            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is very just, since I cannot Personally accompany this Gentleman; yet that I do it with my Letter: wherein if I could transport the Image of mine own minde unto you, as lively as we have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented you unto our selves abroad, then I should not think us asunder while you read it: But of my longing to see you I am a better feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a describer, as likewise of my Obligations towards you, whereof it is not the least that I have been by your mediation, and judgement, and love furnished with so excellent a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41870:5"/>
Comforter of my absence, and so loving and discreet a divider and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of my Travels; after whose se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from me, I am ready to say that which I remember the younger <hi>Pliny</hi> doth utter with much feeling, after the loss of his venerable and dearest friend <hi>Corollius Rufus; Vereor</hi> (saith he) <hi>ne posthac negligentius vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam.</hi> But herein my case is better then his: for I cannot but hope that some good occasion will bring him again nearer me: And I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess unto you, I should be glad to see him planted for a while about the King or Prince, that so if his own fortune be not mended by the Court, yet the Court may be better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in that which it doth more desperately want. Now, Sir, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, there cometh unto you with him an <hi>Italian</hi> Doctor of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, by name <hi>Gaspero Despotini:</hi> a man well practised in his own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and very Philosophical and sound

This stranger I was desirous to present unto you as my friend, in his company; whose testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may more value him then mine own: And so committing them both to your love, and your self with all that family to Gods blessing hand, I rest,</p>

            <p>I Returned from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> some two hours after the King. The next day was celebrated with 20 Tilters, wherein there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred four fraternities: the Earls, <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brock</hi> and <hi>Mongommery:</hi> my Lord <hi>Walden, Thomas</hi> and <hi>Henry Hawards,</hi> the two <hi>Riches,</hi> and the two <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,</hi> as they are called (though falsly) like many things else in a Court. The rest were <hi>Lenox, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel, Rutland, Dorcet, Shandowes, North, Hey, Dingwel, Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Sommerset,</hi> and Sir. <hi>John Harrington.</hi> The day fell out wet to the disgrace of many fine Plumes. Some Caparisons seen before, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to appear again on the Stage with a little disguisement, even on the back of one of the most curious: So frugal are the times, or so indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41870:7"/>
The two <hi>Riches</hi> only made a speech to the King: the rest were contented with bare Imprese: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some were so dark, that their meaning is not yet understood; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less perchance that were their meaning, not to be understood. The two best, to my fancy, were those of the two Earls Brothers: The first a small exceeding white Pearl, and the word, <hi>Solo candore valco.</hi> The other a Sun casting a glance on the side of a Pillar, and the Beams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, with this Motto, <hi>Splendente refulget.</hi> In which devices there seemed an agreement; the elder brother, to allude to his own nature, and the younger to his fortune. The day was signalized with no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary accident, save only between S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Haward,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Sommerset,</hi> who with a counter-buff had almost set himself out of the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and made the others Horse sink under him; but they both came
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41870:7"/>
fairly off without any further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Of the merits of the rest I will say nothing, my Pen being very unfit to speak of Launces.</p>
            <p>To this solemnity of the publick Ambassadors, only the Arch-Dukes was invited, for the healing of the distaste he had taken for the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Venetian</hi> at the marriage. But I doubt the Plaister be too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the sore; which he seemed not much discontented that men should note in his whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that day. Towards the Evening a challenge passed between <hi>Archie</hi> and a famous Knight, called S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Parsons;</hi> the one a fool by election, and the other by necessity: which was accordingly performed some two or three dayes after at Tylt, Tornie, and on foot both compleatly armed, and solemnly brought in before their Majesties, and almost as many other meaner eyes as were at the former. Which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41870:8"/>
bred much sport for the present, and afterwards upon cooler consideration much censure and discourse, as the manner is.</p>
            <p>The departure of the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> and my Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is put off from the <hi>Thursday</hi> in the <hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week,</hi> till the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following: which day I think will hold. The Commissioners that accompany her, have the titles of Ambassadors, to give them precedency before Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and likewise in any encounters with <hi>Almaigne</hi> Princes. Sir <hi>Edward Cecil</hi> goeth as Treasurer to keep up that Office in the name, though it be otherwise perhaps from a General, rather a fall then an ascent. Before this journey there is a conceit, that the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> will be natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized a Peer of our Parliament, and my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> be created Earl of <hi>Devonshire.</hi> The forraign matter is little increased since my last unto

you from <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The <hi>Savoy</hi> Ambassador not yet arrived. The <hi>Turks</hi> designs hitherto unknown, and marching slowly according to the nature of huge Armies: In which suspence the <hi>Venetians</hi> have augmented their guard in the Gulf: enough to confirm unto the world, that States must be conserved, even with ridiculous fears. This is all that the Week yieldeth. My Lord and Lady have received those letters and loving salutations which my Foot-man brought. And so with mine own hearty prayers to God for you, and for that most good Neece, I commit you both to his blessing and love.</p>

            <p>My L. of <hi>Rochester,</hi> partly by some relapse into his late infirmity, and partly (as it is interpreted) through the grief of his minde, is also this second time not gone with the King: some argue upon it, that disassiduity in a Favorite, is a degree of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but of this there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: Only I have set it down to shew you the hasty Logick of Courtiers.</p>

            <p>YOur Kinsman and friend Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Killigrew</hi> was in the Fleet from <hi>Wednesday</hi> of the last week, till the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, and no longer; which I reckon but an Ephemeral fit, in respect of his in firmity who was the cause of it; which to my judgement doth every day appear more and more hectical. Yesterday his father petitioned the King (as he came from the Chappel) that his son might have a Physician, and a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant allowed him, as being much damaged in his health by close im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment: which for my part I believe, for the diseases of fortune have a kinde of transfusion into the body, and strong-working spirits wanting their usual objects, revert upon themselves; because the nature of the minde being ever in motion, must either do, or suffer.</p>
            <p>I take pleasure (speaking to a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41870:11"/>
Philosopher) to reduce (as near as I can) the irregularities of Court to constant principles. Now to return to the matter: The King hath granted the Physician, but denyed the servant: By which you may guess at the issue; for when graces are managed so narrowly by a King, otherwise of so gratious nature, it doth in my opinion very clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the asperity of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Sir <hi>Gervis Elvis</hi> (before one of the Pensioners) is now sworn Lieutenant of the Tower, by the mediation of the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> notwithstanding that my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> was the commender of Sir <hi>Iohn Keyes</hi> to that charge; which the said <hi>Keyes</hi> had for a good while (and this maketh the case the more strange) alwayes supplyed even by Patent in the absence of Sir <hi>William Wade.</hi> Upon which circumstances (though they seem to bend another way) the Logicians of the Court do
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41870:11"/>
make this conclusion: That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty satisfying the <hi>Suffolcians</hi> with petty things, intendeth to repair the Vicount <hi>Rochester</hi> in the main and gross. And therefore all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Sir <hi>Henry Nevil</hi> for the future Secretary; some saying that it is but deferred till the return of the Queen, that she may be allowed a hand in his Introduction: Which likewise will quiet the voyces on the other side; though surely that point be little necessary: For yet did I never in the Country, and much less in the Court see any thing done of this kinde, that was not afterwards approved by those that had most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it: such vicissitudes there are here below, as well as of the rest, even of judgement and affection. I would say more, but I am suddenly surprized by the Secretary of the <hi>Savoy</hi> Ambassador, who I think will depart about the end of the <hi>Whitson</hi> Holy-dayes, for which I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41870:12"/>

            <p>I Have not yet presented to my Lord that Box which came with your Letter of this week; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved on <hi>Wednesday</hi> with the King and houshold to <hi>Greenwich:</hi> And I still remain here to shew you that the Court doth like a Load-stone, draw only those that are <hi>intra orbem vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis suae:</hi> I mean, within the compass and circle of profit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Savoy</hi> Ambassador seemeth in his second audience to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all his Commission; or otherwise he wanteth authority to proceed further then to a general overture, till the arrival of the Caval<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Battista Gabaleoni,</hi> who is hourly expected, and is here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as Resident for the said Duke.</p>
            <p>With him likewise come certain other Gentlemen of title, who should from the beginning have dignified the Ambassadors Train; but the cause of this stragling, was a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41870:13"/>
sudden attempt, which the Duke immediately after the Ambassadors departure (who appointed those Gentlemen to follow him) made upon the Marquisat of <hi>Monserrato,</hi> where he surprized three Towns with the Petarde: the first time (as one writeth from <hi>Venice)</hi> that ever that pestilent invention had been put in practice beyond the Alpes.</p>
            <p>The cause of this attempt, was for that the Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga</hi> (now Duke of <hi>Mantua)</hi> had yielded to send home the <hi>Dowager</hi> Infanta, to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> her Father; but would retain her only child, a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of two years: in whose right, the said Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> pretendeth colourably enough to the foresaid whole Marquisat; and clearly to all the moveables left by the late Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> her Father, who died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testat. Into which point of Law, there entered besides some jealousie of State: being unfit for respects
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41870:13"/>
that would have falln easily into the apprehension of duller Princes than the Italian, to leave a childe out of the custody of her Mother, in his that was to gain by the death of it: yet am I of opinion, who have a little contemplated the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> complexion, that nothing moved him more in this business, than the threatnings of the French Queen, who had before commanded <hi>Didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guires</hi> to fall into the said Dukes estates by way of diversion, if he should meddle with the least Village in the <hi>Monserrato:</hi> which feminine menacement did no doubt incite him to do it out of the impatience of scorn; And withall, he built silently upon a ground, which could not well fail him; That the King of Spain would never suffer the French Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to taste any more of the Grapes and Melons of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> because <hi>L'apetit vient en mangeant:</hi> which the issue of the businesses hath proved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41870:14"/>
true: for the Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> having raised a tumultuary army of horse and foot, did with it only keep things in stay from farther progress on both sides, till the agreement was made between the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> himself in person, and the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> within the Town of <hi>Milan.</hi> The accord is advertised the King from <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi> The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be better known at the arrival of <hi>Gabaleoni;</hi> and then likewise we shall see the bottom of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, which hath been hitherto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a general proposition of a match between the same Lady that was formerly offered, and our Prince now living: which the Ambassador hath touched so tenderly, as if he went to manage his Masters credit. Upon the whole matter, I cannot conceive (though he seemeth to let fall some phrases of haste) that he will be gone yet this fortnight or three weeks, till when I languish. And

            <p>IN my last I told you, that the Ambassador of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to meet the Queen at <hi>Windsor,</hi> which pains she hath spared him by her own coming yesternight to <hi>Greenwich:</hi> where I think she will settle her self a day or two before she admit him. Now, seeing the time of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement at <hi>Cambridge</hi> so near as it is, &amp; being able to determine of this Ambassadors departure within that space, I have resolved to take those Philosophical exercises in my way to you; hoping in the mean time to see <hi>Albertus</hi> admitted by oath to a Clarkship of the Council, or at least
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41870:15"/>
to the next vacancy: for he is now strong enough again to swear.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Mansfeld,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> were on Saturday last called to a very honourable hearing in the Queens Presence Chamber at <hi>White-Hall</hi> before the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, with intervention of my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> the Lord chief Baron of the Exchequer, and Master of the Roles, the Lord chief Justice being kept at home with some infirmitie. There the Attorny and Sollicitor first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder (as the Kings Sergeant) Sir <hi>Robert Mansfeld;</hi> charging the one as a Counsellor, the other as a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioner in matter of the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Soveraignty, upon occasion of a Commission intended for a research into the administration of the Admiralty: against which the said Sir <hi>Robert Mansfeld</hi> (being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so principal an officer therein) had sought some provision of advice,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41870:15"/>
and, This was the sum of the charge: which was diversly amplified. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> in his answer, spake more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly, than was expected from a Lawyer, and the Knight more temperately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> expected from a Souldier. There was likewise some difference noted, not only in the manner, but in the substance between them: For <hi>Whitlock</hi> ended his speech with an absolute confession of his own offence, and with a promise of employing himself hereafter in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kings prerogative. Sir <hi>Robert Mansfeld</hi> on the other side, laboured to distinguish between the error of his acts, and the integrity of his zeal and affection towards the King his Master: protesting he should hold it the greatest glory under Heaven to die at his feet, and that no man living should go before him, if there were occasion to advance his dominions, with some other such Martial strains, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41870:16"/>
became him well. The conclusion of his speech had somewhat of the Courtier, beseeching the Lords, if the restraint he had indured were not in their judgements a sufficient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of his error, that then they would continue it as long as it should please them, and add unto it any other affliction of pain or shame whatsoever; provided that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he might be restored again into his Majesties favour, and their good opinions. To tell you what they all severally said that day, were to rob from the liberty of our discourse when we shall meet. In this they generally agreed, both Counsellors and Judges, to represent the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of both the Prisoners unto the King in lieu of innocency, and to intercede for his gratious pardon: Which was done, and accordingly the next day they were inlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a submission under writing. This is the end of that business, at which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41870:16"/>
were present as many as the room could contain, and men of the best quality; whom the King was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to satisfie, not only about the point in hand, but in some other things that were occasionally awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; which I likewise reserve to our private freedom.</p>
            <p>The Kings Officers are returned from my Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whom they left at <hi>Goltzheime</hi> the last of <hi>May,</hi> where His Majesties expence did cease. This place was chosen for her consignment in stead of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherach,</hi> suspected of contagion. She was at <hi>Andernach</hi> feasted by the Elector of <hi>Cullen;</hi> at <hi>Confluence,</hi> or <hi>Cobolentz</hi> (as they call it) by the other of <hi>Trier;</hi> and at <hi>Mentz</hi> by the third of those Ecclesiastick Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, very Royally and kindly, and (which was less expected) very handsomly. The Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and his Brother with troops of Horse, and a guard of Foot, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41870:17"/>
her to <hi>Cullen,</hi> and entred themselves into that City with her: (I need not tell you, that though themselves were within, the Horse, and most of the Foot were without the walls) Which is here (by the wiser sort of Interpreters) thought as hazardous an act, as either of them both had done in the heat of War; and indeed no way justifiable <hi>in foro sapientiae.</hi> And therefore such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures as these must appeal <hi>ad forum Providentiae;</hi> where we are all covered by his vigilant mercy and love: to which I commit you, and my sweet Neece in my hearty prayers.</p>

we come unto you, where we mean to forget all the world besides. Of this we shall bring you the account.</p>
            <p>Now, to let matters of State sleep, I will entertain you at the present with what hath happened this week at the banks side. The Kings Players had a new Play, called <hi>All is true,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting some principall pieces of the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. which was set forth with many extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Pomp and Majesty, even to the matting of the stage; the Knights of the Order, with their Georges and Garter, the Guards with their embroidered Coats, and the like: sufficient in truth within a while to make greatness very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, if not ridiculous. Now, King <hi>Henry</hi> making a Masque at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s house, and certain Chambers being shot off at his entry, some of the paper, or other stuff wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the thatch, where being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41870:19"/>
thought at first but an idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within less then an hour the whole house to the very grounds.</p>
            <p>This was the fatal period of that vertuous fabrique, wherein yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did perish, but wood and straw, and a few forsaken cloaks; only one man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broyled him, if he had not by the benefit of a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wit put it out with bottle Ale.

            <p>IT is both morally and naturally true, that I have never been in perfect health and chearfulness since we parted: but I have entertained my minde; when my body would give me leave, with the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the strangest thing that ever I beheld, commonly called in our language (as I take it) a Parliament: which hath produced nothing, but inexplicable riddles in the place of Laws. For first, it is aborted before it was born, and nullified after it had a being; insomuch, as the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> (whose naturalization was the only thing that passed in both houses) is now again an Alien. And whereas all other Parliamenrs have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41870:20"/>
had some one eminent quality that hath created a denomination: some being called in our Records mad Parliaments, some, merciless, and the like: This I think, from two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties almost insociable or seldom meeting, may be termed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greatest diligence, and of least resolution that ever was, or ever will be; For our Committees were as well attended commonly, as full Houses in former Sessions; and yet we did nothing, neither in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, nor after, whereof I can yield you no reason, but this one, that our diversions were more then our main purposes; and some of so sensible nature as took up all our reason, and all our passion in the pursuit of them. Now, Sir, what hath followed since the dissolution of this Civil body, let me rather tell you, then lead you back into any particularities of that which is passed.</p>
            <p>It pleased His Majesty the very

next morning, to call to examination before the Lords of his Council, divers Members of the House of Commons, for some speeches better becoming a Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Treaters are perpetual Princes, then where those that speak so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently are so soon to return (which they should remember) to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacity of Subjects.

            <p>The first made great shift to come thither: For having taken in our house some disgrace in the matter of the undertakers (of whom he would fain have been thought one) to get the opinion of a bold man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had lost that of a wise; he fell one morning into a declamation against the times, so insipid, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41870:21"/>
so unseasonable, as if he had been put but out of his place for it of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> (into which one of my L. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals</hi> Nephews is sworn) I should not much have pitied him; though he be my Countryman. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in for more wit, and for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness baptized freedom: For I have noted in our house, that a false or faint Patriot did cover himself with the shadow of equal modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and on the other side, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent discourse was called honest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: so as upon the whole matter, No excesses want pretious names. You shall have it in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s language, which I like better then mine own translation; <hi>Nullis vitiis desunt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa nomina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is a silly and simple creature, God himself knows; and though his Father was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at the time of a Parliament likewise put into the place where the son now is, yet hath he rather
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41870:22"/>
inherited his fortune, then his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. His fault was the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain Texts in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> to the matter of impositions; and saying that the <hi>French</hi> King was kill'd like a Calf, with such like poor stuff: Against which the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador (having gotten know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it) hath formed a complaint with some danger of his wisdom.</p>
            <p>The last is a young Gentleman, fresh from the School; who having gathered together divers Latin sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences against Kings, bound them up in a long speech, and interlarded them with certain <hi>Ciceronian</hi> excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; as, <hi>O Tempora, O Mores.—</hi>Thus I have a little run over these accidents unto you, enough only to break out of that silence which I will not call a symptome of my sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a sickness it self. How so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will keep it from being hecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and hereafter give you a better account of mine own observations.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41870:22"/>
This week I have seen from a most dear Neece a Letter, that hath much comforted one Uncle, and a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script the other. Long may that hand move, which is so full of kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. As for my particular, Take heed of such invitations, if you either love or pity your selves: For I think there was never Needle toucht with a Load-stone that did more incline to the North, then I do to <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave:</hi> In the mean time, we are all here well: and so our Lord Jesus preserve you there.</p>

            <p>THe Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after a lingring feaver spent more spirits than a younger body could well have born, by the incision of a wennish tumor grown on his thigh, yesternight between eleven and twelve of the clock de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this world: where, as he had proved much variety and vicissitude of fortune in the course of his life: so peradventure he hath prevented another change thereof by the opportunity of his end: For there went a general voyce through the Court on Sunday last, upon the commitment of Doctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis</hi> to the Tower, that he was somewhat implicated in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41870:23"/>
that business: whereof I will give you a little accompt at the present as far as I have been hitherto able to penetrate. <hi>John Hoskins</hi> (of whose imprisonment I wrote unto you by the last Carrier) having at a reexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination been questioned, whether he well understood the consequence of that <hi>Sicilian vesper,</hi> whereunto he had made some desperate allusion in the House of Parliament, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (and I think very truly) that he had no more then a general infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof, being but little conversant in those Histories that lay out of the way of his profession: whereupon being pressed to discover whence he then had recieved this information, since it lay not within his own reading, he confessed to have had it from Doctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> who had infused these things into him, and had solicited him to impress them in the Parliament: And further, that <hi>Hoskins</hi> hereupon demanding what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41870:24"/>
protection he might hope for, if afterwards he were called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; the said Doctor should no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate unto him, besides others (whose names I will spare) that Earl who hath now made an end of all his reckonings: assuring him of his assistance by the means of Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis,</hi> with whom the Doctor was conjoyned in this practice. Thus came Sir <hi>Charles</hi> into discovery: who being afterward confronted with the Doctor himself, though he could not (as they say) justifie his own person, yet did he clear my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> from any manner of understanding with him therein upon his Salvation: which yet is not enough (as I percieve among the people) to sweep the dust from his Grave. Thus you see (Sir) the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral end of a great man, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ruine of others, which I had rather you should see in a letter, then as I did on Sunday at <hi>Greenwich:</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41870:24"/>
where it grieved my soul to behold a grave and learned Divine, and a Gentleman of good hopes and merits carried away in the face of the whole Court, with most dejected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and such a greediness at all windows to gaze at unfortunate spectacles.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> hath made three of his servants his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with a very vast power as I hear; and for Overseers of his will, my Lord of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and my Lord <hi>William Haward:</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> he hath left all his land (which will amount to some 3000. of yearly revenue) besides three or four hundred to Mr. <hi>Henry Haward,</hi> whereof he had before assured him at the time of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but neither of them to enjoy a penny thereof as yet this eight year: all which time he intendeth the fruits of his estate shall be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and distributed in legacies and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41870:25"/>
pious uses according to his will, which hath not yet been seen: but thus much as I have told you was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood before his expiration. To my Lord of <hi>Suffolk</hi> he hath left his house, but hath disposed of all the moveables and furniture from him: And it is concieved, that he dyed in some distastful impression, which he had taken against him upon the voyces that ran of my Lord of <hi>Suffolcks</hi> likelihood to be Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer; which place will now assuredly fall upon him; and the world doth contemplate my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> for Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Warden of the five Ports. As for the Lord Chamberlainship, it is somewhat more questionable between my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Knowels.</hi> A few daies will determine these ambitions. In the mean time, I commit you (who have better objects) to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of them, and to the

            <p>HAving here lately seen the deaths of two, and the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of two other Dukes within the compass of six weeks: I have been bold to entertain your Lordship with a little story of these changes and competitions, though with small presumption that you can take any pleasure in my simple report thereof, unless it win some favour by the

For the rest, The whole town is here at the present in horror and confusion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the discovering of a foul and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conspiracy of the <hi>French</hi> against this State; whereof no less then thirty have already suffered very condign punishment between men strangled in prison, drowned in the silence of the night, and hanged in publick view; and yet the bottom is invisible.</p>

change of my purpose to Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in <hi>Kent,</hi> born in me as I was reading your Letter: For what should I do there in such haste after the Nuptials, when I shall come so as well in Lent?

The Doctor likewise as yet hath given me no answer; but I will quicken him, and put life I hope into the business.</p>
            <p>Now, let me tell you, That the noble Sir <hi>Gervase Clifton</hi> (as in good

Among other discourse he shewed me a little excrescence that he hath beginning upon the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ball of his eyes; a filmie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like the rudiment of a Pinn and Webb as they call it. Whereupon fell into my memory a secret that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bohan</hi> had told me his Mother knew: How to take away that evil in growth, and perchance much more in the infancy, with a Medicine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed only to the Wrists. And I have heard your self likewise speak of a rare thing for that part. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you (Sir) be pleased with all possible speed to intreat that receipt from M. <hi>Bohan,</hi> to whom we shall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41870:30"/>
both be much beholden for it. And Sir <hi>Gervase Clifton</hi> is already so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, that he both sayes and thinks, that nothing will cure him better then that which any way shall come through your hand unto him. No peace as yet with either of the Kings: The more wished I think with <hi>France,</hi> the likelier perchance with <hi>Spain.</hi> No Offices disposed in Court. No Favorite but the Lord Treasurer. More news in my next. For the present, God keep you in his dear love.</p>

It is strange to consider the lubricity of popular favour: For he that before during this whole Session (if so we may call it) and the former, was so highly commended, and even in this very act by some of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41870:31"/>
the soundest and soberest of the House; yet with the generall Body is so stript of all his credit in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I have hardly seen in any Chymical work such a precipitation. What hath in sued, will be better told you by this good Captain.

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe very truth is, your love hath prevented me: for I meant by <hi>Giovanni</hi> to give you some account of what hath passed since our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement. When I had slept half an hour after you were gone from <hi>Danford,</hi> I found my self <hi>fresco come una rofa:</hi> but I awaked in a strange dream, that had seldom before befaln me in an Inn; finding nothing to be paid, not so much as for mine own horses: whereby the reason was plain of the paleness of my water which you observed: for none of the tincture of my gold was gone into the reckoning of the drink, as you had handled the matter.</p>
            <p>At the top of Shooters hill my footman stayed, as if he had been watching the Beacon rather then for me; and told me there were good provisions made at Sir <hi>Adam Newtons</hi> for you and me, with kinde expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us both. But my self being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41870:34"/>
desirous to reach <hi>Eton</hi> that night, as I did, (for my horses I see travail best upon an other mans purse) I blanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the house, and sent thither by <hi>Giovanni</hi> a fair excuse. True it is, we are much of a humor: <hi>Cento Bue</hi> will hardly draw us in a journey to any strange place.</p>
            <p>At that time likewise <hi>Will</hi> brought me a letter from Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> which had been expresly sent to <hi>Gravesend</hi> the night before: whereby I saw <hi>Giovanni</hi> had taken a false alarm: for he was not to be gone till the <hi>Munday</hi> morning following: so as I have had time to ballast him with letters: And I have intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand to your <hi>Jack Dinely,</hi> your purpose to pass over the spiritous <hi>Frank</hi> as soon as you can trick him. We are now towards the Festival of our Election; wherein annually I make a shift to loose four or five friends, and yet do my self no good: so as they are angry with me on the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41870:35"/>
one side, and they laugh at me on the other.</p>
            <p>I apprehend this year a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Venison with us: for I came too late to exchange your warrant; and my Lady <hi>Throckmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> will not serve my turn.</p>
            <p>Since my coming, Mr. <hi>Turvil</hi> a French practical man of good erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath passed a day or two with me, from whom I hear a shrewd point; That the oath of peace (which should have been taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two neighbouring Kings upon the same day) is put off for a moneth: I believe the stop be in <hi>France</hi> to gain time to disturb our Treaty with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> (a man whose ears are open) told me likewise yesterday a strange thing; that the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath newly, being hunting, been chased away her self with some affrightment from <hi>Rhenen</hi> by certain Troops of the enemy that have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41870:35"/>
passed the <hi>Isel.</hi> With whom it was feared the Count <hi>Henry Venden Berge</hi> would joyn and ravage the <hi>Velow.</hi> Yet withall were come tidings, that the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> at the <hi>Busse</hi> had had parly offered him. But my intelligences are Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern waters: you are nearer the Fountain. And not only, <hi>Dulcius ex ipso Fonte bibuntur aquae,</hi> but <hi>verius</hi> too. For both will stand in the verse.</p>
            <p>Before I end, let me beseech you, to remember my humble and hearty devotion (in the very stile of <hi>Seneca</hi> to his <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and I shall need to say no more) <hi>Optimo Virorum.</hi> I envy your enjoyments and conversations, and most when they are privatest, for then they are freest. I hope the Noble Lady will return quickly again to her <hi>Hesperian</hi> Garden. To whom I pray, likewise let my humble service be remembred. And so I rest,</p>

            <p>I Am sorry that your Cast of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names</hi> cannot be served at this Election: For to choose one of them (and that must have been in a low place) had been discomfortable: they will flie best at ease together. Yet I have thought of a way the next year, in all event not to fail; which is, to divide them between <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Eton.</hi> Their Election precedeth ours some three weeks; and truly upon my late observation there, I must needs say, that school mouldeth good Scholars, and of certainer preferment to either of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41870:37"/>
Universities (for some go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and some to <hi>Cambridge)</hi> then this: out of which the issue is alwayes hard, and the entrance not alwayes easie. Glad I am to hear by your Letter, that you have gotten so good a School-Master, that they may be well mued in the mean while. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this and the next turn, I shall lay you down an infallible course for them. And this must content their good father at the present.</p>
            <p>If your Masons Brother (who was here on <hi>Sunday)</hi> had stayed till the next morning, there was some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable hope to have sped the Boy this year to <hi>Cambr.</hi> but some unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate haste, and despair of so many places as fell open, carried him away.</p>
            <p>If you had not intimated your own coming to <hi>London,</hi> you might perchance have been troubled with me in the Countrey: But I will now languish for the hour you promise this place of seeing you here; where

your Venison (which we enjoy by exchange from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>VVE were for three weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so besieged at your <hi>Eton,</hi> first with an overflow of water from the West, and then with a deep snow out of the East, (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarters conspiring against us) that our ordinary boats, which usually go and return twice a week, could not pass under the Bridges: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by such a Letter from you as never man received, lay silent at my Chamber in St <hi>Martins-lane</hi> till mine own coming to <hi>London;</hi> to the utter condemnation of my unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in the mean time: Which truly I should fear, but that it is the natural property of the same heart,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41870:39"/>
to be a gentle Interpreter, which is so noble an Obliger.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, After I had received and read your Letter, I took some dayes to deliberate what I should do, and to let my judgement settle again which was distracted with so kinde a surprisal: should I use a feathered quill to write unto you? or fly my self to <hi>Redgrave?</hi> for you had given me wings. At last, I resolved upon both. First, to make this true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation by writing from my very bowels where it is engraven. That though your bounty (considered in all the circumstances, as well the form, as the matter, and the very opportunity of the time wherein it came, and especially without any imaginable pretence of desert in my self) hath been such, as never befell me before, nor can ever befall me again: yet have you therewith not enriched, but stripped and despised me for ever: Nothing that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

either in my power or posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being after this mine own: for it is all yours, if it were both the <hi>Indies.</hi> So as your kindness how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever flowing from a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet is with me like hard wax, dropped and sealed together.</p>
            <p>The next after this, shall be to follow it my self: but therein (after the Spanish phrase) I will take lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage at the Roles, where I shall understand more punctually about what time you purpose to be here. For, I aym at the convoying of you up to your <hi>Eton.</hi> About which I will write more by the next Carrier: and prepare your self (Sir) with patience while we live, to be troubled weekly with my letters; whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am, even when I shall have no more to say then this, which is the least that can be spoken, that I am</p>

            <p>I Do as unwillingly put my pen to tell you, as I am sure you will be to hear what hath befaln my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Albertus</hi> this week. He was going on <hi>Friday</hi> last towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Coach alone: whose driver alighting (I know not upon what occasion) hard by <hi>Charing-</hi>Cross, the horses (being young) took some affrightment, and running away so furiously, that one of them tore all his belly open upon the corner of a Beer Cart, my Nephew (who in this mean while adventured to leap out) seemeth to have hung upon one of the pins of the boot, from whence strugling to get loose, he brake the wast-band of his hose behind, and so fell with the greater violence on the ground, hurting only the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of his head, by what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility we cannot conceive, unless
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41870:40"/>
the motion of the Coach did turn him round in the fall. The force of the concussion took from him for some hour or thereabouts the use of his voice and sense, which are now well restored; only, there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in his left arm a kinde of Paralitical stupefaction, and his right eye-lid is all black with some knock that he took in the agitation of the Coach; which peradventure may have been the motive to make him leap out. But these external evils do not so much trouble us, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pungent and pulsatory ache within the skull, somewhat lower then the place of his hurt; which hath continued more or less since his fall, notwithstanding twice letting blood, and some nights of good rest, and shaving of his head for the better transpiration; which we doubt the more, because it cometh <hi>sine ratione,</hi> his hurt being only in the fleshy part, and very sleight, without fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41870:41"/>
of the skull, without inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any fever, and all the principal faculties, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, discourse, imagination untainted. The King hath in this time much consolated us both with sending unto him, and with expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing publikely a gracious feeling of his case: but we must fetch our true comforts from him, who is Lord of the whole: And so I leave it.</p>
            <p>Since my last unto you, I am sure you hear how Sir <hi>Robert Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> hath been twice or thrice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before the Lords, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Marshalsie; partly for having consulted with M. <hi>Whitlock</hi> the Lawyer about the validity of a Commission drawn for a re-search into the Office of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> whereof himself is an Accomptant; and partly for denying to reveal the name of the said Lawyer his Friend; who before had been committed to the Fleet for another case much of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41870:41"/>
the same nature. The point touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a limb of the Kings Prerogative, and immediate Authority. Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Mansfields</hi> Answers (by report) had as much of the Philosopher, or of the Hermite, as of the Souldier, or Courtier; professing openly his little care of this World, or of his own fortunes in it; and divers other phrases of that complexion. Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> is still where he was, and as he was, without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: The Viscount <hi>Rochester</hi> yet no way sinking in the point of favour; which are two strange consistents.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>R. Drury</hi> runneth at the Ring, corbeteth his horse before the Kings window, haunteth my L. of <hi>Rochesters</hi> chamber, even when himself is not there; &amp; in secret divideth his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances between him &amp; the House of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> And all this (they say) to be Ambassador at <hi>Bruxels.</hi> So as <hi>super to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta materia,</hi> I see appetites are not all of a kinde: Some go to the Tower for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41870:42"/>
the avoiding of that which another doth languish to obtain. I will end with my Paper, and by the next Carrier either tell you precisely when I shall see you, or prevent the telling of it. And so our sweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bless you and my deer Neece.</p>

            <p>Take any Vegetable whatsoever, (none excepted in the effect, though some difference in the degree) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the juyce; put that in any ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Wood or Stone, with a narrow neck and mouth, not closed at the top, but covered with any thing, so as it may work out above: Set it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in some cold hole in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, let it stand there some three weeks, or a moneth, till by fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it have both purged it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and by sediment downwards.

without calcination; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise certainly must needs consume all the active powers of any Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and leave nothing but a plastick and passive vertue.</p>
            <p>For the point of preserving that salt afterwards from resolution by ayr into water, I hold it impossible, notwithstanding the proper exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that you alledge; which yet must of necessity yield to it. For as your excellent Uncle sayes, and sayes well, in not the least of his works (though born after him) of his experiments: <hi>Ayr is predatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have forgotten (for <hi>memoria pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo senescit)</hi> whether I told you in my last a pretty late experiment in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritical</hi> pains: It is cheap enough. Take a rosted Turnip (for if you boyl it, it will open the pores, and draw too much.) apply that in a Poultice to the part affected, with change once in an hour or two, as you finde it dryed by the heat of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41870:43"/>
flesh, and it will in little time allay the pain.</p>
            <p>Thus much in our private way, wherein I dare swear, if our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines were as strong as our wishes, they would work extreamly.</p>
            <p>Now, for the Publick, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure now and then there are distempers as well as in natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> was on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> last (the day after your Posts departure) very solemnly restored at Council-Table (the King present) from a kinde of Eclipse, wherein he had stood since the <hi>Thursday</hi> fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before: All considered, the obscuration was long, and bred both various and doubtful discourse; but it ended well. All the cause yet known, was a verbal challenge sent from him by Mr <hi>Henry Germain</hi> in this form: To the now Lord <hi>Weston</hi> newly returned from his forraign imployments. That since he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41870:44"/>
given the King an account of his Embassage, he did now expect from him an account of a Letter of his, which he had opened in <hi>Paris,</hi> and he did expect it at such a time, even in the <hi>Spring-garden</hi> (close un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his fathers Window) with his sword by his side.</p>
            <p>It is said (I go no farther in such tender points) that my Lord <hi>Weston</hi> sent him by Mr <hi>Henry Percy</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and the said L. <hi>Weston</hi> had in the late journey (as it seems) been contracted, such friendship as overcame the memory that he was Cosin-German to my L. of <hi>Holland)</hi> a very fair and discreet answer: That if he could challenge him for any injury done him before, or after his Ambassage, he would meet him as a Gentleman, with his sword by his side where he should appoint. But for any thing that had been done in the time of his Ambassage, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given the King an account
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41870:44"/>
thereof, and thought himself not accountable to any other. This published on <hi>Thursday</hi> was fortnight, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> was confined to his Chamber in Court, and the next day morning to his house at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sington,</hi> where he remained without any further circumstance of restraint, or displeasure <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday:</hi> on which dayes being much visited, it was thought fit on <hi>Munday</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point M. <hi>Dickenson</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council, to be his Guardian thus far, that none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his presence should accost him. This made the vulgar judgements run high, or rather indeed run low, That he was a lost and discarded man, judgeing as of Patients in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by the exasperation of the fits. But the Queen (who was a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely interrested in this business, for in my Lord of <hi>Hollands</hi> Letter, which was opened, she had one that was not opened, nor so much (as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41870:45"/>
they say) as superscribed; and both the Queens and my L. of <hi>Hollands</hi> were inclosed in one from M. <hi>Walter Mountague</hi> (whereof I shall tell you more hereafter.) The Queen I say, stood nobly by him, and as it seems pressed her own affront. It is too intricately involved for me so much as to guess at any particulars. I hear generally discoursed, that the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dispatch was only in favour (if it might be obtained) of Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>de Chateau Neuf,</hi> and the Cheval<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>de Jarr;</hi> (who had both been here) but written with caution (and surely not without the Kings knowledge) to be delivered, if there were hope of any good effect, and perchance not without order from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to my Lord <hi>Weston;</hi> afterwards to stop the said Letters, upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement that both <hi>Cateau Neuf,</hi> &amp; <hi>de Jarr</hi> were already in the Bastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. But this I leave at large, as not knowing the depth of the business<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41870:45"/>
Upon <hi>Munday</hi> was seven-night fell out another quarrel, nobly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (branching from the former) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my L. <hi>Fielding</hi> and M. <hi>Goring,</hi> son and heir to the Lord of that name. They had been the night before at supper. I know not where together; where M. <hi>Goring</hi> spake something in diminution of my L. <hi>Weston,</hi> which my L. <hi>Fielding</hi> told him, it could not become him to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, lying by the side of his sister. Thereupon, these hot hearts appoint a meeting next day Morning, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone, each upon his Horse. they pass by <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> as a place where they might be parted too soon, and turn into a lane by <hi>Knights-bridge;</hi> where having tyed up their Horses at a hedge or gate, they got over into a Close; there stripped into their shirts, with single Rapiers, they fell to an eager Duel, till they were severed by the Host and his servants of the Inn of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41870:46"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who by meer chance had taken some notice of them. In this noble encounter, wherein blood was spent though (by Gods providence) not much on either side there passed between them a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memorable interchange of a piece of courtesie, if that word may have room in this place: Sayes my Lord <hi>Fielding,</hi> M. <hi>Goring,</hi> If you leave me here, let me advise you not to go back by <hi>Piccadillia-hall,</hi> lest if mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance befall me, and be suddenly noised (as it falleth out in these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions now between us) you might receive some harm by some of my friends that lodge thereabouts.</p>
            <p>My Lord (replyes <hi>Goring)</hi> I have no way but one to answer this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie: I have here by chance in my pocket a Warrant to pass the Ports out of <hi>England</hi> without a name (got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I suppose upon some other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before,) If you leave me here, take it for your use, and put in your
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41870:46"/>
own name. This is a passage much commended between them, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding both from sweetness and stoutness of spirit, which are very compatible. On the solemn day of <hi>Saturday</hi> last, both this difference and the Original, between the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Lord <hi>Weston,</hi> were fairly reconciled and forgiven by the King, with shaking of hands, and such Symbols of agreement: And likewise Sir <hi>Maurice Dromand,</hi> who had before upon an uncivil rupture on his part, between him and my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> been committed to the Tower, was then delivered at the same time: and so it all ended, as a merry fellow said, in a Maurice. But whether these be perfect cures, or but skinnings over and Palliations of Court, will appear hereafter: Nay, some say very quickly, for my Lord <hi>Westons</hi> Lady, being since brought to bed of a daughter, men stand in a kind of suspence, whether
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41870:47"/>
the Queen will be the Godmother after so crude a reconcilement, which by the Kings inestimable goodness, I think may pass in this forgiving week.</p>
            <p>For forraign matter, there is so little and so doubtful, as it were a misery to trouble you with it. The States confuted Treaty is put to the stock; and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (by account) gone to the field two dayes since, having broken the business (as they say) by three demands; the resignment of <hi>Breda</hi> and <hi>Guelder,</hi> the dismantling of <hi>Rheynberg,</hi> and the equality of free exercise of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on either side. The States are strong in arms, weak in money, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above six hundred thousand pounds <hi>sterling</hi> in bare interest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Capital. The enemy hath neither money, nor men, nor agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Arena sine calce,</hi> yet I hear (and <hi>ex bonis Codicibus)</hi> that the States are absolutely resolved to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41870:47"/>
besiege no Town this year, unless it be some such place, as may haply fall gently into their lap. They will range with divided troops.</p>
            <p>I will have a care in my letters to the Kings only sister (for that is now her published stile even in Sermons) so to commend your <hi>Frank</hi> unto her (whom she was wont to call, when he went first over, her little Pig) that he may speedily have a Captains place.</p>

            <p>IT is worth the noting, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the casual firings of houses in Towns do follow one another: And so (methinks) do the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of spirits in Courts: for after the solemn quenching of our late quarrels, there is faln out a new, and shrewdly pursued between Mr. <hi>Harbert Price</hi> a Sewer to the Queen,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41870:48"/>
and Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> Page to the King.</p>
            <p>The beginning they say was upon very sleight occasion: but because a young Lady is an ingredient in the story, I will pass it over. To field they went two daies since upon hot and hasty blood (which somewhat saves it from a deliberate Duel) both shooting the Bridge in several boats; yet the matter being before suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my Lord-Chamberlain sent one Mr. <hi>Haies</hi> (a Scotishman and a good Surgeon, though of late an ordinary Courtier on the Queens side) in guest of them: who found them both on the <hi>Surry</hi> side a mile or two below bridge closed, and (I hear) on the ground. But Mr. <hi>Price</hi> already hurt in three places; in one of his sides, in his face, and in three of his fingers: the other is come off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. This <hi>Price</hi> hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bred a Souldier, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (they say) a Lieutenant in the low Provinces. Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> scarce yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41870:49"/>
a man in years: but for height and strength at his full prime, and in both above the common scantling. The King is herewith highly offended: succeeding so freshly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the late reconcilements. And it is doubted, they will at least lose their places.</p>
            <p>The journey to <hi>Scotland</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hotly, and his Majesty removeth house to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> that way on <hi>Saturday</hi> come fortnight. But first must be censured the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> for too many words, and the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings in <hi>Ireland</hi> for too few deeds, which I believe will both trench deep. I shall stay long enough in <hi>London</hi> (not intending to be gone before the Kings remove) to tell you the event: and truly without your beneficent courtesie, I had been wrapt in a strange riddle: for I could neither have staid nor departed.</p>
            <p>I received at the Communion in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41870:49"/>
St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> last (being <hi>Easter-</hi>day) in the same Pue with your <hi>Hester</hi> and her mother; your <hi>Hester,</hi> either becomes a little tincture of the Green-sickness well, or that becomes her well: well she looks I am sure, and in my fancy draws towards the countenance of her sister <hi>Stanhop</hi> more and more, but stealingly. My Neece <hi>Margaret</hi> is come home from her <hi>Artisan</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> with some pretty amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The manner of his cure in those imperfections is somewhat strange: He useth no bindings, but oyls and stroakings: of which I take him to be (in all my reading) both the instrument and the Author. My Neece <hi>Ann</hi> will prove one of the handsomest creatures of the world: being much grown, and having recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a little squinting or oblique look which she had in one of her eyes so far, as the remainder will turn to a beauty. Her mother hath of late
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41870:50"/>
been much troubled (and I think as much in her fancy, which is the greater cure as in her body) with a pain in her right side; which chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth place, and therefore is sure, but a <hi>flatuous infirmity:</hi> yet it hasteneth her removing to better ayr.</p>
            <p>From my Lady my sister at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> we hear nothing; I believe she is in travail with her own thoughts about defacing the inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tomb, as far as <hi>Catholico</hi> and <hi>Catholica</hi> amount unto. And I could wish, as she took your advice in the invention and word upon the Marble, she had done so in the rest: but in that you were no apt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor.</p>
            <p>Now, for forein matters. We have fair tydings from <hi>Germany;</hi> that the Princes hold fast together, and things go well: and I am of opinion, that when those parts have learnt as well as the lower Provinces, to spend a Summer upon the siege of a Town,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41870:50"/>
the war will nestle there as well as below. For they abound in strong places, and war it self is a great refiner of spirits in little time.</p>
            <p>The States are in the field earlier then heretofore: and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it importeth no less, then the countenancing and covering of a general revolt of the <hi>geheerten Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> as they call them: of that more in my next.

            <p>THis other day at the Cock-pit in <hi>Shoe-lane</hi> (where my self am <hi>rara avis)</hi> your Nephew M. <hi>Robert Bacon</hi> came very kindely to me, with whom I was glad to refresh my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; though I had rather it had been in the Theatre of <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I asked him of his Brother, your <hi>Frank;</hi> and he told me he had been so hindered by winds, as he thought he was not yet gotten over: At which I was sorry, for he hath lost the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of taking <hi>Rheinberge:</hi> He may come yet timely enough to see <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> yielded, and after that, to have his share in <hi>Juliers,</hi> which they write
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41870:51"/>
from the Camp, will be the next piece, and so the States will be Masters of all the tract that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Maese</hi> and the <hi>Rhene;</hi> and backed with one of the fattest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Christendom. Besides, we hear they have recovered their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer footing in <hi>Brasiel,</hi> and beaten the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet. It is hard to say, into what these prosperities will run out: For surely, if they can establish a right correspondency with the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Armies of <hi>Germany,</hi> and either both hold out, or neither agree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other; even this Summer will breed notable effects, and among other I hope, the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> where as much as the <hi>Swede</hi> had taken, is offered for 16000 Dalers; whereof the half is payed already by the Duke of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mern,</hi> Administrator to the young <hi>Palatin</hi> in his minority, and the other moiety is expected from hence. One thing I must not omit to tell you,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41870:52"/>
that the said young Prince was at the siege of <hi>Rheinberge</hi> to initiate him in action. The young Cardinal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> is come you know to <hi>Milan,</hi> and they say will there reside as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour till he can recover <hi>Casale</hi> and <hi>Pignerolo,</hi> and purge <hi>Italy</hi> of the <hi>French:</hi> So as I believe he will come to <hi>Bruxels</hi> (for thither he finally tends) in the <hi>Spanish</hi> pace. Having thus a little skimmed over our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein news, give me leave now to enternain you with some novelties of Art. I send you herewith two printed Capps, A triangular Salt-seller, and the top of an Ambar-Ring. The Capps is a pretty fresh invention of a very easie rate; for they will run shortly at some six pence apiece: and they say the sale is monopolized by a woman at <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> which may come to some pretty perfection in the ornament of Curtains and Valances of Beds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in some fine historified Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41870:52"/>
for a Banquet, or the like. In the invention of the Salt-seller you have an interest your self; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (Sir) you shewed me a whole furniture of Marble-Saltsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for a Table of your bespeaking: But there is one that hath only gone beyond you in the cheapness of the Material: For this which you now receive, is but of Seacole, and it is strange to see what a polishment so base a stuff doth take, like the ennobling of a Clown. To the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ring there belongs a little more discourse. I bought for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle in <hi>Lombard-street</hi> long since, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it had a Flie intombed in the sealing part; which if it had been precisely in the middle, would have shewed like the sculpture of the signet it self. Now a while since by a fall from a Table to the ground, it brake, though in a boarded room. Whereupon, there fell a conceit into my minde, that the Ring was Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41870:53"/>
Amber, and not Natural; as indeed my servant <hi>Giovanni</hi> and I have since plainly discovered. Now I cannot chuse but smile when I think how much more the first Seller of it might have had from me for the falshood (if he would have said so) then for the truth. For surely many rare things may be made of this composition, and intire insectils of any greatness, and in any posture be inclosed therein; which I am sure will inflame you, as it hath set me on fire already to finde the way how to clarifie the Pasta, which seems to be of Rosin, and perchance some dust of true Amber. And thus you see what easie wayes I take to please my self, while I am conversing with you. Let me add to these a strange thing to be seen in <hi>London</hi> for a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of pence; which I know not whether I should call a piece of Art or Nature: It is an English man like some swabber of a ship come from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41870:53"/>
the <hi>Indies,</hi> where he hath learned to eat fire as familiarly as ever I saw any eat cakes; even whole glowing Brands, which he will crash with his teeth, and swallow. I believe he hath been hard famished in the <hi>Terra de Fuego,</hi> on the South of the <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan-</hi>strait.</p>

            <p>For the first: it is now almost an whole Cycle of the Sun, since after certain fits of a Quotidian Feaver, I was assailed by that Splenetick Passion, which a Country good fellow that had been a piece of a Grammarian meant, when he said he was sick of the <hi>Flatus,</hi> and the other hard Word: for <hi>Hypocondriacus</hi> stuck in his teeth: it is the very <hi>Proteus</hi> of all Maladies; shifting into sundry shapes, almost every night a new, and yet still the same; neither can I hope, that it will end in a solar Period; being such a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine Humour: but though the Core and Root of it be remaining, yet the Symptomes (I thank my God) are well allayed: and in general, I have found it of more
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41870:55"/>
contumacy then malignity; only since the late cold weather, there is complicated with it a more Asthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical straitness of respiration then heretofore: yet those about me say, I bear it well, as perchance custome hath taught me: being now famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arized and domesticated evils: In the Tragedians expression: <hi>Jam mansueta Mala.</hi> And thus much of the Habit of my Body. On the other side: My minde is in a right Philosophical Estate of health: that is, at an equal distance, both from desire and hope; and ambitious of nothing, but of doing nothing, and of being nothing: yet I have some employment of my thoughts to keep them from mouldring, as you shall know before I close this letter. But first, touching the third kinde of health. My condition or fortune was never better, then in this good Lord Treasures time: the very reverse of his proud Predecessor, that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41870:55"/>
made a scorn of my poverty, and a sport of my modesty; leaving me in bad case: and the world, so as though we now know by what Arts he lived, yet are we ignorant to this hour by what Religion he died, save only that it could not be good, which was not worthy the professing. This free passage let me commit to your noble brest, remembring that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the reciever, I have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed a late Counsel of mine own which I gave to a young friend, who asking me casually of what he should make him a sute, as he was passing this way towards <hi>London;</hi> I told him that in my opinion, he could not buy a cheaper nor a more lasting stuff there then silence. For I loved him well, and was afraid of a little free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that I spied in him. And now, Sir, I must needs conclude (or I shall burst) with letting you know, that I have divers things in wilde sheets that think and struggle to get out of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41870:56"/>
several kinds, some long promised, and some of a newer conception: but a poor exercise of my pen (wherewith I shall only honour my self by the dedication thereof unto your own person) is that which shall lead the way by mine and your good leave, intending (if God yield me his favour) to print it before It be long in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to send you thence, or bring you a Copy to our <hi>Redgrave.</hi> What the subject is you must not know beforehand: for I fear it will want all other grace, if it lose virginity. And so the Lord of all abundant joy keep you long, <hi>con quella buona Ciera,</hi> which this my servant did relate unto me,</p>

            <p>UPon the receipt of a letter from you (which came late, and I know not by what misadventure, half drowned to my hands) with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, that you had been at <hi>Sudbury</hi> in your passage homewards assailed with a Quartan: I resolved immediately to visit you by this bearer the best of my flights, and lately well acquainted himself with farther travellers, who yet hath been kept here after my said resolution, that he might bring you a full account of the business touching my inviol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t Neece so dear unto us both, which was a part of your foresaid letter, and wherein I am confident you will receive very singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment out of the very Originals of some, and true Copies of other letters which I send you by this my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41870:57"/>
said inward servant; and if he were not so, I would not have intrusted him with so tender Papers. The rest of his stay, was only that I might collect among my poor memorials and experiments something condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the recovery of your health, wherein I reckon my self as much interessed as in any one thing of this world. I will not say unto you, Courage, as the French use to speak: for you have enough of that within your self: Nor, be merry, in our English phrase (for you can impart enough of that even to others in the incomparable delight of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation) But let me give you two comforts, though needless to the serenity of your spirits. The first, That I hope your infirmity will not hold you long, because it comes (as I may speak, according to the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous translators of <hi>Avicenna) In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexionato suo:</hi> that is in the very season of the revolution of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41870:58"/>
humours, for <hi>Omnis Morbus contra complexionatum Patientis vel Temporis, est periculosus aut longus.</hi> The other, That it hath not succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any precedent caustick disease, because those Quartans are of all the most obstinat which arise out of the Incineration of a former Ague. The rest I have committed to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and memory of this bearer, being himself a Student in Physick: and though I dare not yet call him a good Counsellor, yet I assure you, he is a good relator: with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch I will intermingle no other vulgar subject, but hereafter I will entertain you with as jolly things, as I can scamble together. And so, Sir, for the present, commending you into the sweet and comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of our dear God: I rest</p>

            <p>AN express Messenger will ease us both of the trouble of a cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: But I was in pain whether I should send another, or be that Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger my self, being now as near you as <hi>Royston,</hi> and scant able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon of mine own severity for not passing farther; yet this may be said for me, that the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion required little noise; and besides, I am newly ingaged into some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereof I will give you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account, when I shall first have discharged that part which belongeth to your self.</p>
            <p>My Lord, my Brother having been acquainted with the matter inclosed in your last to me, dispatched the very next day M. <hi>Pen</hi> down to <hi>Boughton</hi> for such writings as had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41870:59"/>
passed at your marriage; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving consulted with his Lawyers, he found those things to stand in several natures according to the annexed Scedule.</p>
            <p>For the point of your coming up, he referreth that to your own heart, and I have only charge from him to tell you, that without any such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as this, which seemeth to imply your affectionate respect of his Daughter, your own person and conversation shall be ever most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and dear unto him.</p>
            <p>As for my Lady, through whose knowledge, and my self, through whose hands you have passed this point of confidence; if you could behold us, and compare us with my Lord, you should see, though no difference in the reality, yet some in the fashion. For to him you must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the sober forms of his age and place; but we on the other side are mad with gladness, at the hope we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41870:59"/>
have now taken by this occasion of enjoying both you and my Neece this Winter at <hi>London;</hi> and we are contented to profess it as profusely as it is possible for a better Pen to set it down: Nay for my part (who in this case have somewhat single) I flatter my self yet farther, that the Term (whereof not much now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth) will accelerate your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Which if you resolve, I pray then let me only by this Bearer know it, that I may provide you some fit Lodgings at a good distance from <hi>White-Hall;</hi> for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blessed liberty, and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the comber of kindeness: which in troth (as we have privately discoursed) is no small one. Now touching my self.</p>
            <p>It may please you Sir to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, That the King, when he was last at <hi>Hampton,</hi> called me to him, and there acquainted me with a general purpose that he had to put
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41870:60"/>
me again into some use. Since which time, the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador (and very lately) having at an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of good length besought His Majesty (I know not whether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, or set on by some of our own) to disincumber himself of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent accesses by the choice of some confident servant, to whom the said Ambassador might address himself in such occurrences as did not require the Kings immediate ear. It pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to nominate me for that charge, with more gracious commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then it can beseem me to repeat; though I write to a friend, in whose breast I dare depose even my vanities. But lest you should mistake, as some others have been apt to do here, in the present consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Court (which is very ombragious) the Kings end in this application of me, I must tell you that it is only for the better preparing of my insufficiency and weakness for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41870:60"/>
the succeeding of Sir <hi>Thomas Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> towards which, His Majesty hath thought meet, first to indue me with some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>French</hi> businesses, which are <hi>in motu.</hi> And I think my going thither will be about <hi>Easter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see (Sir) both my next remove, and the exercise of my thoughts, till then; wherewith there is joyned this comfort, besides the redemption from expense and debt at home (which are the Gulfs that would swallow me) that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty hath promised to do something for me before I go.</p>
            <p>I should now according to the promise of my last tell you many things, wherewith my Pen is swoln; but I will beg leave to defer them till the next opportunity after my coming to <hi>London:</hi> And they shall all give place now to this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Whether there be any thing in this intended journey, that you

will command? Which having said, I will end; ever resting</p>

            <p>TO divert you from thinking on my faults, I will entertain you with some news out of a Letter which I have here received from <hi>Venice,</hi> of much consequence divers wayes.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Almayn-Prelate (of which kinde there be enough of that coat, though not in that Countrey) was treating
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41870:61"/>
in <hi>Rome</hi> a League against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> with whom His Majesty (you know) was first by Articles, and is now by ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance more nearly confederate: His Commission he had from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>Sotto parole tacite</hi> as they call it. Now, while this matter was there moulding, a <hi>Chiaus</hi> arrives at the Emperors Court, with a Letter from the <hi>Turk;</hi> importing a denuntiation of War, grounded upon a heap of complaints easily found out between Princes that do not intend to agree. And accordingly the <hi>Turk</hi> is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Person from <hi>Constantinople</hi> into <hi>Hungarie</hi> with great Forces (as my Friend writeth) on a morning <hi>quando nevicava a furia</hi> (by which appeareth the sharpness of the humor) having made a leavy before his going of 5000 youths out of the <hi>Seragli;</hi> a thing never seen before. He hath left behinde him <hi>Nasuf Bassa</hi> as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of his affairs, who told the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41870:62"/>
               <hi>Baiolo</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> there resident, that his Master was but gone to hunt: and seemeth to have healed the same language with the other Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors: whether out of meer wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of conceit, or as esteeming a war with Christians, but a sport in respect of that which he had newly concluded with the <hi>Persian,</hi> I know not: howsoever, this is likely to quash the Bishops business, and I fear it will fall heavy upon <hi>Germany:</hi> which first in it self was never more disunited; and besides, the Emperor in small good will with those that should help him. It will likewise in my conjecture hasten the departure of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> or at least (if it so please him) it may well serve his turn for that purpose.</p>
            <p>This is all that I have for your entertainment: To morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I depart hence towards <hi>London:</hi> whence I determine to write by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Carrier to you, till I bring my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41870:62"/>
In your last you mentioned a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Courtier that seemeth to have spoken somewhat harshly of me; I have a guess at the man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though for him to speak of such as I am in any kinde whatsoever was a favour: yet I wonder how I am faln out of his estimation; for it is not long since he offered me a fair match within his own tribe, and much addition to her fortune out of his private bounty; when we meet, all the world to nothing we shall laugh, and in truth (Sir) this world is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of nothing else. In the mean time and ever our sweet Saviour keep us in his love.</p>

And first, I send you your immortal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles confession of his faith; which I did promise you at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> solidly and excellently couched; as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else had the happiness to fall under his Meditation, and Pen. Next; you receive a letter freshly written me from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with mention (God bless us) of a Jesuite
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41870:63"/>
of your name: who seems (as all that comes from any of you is pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to have sent over lately some pretty iusinuative book in matter of Theological Controversie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance better dressed then any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and with more relish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the vulgar taste, but I believe it will be the same to the stomack: for well they may change their form, but it is long since we have heard their substance over and over, still the same <hi>ad fastidium usque.</hi> I shall languish to know how he toucheth upon your Name and stirp. The name of my friend who writ me the said letter, I have defaced for the censure of some other things therein, which I should be sorry to adventure at large: but you shall know him from me hereafter; and believe it, he will be worth your knowing.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear to tell you a thing (I know not whether I should
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41870:64"/>
call it news, because it is nearer you then to us) but strange in truth, written me from the said University at the same time by the Provost of Kings Colledge there; between whom and me doth pass much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar correspondency. It is of a weekly Lecture there performed heretofore by the Person of Mr. <hi>Christopher Goad,</hi> and lately deposed with severe commandment (as it should seem) from above, whereupon the women especially by way of of revenge for that restraint do flock to St. <hi>Maries</hi> in such troops, and so early, that the Masters of Art have no room to sit; so as the Vice-Chancellor and Heads of houses were in deliberation to repress their shoaling thither. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it is a good thing, when zeal in a land grows so thick and so warm. But soft, if I lanch any farther, I may perchance run (which yet were a great mistake) into the name of a Puritan. For that very Lecturer
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41870:64"/>
which is now deposed, did live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore with me at my table upon especial choice: being in truth a man of sweet conversation, and of sober solidity.</p>
            <p>Now, for other things, <hi>Nicolas Oudard</hi> brought me the <hi>Friday</hi> after his departure from you the glad tidings of your Agues discharge, as you then conceived it would be at the twentieth Access, according (as you seem to have told him) to a common observation with you there: so as in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> I see you count Quartan fits, as you do your sheep, by the score. I could heartily wish you would take for some time after it <hi>Alternis Diebus,</hi> my preparation of the <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> with addition likewise of the roots of <hi>China, Enula Campana,</hi> and a sprig of <hi>Tamarisque,</hi> all in the decoction of Barley-water, and quickned with a little sprinkling of a Lemmon: a rare Receipt to corroborat the Viscera, and to keep
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41870:65"/>
the Stomack in <hi>Tono.</hi> My said <hi>Nicolas</hi> tells me likewise, that you began to chirp upon being in <hi>London</hi> the next Term. I should be glad with your favour to know that point precisely: for having a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (by Gods dear blessing) to visit you at <hi>Redgrave</hi> (which will be the best Cordial I took in long time) I would shape my course circularly, either from <hi>Suffolk</hi> to <hi>Kent,</hi> or from <hi>Kent</hi> to <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as I shall hear of your motions towards the beginning of next Lent. For novelties of Court and State, all mens minds at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us seem magnetical, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the North. Order is come down this day to the Justices of this Shire, about a general muster at <hi>Alisbury</hi> the next week, and for especial watch at the Beacons: so as any burning of a bush by chance near one of them, would set the whole Province in an alarm; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these good providences, we
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41870:65"/>
hope well of the issue: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that a pretty strong conceit runneth, that the Deanery of <hi>Durham</hi> is reserved for Doctor <hi>Belkanquel,</hi> as a reward of his travails to and fro in this great business. While we are uniting our ceremonious breaches, The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> abroad treat hard this Winter about a peace, as one writeth; (and I believe very truly) without consideration of any other Prince or State but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If this be so, and take effect in that manner, then is <hi>Charles de Loraine Exutus Lepidus,</hi> stript to his shirt, the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> lest at large, and the <hi>Swede</hi> must stand upon his own feet. But <hi>Brevibus Moment is summa vertuntur:</hi> all depends upon the taking, or not taking of <hi>Brisach,</hi> the <hi>Helena</hi> of <hi>Germany:</hi> and though a Town indeed of great strength and advantage; yet a poor price for so much blood as hath been lost about it. While I am talking of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41870:66"/>
war, let me tell you what I hear, that your Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> is grown a great man at Court in private intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the King, together with the Earl <hi>Marshall:</hi> our good Soveraign will feel a sufficient man quickly. The States lie still and close oppressed with the adversities of the last year; and with nothing more, then the late ruine of fourty well laden ships by the <hi>Texel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with deploration of the whole Province were lost one thousand Mariners.</p>
            <p>Touching the subject whereof I sent you an account by <hi>Nicolas,</hi> I have heard nothing since to increase my hope, and much less my faith. You shall have more the next week. Till when and ever our sweet Jesus have you in his love.</p>

Of his case whose love drew him into it, I can yet make no judgement. The humour seemeth to be sharp, and there is wisdom enough in those that have the handling of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to manage the matter, so that at length, his banishment from the Court may be granted as a point of grace. The nature of his alteration was (as you rightly judge it) in the first access somewhat apoplectical, but yet mingled in my opinion with divers properties of a lethargy; whereof we shall discourse more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when we meet, which I now long for, besides other respects, that we may lay aside these Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors.</p>
            <p>This very morning shall be heard at the Star-chamber the case of Sir <hi>Peter Buck</hi> an inhabitant at <hi>Rochester,</hi> an officer (as I take it) of the Navy, who hath lain some good while in prison for having written to a friend of his at <hi>Dover</hi> a letter containing this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41870:67"/>
news, that some of the Lords had kneeled down to the King for a toleration in Religion: besides some particular aspersion in the said letter of my Lord privy Seal: whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of late a Preacher or two have disquieted: whereby he hath been moved besides his own nature, and (as some think also) besides his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to call these things into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick discourse: <hi>quae spreta exolescunt,</hi> if antient grave sentences do not deceive us.</p>
            <p>My Lady of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> remain still close prisoners since their last restraint, which I signified unto you in a little ticquet. Sir <hi>William Wade</hi> was yesternight put from the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy of the Tower.</p>
            <p>I set down these accidents barely as you see without their causes, which in truth is a double fault, writing both to a friend, and to a Philosopher: but my lodging is so
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41870:68"/>
near the Star-chamber, that my pens shake in my hand: I hope therefore the Ambassador of <hi>Savoy</hi> (who hath already had two audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) will quickly be gone, that I may fly to you, and ease my heart.

            <p>AFter the rest of your trouble at the present, there remaineth a

proposition to be consulted with you: about which I should esteem the charge of an express messenger not ill expended, though you were at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And both Mr. <hi>Harison</hi> and my self think no man living more proper to solve it, then our Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon.</hi> The Question is this: whether there may not be found some natural Philosophical way to determine the measure of a minute, or quarter, or half, or intire hour, or any portion of time more precisely and uniformly, and infallibly then hath been yet invented by any Mechanical and Artificial motion? And particularly, whether it may not be done by the descent of drops through a Filter, either in <hi>Manica Hippocratis,</hi> or in a Tongue of cloth equally thick, with consideration likewise of all circumstances in that liquid substance which must sink through it. If this may be done, there will be a mighty point obtained in

the rectifying of the Longitudes of the Earth, which depend upon the thoment of the Lunar Eclipses; and Mose, upon the exact determination of the beginning and ending of an hour: for which purpose the great <hi>Tycho Brach</hi> composed divers <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,</hi> and hour-glasses, some run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with simple water, some with distilled spirits, some with pulverized metals, and some with crude Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but never to any infallible satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the point propounded: which likewise would be of singular use in divers Astronomical observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it could be once justly regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

The Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> is still beheld as a Lord Treasurer, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture hath never fainted since the very first rising of it.

If my Neece <hi>Bacon</hi> of dearest memory were alive, (whom God took not long after my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Albertus</hi> into his eternal bliss) I am sure she would joyn in this suit unto your Majesty, that all Sexes might enter into the obligation: But it is your Majesties own goodness, from which only we can hope for a favourable answer: And so with all our prayers, and with my particular

            <p>I Must now acknowledge it true which our Navigators tell us, that there be indeed certain variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the compass: for I think there was never point of a needle better touched then you have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, having ever since I parted from you been looking towards you, and yet still by something or an other, I am put out of my course.

            <p>This is the first part of what I meant to say.

            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Mansfeld</hi> is still in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> not only out of liberty (as he was) but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41870:83"/>
almost now out of Discourse.</p>
            <p>We have lately started at a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch from <hi>Ireland,</hi> importing a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance there, about the choice of a Speaker in the summoned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which came to so sharp a point, that the Deputy was fain to fetch wisdom from hence. Sure it is that the humors of that Kingdom are very hovering, and much awaked with an apprehension taken that we mean to fetter them with Laws of their own making; which in truth were an ingenious strain of State. My Lord and Lady are stollen down into <hi>Kent</hi> for a few dayes to take in some fresh ayr. They go not this next Progress, if my Brother can get leave of the King to see his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children; where he intends to spend some fortnight, and the rest of the time between <hi>Boughton</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi>

            <p>THe last week, by reason of my being in <hi>Kent,</hi> was a week of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and this I think will appear unto you a week of wonder.</p>
            <p>The Court was full of discourse and expectation, that the King being now disincumbred of the care of his Daughter; would towards this Feast of St. <hi>George</hi> fill up either all or some at least of those places that had lien vacant so long, and had been in this time of their emptiness a subject of notorious opposition between our great Vicount and the House of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi> Thus I say ran the opinion: When yesterday about six of the Clock at Evening, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> was from the Council-Chamber conveighed by a Clerk of the Council, and two of the Guard
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41870:84"/>
to the Tower; and there by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant consigned to the Lieutenant as close Prisoner: Which both by the suddainness, like a stroak of thunder, and more by the quality and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the person breeding in the Beholders (whereof by chance I was one) very much amazement; and being likely in some proportion to breed the like in the Hearers, I will adventure for the satisfying of your thoughts about it, to set down the fore-running and leading Causes of this accident, as far, as in so short a time I have been able to wade in so deep a water. It is conceived that the King hath a good while been much distasted with the said Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, even in his own nature, for too stiff a carriage of his fortune; besides that scandalous offence of the Queen at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> which was never but a palliated cure. Upon which considerations, His Majesty resolving to sever him from my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41870:85"/>
Lord of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and to do it not disgracefully or violently, but in some honourable fashion; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not long since the Arch-Bishop by way of familiar discourse, to propound unto him the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>France,</hi> or of the Arch-Dukes Court; whereof the one was shortly to be changed, and the other at the present vacant: In which proposition it seemeth, though shadowed under the Arch-Bishops good will, that the King was also contented some little light should be given him of His Majesties incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto it, grounded upon his merit. At this the Fish did not bite; whereupon the King took a rounder way, commanding my Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi> to propound joyntly the same unto him (which the Arch-Bishop had before moved) as immediately from the King, and to sweeten it the more, he had (as I hear) an offer
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41870:85"/>
made him of assurance before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the place, of Treasurer of the Chamber, which he expecteth after the death of the Lord <hi>Stanhop;</hi> whom belike the King would have drawn to some reasonable composition. Notwithstanding all which Motives and impulsives, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> refused to be sent abroad with such terms as were by the Council inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted pregnant of contemptin a case where the King had opened his will; which refusal of his, I should for my part esteem an eternal disgrace to our occupation, if withall I did not consider how hard it is to pull one from the bosom of a Favorite. Thus you see the point upon which one hath been committed standing in the second degree of power in the Court, and conceiving (as himself told me but two hours before) never better then at that present of his own fortunes &amp; ends. Now in this whole matter, there is one main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41870:86"/>
doubt, which doth travail all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings; that is, <hi>Whether this were done without the participation of my Lord of Rochester:</hi> A point neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infolding two different conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; for if it were done without his knowledge, we must expect of himself either a decadence or a ruine; if not, we must then expect a repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by some other great publick satisfaction, whereof the world may take as much notice. These clouds a few dayes will clear: In the mean while I dare pronounce of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> that he shall return no more to this Stage, unless Courts be governed every year by a new Philosophy, for our old Principles will not bear it.</p>
            <p>I have shewed my Lord and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Sister your Letter of the 18. of <hi>April,</hi> who return unto you their affectionate remembrances, and I many thanks for it. The King hath altered his journey to <hi>Thetford,</hi> and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41870:86"/>
determineth to entertain himself till the progress nearer <hi>London.</hi> The Queen beginneth her journey upon <hi>Saturday</hi> towards <hi>Bathe.</hi> Neither the Marquess <hi>di villa</hi> (who cometh from <hi>Savoy)</hi> nor <hi>Don Pedro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> disarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento</hi> (who shall reside here in the room of the present <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador) are yet either arrived, or near our Coast; though both on the way: So as I can yet but cast to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you a longing, and in truth an envious look from this place of such servility in the getting, and such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in the holding of fortunes, where me-thinks we are all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded with that sleep of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he saw some ascending, and some descending; but that those were Angels, and these are men: For in both, what is it but a Dream? And so (Sir) wishing this Paper in your hands, to whom I dare communicate the freest of my thoughts, I commit you to
