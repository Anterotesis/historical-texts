         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Were they greate worldly Clerkes, were they philosophers, were they pharisees or scribes, were they great rich persones, or men of high power and authoritie? no verily, they were none of al these, they were but pore &amp; vnlerned fishermen.

<pb facs="tcp:24962:8"/>
with one hole voice and consent: yet he said he wold not beleue it, tyl he had sene the prynte of the nayles in Christes handes, and felte his woundes. Uerely<note place="margin">S.

For the infidelitie of saynte Thomas profyted more to the Christen feith, then did the feith of the beleuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For while he by gropyng, is brought againe to the feith: our mynde is (all doubt set apart) stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the feith. Thre thynges then are here to be considered in thys historie. First the hardnes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe in saynt Thomas, whiche albeit he was one of the electe disciples of Christe and longe conuersant wyth hym, and continually instructed of his risyng againe, yet he doubteth. Seconde, the goodnes and tendre mercie of Christ, which wolde not thus leaue him. Thyrdly, the constancie of thys blessed Apostle in the feith ouer after euen til his lifes ende. It was doubtles a very grosse infidelitie and hardnes of be leue in saint Thomas, that after so longe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paning with our Sauiour Christ and hearynge him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afore his passion say he shuld rise agayne yet he wolde not beleue his resurrection, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hys felawes verily were grosse til they had receyued the holy ghost, for they wold skant beleue his resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Chryso stom.</note> til they had seen him. But saynt Thomas was

grosser tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they all. For he said he wold not beleue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tyl he had seen the prynt of the nayles in Christes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; yet this was not ynough to make<note place="margin">☜</note> him beleue, but he wolde also fele hys wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des with his owne handes. And here we haue a lyuely image of the nature &amp; disposition of the fleshe. For the flesh can not be brought to beleue but by sensible signes &amp; tokens. Neither was thys carnalitie in Thomas only, but it is in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for we be made of one mowld<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> and god hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder infidelitie that he might haue mercie of all.

Our Sauiour Christe therfore eight daies after he had appeared to his felawes, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where as they were gathered togither, &amp; Thomas with them. He entred in vnto them, the dores being shutte, &amp; wyth hys ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed salutation greteth them, sayng. Peace be amonges you. And forthwyth turnyng hymselfe to Thomas, whose infidelitie could not be hidde from him, whiche bicause he ꝑceiued proceded not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice but of weaknes: he vouch saued to heale. He had him behold his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and grope his side. Thomas according as Christ had bidde him, beheld the print of the nailes, and thurst his hand into his side. And forthwyth wyth an exclamation cryed, my lorde my God. Thus from a grosse and stubburne infidelitie was he brought to a fast and constant feith.</p>

spake to his disciples, occasioned them to be moche more diligent and lowly in hert. For bycause it was likely that they stode moch in their owne conceytes for that they did cast out deuiles, therfore with these wordes he abateth their courage &amp; represseth them.

come to mankynd, that is that she shulde beare the moost blessed kyng of kinges and Sauiour of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde. Let vs then procede to the declaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this so ioyful gospel. In the sixt moneth was sent to the blessed virgine Mary no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon angel but Gabriel the Archangel. For to this so highe and solempne a message it was mete that an highe angell shulde be sent which shulde bringe tydynges of him that was highest of all. Whiche aungel (as Origen sayth) is<note place="margin">Origen.</note> therfore expressed by hys propre name to thintent it might be signified by the same what he is in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Gabriell he sayth betokeneth the strength of God. Wherfore by hym that was the strength of God it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that he shulde be vttered and proclaimed whiche being the Lorde of powers and mighty in batell came to conquere &amp; vanquishe the wicked powers of the ayer. And what saith this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changell Gabriel vnto her? Haile ful of grace. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo. de assu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p.</note> saith saynt Hierom, she is wel called ful of grace. For to other grace is giuen by partes, but vpon the virgine Mary dyd the fulnes of grace altogether infunde it selfe. She mighte well be cleped full of grace by whome euery creature is w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a large showre of the holyghost ouersprede. Yea already was he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the virgine whiche sent the angell to the virgine, I say our Lorde went before his messanger. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it foloweth. The Lorde is with the. He is in thy harte, he is nowe also in thy wombe, he replenisheth thy mynde, he replenisheth also thy body. And here<note place="margin">Ambro se.</note> (saith Ambrose) lerne a virgine of her shamefastnes for she was abashed. It is the propertie of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to tremble, &amp; at al approchinges of man vnto
<pb n="xiiij" facs="tcp:24962:14"/>
them to blushe, &amp; with a reuerent feare to eschue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar talkyng with man.</p>
            <p>Lerne y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> virgine tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eschue al wantonnes of wor des. The virgine Mary feared euen the greting of the angell. Yea she wondered at this strange maner of gretinge, wherof the lyke was neuer herde before in any place, this was reserued only for the virgine For (as Origen noteth) if she had wyst y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the like sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation<note place="margin">Origen</note> had euer been made to any other in al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (for she had the knowlege of the lawe) thys gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge shulde neuer haue troubled ne dismayed her. But albeit she was troubled &amp; abashed at the sode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this so stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a thing: yet seyng she had deser<note place="margin">Chryso stom.</note> ued such grace with God, she had no cause to feare. And therfore the angel saith vnto her. Feare not O Mary, for thou hast founde fauour &amp; grace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god. But how fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d she this grace? Surely (saith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctoure Chrysostomus) through her humilitie. And so must al we fynde it. For as holy writ sayeth, God giueth grace to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, And lo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sayth the angel, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shalt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue in thy wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be &amp; be deliuered of a son who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shalt name Iesus. Iesus by interpre tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betokeneth a Sauiour. And in dede our lorde is a right Sauiour to so many as cleaue vnto hym by feith. Yea ther is none other Sauiour but he. He is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> only great one &amp; is cleped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest. For albeit it was spoken by Ihon Baptist y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he shuld be<note place="margin">Ambro se.</note> great, yet, as S. Ambrose saith, he was called great as a greate man wheras Christe is as greate God. Thys Christ therfore shall reigne in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> house of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob for euermore. He called y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> house of Iacob not on ly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> outward Israelitꝭ but the hole church of Christ

be they Iues or Gentils which beleue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For as saynt Paule sayth. Not al they whiche be of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell be Israelites, but suche as be the chyldern of<note place="margin">Rom. ix.</note> the promise, be counted the sede. For, sayeth he, they that be the chyldren of the fleshe, be not the chyldren of God. Now Mary to thintent she wold be yet fur ther instructed of thys mystery, asketh howe thys shulde come to pas, she doubted not of the aungels wordes. Only she desireth to know by what meane it shulde be brought about that she shulde be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that neuer lay with man. The angel answereth The holy goost shall come vpon the, as who shulde say. Seke not a natural ordre where the thyng pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<note place="margin">Chrxso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</note> nature. Thou askest how this shalbe, thou not knowyng man. Nay thys thynge happeth vnto the euen bicause thou hast not assayed wedloke. For yf thou haddest, thou shuldest not haue been thoughte worthy to this mystery, not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wedlok is a prophane<note place="margin">☞</note> thing, but bycause virginitie is better. For it becam the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Lorde of all, both to be pertaker with vs in byrth and also to varye from vs in it. In that he shulde be borne of the wombe, he taketh parte wyth vs, but in that he shulde be borne wythout carnall knowledge of man, he is declared to be no man but god. Mary fully satisfied with his answere sayth in moost humble wise, beholde the handmayde of oure Lorde, be it to me as thou hast said. Let vs then my frendes folow the humilitie of thys blessed virgine. Let vs imbrace Christ like feythful Christians that we maye be of the nombre of his chosen people, and inherite hys kyngdome.

Now, saith Christ, ye be cleane for the worde that I<note place="margin">Vos mü di estis.</note> haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you.

For who is he (as sayth saynte Augustine) so cleane<note place="margin">S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> in this life, which is not yet more &amp; more to be made cleane? Christe therfore clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seth those that be cleane that they maye be yet more frutefull. But why saith he not, ye be cleane by baptisme? Uerely, sayth thys holy doctour, bicause in the water also it is the word that cleanseth. For plucke awey the word, and what is the water but water? But let the worde come to the water and so is made a sacrament. Let vs than take hede, that we abide in Christ, that he also maye worke in vs hangynge vpon hym. For lyke as the braunche, yf it be plucked from the vine, can bringe forth no frute, no more can we bryng forth the frute of any good worke, onles we cleaue to Christe by feith and charitie, from whens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth whatsoeuer maketh to the true and euerlastyng helth.

Surely yf any braunche, by hys owne fault plucke hymselfe awey from the true vine: not only he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth no frute, but as an vnprofitable bowghe being cutte of wyth the knyfe wythereth awey, and anon after is gathered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other baren bowghes &amp; thrown into the fyer to be burned, and thus being destitute and voide of the liuely moysture &amp; spirite of Christ, he dyeth in the mynde, thoughe he yet liue in bodye, and after this life being seperated &amp; pared awey from the vine without recouerie, he is cast in to euerlastynge fyer, alweys there to brenne for hys punishement bycause he wolde not styll remayne in the vine as a good brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch hereafter to haue brought<note place="margin">Et verb a mea in vobis ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>serit.</note> forth and inioyed the frute of euerlastyng ioye.

For there is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate plentie there of mansions, and ye shall not nede to say that it is necessary, that they were made redy for you, albeit if I go &amp; prepare you a place, yet wil I com againe &amp; take you with me.

that he may not be seen, he withdraweth himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that he may be beleued. For then is a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs, if we liue by feith. This is the wey that our sauiour Christe here speaketh of.</p>
            <p>Yea Christ himselfe (if we beleue in him) is the very wey for vs to heuen, he is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trouth, he is the life.

And therfore Christ say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further, that no man can come to the father but by him, &amp; he sayth, that he that knoweth him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also the father, forasmoche as the father and he be one.

The Apostles therfore healed disea ses euen with their shadowes, they conuerted to the feith not a fewe persons as Christ did when he was here in earth, but hole nations, but yet they did this by Chryste, or rather Chryste dyd these thinges in them. Lette vs then haue in vs this stronge feith, and this brenning charitie, and than wythout fayle what so euer we shal desyre in Christes name, he woll perfourme it.

This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophetes mother named Elizabeth was thought to haue bene baren. But it pleased god so to worke with her to set forth his owne glorie and power. He
<pb facs="tcp:24962:20"/>
sent to her therfore nowe in her old age this blessed child to take the reproche of barennes from her. He prolonged for this intent her child bearing, that the<note place="margin">Chry so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</note> ioy herof might be the greater, and she be made the more renowined and notoriouse. For all her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours &amp; kynsfolke which before had knowne her ba rennes, were nowe made witnesses of the heauenly grace wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had endowed her. For none that saw the child, departed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> silence, but blessed &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed god which vnloked for had se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this blessed child vnto her being of this age. The eight day therfore they went to circumcise the child according to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe. And bicause Zacharie his father was by gods prouision made du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and spechles, they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing<note place="margin">Luc. i.</note> that the father wold so haue bene best ct<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>en<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ted named him Zacharie by his fathers name.

For Zacharias betokeneth in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brer of god, &amp; Ihon is named the grace of God. The iustice of the lawe stode in appoynted<note place="margin">☞</note> workes: the iustice of the gospell standeth by faythe through grace &amp; fauour. Howbeit, the kinsfolk wold not be ruled by the mother to giue him this strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge name, bicause there was none in al their kindred so called, but they wolde in any wyfe haue hym called Zacharie by his fathers name. And yet at this day

there be some better pleased w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the name of Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">Erasmꝰ in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra.</note> then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the name of Ihon, these be they that can not yet suffre that the ceremonies of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> old law shuld be abolished, so that in effect they crye we wil none of this new name of Ihon, but we wil haue stil the old Zacharie. wherfore for asmoch as the childwife &amp; the cousins could not agree in the name, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie that the authoritie of the father shuld come betwene to breake the strife. But he had not as yet the vse of his tong, where now neded speche. Wyth signes therfore they signified vnto him what name wold pleace him that his child shulde haue. He vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mater required writing tables to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that thinge by dombe letters whiche by liuely voice he could not bring forth.

The time now was com, that the mouth<note place="margin">S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose. Luc. i.</note> which vnfeithfulnes had locked, shuld now through feyth be opened.

And a great praise of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is gathered out of this text as sayeth C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

could not be saued, oules perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a man wil say, that betwene the time of the calling of these two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles &amp; the passion of Christ, Zebedee her husband dyed, &amp; so she beinge a lone woman, &amp; aged, folowed the steppꝭ of Christ, which is also moch to her praise and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation. For feith neuer waxeth olde, and deuotion feleth no werines. She co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth therfore to Christ w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her two so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. They had herd Christe say<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> a litle before, that they which wold folow him in the new byrth, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shuld sit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seate of his maiestie shuld also sitte vpon xij. seates iuging the xij. tribes of Israel. And that al they which had left house, or brethren &amp; susters, father or mother, wife or children or their landes for his name sake, shulde receyue an hundred times as moch, &amp; shulde enioy euerlasting life. They therfore being as yet imꝑfect, &amp; hauinge litle vnderstandinge of the spirituall kingdom, but thinking rather that Christes kingdom shulde be a worldly &amp; temporal reigne, cam w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seching him, that the one of them might sitte on the right hand of him in his kingdom, and the other on the left, meaning, that they might be in some highe authoritie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. For sith in a worldely kingdome<note place="margin">Origen.</note> they do seme to be in honour, which sit w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king, it was no meruayle, though a woman being led w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a womans simplicitie or ignoraunce, thought, that such thinges ought to be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and her so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes also thinkinge yet nothinge highly vpon Christes kingdom, ymagined such thinges of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that shuld sitte with Christ. Then oure lord the knower of hyd<note place="margin">Chryso stom.</note> thinges, answered not to the wordes of the woman which was made peticioner, but to the counsailes of
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:24962:26"/>
her so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ues which had set her to do this. Surely our lord Iesus Christ oftentimes suffred hys disciples both to do, speake &amp; thinke many thinges vnright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to thintent that by their ouersight and blame, he might finde occasion, to expowne the rule of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, knowing ful wel that theire errour hurted not, so long as he was present with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the doctrine and instruction of the same was profitable both for that time present &amp; also for time comming. He saith<note place="margin">☜</note> therfore vnto them, ye wot not what ye aske, as who shuld say. I haue called you from the left side vnto the right, &amp; ye by your counsayle wil ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to the left side againe. And happily y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing was therfore done by a woman. For the deuil gatt him to his wont ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours<note place="margin">Gen iis.</note> of women, that as Adam was spoyled by a woman: so he might also separate &amp; destroy these by their mother. But now destruction coulde not entre by a woman into saintes, sithens fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the saluation of al men. The auauncement of honour delited them, but first it behoued them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the way of labour. And therfore he sayth vnto them. Can ye drinke of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cuppe that I must drinke of? As who shulde say, if ye wil deserue the swete, ye must also tast of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sowre. If ye wil haue pleasure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me in my kingdom, ye must take ꝑte of my payne, &amp; passion. The crowne of rightuousnes is giuen not<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> to al but to them that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in the course, and whiche do vse themselfes in such sort, that they may obteine the maistrye. If then he that proueth maistryes in worldly games, kepeth himselfe sobre &amp; absteyneth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to get a crown y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perisheth, what ought they be, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> seke for an euerlasting crowne
<pb facs="tcp:24962:27"/>
Truly (as sayth Chrysostom) our Lorde knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that<note place="margin">Chryso stom.</note> they coulde folowe his passion, but he asketh them this, to thintent all we might heare and know, that none can reygne wyth Christe, onles he folowe hys passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For a preciouse thing is not gotten but with a preciouse price. We call the passion of the Lorde,<note place="margin">☞</note> not only the persecuting of the Hethen, but also all violence whyche we suffre stryuyng agaynst synne. This passion and crosse we be all bounde to abyde, if we wyll be counted to be of Christes flocke. Yea and when the glorie of Christ requireth, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so not refuse to suffre corporall deathe for hys sake. Thus dyd the hooly Apostle saynte Iames (whose memorie we do thys daye celebrate) folowe hym, for he was beheded of Herode for preaching and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of hys maisters commission. And therfore it is no doubt of him, but according to Christes owne<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> promisse, he hath receyued an hundered tymes as moch, and doth now enioye the euerlasting life, and that he is one of them, that the kyngdom of heauen is prepared for. Wherfore (good people) lette vs fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe thys blessed Apostle, and as he dyd, so let vs, leue the loue of all worldly vanities, and folow our Sauiour Christe, to thintent we maye be heyres of god and ioynt heyres wyth Christe. For if we suffre with him (saith Paule) we shal also be glorified with<note place="margin">Rom. 8. i. Timo ij.</note> hym and reygne togither with hym. If we dye with him, we shal also liue with him and enioy the crown of euerlastinge blysse by him, to whom wyth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and holy ghoste be glorie and prayse for euer and euer.</p>

The good angells do continually mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistre vnto god and serue for our behouf, and their delite is to do men good, bicause they themselfes be good of nature, and theire office is to execute gods busynes and to take charge and cure of vs mortall men.

I let pas the visions of the prophetes Esaye, Elie, Elizeus, Ezechiel, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and the rest, where the Lorde by hys angells dyd speake and teach thinges whiche were to be done &amp; taught. Also the reuelacions of saynt Ihon setforth in the boke of the Apocalipse. Furthermore when so euer almighty god wold set out any singulare thing to mankind, he shewed it afore by his angels, as for exemple, of Sampson, of Iohn Baptist, yea and of Christ himself to be borne. The angels were present at Christes byrth, at his death, at hys resurrection, and at sundry other tymes. Ye shal morouer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that there be angels and also archa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels that is to saye, chiefe or principall angels, and they haue distincte officies and seueral functions wherby god almyghty exerciseth hys wonders. The Apostell Paul therfore teacheth, that there be powers, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, vertues. And according to their officies and properties they haue names, as saynte Michaell (whose memorie the church doth this day celebrate) as Gabriel, as Raphael, whiche for their high kind of ministration be called Archangels. For lyke as a king hath vnder him princes, dukes, capitans lieutenantes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stables and other officers to defend men from iniuries, to kepe the peace, to brydell and punishe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

so hath god (who is king of kinges) his angels vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him of diuerse officies for mans sauegarde and defense against noysom spirites. The angels I say of god, whether they be sene or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sene be alweyes ready and assistent to good personnes and be theyr kepers, which thing the ladder that Iacob saw rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vp to heauen, by whiche ladder the angels of<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> god ascended &amp; descended, doth manifestly declare. But here peraduenture ye woll aske thys question,<note place="margin">A pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> why angels do not so often nowe appeare, as they did in old tyme? To this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apostle maketh answere in the first chapter of the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,<note place="margin">The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> where he sayeth, that the lorde in times paste spake to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fathers by his angels, but to vs he haue spoken by his only begotten sonne, whom the father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs to heare, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes and teachinges be set forth vnto vs by the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes, Mathew, Marke, Luke &amp; Ihon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit an other cause also why the angels appeare not as often to vs, as they did in olde time to the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, may be very wel forbicause the world is now set all in naughtines &amp; men be commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge so pure, so bertuouse, nor so deuout, as they were in times passed. Yet it is manifest &amp; playne by Christes own wordes in the gospel of this day, that euery good person hath his angel whych beholdeth the face of god the father in heuen. Such an angell no doubt had Paule whom he called his angell, as<note place="margin">Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:24962:35"/>Wherfore the more fuller and replenished a man be wyth feyth and godly awe, the more often &amp; also the nerer be the angels to him, for accordinge to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe, lyke delyteth in the lyke.

If we be then pure &amp; good, doubt we not, but god hath giuen commaundement to his angels ouer vs, that they shuld kepe vs in all oure<note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> wayes. Herunto also do the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient doctours of the church ful wel agree. Saynt Hierom, writing vpon<note place="margin">Hierom</note> the gospel of Matheu, sayth. The worthines surely of soules is great, forasmoch as euery one hath his angel appointed vnto him for his keper euen from<note place="margin">Orige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 71.</note> his byrth.

Certainly these be few wordes, but many thinges in them com here to be marked.

For in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry be certaine due seasons &amp; goinges forwarde tyl at laste the corne waxe ripe, and the haruest is at hand. First of al the grounde is broken vp with the plough, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is sowed, after that the sede springeth vp into grasse, and shoteth vp into blades &amp; stalkes, and at last the frute ripeth, is cut downe, &amp; brought into the barne. In semblable wise the tyllage of the Lordes ground hath his certaine tymes, hys proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges and growinges. At the begynnynge Moses brake vp the Lordes grounde wyth the ploughe of the lawe. Then cam the prophetes and did sowe the sede. After that in the tyme of Ihon Baptist appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the blades. And at last wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ cam and sent forth his Apostles cam also the haruest, &amp; the weate beganne to be conueyed into the barne of God.

Lyft vp your eyen and be holde the<note place="margin">Ioh. iiij</note> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, for they be white alredy vnto haruest. And he that reapeth, receiueth a rewarde and gathereth frute into euerlastinge lyfe, so that both he that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth may be glad &amp; also he that reapeth. For herein is the worde true, that there is one that soweth and

an other that reapeth. I haue sent you to reape that which ye haue not labored. Other haue labored, and ye haue entred into their labours.

               <pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:24962:43"/>OUr Sauiour Christ (deare frendes) giueth vs here a speciall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, that we shulde loue one an other. First, bicause he by so many ways hath declared his loue towardes vs. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bicause in the worlde, if we be true folowers and louers of him, we shal haue none that wil hartely loue vs, but rather the world woll surely hate vs. And why woll the world hate vs? bicause the veritie of the gospell is brought vnto vs out of an other world into thys world by Christe, and Christ as a straunger cam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this world. Wherfore it is no meruayle, thoughe he hath many haters and despicers. For a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger amonges straungers can not easely fynd freendes. Besydes thys, whatsoeuer is in thys worlde, it is nawght elles but luste of the fleshe, luste of the eyen and pryde of lyfe, as saynte Ihon wryteth. Yea the<note place="margin">1. Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2.</note> chief renownes of this world (as carnal iustice, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wisdom, carnall power) be starke nawght. For the Iues were rightuouse in flesh, but seking to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their own ryghtuousnes they were not subiect to the rightuousnes of god. The Grekes were este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> the wisest men of the worlde, but the wisdom of this worlde was foly before god. Christ by his gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel repreueth the worlde of synne, &amp; vtterly reiecteth the wisdom, iustice, &amp; power of this worlde teaching them to be falshode and no trouthes, and he setteth vp an other kynde of iustice that muste be obteyned by feythe, an other kynde of wysdom to be lerned of gods worde, and an other kinde of power to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by trouble, crosse, affliction and suffraunce. The worldly men therfore not abydyng their thinges to be eyther repreued or reiected do hate Christe, they
<pb facs="tcp:24962:44"/>
persecutel his gospel and stampe against his word. And loke how moch the worlde hateth Christ &amp; hys gospel: &amp; euen so moch they hate so many as purely and syncerely do eyther preache or set forth by any meanes the same. They persecute them they kyll them. And for this cause Christe armeth al his true preachers and disciples by hys owne exemple that they shrynke not, when they be persecuted troubled or vexed, sayng. If the world hateth you, knowe ye that it hated me first ere it hated you, as who shulde say. Let it not seme straunge that ye be hated of the world, for the seruant is not in better ease than hys<note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> maister, they hated me first, wherfor how shuld they not but hate you also? Uerely al that be the true fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christe be not of the worlde first bycause Christe hath plucked them aweye by feyth from the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The worlde therfore can not but hate them, but persecute them, but exclude them out of theire companyes, yea, and if they can, put them to death. And al these thynges (sayth Christe) shal they do vnto you for my names sake. But what is thys to say, for my names sake? Surely sayth saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,<note place="margin">Saynte Austin.</note> Christe here meaneth, that they woll hate hym in hys disciples and true folowers, they woll perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him in them, and wol not folowe nor kepe their worde bicause it is his worde. Wherfore sayth thys holy doctoure, so moche the more wretched be they

whiche do these thinges forbicause of this name, as they be the more blessed whyche suffre these thinges for this names sake. Howbeit the euil do these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the euyl but both be wretched, aswell the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as the suffrers. And why wol they do these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in spite of Christes name? Ueryly (saith Christ) bicause they haue not knowne god the father of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whyche sente me. For if they had knowne God th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If Chryste had not comme and spoken to the worlde, it shulde haue had no synne. It is the preachinge of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell veryly that discloseth all vngodlynes and the vnrightuousnes of the worlde, and whiche also set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth open the iustice of god. Lette vs not then my freendes be ashamed of the gospell of Chryste. For as (the Apostle sayeth) it is the power of God to the<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now therfore sith the gospel is preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs whyche discloseth synne, we haue no excuse no clooke to hyde our synne wyth. We know god, and yet we do not glorifie ne worship him as god, we be not thankfull vnto hym for the great &amp; inestimable benefites which from time to time we haue receiued at his handes. We be called by the ministres of his holy word, but we wol giue no eare. We be tawght, and we wil not attende. Wherfore it is moche to be feared that like as we haue not regarded to knowe god: so god wil giue vs vp into a disalowed minde.
<pb facs="tcp:24962:45"/>
If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold hate him that he knew not, he might peraduenture seme worthy of pardon and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bycause he can not finde in his harte to fauour him whom he neuer sawe. But we haue sene Christ and haue harde him thoughe not personally as the Iues sawe him and hard him, yet by the preachyng of the gospell we knowe his power and ryghtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and we espye our infirmitie and vnrightuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I say in his worde we se him and heare him as wel and as perfectly as the Iues did. We haue seen his great benefites, we haue hard of his wonderful dedes, &amp; yet I feare lest there be many worldly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons amonges vs which do hate Christ &amp; hys word in very dede thoughe they pretende neuer so muche to loue hym, and they hate hym and his worde euen for the same thinges, for whiche they ought to loue him and the preachers of his word. For in that they hate the preachers of his worde, they hate his word, and in that they hate his worde, they hate hym. And verily who so euer hateth Christ and hys preachers or his word, doth hate also in very dede god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by whose authoritie and speciall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al is doon. Wherfore thys very thynge doth heape damnation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such worldly persons bycause they abuse so lewdly and so stubbernly the offred &amp; open goodnes of God. If Christ by the preachyng of his mooste holy worde had not vttered amonges them suche miracles and wonders as none of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes euer vttered, whether we woll consider the greatnes or the multitude of them, they shulde not haue been in daunger of so heynouse a synne. But nowe haue they both herde and seen the trouth, and
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:24962:45"/>
the more they haue herde &amp; seen, the more they haue hated both it and the preachers therof. So that the<note place="margin">Psal. 35. and. 69.</note> saynge of God by his prophete is in them fulfylled, where it is written, they haue hated me wythout cause. It might be borne yf one did hate one beinge sturred and prouoked by displeasure and vnkynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shewed vnto him to hate him. It myght be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold hate one he knewe not: but how can it be borne, that one shulde hate hym whom he knoweth and which studyeth to do him all the good he can for hys sauegarde and soule health? In thys sort did our sauiour Christ eo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte his Apostles and by them vs all, to suffre tribulation and hatred for hys sake. Let vs then folowe them and namely the blessed Apostles Simon and Iude whose memorye we do thys daye celebrate, whiche had experience of these counfortes in their crosse whiche they bare for Christes sake, neyther wolde they suffre themselfes to be plucked awey from the trouth of Gods worde for al the hatred malice and trouble that the worlde could practise against them.

            <p>WElbeloued people in our sauiour Christ, this gospel is right comfortable to al feithful and true christian folke. For in it is conteyned the glad and swere tydinges to al vnfeyned Christians, that is to wit, how Christ is our resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and our life, if we beleue vnfeynedly vpon him. and verely this is one of the chiefest articles of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to beleue that though we dye here bodily for a tyme or rather slepe, for so the scripture calleth it: yet we shal rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and lyue euerlastingly wyth God in heauen, through Christ, in case we haue had stedfast feith in him, and be founde cladde and adourned wyth the<note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For what auaileth it o my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (sayth thys holy Apostle Saynte Iames) if a man wold say he had feith, and hath no workes.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable &amp; chefest article of the christen mans beleue.
<pb facs="tcp:24962:59"/>
The historie is this. As our Sauiour Christ abode at Iordan, it chaunced that in a towne named Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania, a certayne man called Lazarus laye sycke. This towne was the natyue place &amp; countrey both of the sycke man, and of his two susters Mary and Martha. Uerely this Mary was she, which wyth a notable record of loue towardes our sauiour Christ had annoynted hys hed as he sate at meate wyth a right preciouse oyntment &amp; with her heare had wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped hys feete whyche she had washed with the very teares that ranne downe from her eyen. By reason wherof we may very wel vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that there was a singular and a right special amitie and frendship betwene this familie and our sauiour Christ. Wher<note place="margin">Chryso stom.</note> fore when Lazarus was in great paryll of deathe, his susters, for the familiaritie which they had with Iesus, sent worde vnto him, how his freend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus was sore sycke, they nothing doubting, but that he of his wonderful humanitie whyche he bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes al men, wold helpe his freend being in such dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Lo, say they, he whom thou louest is sycke. They thought it ynough only to gyue hym know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of his freendes sickenes, and therfor they adde no praiers to desyre his helpe. To whom Iesus ma keth answere in this wise. Ueryly this syckenes is not deadly, but it is therfore chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced vnto him, that by occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof gods glory might be set out, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his vertue the disease shal be driue awey, the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god might also be glorified. A like answere did Chryste make to hys disciples of him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

By feith doubtles the deade man liueth, &amp; by feith the quicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer dyeth. For ye may not thinke, that Christ spake this only of Lazarus.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it also with hys owne resurrection. Why do we then mourne the deth of oure freendes? Harken what Christ sayth. I am the resurrection.
