         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And nowe to begin with the firſt &amp; principall, the little belly or maw, (which otherwiſe is the receptacle of foode, and the officer for the firſt concoction) being lagde &amp; rent by the ordure of crude &amp; raw humors, hath languiſhed in ſuch ſort, as it had no power, either to retaine the meates therin encloſed, or to receiue in any other. Euen ſo in <hi>Hippocrates, Hermocrates</hi> being ſurprized with an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19188:20"/>
extreame burning Feauer, did euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more caſt the foode hee receiued: becauſe this facultie had loſt his ſtrength, and that was quenched in him (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſame place)<note place="margin">Com. 1.</note> whereof the office was, to feele lack in health, and to deſire what was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar for him.</p>
            <p>Many would attribute the cauſe of this Symptome, or paſsion enſuing ſickneſſe, to ſome bad power in an Apple, which an olde woman had giuen to this young Maiden, two or three months before; becauſe when ſhe had eaten it, ſhe had a diſtaſte of her meats, and felt ſome alteration of her ſpirits. But in regard, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this) nothing hath happened to her, which outwardly hath impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her health, neither her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall functions, vntill ſhe became ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the Feauer before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; I ſee no reaſon at all, that yeelds any ſubiect to belieue, how
<pb facs="tcp:19188:21"/>
the euill power in the Apple, could remaine ſo long time hidden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yeelding any effect. Her vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ceaſsing, ſhe became dumbe, by reaſon of thoſe nerues reſolution, which wee call recurrent (vvhich hapned to her ſoone after through all her body) the fleame cold &amp; raw, beeing liquefied by the heate of the Feauer, which by this meanes wrought a debilitie in the braine, cauſed that ſhee could not be ſound and wel in ſpirit. Here-hence it hath neceſſarily followed, that ſhe muſt needs looſe the ſence of taſt &amp; ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and likewiſe the vſe of ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat and drinke: which onely hath procured the abolition of the animall appetite, and by little &amp; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it hath bin followed, by a totall priuation of the appetite naturall, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> noteth by theſe words, <hi>Genestai de ouc edunato,</hi> if we may giue credit to his moſt graue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19188:21"/>
interpreter <hi>Galen.</hi> VVhich caſts the cauſe of this paſsion, vpon the blame of the liuer, who being the vegetant and naturall ſoule, ſo ſoone as ſhe is wounded, ſhe is conſtraind, that the auxiliarie, or ſuccouring faculties, (to wit, attraction, retention, aſsimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or compariſon, and expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in whom lies all the power of nouriſhing) muſt needs ſinck &amp; fall, and ſo conſequently the appetite, which cannot be compleat &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but by attraction. The ſame Authour gathers it to be the ſicknes of the liuer in <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> by this,<note place="margin">1.

For, that it muſt needes be ſo, life is nothing els, but an abiding or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſoule with the heat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame <hi>Aristotles</hi> iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">Lib. de reſp.</note> and we cannot in this obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of things, find any more aſſured inſtance of this preſent life, then by the functions thereof, of all vvhich, heat (as the eſpeciall inſtrument, and without other meanes) is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, the cauſe motiue and effecter. And <hi>Ioubert</hi> (to no ſmall purpoſe) hath defined life by heat, in that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> hath conſigned death, by the extinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame heat: for <hi>Iou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> groundeth on this axiome, that of two contraries, the conſequents are contraries.

And therefore it is blameleſſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine life by theſe two cauſes, that is to ſay, heat and temperature, becauſe it behooueth to take the definition, by the cauſe which is moſt neere. Now heat is the moſt neere inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule, the temper (next that) of naturall heat, which diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and accommodates it to diuers actions.

Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Haruet</hi> goes after another faſhion, he defines the life of man, to be an action of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, produced into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of man: but this definition is not ſubtile enough. For firſt &amp; formoſt, life is no action at all of the ſoule, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it ſhould be the ſoule that liueth, and not the body: but life is an abiding (as hath bin ſaid) or an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſoule with the body (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribeth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his bookes) wherof (ſoone<note place="margin">8.

            <p>Now the ſtrength of the facultie, which boiles the meate in our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, depends much vppon tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and moderation, but that is, when it is excited and prouoked on by the heat natural, which although that after one food is digeſted, ſhee introduceth not then of herſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other nouriture, as ſaith <hi>Haruet:</hi> neuertheleſſe; becauſe that this firſt is thus digeſted by heate, there growes incontinently a feeling of

penurie and want of foode, at the mouth of the ventricle, which we call hunger. For this cauſe, <hi>Ioubert</hi> referres only to heate (as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall agent) the quantitie of thoſe foodes, which we take immediatly after, and they are ruled by the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of hunger.

And therefore he concluds, that olde men haue not need of meate often, becauſe they doo not deſire or appetite often, principally conſidering, that they haue colde bodies: whereto <hi>Haruet</hi> in no wiſe will agree, for he ſaith, that all the action of mixed bodies, comes from the qualitie; which winnes the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand in the aſſembling of the elements. So is it in liuing bodies, heate ruleth ouer the other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which heate, all action hath his originall, and not of colde. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admit the propoſition with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> ſo farre foorth as to mixte
<pb facs="tcp:19188:38"/>
things, inanimate or without ſoule, &amp; which know the ſimple formes of the elements, for their principles. But in animate bodies, hauing ſoules, &amp; which haue a forme more noble, wherein are contained thoſe other more ignoble (euen as the triangle within the quadrangle) this is not a thing ſo eaſie. For they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge (as the principall of their functions) that nature, properlie called the ſoule I ſay, that is, the moouing vertue of the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the organe, liuing by power.</p>
            <p>And as for that which <hi>Haruet</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in aſſumption of his argument, that in the liuing bodie, heate doth ſurmount the other elementarie qualities: I cannot allow therof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he wil haue this heate to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to be the ſame which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth it ſelfe through the bodie, gouerneth and moderateth the whole Oeconomie of ſame. And

this, while it is in eſſence, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth life, but comming once to quench it ſelfe, then death of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt follow: and this ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth &amp; ſubiecteth to it ſelfe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the colde, moiſt and drie elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie qualities, but euen the hote ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie nature alſo, beeing (as in herſelfe) truelie celeſtiall.

So that if in the body, there be any ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding humour, which theſe parts cannot any way diſperſe, <hi>Galen</hi> calls the ſame, <hi>Peritton hupoleipome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19188:41"/>
which is impaired by the power of heat. In truth, the excrements doe not fall altogether vnder one &amp; the ſame conſideration. For there be ſome which are quite againſt nature, and wholy vnprofitable, and which haue no reſemblance at all with vs, and therefore can neuer turne them ſelues to our vſe, to be incorporated with vs. The Greeks call them by an apt name, <hi>Perittoomata,</hi> as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, vrine, ſweat, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There be others more according to nature, which are profitable to ſome part of the body: &amp; yet are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, not in regard of all, or the whole body, but for ſome part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only.

For the iuyce melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hath his excrement, the bilious or cholerick alſo hath his, neither is it that which is lodged in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and the inteſtines: for it is not as yet come ſo far as the liuer, where

            <p>In briefe, phlegme is not held to haue any perticuler inſtrument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if ſometime thorow want of eating, there ſhall be a defect of blood: the ſame turning it ſelfe on the blood ſide, ſhal ſerue as nutrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to theſe parts.

<pb facs="tcp:19188:46"/>
that if the ventricle bee filled with the phlegmatick-humour, it hath no appetite at all; why ſo in like manner, all the parts of the (bodie being filled) they cannot haue any deſire or hunger. For this appetite of the ventricle, whereof heere is ſome queſtion made, it is an animall appetite, which not being ſo in the other parts, this fleame cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate herſelfe to them in the ſame manner. I anſwere, that there are two ſorts of appetite in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the animall, and the naturall. The animall appetite, is a certaine moleſtation and anguiſh of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, proceednig of the ſucking, or of the compresſion of the foode, for and by the which, beeing angrie or offended, it deſireth meate. And the naturall appetite, is a ſtrength, bred and borne in all parts of the bodie, which deſireth euermore what it wanteth, and is thereto agreeable.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19188:46"/>
The one is appeaſed by the vapour of the meates receiued, and, by how little ſoeuer it be of ſubſtaunce: the other, by the only application hee makes of the meates. The animall appetite is perticuler to the ſole ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the naturall is common, as well to the ventricle, as to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes, by the which, beeing brought to the orifice ſuperiour of the ſame ventricle, it exciteth the animall appetite, which ſerues vs as a ſpurre for the deſiring of our meates. So long then as the rawe humour and phlegmatick remaineth at the ventricle, and that there (by the naturall ſtrength thereof,) it is boyled and brought into an eſtate: the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unicles, which make the bodie of the ventricle, in taking their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent portion, and the beſt therof, doo conuert the ſame to their owne profit. So the naturall appetite being contented, the anima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l appetite is
<pb facs="tcp:19188:47"/>
not offended at all, or complaines at entraunce of the ventricle. If all the bodie were full of one and the ſame humour, all the parts to whom this appetite is common, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the ſtrength of this emotion, would borrowe thereof, and drawe thence what ſhould bee ſeruiceable for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the arguments, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the learned <hi>Ioubert</hi> hath forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his opinion: arguments, which (in my iudgement) vntill this inſtant houre, there could be no one found, that did knowe deſeruedly how to ſtand againſt them. VVherto there are ioyned many examples, both of plants and other creatures, that not only preſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues many dayes, but alſo many yeares, without any nouriſhment taken outwardly. As in plants, the Onyon and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick &amp;c: in graine, VVheate Re, Barley, Oates, Millet and others:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19188:47"/>
in and among beaſtes, Serpents, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardes, Dormiſe, Beares, Crocodiles and Cameleons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. Of which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Haruet</hi> ſtriues to weaken the authoritie, by oppoſition of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulitude and great diſproportion, which is betweene the life of brute beaſtes, (yea, much more of plants,) &amp; that of man: becauſe his principall is referred to the reaſonable ſoule, and theirs to the ſoule vnreaſonable, and beſide, that heate (the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof) is much more noble in man, then in the vnreaſonable ſoule, and yet more in the vnreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoule, then in the plant.

I anſwere, that this humour aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in cruditie, ſeethes it ſelfe in the bodie there, and yet hurtes it not at all: for, beeing according to nature, it cannot create any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and diſeaſes againſt nature.

ſpirit, or the vapour. He will ſay, that in theſe natures, the ſpirits are more feeble, and haue not power ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to make ſo great a violence or impetuoſitie.

            <p>Now, where hee ſaith, that our life is differing from that of Plants &amp; beaſts, and that her principle, which is our ſoule, is much more noble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others: what is he that wil deny it? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelfe belieued, that ſhe onely was diuine, and came from abroade or without, to lodge within our bodie? But becauſe hee encloſeth within his obiection, the vegetatiue ſoule of Plants, and the
