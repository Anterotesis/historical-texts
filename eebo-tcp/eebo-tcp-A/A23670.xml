            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We must first mind you of your votes once past concerning no more addresses to the King, and our engagement to adhere to you therein.</p>

               </gap>ionably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled in expectations which way things would bend, seeing such uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of any end of troubles upon the Parliamentary account alone; then began your Enemies to hope and work your trouble, and their owne advantages, and in all the disturbances, so to execute all the other interests pretended, that at last they might set up that of the King and their owne above all others. Thus the Army which would not be won to disert the Parliamentary and publique interest to serve their turnes, was by them rendred the only common Enemy, and this new formed party at first professe for a full and free Parliament, and to free it from the force of an Army, <note n="d" place="margin">as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph was accused to his master Gen. 39.8 3.17.</note>Whereas the latest quarrell against it was that it would not force the Parliament to comply with the interest of the King. They likewise pretended to be for the easing of the people of taxes to an Army, whereas indeed their workings did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate the Parliament to continue an Army, and taxes for it. They also pretended for the Covenant against an Army of Sectaries, and for all these ends a Personall Treaty with the King must be held forth as the only Soveraigne salve. And thus the People were taught mainly to depend upon the King for all, and to Petition for these things, and in pretence of them to levy Warre against the Parliament on the Kings behalfe, and his partie is brought into the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of it.

for your and the Kingdomes defence, or in declaring with you against the Scotch Army and others, they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lead nor follow. And when in any thing of the Treaty concerning the very life of your Cause you made som stick, clamorous Petitions with Menaces come thick upon you, and forces listed daily about you, the City neither taking course, nor suffering their Major Generall to do it. And thus you were at their mercy whiles your Armie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at distance against your enemies in Armes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot conceive that in those resolutions for a Treaty, the judgement of Parliament was with due and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer freedome. And we wish you to consider the evills of this Treaty in laying designes for the Kings escape, and settling future correspondencies, and further whether it can be just or safe in relation to publique interest.</p>
            <p>The summe of publique interest of a Nation in relation to common Right, and in opposition to tyrrany of Kings or others, is, that for all matters concerning the whole they have a Parliament consisting of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putyes or Representers freelly chosen and with as much equality as may be, And that the power of making or altering Lawes and of finall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be in them, and that it may not be left in the will of the King, or any other particular persons to make voyd their determinations or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. And where the offence is in publique Officers against their trust, this same Counsell may call to account and punish such offenders either according to the Law, or where it hath not provided <note n="e" place="margin">Which is the ground of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting any Law</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own judgment.</p>
            <p>Against these matters of publique interest this King hath all along his Raigne opposed to uphold the interest of his and his Posterities Will, and Power: First that there might be no such Common councell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him, but that all things of Supreame trust concerning safety might rest in his breast alone without limit from any, or account to any on earth.<note place="margin">1639.</note> And for this he raised his first and second Armes against his people in both Kingdomes;<note place="margin">1640.</note> then he fell to play lower that none of those things of Supreame and absolute trust might be exercised by any others without him, no not by all the Trustees of the, Land, nor in any case though never so necessary for releife or saving of the People,<note place="margin">1641.</note> and for this he raised his third Armes, and when these his other claimes so farre failed, he would make you

know that neither Parliament nor any power on earth (what ever ills he had done) might meddle with his sacred person, no not so much as to secure him from doing more evill; and for this last part of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest his fourth Armes were raised. There have also fallen in other particulars with these interests,<note place="margin">1648.</note> as on the Parliaments part to protect Religious men, and to give Freedome to the Gospell and take away those corrupt formes by which snares were laid for such conscientious men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But on the Kings part the interest was to doe contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the Parliamentary and publique interests hath been made very much one with the interest of the Godly, and the King interest one with their greatest opposites, now wee suppose that where a person trusted <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 13.3.4. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of authority or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy in its constitution (not of a person abusively exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it) to be Gods instrument of good to every one, and an encourager of good in every man, and an enemy to evill.

And consider the Prince as heire, it serves to acquit himselfe, and as the next visible head of the Kings party, the King being in durance, it may serve on behalfe of the King and his heires and party as a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station against any conclusion by his Treaty; and the King himself hath insinuated the same sence of the Treaty, and that not without grounds to gaine beleef, he being still confined within your Garrisons and guards and upon his paroll; so that if you proceed upon so rotten a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and be cousened, ye cousen your selves, and cannot blame him or his.

            <p>If any object the Covenant as obliging us to perpetuall addresses to the King as being the onely way consistent with the preservation of his person and authority.

               </note> King may and shall be proceeded against in way of justice for the bloud spilt, and other evils and mischiefes done by him or by his Commission or procurement, and in order thereto shall be kept in safe custody as formerly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that for other Delinquents, you would lay aside that particular barganing proposition, and declare that all Delinquents shall submit to the judiciall power of the Parliament, to be thereby proceeded against according to justice or mercy, as cause shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and that none shall be exempt therefrom, nor pardonable by any other power then that of the Kingdom in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The power of Justice and mercy being thus saved, we proceed in order to the actuall dispensing thereof in relation to the late wars, and to peace with God, and quiet amongst men, to propound, as followeth:</p>
            <p>First, that the <note n="z" place="margin">God hates all workers of iniquity, <hi>Psalm</hi> 5.5. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth not the person of Princes, nor regards the rich more then the poore, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.19. and therefore he saith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. Ye shall doe no unrighteousnesse in judgement, thou shalt not respect the person of the poore, nor honour the person of the mighty; Reformation were better begin at the Majorites then the Minorites, <hi>Num.</hi> 25.17. and the 31 &amp;c. Midianites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Psalm</hi> 140.9. <hi>David</hi> prayes against the head of those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe him about; and he gives a generall Law for punishment of murderers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. and <hi>Num.</hi> 35.33. So you shall not pollute the Land wherein ye are, for blood it defiles the Land, and a Land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cleansed of blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.27. Now after the time that <hi>Amaziah</hi> did turn from following the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him, <hi>Vajiksher gnalaiv kesher, ligaverunt contra enim ligationem</hi> or <hi>ligam,</hi> some copies of 70 read <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desmos,</hi> a Combination, League, or confederacy against him; the words signifies any conjunction, as <hi>Iob</hi> 38.31. of the Pleiades, and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.6. of the wall, and it is of a warrantable combyning of <hi>Iehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.14. and this against <hi>Amaziah</hi> was in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the seat of the chiefe State or great Councell of the Kingdome, and it was done (as it seems) by publique Authority, for he fled to <hi>Lachish,</hi> and there as <hi>Iunius.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.21. lived a private life for eleven yeeres, in the mean while when they so conspired or combined against him, the whole people of <hi>Iudah</hi> made <hi>Azariah</hi> King instead of his father; yet though they deferred the execution, they did not omit it, but after the said yeers, sent after <hi>Amaziah</hi> to <hi>Lachish, Vbi morte offecerunt eum vamitha hac Ethana</hi> to Sea, they put him to death. So that this was done in an open publique, (not in a sudden and clandestine, or tumultuous) way, which it selfe was not afterward punishable, as in this case of <hi>Amaziahs</hi> father, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.10. &amp; 14 chap. 5. and of wicked Ammon, the people slew them servants of his that slew him in his own house, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.23, 24.</note> Capitall and grand Authour of our troubles, the person of the King, by whose procurement, and for whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest onely of will and power, all our wars have been, may be brought to Justice for the Treason, Bloud, and mischiefe he is therein <note n="a" place="margin">It cannot be unjust to desire justice, and that on, and as a guilty man, and no further.</note> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51717:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly, that a timely day may be set for the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> to come in, by which time if they doe not, that then they may be immediately declared incapable of any government or trust in this Kingdom or its Dominions, &amp; thence to stand exild for ever as Enemies and Traytors, to die without mercy if ever after found and taken therein. Or if by the time limited they doe render themselves, that then the Prince be proceeded with as on his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he shall give satisfaction, or not. And the Duke as he shall give satisfaction, may be considered as to future trust, or not. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that the Revenue of the Crown (saving necessary allowances for the Children, and for Servants and Creditors to the Crown) be sequestred; And the costly pompe suspended for a good number of yeeres; and that this Revenue be for that time disposed toward pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Charges, Debts and dammages, for the easing of the people, so as the estates neither of friends to publique interest, nor alone of inferiour enemies thereto, may bear wholly the burden of that losse and charge, which by and for that Family, the Kingdome hath been put unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that capitall punishment be speedily executed upon a competent number of his chiefe instruments also, both in former and latter wars; and that some of both sorts be pitcht upon as are really in your hands or reach.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the rest of the Delinquents English, may upon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring themselves to justice have mercy for their lives; and that onely Fines be set upon them, and their persons declared incapable of any publique trust, or having any voyce in elections thereto, at least for a good number of yeers. And that a short day be set by which all such Delinquents may come in, and for those who come not in by that day, that their estates be absolutely confiscate and sould to the publique use, and their persons stand exild, as Traytors, and to die without mercy if ever found after in the Kingdome, or its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that the satisfaction of arrears to the Souldiery, with other publique Debts, and competent reparations of publique dammages may be put into some orderly way. And therefore that the Fines and Compositions of Delinquents be disposed to those uses onely, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51717:8"/>
also the Confiscations of such who shall be excluded from pardon, or not come in by the day assigned.</p>
            <p>Now after publique justice thus far provided for, we proceed in order to the generall satisfaction and setling of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>First, that you would set some reasonable and certain period to your own power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that with a period to this Parliament, there may be a settlement of the peace and future government of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>First, that there may be a certain succession of future Parliaments, annuall or bienniall, with secure provision, 1. For the certainty of their sitting, meeting, and ending. 2. For equall elections. 3. For the peoples meeting to elect, provided that none engaged in warre against the Kingdom may elect, or be elected, nor any other who oppose this settlement. 4. For clearing the future power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as supream onely, they may not give away any foundation of common Right. 5. For liberty of entring dissents in the said Representatives, that the people may know who are not fit for future trust, but without any further penalty for their free judgements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that no King be hereafter admitted <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23.3. All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.18, whom the Lord and his people and all the men of <hi>Israel</hi> chuse, his will I be.</note> but upon election of, and as upon trust from the people by such their Representatives, not without first disclaiming all pretence to a negative voyce against the determinations of the Commons in Parliament, and this to be done in some forme more cleare then heretofore in the Coronation Oath.</p>
            <p>These matters of generall settlement we propound to be provided by the Authority of the Commons in this Parliament, and to be further established by a generall Contract or agreement of the people with their subscriptions thereunto. And that no King be admitted to the Crown, nor other person to any Office of publique trust, without expresse accord and subscription to the same.</p>
            <p>For our parts, let but that way of justice be effectually prosecuted, and the settlement of the publique interest be assured to us and the Kingdom, we shall desire discharge from our present service, and shall be ready to disband all or part, as shal be thought fit, the Arrears of the Souldiery being satisfied: We therefore desire that you would leave all private matters, and things of ordinary Justice and Right
