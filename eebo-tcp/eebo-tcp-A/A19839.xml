            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y deere Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters, Friends, and Allies, of the seede of <hi>Israel,</hi> according to the flesh: I professe truly vnto you, and that without dissimulation, my conscience and soule beareth witnesse with me, that I could say with the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for you so much affliction in soule, that I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desire to bee seperated from Christ for you my Brethren: for you I say, that are of the seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> you to whom hath beene sent and Prophesied, the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Blessed <hi>Messias,</hi> promised to our Fore-fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> as also vnto holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> You Brethren of whom according to the flesh, is
<pb facs="tcp:19942:3"/>
borne Iesus Christ, which is God eternally blessed. <hi>Amen. Rom.</hi> 9.5.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but this my conuersion to the Christian Faith, doth much astonish and afflict you: But my deare Brethren, that you may vnderstand I haue done nothing lightly or without premeditation: But with carefull heede, constant faith, and assurednesse in soule, hauing built my foundation vpon Gods eternall word, which cannot faile; I haue this day manifested to you and the world, my confession of Faith, which if you shall please to reade, though you finde it briefe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my scarsity of time, yet grounded vpon the proofe of the Prophets and Old Testament, verified in the History of the New. God assist you and mee, and may he be so pleased to hasten my returne amongst you my Brethren, that I there may manifest his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and grace to me, and that I may likewise be a light and guide vnto you, to leade you out of that darknesse wherein you are; insomuch that you know not the right hand from the left.</p>
            <p>First, I would entreate you vnderstand, that though I haue vtterly abandoned the Iewish Religion, yet am not become enemie to their persons, nor to the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is now so much the more auaileable into mee, in regard I can call my selfe of the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> not onely according to the flesh, but principally according to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore dearely beloued, I thought it fit to giue you some testimony of my charity, thereby to make you partakers of that grace which God hath bestowed on me, plucking mee forth of darknesse and errour, to the light of his holy word, out of the way of death
<pb facs="tcp:19942:3"/>
and destruction, into the way of eternall saluation.</p>
            <p>I know for these things I shall be hated of you, and if it be in your power, persecuted; yet being in your blinde zeale transported, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called to the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, who persecuted those that beleeued in his name. But when that shall happen, may it please God so to strengthen me, that I may as a Christian appeare like one of his, and so suffer for him that suffered and was crucified for me, which I shall account exceeding great gaine.</p>
            <p>And thus farre vnderstand, that all worldly respect whatsoeuer, I cast beneath my feete, and doe vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and disobey all Iniunctions which shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his seruice, that hath made me of a <hi>Saul</hi> a <hi>Paul</hi>; of a Persecuter and Blasphemer of his name, a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (by his grace) couragiously to confesse him and his name; that of an enemie hath adopted me a child; for which I cannot sufficiently render thankes: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to make you partakers of the same grace and mercie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (beloued) wash your selues in cleane water, that ye may be cleane, and turne yet from your euils. Alas! how long will ye vexe God? stay for no other Messias then hee that is come, and shall againe vndoubtedly with glory come to iudge both the quick and the dead. Then those eyes shall see him that haue pierced him, and those that cried, Deliuer the Thiefe, and crucifie the iust: Then shall they cry to the hills to fall vpon them, and the mountaines to couer them, but it shall no whit auaile them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19942:4"/>But howsoeuer you haue persecuted the Prince of life; and spilt his innocent blood; yet notwithstanding hee prayed for you, that it would please his Father to pardon you, in regard you knew not what you did: you may be yet restored by him, prouided you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, and leaue to blaspheme his name, and flye from misbeliefe: for God hath not forsaken his people whom hee formerly knew. Beare in minde the calling of the Gentiles, towards whom the Messias turned, being by you reiected, of whom he was borne, and to whom he was promised and sent: Woe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that are wise in your owne conceites, seeing many things, and taking heede to none; hearing much, and vnderstanding nothing.</p>
            <p>Thinke not (brethren) that I reproachfully write this vnto you, but in charity, and for it is the truth which I will alwayes witnesse vnto you as to my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued brethren, and better it were that I reprooue you, then God should reproach you with this saying, The Oxe knowes his Owner, the Asse the Manger of his Master, but <hi>Israel</hi> hath no knowledge, my people hath no vnderstanding. Behold heere the eternall which knocketh at your doore, it is the voyce of the beloued that knockes, saying, <hi>Open my sister, my deare, my Doue</hi>: Seeke the eternall now when he may be found, call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whilst he is neere: kisse the Sonne left he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye perish in the way.</p>
            <p>Thinke with your selues, the dayes are fewe and euill: Redeeme the time, the day of the Lord is at hand, you know not at what houre hee will come, then shall wee not be able to open our mouthes against our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb facs="tcp:19942:4"/>
the worke shall not dispute against him that made it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (deere Brethren) search diligently the Scriptures, take in hand the key of the Kingdome of heauen, the Lord in his mercy will shew you the doore.</p>
            <p>Receiue this in good part and briefely, because of the shortnesse of time that I haue to soiourne here: but if it please God to graunt me the grace, to returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Country amongst my brother Christians, after hauing trauailed into mine owne Country, to see those of mine owne Nation, I shall (God assist me) take paines to doe something more amply for your benefit, and the aduancement of your soules health.</p>
            <p>You my Father and Mother, whom I loue equally with mine owne soule: I humbly beseech you in the bowels of Gods mercy, thinke with your selues that you must once come to iudgement, and render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all your proceedings, before the King of Kings, holy and blessed, stop not your eares, and be not voide of vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>God which is the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, be pleased to open the eyes of your vnderstanding, and to manifest vnto you the knowledge of the Messia<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which hath suffered for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our iustification, and hauing giuen you this grace as vnto me, hee hath strengthened vs together in the same by his holy Spirit, to the end wee may perseuer constantly in the confession of his holy name in this life, and dying in his loue; we may be receiued into his peace, and made pertakers of euerlasting life which

By the Sea or great Caldron, which <hi>Salomon</hi> placed in the Temple of God in Ierusalem, which was borne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twelue Oxen, figuring the twelue Apostles, which should Preach the Baptisme of Repentance, of which they receiued the Commandement by our Lord IESVS CHRIST, which speakes to them in the 28.th of St. <hi>Mathew: Goe therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vertue of which Baptisme I verily beleeue to be
<pb facs="tcp:19942:6"/>
powerfull to Saluation, since our Sauiour CHRIST himselfe saith, 16. of St. <hi>Marke. Hee that shall beleeue and bee Baptized shall be saued, but hee that shall not beleeue, shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Iesus</hi> answered, <hi>Verily, verily I say vnto thee, except that a man bee borne of Water and of the Spirit, hee cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these wordes it appeareth cleare, that the Figures in the Olde Testament, are fully accomplished in the New by the searching of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which is the true Lambe of God without any spot, that taketh away the Sinnes of the world. Being also the true promised Messias and Sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom nothing hath beene spoken in the New Testament, which hath not formerly beene Prophesied by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets. Neither ought wee to looke for any other then he that is ascended into Heauen, euen <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which shall come to Iudge the quicke and the Dead.</p>
            <p>And further examining the particulers of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, touching his Person, Office, Natiuity, Doctrine, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, and Ascenton, I haue found them all to belong and appertaine to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> onely, who is the vndoubted Messias and Sonne of the Eternall God, as appeareth <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. Vers. 7. <hi>Thou art my Sonne this day haue I begotten thee.</hi> And it is of him also that is spoken in the 3. of <hi>Mathew, This is my beloued Son in whome I am well pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the time of his Birth, and entrance into the world, it is Prophesied in the 49. Chap. of <hi>Genesis: The Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Iuda, <hi>nor a Law-giuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his feete, vntill</hi> Shilo <hi>come, and the People shall bee gathered vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19942:7"/>And in the 24. of <hi>Nom. There shall come a Starre out of Iacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ is the Sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> according to the Flesh, he is the seed of the Woman, as is Prophesied in the 3. of <hi>Gen. The seede of the Woman shall bruise the head of the Sespent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to bee borne of a Virgin, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 7. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceiue and beare a Sonne, and shee shall call his name</hi> Emanuell.</p>
            <p>Christ was borne of this Virgin, to whome the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell speaking (that shee should bee Mother to the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world) said, his Name shall be IESVS. And the Euangelist St. <hi>Mathew</hi> saith, <hi>All this was done that it might bee fulfilled,</hi> which was spoken by the Prophet <hi>Isaih.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Messias is true Man, and so likewise true GOD, and beareth Name <hi>Iehouah</hi> th' Eternall. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 23. and the 5. <hi>Behold,</hi> the dayes come, (saith the Lord) that I will raise vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> a righteous branch, and a King shall raigne and prosper, and shall execute Iudgement and Iustice in the Earth.</p>
            <p>This could haue relation to none but our Sauiour Christ, who is sprung from <hi>Dauid</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> as it hath beene Prophesied.</p>
            <p>So then that the Messias ought to haue come from the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and that at this present no Iew can distinguish the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> one from the other, since they were Captiues in <hi>Babilon,</hi> which is aboue 2. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, how can they now haue knowledge of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and consequently their Messias which they looke for?</p>
            <p>This perswadeth mee verily to beleeue, that he that
<pb facs="tcp:19942:7"/>
was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> proceeded from the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as teacheth the holy history, the true Messias of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to haue beene borne in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> as foretold <hi>Micah</hi>: in the 5. Chap. 2. Vers. <hi>And thou Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Ephrathah,</hi> art little to bee among the Thousands of <hi>Iuda,</hi> yet out of thee shall come forth vnto me, hee that shall be the ruler in <hi>Israel,</hi> whose goings forth haue beene from the Beginning and from Euerlasting.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Bethelem</hi> is long since destroyed, and no marke or memory of it remaining; So then it followes, that hee that was borne in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> to wit, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> must bee the true Messias, according to the Prophets.</p>
            <p>The Messias ought to come to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the time of the Second Temple, as spake <hi>Agge.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Mala.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> came in the time of the second Temple, as the Gospell maketh mention, which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perswadeth me, to beleeue him to bee the true Messias to vs promised.</p>
            <p>And now seeing that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is destroyed, and the Temple likewise destroyed, so that no Stone remaineth vpon another.</p>
            <p>It is meere folly for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to looke for any other Messias aboue 1500. after the Destruction, then he that came at the time Prophesied and appointed, and which shall come againe to Iudge the quicke and the Dead, as it hath beene taught by the Apostles of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Item the Messias ought to haue taught a Doctrine of Grace and Mercy, whereas <hi>Moses</hi> gaue the Law, and denounced a Curse against the transgressors thereof, this is that which <hi>Esa,</hi> Prophesied in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The Messias, ought to bee that great Prophet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the 18.th of <hi>Deut: I will raise them vp a Prophet from among their brethren like vnto thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to worke Miracles, as saith <hi>Isa</hi>: Chap. 35. <hi>Then shall the eyes of the Blinde bee lightned, and the eares of the Deafe bee opened, then shall the Lame man leape as an Hart. and the Dumbe mans tongue shall sing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to bee a high Priest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. vers. 4. <hi>The Lord sware and will not repent, thou art a Priest for euer, after the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to suffer and Dye, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> teacheth vs in the 4. Chap. of his Prophesie, the 26. Vers. <hi>And after Three score and two weekes shall Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah be slaine, &amp;c.</hi> He ought then to haue Dyed but not for his sinne, for he was without sinne, and called by <hi>Daniel,</hi> the holy of holyes, he hath done wrong to no man, nor hath any deceit beene found in his mouth.</p>
            <p>The manner of his Death hath beene foretolde by <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 22. <hi>They haue pierced my hands and my feete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Zacha.</hi> 12.10. <hi>And they shall looke vpon mee whome they haue pierced, and they shall lament for him as one mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for his onely Sonne, and bee sory for him as one is sory for his first borne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And speaking of the Person of Iesus Christ in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalips,</hi> it is said of him; <hi>That when hee shall come in the Clouds all eyes shall see him.</hi> Namely those that haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him.</p>
            <p>The Messias ought to suffer for our Sinnes, to take
<pb facs="tcp:19942:8"/>
vpon him our infirmities and miseries, by his sicknesse to giue vs health, and to indure himselfe all reproach and disquiet to bring vs peace. As saith <hi>Isa.</hi> in the 53. Chap. very amply. Which is likewise aleadged by the Euangelists in diuers other places.</p>
            <p>The Messias ought to bee our high Priest, not that hee offered the Blood of Beeues and Rammes, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the Sinnes of the people, as saith <hi>Isa.</hi> in the 53. Chap. <hi>Hee shall make his soule an Offehing for Sinne.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 9.th Chap. saith. <hi>Neither by the blood of Goates and Calues, but by his owne Blood, entred hee once into the Holy place, and obtained Eternall redemption for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias ought to bee an Intercessor for Sinners and transgressors, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. So did our Sauiour Iesus Christ doe in the 23. of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> hee saith; (praying for his persecutors) <hi>Father pardon them they knowe not what they doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias after his Suffering ought not to remaine amongst the Dead, but to rise againe, <hi>Dauid</hi> fore-spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him, saith in the 16. <hi>Psal. For thou wilt not leaue my soule in the Graue, Neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption:</hi> The time of his Resurrection was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by <hi>Ionas,</hi> and our Sauiour doth apply it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> 12.40. <hi>For as</hi> Ionas <hi>was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly; so shall the Sonne of man bee three dayes and three nights in the heart of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Messias was not promised to bee a King or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince, or to haue an earthly Dominion, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> imagine, that thinke hee should come accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with an Earthly glory. But his Kingdome was foretolde to bee Spirituall, and his comming into this
<pb facs="tcp:19942:9"/>
world full of humility, ignominy, and contempt.</p>
            <p>His eternall and spirituall Kingdome was foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> his Kingdome is an eternall Kingdome, and in the second of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the 44. <hi>And in the dayes of these Kings. shall the God of heauen set vp a Kingdome, which shall neuer be destroyed, and this Kingdome shall not be giuen to another people, but it shall breake and destroy all these Kingdomes, and it shall stand for euer.</hi> And the Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> speaking to the holy Virgin Mother of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, saith, <hi>That hee shall raigne ouer the house of</hi> Iacob <hi>eternally, and there shall be no end of his raigne.</hi> Then this Iesus which is come in the fulnesse of time, is the Messias, which now raignes ouer a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall not temporall Kingdome, and there shines in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, who contrariwise in the earthly Kingdome was contemptible. First, hee was reputed borne from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of meane condition, foulded in cloutes, laid in a Manger, in a loathsome Stable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. For his familiar company poore Fishermen, knew no place where to lay his head, he was mock'd, iniur'd, persecuted struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they haue strucken the King of <hi>Israel</hi> vpon the cheeke with a Rod, then wisht they him to prophesie, <hi>Mathew</hi> 26.68. <hi>Prophesie vnto vs, O Christ, who is hee that smote thee.</hi> His defection was such that <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith of him, chap. 53. he hath neither forme nor beauty, when we shall see him there shall be no forme that we should desire him: and <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 22. <hi>Psalme,</hi> calleth him <hi>a worme and not a man, the shame of men, and the contempt of the people</hi>: And verse the 7. <hi>All they that see me haue mee in derision, they make a mowe and nod the head,</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise verified in the Gospell. Our Sauiour speaking of himselfe, saith, His Kingdome is not of this world,
<pb facs="tcp:19942:9"/>
which though it be to them a scandall yet it might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Iewes that hoped and yet doe vainely hope for a reestablishment of the temporall Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi>: and which beleeue that the Messias should come for them only, and not for the Gentiles, altogether against that which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.22. <hi>I will make them one people in the land, vpon the mountaines of Israel, and one King shall be King to them all, and they shall be no more two peoples, neither be deuided henceforth any more into two Kingdomes.</hi> And our Sauiour Christ in Saint <hi>Iohn Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>calles them one Shepheard and one flocke.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. who saith, Christ Iesus hath made both one, and hath broken downe the pertition wall.</p>
            <p>Now Christ hauing finished and suffered all things, that we haue vnderstood to haue beene foretold to be done by the Messias: we assuredly beleeue, that hee is the true Messias, which not onely came in the flesh, and in that suffered death, but hath triumphed ouer death, and the paines and punishments due to our sinnes, and after his resurrection ascended into heauen, there to be a Mediator for vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.

            <p>I receiue the Writings of the Euangelists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and them, beleeue to be the true word of God, as are also those of <hi>Moyses</hi> and the Prophets, and that the doctrines of the one and the other, are to instruct men in the true faith, and consequently, to bring them by the grace of God, to the inheritance of the Kingdome bought and purchased by Iesus Christ, in whom hee that beleeues, shall be saued, as he himselfe teacheth in the 6. of Saint <hi>Iohn, He that beleeues in me shall haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life:</hi> Now, for as much as the Christian Church is blemished with many Schismes and Heresies.

Then proceeding, I found it to be a New Testament, when comparing some places of it to others of the Old Testament, I was on the suddaine so sensibly toucht in soule, that I resolued to reade it through: and after a while reading, God I humbly thanke him by little and little opened the eyes of my vnderstanding, so that I began to doubt that I and those of my Nation were in some error: of which to be resolued, I addressed my selfe to some of the most learned amongst vs in <hi>Prague,</hi> desiring of them to expound vnto mee some of those places which I had read in the Prophets, still concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that I had a New Testament: which had they knowne, I might haue beene rudely handled by them: Their answeres gaue me no satisfaction, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary bred in me more difficulties, and if I pressed them to any materiall point, they then answered me, <hi>Sthouma:</hi> that is, they are things conceal'd; but being desirous to know those things which were conceal'd to them and my selfe also, I departed from <hi>Prague,</hi> and tooke my way into <hi>Poland,</hi> hoping from those Rabbies there to haue had more instructions; but their answeres were all one: And moreouer, I was by them inioyned to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

the Pope caused Sermons to be made weekely for the conuersion of Iewes.

               <p>First, for that contrary to the expresse will of God in the second Commandement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. They make to themselues grauen Images, they prostrate themselues before them, and worship them, giuing them the glory belonging to God onely, who saith: <hi>I am the eternall, that is my name, I will not giue my glory to another,</hi> nor my praise to grauen Images.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they doe adore and worship others then God, contrary to the saying of our Lord Iesus Christ, Math. 4.10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For that they beleeue that they may be saued by the name of other creatures, contrary to that, Acts 4. so spoken by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> touching our Sauiour Christ. <hi>Neither is there saluation in any other: for among men there is giuen none other name vnder heauen, whereby wee must be saued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Because they take from the Merites of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his Death and Passion, and teach that men are iustified by their owne workes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 21. <hi>For if righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes bee by the Law, then Christ dyed without cause.</hi> And in the 16. <hi>Knowe that a man is not Iustified by the workes of the Law, but by the Faith of Iesus Christ.</hi> And <hi>Ephas.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Not of workes,</hi> least any man should boast himselfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the men of the Church as they say, haue power to forgiue Sinnes, But God speakes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. <hi>I euen I am hee, that putteth away thine iniquitias for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy Sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb facs="tcp:19942:12"/>6. Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confesseth, with the Christian reformed Church, That our Sauiour tooke Flesh onely of the Virgin, and yet make they to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues out of Bread, a Iesus Christ of Flesh as they say, to bee their dayly Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> offendeth, in saying that they Sacrifice the Sonne of God for the sinnes of the Liuing and the Dead, against that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>which through the Eternall spirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himselfe without spot to God.</hi>' And 10.14. <hi>For with one offring hath hee consecrated for euer, them that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Because in the Romish Church, they haue taken from the Sacrament of Baptisme, which is for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sinnes in Iesus Christ, and teach in the same Church a remission of Sinnes, by Fastings, Pilgrimages, and the like, which I neither beleeue nor finde warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any place of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Because in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they holde some Meates (created good by God) for some certaine times poluted and vncleane, against the saying of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Tim. 4.4. <hi>For euery Creature of God is good, and nothing ought to bee refused, if it bee receiued with Thankesgiuing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prohibiteth people to Marry, which God hath not forbidden, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> cals that a Doctrine of Deuils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Forbidding to Marry, and commanding to abstaine from Mea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es which God hath Created, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Because in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Purgings then by the Blood of Iesus Christ, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which is spoken, in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>By his owne Blood entred hee once into the Holy plac<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and obtained Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:19942:13"/>
remission for vs.</hi> And <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ cleaseth vs from all Sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Because I beleeue a man ought not to worship what hee Eateth, nor to eate that hee worshippeth, nor that any thing wee eate can bee God; This appeareth vnto mee not onely impious but horrible in the Church of Rome, which teacheth that a mortall Man eateth his Creator.</p>
               <p>These reasons with many more hindred my Iourney to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to take my Baptisme from that Church or Ministers thereof, who teach, thinges so repugnant to the worde of God.</p>
               <p>Neither would I ioyne my selfe to the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> my reason was; Because they deny the true humane Body of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, saying, hee tooke no part of the Flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; But onely past through her Body as water through a conduit, without participating of any of the substance. And so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently sinning against the Article of our Beliefe, which saith that hee was borue of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> so that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his Humanity, they make him not alike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in all thinges, <hi>Sinne excepted:</hi> as the Apostle hath auerred him.</p>
               <p>I therefore vtterly renouncing all Impieties, and all Doctrines contrary to the word of God, imbrace the holy Christian Faith, to liue and dye according to Gods holy word, not the traditions of men. For which cause, I know I shall bee abandoned of Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters, and hated of all my Nation for the Blessed name of Christ, who hath Prophesied, that the Father shall bee against the Sonne, and the Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19942:13"/>But that threatning of his doth astonish mee, when he saith; <hi>Hee</hi> that shall loue Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of mee, and hee that shall deny me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in Heauen.</p>
               <p>My soules desire is for those of my Nation, that it would please God in the bowels of his great mercy, to take from them the vale that hideth the Truth from them, to open their eyes, to change their blinde zeale which is without vnderstanding, and to bee as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them, as to me hee hath bin, to the end they bee not condemned before the Throne of his Maiesty, that they may cease to Blaspheme his holy Name! O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them O Lord, that are the lost Sheepe of Israel, for thou hast not forsaken thy people for euer; There are amongst them many that haue not bended their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore O Lord conuert them, that are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, not looking vpon them in thy Iustice, but in thy great Mercy, for thine owne sake, for thine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for thy Couenants sake, to the end thy Name may be euerlasting Blessed. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Welbeloued Christians, whome I beleeue to be the assembly of the Faithfull, and of the house of God, I am heartily sorry that I cannot in your owne Tongue, make knowne to you this my Confession, I haue writ it in the <hi>Siriacke,</hi> and it is translated in my name into your Language. I protest, not onely before you, but before God, that knowes the secrets of all hearts, and heares this my protestation, that his Grace assisting me, I will liue and dye a Christian, and so bee it vnto me in his great day of Iudgement, as I beleeue what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

before his holy Assembly, whome I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech that in Christian charity they would receiue me for a member of them, as one of the Disperced sheepe of the house of <hi>Israell,</hi> and that my name may bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your memories, as I verily beleeue God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistered it, in his Booke of Eternall Life. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>27. And this is my Couenants to them, when I shall take away their Sinnes.</p>
