            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LIeutenant General <hi>Ginckell,</hi> Commander in Chief of Their Majeſties Forces, with fiſteen Battalions of Foot, and nineteen Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, being that part of Their Majeſties Army that Rendezvouſed at <hi>Mullingar,</hi> march'd from thence on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the ſixth inſtant towards <hi>Ballimore,</hi> and arrived there on the ſeventh, and immediatly beat the Enemy out of the Hedges they had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of without, into the Fort, a Serjeant and fifteen Men, who were in a ſmall Tower, half a quarter of a Mile from the Garriſon, only excepted, who had the impudence, after all Communication was cut off from him, to force his Men to Fire, and kill'd two of ours; for which, as ſoon as it was taken, he was hanged.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning the eight, the Batteries being finiſhed, began to Fire at the Fort about Sun-riſing; about eight a Clock, the General ſent a Summons to the Governour, <hi>That if he did not deliver up the Place within two hours, he ſhould have the ſame Treatment his Serjeant met with;</hi> but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Meſſage, (as the Governour ſaid afterwards) he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an Anſwer to the General's Satisfaction. Upon which he Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Batteries to continue firing, and they did it with ſuch good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that two Breaches were made, one in the outermoſt Fort next the Town, and the other on the Works within the Iſland, ſo that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Storm it the next morning when the Tinn-Boats came up, four other Boats being put into the Water, put the Enemy into a mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, all the Iſland to the Lough-ſide being altogether Unfortified. About twelve a Clock they continually held out White Flags, but were not hearkned unto till about ſeven in the Evening, when they left off Firing, and then we did the like. And after ſome Parly, Colonel <hi>Vlick Bourke,</hi> the Governor and ſeveral Officers came out to the General, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſubmit upon Diſcretion; About nine a Clock the General went into the Fort, where were found alive four Field Officers, ſixteen Captains, fourteen Lieutenants, twelve Enſigns and Cornets, five Quartermaſters, Chaplains, Store-keepers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeven hundred and eighty private Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, two hundred and fifty nine Rapparies, who were all well Armed, ſix hundred and forty five Women, and Children innumerable; and are to be brought Priſoners to <hi>Dublin.</hi> We loſt in this Action but eight Men, and kill'd of the Enemy about one hundred and fifty.</p>
