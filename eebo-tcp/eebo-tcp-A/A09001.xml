            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

assembly (brethren in
the Lorde and Sauiour
Iesus Christ most dearely
beloued) is alredye vnto
you so wel knowne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall not neede
therevpon to vse many wordes: but on
the other side, the speciall points here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
offered to our considerations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the iust cause that wee (euen we
Cambridge-men) haue to weepe and
waile, I feare that a greate sorce,
throughe want of skill, feele not, and
many moe, (blindely ledd with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
peeuish rancour and festured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice)
throughly consider not.</p>
            <p>To mourne and weepe for the death
of a good and godly man, so far foorth
as concerneth him, we are flatly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
both by reason and also by nature:
I meane, that reason which is right,
and that nature which is sinceare, not
corrupted. Yea, it is directly against
the rules both of Charity and Faith.
For, if Heathen Philosophers, (not
knowing god aright, &amp; void of that hope
which wee dayly haue before our eyes,
and whiche, so manye of vs as liue
<pb facs="tcp:10512:4"/>
in Christ, doe earnestly thirst after, and
dayly long for) deemed by reason, that
death was not to be bewailed: and if
they could agree among themselues in
opinion, that nature might lawfully
call for, &amp; redemaund that, whereof she
had graunted to vs, the vse, but for a
while: what an absurd thing were it,
if wee in this so great light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
beeing so vndoubtedly perswaded
of such sure and manifest promises of
most blessed state after this life by the
benefite of our Redeemer, should not
aswell as they, thinke it to stand with
reason and equitie? Yea, worthilye
were wee to be reprooued, if we should
but onely match them, and not rather
far surmount them in this point, and by
faith vnderstand how that we are so far
from hauing any cause of sorrowing,
that we rather ought more then can be
vttered, to reioyce for them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
cheir felicitie, whereunto we
hope also to come our selues, and for the
same ought dayly to pray.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Lone enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</note> I pray you, what Ioue, or what
charity is this, to enuie our friendes
<pb facs="tcp:10512:4"/>
blessed hap, &amp; to be sory for their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and welfare? To be agreeued &amp; to
lament for their glorious exchaunge is
as though we repined, that after many
dangerous stormes and blustring tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
in the Sea of this world, they be
at length gotten to a quiet har borough
and safely ariued at the hauen of rest: or
that after a sharpe conflict &amp; long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
warre, they bee nowe at length
safely returned home, with victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their enemies.</p>
            <p>What loue can this be, to bee sorye
that our friend hauing beene long py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with grieuous &amp; languishing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
to haue now recouered his former
health? or to fret and greeue to heare
that hee whom we say we loue, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
and deliuered out of most loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
prison, where he had long lyne in
hunger and cold, fettered and chayned?
Is there any man, that can with anye
colour of reason say, that he loueth his
friend, being heire to some great lands,
if he mourne and be sory that the tyme
now approcheth, wherin his friend shal
possesse and receaue some huge summe
<pb facs="tcp:10512:5"/>
of money aud sewe out his liuerey for
the peaceable enioying of his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes
and enheritance? It is (I say)
against godly loue and against sinceare
affection, to bewaile our friends, when
they leaue the miseries of this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
lyfe, and goe to possesse a place of
rest and blisse, that shall continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it agreeth not with the
rules of faith, for a christian man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle
the dead. For, who can deny that
to be against faith, which is flatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the scriptures? And how can
that be sayed to agree with the rule of
fayth, whiche the scriptures most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye
prooue to be done by those that
haue no hope? There is such an indeui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

oure weakenesse and infirmytie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
whereof hee yealdeth somewhat
vnto our frayltie, and tollerateth some

howebeit, if the wise-man had any hope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully
to perswade &amp; effectuallye to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that which he was the willinger
of, no doubt, hee woulde rather haue
<pb facs="tcp:10512:6"/>
counsailed and aduised vs, vtterly to

            <p>Which thing we ought (doubtlesse)
to doe, if wee coulde in all our actions
haue that regard &amp; alwayes keepe that
euen hand, which we should doe if our

            <p>And true it is, that <hi>Ieremie,</hi> (being
a witnesse in this case of far more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite

in most plaine words flatly and in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitye

               <hi>Weepe not</hi> (saith

of the blessed lyfe whereinto they
were entered: and he wisely weighed
that the sooner, they finisht the course &amp;
end the race of this life, the sooner they
come to enioy their desyred rest &amp; blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
state: and therefore he woulde not
at anye hande nozzle and feede a man in
folly, by allowing or yelding any thing
to him in this so vaine frailty. This did
he see in the spirite: and the very same
is lykewise by the same spirite reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> with commandement al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vnto him, to write it for an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

heauen, deliuering a iust consideration

               <hi>Blessed are the
dead, which dye in the Lord.</hi> May this
worde <hi>(Blessed)</hi> being pronounced by
the mouth of God himselfe, be thought
to be miserable, mournefull or lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Neyther doth the Spirite deliuer
&amp; vtter these words absolutely without
any other addition, but withal he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the cause: <hi>For they henceforth</hi> (saith
the Spirite,) <hi>rest from their labours:</hi> &amp;

an other wise man:<note place="margin">Wised. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The soules of the

they are in peace.</hi> Furthermore let vs

               <hi>If we beleue that Iesus is dead

Let vs consider what these wordes doe
signifie &amp; meane, <hi>Blessed are they that
dye in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And we shall easily
<pb facs="tcp:10512:7"/>
perceiue in what sense we ought to take
this <hi>(Little)</hi> which the wise man vseth:
yea we shal quickly see, what he would
rather haue aduised &amp; vttered, if he had
not otherwise regarded &amp; respected our
weaknes. Therefore I saye, when wee
haue respect &amp; consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the party
that is dead and departed, it is both vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seemely
&amp; wicked to vse any howling or
blubbering for him, vnlesse we desire to
be accounted creatures endued rather
with beastly nature then furnished with
the vse of reason: to be deemed Heathen
people rather then true Christians: enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
caitiues then wel meaning friends:
void of hope &amp; faith, not vnderstanding
our happy estate, &amp; persons doubtful &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
of their saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rather then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
beleeuers vndoubtedly embracing
&amp; crediting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infallible worde of God,
therby as by a rule directing all &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our actions, thoughts &amp; affections, &amp;
valiantly subduing and entirely trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
ouer our imbecillity &amp; weaknes.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer some texts of scripture
seeme to confirm this opinion, &amp; to proue
&amp; allow some small mourning, &amp; again,
some vtterly &amp; altogither forbid weping
<pb facs="tcp:10512:8"/>
and lamenting, as we haue afore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
So in an other sence wee are not
onely allowed to mourne, but also are
admonished and directly commaunded
so to do. <hi>My sonne, powre foorth teares
ouer the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 38. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and begin to mourne as
if thou hadst suffered greate harme thy
selfe.</hi> Heere, the same wise man that a
little aforesaid, <hi>Make small weeping for
the deade,</hi> seemeth in this place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
vs to weepe, not a little, nor for a
while: but to continue lamentations,
and to powre foorth teares for a long
season. God forbid that we should think
so holy a man, (inuested with the tytle
of a wiseman) should in one &amp; the selfe-same
booke disagree with himselfe in
opinions and sentences, (albeit they be
set downe in seuerall Chapters) and to
enioyne and commaund things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and repugnant one to an other. We
must therefore assay and tyre, whether
we can find out his very meaning.</p>
            <p>But if he himselfe doe expound and
interpret his owne words, we may then
boldly and safely without danger sticke
to his iudgement. In this verye sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb facs="tcp:10512:8"/>
where he thus writeth. <hi>Make
small weeping for the dead, for hee is at
rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 22. 11.</note> he also saith, <hi>Weepe for the dead,
for he hath lost the light.</hi> To make him
therefore to agree with himselfe, this
must needes bee his meaning: that, as
in respect of the party deceased, it is not
lawfull to weepe and lament, for that,
he enioyeth blisse, and is at rest: so, on
the other side, namely in respecte of
our selues, that are berest the company,
sight and comfort of his vertuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
godly life and excellent learning,
we haue most iust and vrgent cause not
onely to lament &amp; bee sorie, but euen for
a long space to continue the same our
griefe and moane, as hauing receiued
some great losse &amp; hinderance vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable.
And the brighter &amp; clearer that
the light was, when it gaue shine, and
the neeedefuller &amp; expedienter that the
same was for our behoofe and benefite,
so much the more cause and matter is
there ministred to our lamentation and
mourning, by the wofuller considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the losse receaued.</p>
            <p>Such a kind of light is there nowe
<pb facs="tcp:10512:9"/>

            <p>One example fitlie seruinge to this

Call to your remembrance
that rebellious, obstinate, murmuring,

ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god set that excellent man
Moses, to be their Captaine &amp; Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And that I may omit &amp; not speak

Gouernor <hi>Moses</hi> was prest &amp; ready by
prayer &amp; intercession to reconcile God
vnto them &amp; to turne away his plagues
from them: for whose sake &amp; at whose
suite their misdeedes were often forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
&amp; their offences pardoned: how wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy
a Gouernor he was, how notabe a

himselfe vnto them, the whole course
of his dealinges, the whole race of
his lyfe, and the whole manner of his
proceedings, during the time of his rule
&amp; gouernment doth sufficiently declare.
And yet against him being so worthy &amp;
so noble a Prince, &amp; appointed of god to
them for their great comfort, and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
commodity, did <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and
<hi>Abiram</hi> maliciously conspire,<note place="margin">Num. 16. 3.</note> and him
rebelliouslye despise, shaking of the
yoke of obedience, and moste vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye

by him they bountifully enioyed.</p>
            <p>But how seuerelye, how strangely and
<pb facs="tcp:10512:12"/>
dreadfullye did the Lorde God reuenge
that thir so mutynous reuolt and vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

her mouth, and swallowe them vp,
with their tabernacles, and familyes

as yet they seditiously persisted in their

Malcontents, against so worthie a

            <p>God so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly &amp; terribly reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged this

<pb facs="tcp:10512:13"/>
meaning by such a kind of punishment
to make them more thankfull, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contented with this benefite. But
when almighty God saw that all these
punishments would not serue to bring
them to amendment, nor to stur them
vp to their dutifull thankefullnesse, and
obedient behauiour; after many assaies
and waies practised and wrought for
their recouery, he was at length driuen
in his heauy indignation to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to an other course, and to proceede
further. And what course was that:
Forsooth, for their sins and wickednes,
he shortned the life of <hi>Moses,</hi> and would
not, that by him they should be brought
into the land of promise. <hi>Moses</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dyed, before they had set one foote
therin. But how profitable had it beene
for them; if hee had remained aliue,
considering his graue wisedome, and
ripe iudgement, wherein by reason of
his great practise and long experience
hee singularlye excelled? Howe fitte
a man had hee beene, by reason of his
Sanctytye and holinesse of lyfe, and
of his vertuous dealinges and godlye
<pb facs="tcp:10512:13"/>
cogitations to turne awaye the wrath
of GOD, iustlye conceiued against
them: What an helpe, furtherance,
and direction, moreouer mighte hee
haue beene to them, after they had
beene once entered and come into the
Lande, touchinge their Sacrifices,
Rytes and Ceremonies, which hee ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by worde of mouthe, or by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
written, had lefte amonge
them.</p>
            <p>How necessarie in all respectes was
this reuerend Doctor <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> to
the Church of Christ, being a man so
notablye furnished &amp; so exquisitely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
to the aduauncement of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
and true religion of God? And yet
notwithstanding, God hath taken him
away from amonge vs: the lyght that
was in him, hee hath quenched: and
would not that we should bee shrowded
any longer vnder his winges, or priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
vnder his shadowe: reputing vs
people most vnworthy, to be so much as
the leaste partakers of suche surpassing
benefites.</p>
            <p>And if (as it is indeede) the greater
<pb facs="tcp:10512:14"/>
greater the sinne is, the greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is there vnto due, and the sharper
smart it deserueth: then shall it bee no
hard matter to iudge, among what sort
of punishment this is nowe to be recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that this time so good a pastor is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

quenched, and such a lighte put oute, as
while wee enioyed, wee safely walked
thoroughe the daungerous and darke
pathes of this life. Lette vs diligently
waighe and effectuallye consider these
thinges (dearely beloued) and beeinge

of God, as the Isralites were, lette vs
learne to acknoweledge the wrathe of
God, and receyue it as an vndoubted

            <p>We haue heertofore shewed our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

did) the heauie wrath and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
hand of God for the same, and may
<pb facs="tcp:10512:14"/>
perceiue how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he euidently punisheth
vs therefore. We haue bene heretofore
vngratefull, and repyning for the light
that wee receyued from this excellent
and worthy Doctor: now is it therefore
put out and quenched. It is sayde, that
hee liued heere amonge thankelesse,
crabbed, and frowarde sinners: nowe
therefore is he taken awaye from them.
As for him-selfe hee liude still: but soe,
that hee liueth in ioye and blisse with
God, and is hence dispatched and freed
from the toylesome greiues, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
troubles of this life, &amp; from those
paynefull labours which hee heere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye
suffered and patyentelye endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for oure beehoofe and benefytte,
but nowe is he at rest with GOD,
to his owne beehoofe, comforte and
commodytye. GOD looueth him
in that hee hasted soe soone to call
hym awaye oute of the companye of
wicked Sinners. But hee is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye
with vs, in that he thinketh vs
inworthye any longer to enioye such
a precious piller.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10512:15"/>
If these thinges being thus duely &amp;
diligently considered can nothing at all
moue vs (wherwith (notwithstanding)
I knowe, that euery godly person is &amp;
will be not a little touched) yet is there
greater cause to drawe vs, heauilie and
sorowfully to take this misfortune: not
in suche sorte lamenting and sorowing,
for him that is deade (as hath bene said
before) as though death had done to him
any harme, but in applying and transla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
the whole cause of our sorowe and
greife vnto our owne selues, according
to that saying of our Lord &amp; Sauioure
Christ, who would not haue the <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solimitanes</hi>
to mourne for him, but for
themselues and their children.<note place="margin">Luc. 23. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Hierusalem</hi> (sayth he) <hi>weepe not
for me, but weepe for your selues and for
youre children.</hi> And hee there yeldeth a
reason why they should weepe for them
selues &amp; their children. <hi>For</hi> (sayth he)
<hi>if they doe this to the greene tree, what
shalbe done to the drie?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let euery one of vs now here present
note well this sentence, and loke wel to
himselfe: let euerye one of vs (I saye)
<pb facs="tcp:10512:15"/>
thinke well of this matter, &amp; vpon this
occasion heere presently offered by the
death and departure of this graue and
reuerend Father, let him be mooued to
feare. For, if by the secrete and hidden
(but yet iust) iudgment of almighty god
we see and heare suche heauye sentence
pronounced against his owne familie &amp;
haushold, that he threateneth to abridge
their life, and shorten their dayes, howe
neere at hand is the end of them which
beleeue not the Gospel? If his life were
shortened, whom while hee heere liued,
the Lorde so entirelye loued, beeing the
beautie of his house, &amp; in the building,
repayring and euery way garnishinge
whereof, he shewed himselfe a most dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and paynefull builder, and a most
wise and cunning maister workman: if
(I say) his daies were cut shorte, to the
end he mighte rest from his vehemente
toyle and zealous studie, which hee had
toward the promoting and aduauncing
the lordes building: how commeth it to
passe, that we, (we I say) u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nful caitiues
do promise to oure selues longe life, and
thinke here to liue many yeares, spend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:10512:16"/>
and bestowing the same (as some
doe) in idlenesse, vanitye and loytring:
Whereby it must needes come to passe,
and necessarily follow, that they cannot
be saide to liue ouerwise, then by the
spoyles of the goodes and Patrimonye
of Christ crucified.</p>
            <p>Some there be, that deuise all the
waies they can, and seeke all meanes
possible, to the vttermost of their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to deface the beautye &amp; glory of this
building, to vndermine the walles and
ouerthrow the foundation therof, that
all the wilde beastes of the woode, may
freely enter, to deuoure; spoyle, robbe
and moste cruellye to make hauocke
of all.</p>
            <p>If this greene Tree which yelded
plentifull store of fruite in due season,
and which was planted by the riuers
side, and moystened with the liuelye
waters of the Fountaine of lyfe, and
which brought foorth such continuall,
heauenly and durable fruict, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

imitated, was (notwithstanding his
flourishing and fruitfull encrease) pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
