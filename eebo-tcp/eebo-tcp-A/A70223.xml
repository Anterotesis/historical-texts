            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>
                     <p>A form of Speech this is which implieth often Difficulties in the buſineſs; and ſometimes Impoſſibility; difficult where the Parties to be reconciled are froward, and ſelf-willed Enemies to Peace in <hi>Davids</hi> language. Impoſſibility where no Agreement will be had, without loſs of a good Conſcience: Where Gods Honour, or the adminiſtration of Juſtice, or the diſcharge of our calling lieth at ſtake, ſo that we cannot have Peace with men, unleſs we be irreligious, unjuſt or unfaithful. In the former caſe where Peace is only difficult; that ſhould ſtir up our dilgence the rather; endeavour with ſo much the more Patience and unwearied Induſtry to overcome the frowardneſs of thoſe we have to deal with; and where ſo precious a Jewel as Peace is to be compaſſed, with expence of our labour or our ſubſtance, there ſpare for no coſt or pains. But where it is impoſſible to a Servant of God, where nothing will do it but the ſale of a good Conſcience, there rouſe up our courage, and prefer not outward Peace before inward; mens contentment, or our own temporal commodity or ſafety, before Gods Honour, our Souls quiet and the publick good. But it will here be demanded, How we may know when Peace is poſſible, when not: Six caſes are mentioned by ſome Divines, ye may referr them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94429:7"/>to the three heads aforenamed, of Religion, Juſtice, and Faithfulneſs in our calling. Of Religion firſt. God himſelf (in caſe his publick Worſhip be indangered) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us flatly to break the Peace. <hi>If thy Brother the ſon of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy boſom, or thy friend, which is as thine own Soul, entice thee ſecretly, ſaying, Let us go and Serve other Gods which thou ſhalt not know,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine eye pitty him: Thou ſhalt not ſpare, nor conceal him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thy hand ſhall be firſt upon him, and afterward the hand of all the People,</hi> Deut. 13.6. Thus ye are to underſtand it in caſe of Temptation to manifeſt Idolatry, <hi>(and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is clearly prov'd to be Idolatry)</hi> Blaſphemy, Hereſie or Apoſtacy from the true Faith and Worſhip of God: we can have no Peace, nay, we can have no Mercy; we are not allowed to ſpare and conceal the party ſo tempting us, but deliver him up to juſt Puniſhment, be he never ſo near, or dear to us. Secondly, where our ſelves are Perſecuted for Religion, or Vertue, or Obedience to Gods Law in any kind, and there is no way of ſatisfying our Perſecutors, or delivering our ſelves from trouble, but by denying our Faith, yielding up our Vertue, or violating our Obedience to Gods Commandments. In theſe two caſes, the one offenſive, the other defenſive; for preſervation of our Religion, and our Duty to God, no Peace poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Two other caſes follow, which belong to Juſtice. One where we are paſſive, or thoſe who are one with us: and we are violently aſſaulted contrary to Law and Equity. We may then break the Peace for our own Preſervation, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, ſo we do it <hi>Cum moderamine inculpatae tutelae,</hi> go not beyond what is needful to our honeſt defence, or theirs who depend on us, as our Wives, Children or Family. The like holds when we are violently handled, becauſe we will not joyn with others in breaking Peace, and trampling down Juſtice. <hi>Caſt in thy lot among us: We will find all precious ſubſtance, and fill our Houſes with spoil,</hi> Prov. 1.13. Thus where in defence of Juſtice to our ſelves, and our own private, being Innocent, and againſt wrongful Authority, our Lot is to be paſſive. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe may fall out, wherein it becomes us to be active, though our ſelves, in our particular Intereſt ſuffer not: and that is, where we ſee our innocent neighbours wrongfully abuſed, and diſtreſſed to extremity by lawleſs hands; we may there riſe up in reſcue of oppreſſed Innocence, and do as much in our neighbours caſe, as we would wiſh done in our own. Thus <hi>Lot</hi> reſiſted the <hi>Sodomites</hi> in behalf of the Angels whom they Invaded with violence: And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuccoured the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſtriving with the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> Exod. 2.12. And thus every good man, armed with wealth and power, may, and ought to ſtand up in defence of the poor Widow and fatherleſs, againſt their tyrannous oppreſſors. Nor are they breakers of the Peace in ſo doing; but theſe cruel grinders of the Poor whom they reſiſt.</p>

                        <hi>MAſter Speaker,</hi> he is a great ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who knows not that this Kingdom hath long laboured under many and great Oppreſſions, both in Religion and Liberty: and his acquaintance here is not great, or his ingenuity leſs, who doth not both know and acknowledge that a great, if not a principal cauſe of both theſe have been ſome Biſhops and their adherents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> a little ſearch will ſerve to find them to have been the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Unity, under pretence of Uniformity, to have brought in Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Scandal, under the titles of Reverence and Decency; to have defil'd our Church, by adorning our Churches; to have ſlackned the ſtrictneſs of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was formerly between us and thoſe of our Religion beyond the Sea; an action as unpolitick as ungodly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> we ſhall find them to have Tith'd Mint and Aniſe, and have left undone the weightier works of the Law; to have been leſs eager upon thoſe who damn our Church, than upon thoſe who upon weak Conſcience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as weak reaſons (the diſlike of ſome commanded Garment, or ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded poſture) onely abſtained from it. Nay, it hath been more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for men to go to ſome neighbours Pariſh, when they had no Sermon in their own, than to be obſtinate and perpetual Recuſants; while Maſſes have been ſaid in ſecurity, a Conventicle hath been a crime, and which is yet more, the conforming to Ceremonies hath been more exacted than the conforming to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94429:11"/>and whileſt men for Scruples have been undone, for attempts upon <hi>Sodomy</hi> they have onely been admoniſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> we ſhall find them to have been like the Hen in <hi>Aeſop,</hi> which laying every day an Egg upon ſuch a proportion of Barly, her Miſtreſs increaſing her proportion in hope ſhe would encreaſe her eggs, ſhe grew ſo ſat upon that addition, that ſhe never laid more: ſo though at firſt their Preaching was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their preferment, they after made their Preferment the occaſion of their not Preaching.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> we ſhall find them to have reſembled another Fable, the Dog in the manger; to have neither Preached themſelves, nor employ'd thoſe that ſhould, nor ſuffered thoſe that would: to have brought in Catechiſing only to thruſt out Preaching, cryed down Lectures by the name of Factions, either becauſe their Induſtry in that Duty appeared a reproof to their neglect of it, (not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that we read of him, who in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time and <hi>Tacitus</hi> his ſtory was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe by his Vertue he did appear <hi>Exprobrare vitia Principis</hi>) or with intention to have brought in darkneſs, that they might the eaſier ſowe their tares, while it was night; and by that Introduction of Ignorance, introduce the better that Religion which accompts it the Mother of devotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> in this they have abuſed his Majeſty, as well as his people, for when they had with great wiſdom (ſince uſually the Children of darkneſs are wiſer in their generation than the Children of light; I may gueſs not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome eye upon the moſt politick action of the moſt politick Church) ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on both parts thoſe Opinions which have often tormented the Church, and have, and will alway trouble the Schools, they made uſe of this declaration to tye up one ſide, and let the other looſe, whereas they ought either in diſcretion to have been equally reſtrained, or in juſtice to have been equally tolerated. And it is obſervable, that that party to which they gave this Licenſe, was that whoſe Doctrine, though it were not contrary to Law, was contrary to Cuſtom, and for a long while in this Kingdom was no oftner Preached than recanted.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> that as ſome ill Miniſters in our State firſt took away our Money from us, and after endeavoured to make our Money not worth the taking, by turning it into Braſs by a kind of <hi>Antiphiloſophers-ſtone;</hi> ſo theſe men uſed us in the point of Preaching, firſt depreſſing it to their power, and next labouring to make it ſuch, as the harm had not been much if it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; the moſt frequent Subjects even in the moſt ſacred Auditories, being the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Biſhops and Tithes, the Sacredneſs of the Clergy, the Sacriledge of Impropriations, the demoliſhing of Puritaniſm and propriety, the building of the Prerogative at <hi>Pauls,</hi> the introduction of ſuch Doctrines, as admitting them true, the truth would not recompenſe the ſcandal; or of ſuch as were ſo far falſe, that as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> ſays of the Caſuiſts, their buſineſs was not to keep men from ſinning, but to inform them <hi>Quàm propè ad peccatum ſine peccato liceat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere:</hi> ſo it ſeemed their work was to try how much of a Papiſt might be brought in without Popery, and to deſtroy as much as they could of the Goſpel, without bringing themſelves into danger of being deſtroyed by the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> to go yet further, ſome of them have ſo induſtriouſly labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deduce themſelves from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they have given great ſuſpition that in gratitude they deſire to return thither, or at leaſt to meet it half way: Some have evidently labour'd to bring in an <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though not a <hi>Roman</hi> Popery: I mean not only the outſide and dreſs of it, but equally abſolute; a blind depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the People upon the Clergy, and of the Clergy upon themſelves; and have oppoſed the Papacy beyond the Sea, that they might ſettle one beyond the water. Nay, common Fame is more than ordinary falſe, if none of them have found a way to reconcile the Opinions of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Preferments of <hi>England;</hi> and be ſo abſolutely, directly and cordially Papiſts, that it is all that fifteen hundred pounds a year can do to keep them from confeſſing it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> I come now to ſpeak of our Liberties; and conſidering the great Intereſt theſe men have had in our common Maſter, and conſidering how great a good to us, they might have made that Intereſt in him, if they would have uſed it to have informed him of our general Sufferings; and conſidering how little of their freedom of Speech at <hi>Whitehall</hi> might have ſaved us a great
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94429:12"/>deal of the uſe we have now of it in the Parliament-houſe, their not doing this alone were occaſion enough for us to accuſe them as the betrayers, though not as the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Rights and Liberties: Though, I confeſs, if they had been onely ſilent in this particular, I had been ſilent too; But, alas, they whoſe Anceſtors in the darkeſt times excommunicated the breakers of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> did now by themſelves, and their adherents, both write, preach, plot, and act againſt it, by encouraging Doctor <hi>Beal,</hi> by preferring Doctor <hi>Mannering,</hi> appearing forward for Monopolies and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money: and if any were ſlow and backward to comply, blaſting both them and their Preferment with utmoſt expreſſion of their hatred, the title of <hi>Puritans.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> we ſhall find ſome of them to have labour'd to exclude both all perſons and all cauſes of the Clergy, from the ordinary Juriſdiction of the temporal Magiſtrate, and by hindring prohibitions (firſt by apparent power againſt the Judges, and after by ſecret agreements with them) to have taken away the only legal bound to their arbitrary power, and made as it were a conqueſt upon the common Law of the Land, which is our common Inheritance; and after made uſe of that power to turn their Brethren out of their Free-holds, for not doing that which no Law of man required them to do; and which (in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the Law of God required of them not to do.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Kings Oath is not only to Rule according to Law, but to make new, and abrogate old Laws, which cannot be without a Parliament; therefore Parliament; therefore Parliaments are a <hi>Fundamental and Vital part,</hi> and conſtitution of the Government.</p>
               <p>
