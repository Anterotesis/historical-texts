            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I beg thy great Mercy, because thy lesser mercies will not doe the turne, which my miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition requires. For they may ease me of lesser mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,

of afflictions in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of distresses in estate, of other incumbrances in the world; but it is thy larger Mercy that must forgiue, not my lesser on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but my greater sinnes, which haue prouoked thy iust and heauy indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against me.</p>
               <p>Thy wayes, O God, are not as mans wayes, nor thy mercies, as mans mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

will forbeare to demand the debt, yet will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the Bond; hee will keepe that, to curbe his debtor, vpon all occasions.

I striue to expresse one and the same thing in diuers words or phrases; great mercy, and a multitude of mercies, being all one in sence and meaning: for great mercy comprehends

               <p>The greatest mercy, that the greatest person can doe to the most miserable wretch vpon earth, is not to bee compared to the least of thy mercies, which thou affoordest to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest man that liues, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the infinite dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that is betweene the Offendor and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the Creator of Heauen and earth, and dust and ashes.

               <p>For to deny expressely, or tacitly, thy science and wisdome (who art all eye, and wisdome it selfe) is to deny thy very essence and being. Whereupon, my soule euen melteth within me, and resolueth it selfe

into teares, to thinke that I could bee so impudently bold, and insolently care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as in thy sight and presence (thogh none else beheld) to commit such foule and vgly offences.</p>

               <p>A franke and sincere confession, (such as this) is a full and direct conuiction in it selfe, and of it selfe, in courts held vpon earth,<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> and before men, <hi>in foro fori,</hi> (as the Lawyers speake.)

               <p>The Church is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the name of <hi>Sion. Sion</hi> the holy Mountaine in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which thou louest, from whence thy lawe should come, and where thou wilt dwell for euer. <hi>Iehouah</hi> hath chosen
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:26402:176"/>
                  <hi>Sion,</hi> and desired it for his<note place="margin">Psal. 132. 14.</note> seate, and said, <hi>This is my rest, here will I sit, euen to perpetuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, I acknowledge my selfe tyed by a speciall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to pray for <hi>Sion:</hi> for there was no let, on my part, but that the whole kingdome of thy Christ might haue fallen to the ground; for, I being raised from the dunghill, to the Diadem; from the Parke, to the Pallace; from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Ewes great with young, to feede thy people, and anoynted King, to the end I should gather thy Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by my Apostasie haue scattered and wasted it, so

farre forth as there is great cause to feare the vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and desolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore by force, and in remorse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I beg for the susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and preseruation of thy Church, through thy free and vndeserued mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Thou, O Lord, art the onely founder of this choise Company and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. As out of thy loue onely thou didst sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and select them from other refuse people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world, as by the same loue thou hast supported and preserued them (amids all dangers and disasters) euer sithence; so, I beseech thee
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:26402:177"/>
still to continue thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, accustomed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate fauour to them. Let not my vnhappinesse impeach their happinesse; let not the darke and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy mists of my wickednes, ecclipse the light and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of thy countenance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; let them be still as deare vnto thee as the apple of thine owne eye; doe not spill them for my faults, but spare mee and them for thine owne sake.</p>
               <p>Thou doest often, and mayest alwaies punish the people for the sins of their Princes. Wherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee not onely to pardon my sins to my selfe, but to be fauourable to my
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:26402:177"/>
people also, and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to smart, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for my offences.</p>
               <p>It is I that haue sinned and done euill indeed, but as for these sheepe, what haue they done? let thine hand bee on mee, and my Fathers house, but not on thy people, that they should bee plagued. Let not the contagion of my corruption spread vnto them, let not the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I (their head) haue deserued, fall vpon their heads; be fauourable to them, howsoeuer thou be displeased with me.</p>
               <p>I doe acknowledge, that looke how farre Kings do exceed other men in place and dignity; so farre doe

their sinnes surpasse other mens sinnes in quality. Their sinnes, though lesse in their owne nature, are greater by reason of their persons, they are crying, capitall, and sinning sinnes. Wherfore it behooues me to repent more deepely to pray more earnestly, not onely for my selfe, but for my people also, whom I haue scandalized by my ill example, and exposed, as much as in mee lay, to thy heauiest venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
