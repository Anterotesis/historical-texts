            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WAY to prevent the <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Iudgments of God</hi> from coming on a Kingdom, Nation or Family; Commended to the Conſciences of all Concerned.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> All you <hi>Vintners</hi> that ſell <hi>Wine,</hi> that keep <hi>Taverns</hi> or ſuch like Houſes; and all you <hi>Inn-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and you that keep <hi>Victualling-Houſes, Ale-Houſes, Strong-Water-Shops, &amp;c.</hi> ſee that you never let any Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have any <hi>more Wine, Ale, ſtrong Drink, Brandy</hi> or <hi>ſtrong Waters,</hi> or other <hi>ſtrong Liquors,</hi> than what is for their <hi>Health</hi> and their <hi>Good</hi>; in that they may praiſe God for his Good Creatures. For every <hi>Creature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Good,</hi> and ought to be received with Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>But if you do give or let Men or Women have ſo much <hi>Wine, Brandy, ſtrong Liquors, ſtrong Beer</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> till they be <hi>Drunk</hi> or to make them <hi>Drunk</hi>;</p>
            <p n="1">1. You deſtroy the good <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You deſtroy them, that have not power over their <hi>Luſts,</hi> no more than a <hi>Rat</hi> or a <hi>Swine,</hi> who will <hi>Drink</hi> till they are <hi>drunk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. You are a great cauſe of <hi>Ruining</hi> them in their <hi>Healths, Purſes</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> (their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Families</hi>) in feeding of them in their <hi>Luſts,</hi> by letting them have more than doth them good; which alſo tends to bring <hi>God's Iudgments</hi> upon you, to your <hi>own ruin</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For many when they are full of <hi>Wine, Beer</hi> or <hi>Strong Liquors,</hi> then they will cry for <hi>Muſick, Pipe</hi> and <hi>Harp,</hi> and it may be their <hi>Whores</hi> alſo: And ſo in this, you that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or allow ſuch things, are <hi>Nurſers</hi> of <hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and of your own <hi>Families</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>And alſo ſuch Men, when they are full of <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Liquors,</hi> and have deſtroyed the Creatures, by taking more than doth them good, then they are got to that height that they are ready to <hi>Quarrel</hi> and <hi>Abuſe,</hi> or <hi>Kill</hi> or <hi>Deſtroy</hi> one another; &amp; ſometimes <hi>Kill</hi> other People (who do them no harm) as they are <hi>walking</hi> or <hi>travelling</hi> in the <hi>Streets</hi> or <hi>High-ways.</hi> For when they are overcome by <hi>ſtrong Liquors,</hi> then are they fit &amp; do ly open to all manner of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>And though you think by ſelling or letting People have <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Liquors</hi> more than doth them good, or is for their Health, <hi>The more they Drink, the more Gain you think it brings you; and the more you vend your Goods, the more Profit you get</hi>: Ah poor <hi>Sellers!</hi> Do not you think, that God with his all-ſeeing Eye doth behold you and your Actions? And cannot the Lord ſoon bring a <hi>Blaſting</hi> upon all your Undertakings and ſuch <hi>Vngodly Gain</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> and whatſoever you have gained by your <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs</hi> and from the <hi>Luſts</hi> of others, through which they do deſtroy their <hi>Eſtates, Children</hi> &amp; <hi>Families?</hi> Will not this bring <hi>deſtruction</hi> upon you and your <hi>unrighteous Gain,</hi> which you have gotten by feeding their <hi>Luſts?</hi> For that which feeds the <hi>Deſtroying Luſts,</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>Deſtroyer</hi>; and the <hi>Profit</hi> of <hi>that</hi> will not be <hi>Gain</hi> to <hi>you</hi> in the end.</p>
            <p>For are not you ſenſible, how many, after they have ſpent their <hi>Eſtates</hi> or part of them, they will <hi>run</hi> into <hi>your Debts</hi> for <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>ſtrong Liquors,</hi> yea, ſuch as you let have more than did or doth them good? And is not this the cauſe, that many <hi>break</hi> by <hi>truſting,</hi> and other ways as before mentioned? <hi>Truſt</hi> ſhould be with that which is <hi>Truſty,</hi> which doth not <hi>Waſt</hi> or <hi>Deſtroy</hi>; and ſuch God will bleſs. And therefore take heed of letting any Man or Woman have any more <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>ſtrong Liquors,</hi> than what is for their <hi>nouriſhment, health</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See what a dreadful <hi>Wo</hi> the Lord pronounced againſt them, <hi>That riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow</hi> Strong Drink, <hi>that continue until night, till <hi>Wine</hi> inflame them: Then they call for the <hi>Harp</hi> and the <hi>Viol,</hi> the <hi>Tabret</hi> and the <hi>Pipe,</hi> &amp;c. But ſuch regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands</hi>: A ſad ſtate! <hi>Wo unto them that are Mighty to Drink Wine, and are Men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong Drink.</hi> And therefore all are to ſhun ſuch things; all are to be ſober, and to mind and fear God, that they may eſcape theſe <hi>Woes</hi>: as you may ſee in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 5.</p>
            <p>And therefore all <hi>Vintners</hi> and ſuch as <hi>ſell Wine,</hi> with <hi>Ale-Houſes, Inns</hi> and <hi>Victualing-Houſes,</hi> who ſell <hi>Ale, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>ſtrong Liquors,</hi> never let any one have any more than doth them <hi>good,</hi> and is for their <hi>health</hi> (as is ſaid before) ſo <hi>that all may eat and drink the good Creatures of God to his Praiſe and Glory</hi>; which <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Gluttons</hi> cannot, nor they who let them have the Creatures of God in exceſs or immoderately, till they are <hi>drunk</hi> and <hi>ſurfeited,</hi> for ſuch do feed themſelves without the Fear of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> Let all who go under the Name of <hi>Chriſtian Families,</hi> train up their <hi>Children</hi> in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and keep themſelves in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that they may keep all their <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Families</hi> in the <hi>Fear of God</hi>; out of all <hi>Looſneſs</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>Exceſs,</hi> and from all <hi>Drunkenneſs, Fornication, Whoredom</hi> or <hi>Vncleanneſs,</hi> and <hi>Vnrighteouſneſs,</hi> and all <hi>Vngodlyneſs</hi>; that they may keep out of all thoſe things, that diſpleaſe or diſhonour the Lord God. And do not <hi>nouriſh</hi> up the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> nor the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> nor the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi>; for if you do, you <hi>nouriſh</hi> up that which is not of God the Father. And therefore to ſhun all theſe <hi>Evils,</hi> and to depart from them, and keeping in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; this is the <hi>way to bring the Bleſſing of God</hi> upon a <hi>Land, Kingdom, Nation</hi> or <hi>Family.</hi>
