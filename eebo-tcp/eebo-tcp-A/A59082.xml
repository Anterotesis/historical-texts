            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis <hi>Book</hi> at its first <hi>Publishing,</hi> which was shortly after the
Death of <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> had the ill fortune to be
coldly received in the world, by reason of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of those times; but after <hi>K. Charles the Second</hi> was
possest of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and endeavoured to advance the <hi>Prerogative</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
its just bounds, the <hi>Book</hi> began to be much enquired after, and
lookt into by many <hi>Learned Men</hi> who were not willing to part easily
with their <hi>Birth-Rights,</hi> so that in a short time it became very scarce,
and was sold at a great rate; this occasion'd the private Reprinting
of it in the year 1672, which as soon as the Government perceived,
they Prosecuted both the <hi>Publisher</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> so violently, that
many hundreds of the <hi>Books</hi> were seized and burnt; that, and the
great want of the <hi>Book</hi> since occasioned the Reprinting of it (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Alterations</hi> or <hi>Omissions</hi>) in the year 1682, when the Press
was at liberty by reason of the ceasing of the Act for Printing, but
<hi>Prerogative</hi> then getting above the <hi>Law,</hi> it met with a new Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the <hi>Publisher</hi> was Indicted for the Reprinting of it; the
<hi>passages</hi> in it upon which the <hi>Indictment</hi> was found, were these,
Part II. Page 76. beginning Line the <hi>24th,</hi> thus, <hi>I do easily grant that</hi>
Kings <hi>have many occasions and opportunities to beguile their people; yet can
they do nothing</hi> as Kings, <hi>but what of Right they ought to do. They may call</hi>
Parliaments, <hi>but neither as often or seldom as they please, if the</hi> Statute
Laws <hi>of this Realm might take place.</hi> And, Part II. Page 148. Line 32.
<hi>And though</hi> Kings <hi>may be Chief Commanders, yet they are not the Chief
Rulers.</hi> The Prosecution went on so rigorously, that the <hi>Publisher,</hi>
tho' beyond the Seas, yet willing to try the <hi>Cause,</hi> appeared accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the constant practice of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> by his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,</hi>
but for not being personally present in the <hi>Court,</hi> (which was
then impossible) he was by the Arbitrary Power of the then <hi>Lord
Chief Justice Jefferys</hi> Out-Law'd for a <hi>Misdemeanour,</hi> and so remain'd
till this wonderful Revolution, by the wise Conduct of his Highness
the <hi>Prince of Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Books</hi> have been ever since with care and charge preserved,
for the benefit of all that are willing to know and maintain their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Birth-Rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was well known to, and owned by, the late <hi>Lord Chief Justice
Vaughan,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Executors</hi> of the Great and Learned
<hi>Mr. Selden,</hi> that the <hi>Ground-work</hi> was his, upon which <hi>Mr. Bacon</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Private Debate concerning the right of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
King</hi> to Arbitrary rule over <hi>English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
as Successor to the <hi>Norman Conquerour,</hi>
(so called) first occasioned this Discourse.
Herein I have necessarily fall'n upon the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
and <hi>Vniformity</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> of this <hi>Nation:</hi> It,
being cleared, may also serve as an <hi>Idea</hi> for them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who do mind the restitution of this shattered Frame
of Policy. for as in all other Cures, so in that of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
Government, the Original Constitution of the
Body is not lightly to be regarded; and the contemplation
of the Proportions and manners of the Nation in a small
Model, brings no less furtherance to the right apprehension
of the true nature thereof (besides the delight) than the
perusing of a Map doth to the Traveller, after a long and
tedious travel.</p>
            <p>I propound not this Discourse as a Patern drawn up to
the life of the thing, nor the thing it self as a Master-piece
for future Ages: for well I know, that Commonwealths in
their minority want not onely perfection of Strength and
Beauty, but also of Parts and Proportion; especially seeing
that their full age attaineth no further growth, than to a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of divers Forms in one. Ambition hath done much by
Discourse and Action to bring forth Absolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> out
of the Womb of Notion; but yet, like that of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher's
Stone, the issue is but wind, and the end misery
to the undertakers: And therefore more than probable it
is, that the utmost perfection of this Nether-worlds <hi>best
Government,</hi> consists in the upholding of a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:64112:4"/>
of several Interests, compounded into one tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>He that knoweth the secrets of all Mens Hearts, doth
know that my aim in this Discourse is neither at <hi>Scepter</hi> or
<hi>Crosier,</hi> nor after <hi>Popular</hi> Dotage, but that Justice and Truth
may moderate in all. This is a Vessel, I confess, ill and
weakly built, yet doth it adventure into the vast Ocean of
your Censures, Gentlemen, who are <hi>Antiquaries, Lawyers,</hi>
and <hi>Historians;</hi> any one of whom might have steered in this
course much better than my self. Had my own credit been the
fraight, I must have expected nothing less than wrack and loss
of all; but the main design of this Voyage being for discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the true nature of this <hi>Government</hi> to common view, I
shall ever account your just Censures and Contradictions (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
published with their grounds) to be my most happy
return, and as a Crown to this Work: And that my labour
hath its full reward, if others, taking advantage by my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
shall beautifie <hi>England</hi> with a more perfect and
lively Character.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe policy of the English Government, so far as is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
is (all one with Divine Providence) wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in a Vail of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Wise men;</hi> and thus
implicitely hath been delivered to the World by Historians,
who for the most part read Men, and wear their Pens in decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering
their Persons and Conditions: Some of whom, having
met with ingenious Writers, survive themselves, possibly more
famous after death than before: Others, after a miserable life
wasted, are yet more miserable in being little better than Tables
to set forth the Painters Workmanship, and to let the World
know, that their Historians are more witty than they, of whom
they wrote, were either wise or good. And thus <hi>History,</hi> that
should be a witness of Truth and Time, becomes little better
than a Parable, or rather, than a Nonsence in a fair Character,
whose best commendation is, that it is well written.</p>
            <p>Doubtless, <hi>Histories</hi> of Persons, or <hi>Lives</hi> of Men, have their
excellency in Fruit, for imitation and continuance of Fame, as a
reward of Vertue: yet will not the coacervation of these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declare the nature of a Commonwealth better than the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Body dismembered is revived by thrusting together the
Members, which cannot be without deformity. Nor will it be
denied, but many wise and good Kings and Queens of this Realm,
may justly challenge the honour of passing many excellent Laws,
albeit it is the proper work of the Representative Body to form
them; yet to no one, nor all of them, can we attribute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that Wisdom and Goodness that constituted this blessed
Frame of Government. For seldom is it seen that one Prince
buildeth upon the foundation of his Predecessor, or pursueth his
ends or aims; because as several men they have several Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Desires, and are subject to a <hi>Royal kind</hi> of self-love,
that inciteth them either to exceed former Precedents, or at least
to differ from them, that they may not seem to rule by Copy, as
insufficient of themselves, which is a kind of disparagement
to such as are above. Add hereunto, that it is not to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the wisest of our Ancestors saw the Idea of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb facs="tcp:64112:6"/>
nor was it any where in precedent but in him that
determined the same from Eternity: For as no Nation can shew
more variety and inconstancy in the Government of Princes than
this, especially for three hundred years next insuing the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
So reason cannot move imagination that these Wheels, by
divers, if not contrary motions, could ever conspire into this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of policy, were there not some <hi>primum mobile</hi> that hath
ever kept one constant motion in all.</p>
            <p>My aim therefore shall be to lay aside the consideration of Man
as much as may be, and to extract a summary view of the <hi>cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
passes</hi> of the Government of this Kingdom, and to glance at
the various <hi>Aspects</hi> of the ancient upon the modern, that so these
divers Princes, and wise Councils in their different course, may
appear to be no other than the instruments of him that is but
one, and of one mind, whose goings forth have been in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
course of Wisdom and Goodness for our selves in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
days. And herein I am encouraged, because I am not in
danger of temptation to Flattery or Spleen, nor pinched with
Penury of grounds of observation; having to do with a Nation,
than which a clearer mirour of Gods gracious Government is
not to be found amongst all the Nations and People under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

and rested upon their Priests, whom they accounted the only Secretaries
that God had on earth, feared their interdict worse than death itself, and (in
these times of uttermost darkness) held them forth to neighbouring Nations,
to instruct them into an higher excellency than that of brutish men.</p>
               <p>In their civil Government they allowed preeminence of their Magistrates
rather than Supremacy, and had many chiefs in a little room; the <hi>Romans</hi>
called them little Kings, for the greater renown of their Empire. But
others of more sobriety account them no better than Lords:<note place="margin">Caes. com. lib. 5.</note> Of liberties,
not much exceeding those of a City; and these (though in time of peace
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64112:11"/>
independant upon each other, yea perpetual Enemies, yet) in time of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

to the custom of the <hi>Germans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> as <hi>Caesar</hi> noteth. But that which
yet cleareth the matter, is the testimony of <hi>Dion</hi> in the Life of <hi>Severus</hi> the
Emperour, who expresly saith, <hi>That in</hi> Britain <hi>the People held the Helm of
Government in their own power.</hi> So as these were not Kings, nor their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Monarchical, and yet might be regular enough, considering the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that in those days overspread the world. True it is, that by a holy
man this Nation was in latter times of Barbarism,<note place="margin">Hieron.</note> called <hi>Tyrannorum gens,</hi>
the word being taken <hi>mitiori sensu,</hi> or from a common repute of excessive
cruelty, or oppression by Superiours. As touching their Cruelty, I find
no footsteps in story: Somewhat reflecteth upon their Sacrifices, as if they
offered Mans flesh;<note place="margin">Caes. com. 6.</note> but that was common to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who borrowed
their Religion from <hi>Britain;</hi> and it might be founded rather upon an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in judgment, than savageness of nature. Much less cause doth appear
of any cry of oppression upon inferiours, but rather against that; as the
multitude of Kings or Lords do manifestly witness, who being observed in
the time of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> continued in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his time and afterwards,
until in the Reign of <hi>Claudius</hi> 'tis said, that <hi>Caractacus</hi> ruled over many
Nations. For it is a certain Maxim, that though great Nations may be
upholden by power, small Territories must be maintained by justice; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, the door will be soon set open to the next passenger that comes;
especially where the people are bent to war, as these were, and therein had
attained such exquisite perfection of skill in Chariot-service, as must needs
convince us of their much experience against themselves, in regard that
to other people it was scarce known; no, nor yet to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, that
had been practised in the Wars of all Nations. And this is all that I can
produce out of story, touching the Government of <hi>Britain,</hi> before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of that light that lightneth every one that cometh into the world.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Concerning the Conversion of the BRITONS unto the Faith.</head>
               <p>IT was long before the Son of God was inwombed, and whiles as yet
Providence seemed to close only with the Jewish Nation, and to hover
over it, as a choice picked place from all the earth, that with a gracious
eye surveying the forsaken condition of other Nations, it glanced upon
this Island; both thoughts and words reflected on Isles, <hi>Isles of the Gentiles,
Isles afar off,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 42. 4. 51. 5. 60. 9. 66. 19.</note> as if amongst them the Lord of all the earth had found out
one place that should be to him as the Gemme of the ring of this Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Globe: and if the ways of future providence may be looked upon as
a gloss of those Prophecies, we must confess that this Island was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the womb thereof, long before it was manifested to the world.</p>
               <p>To recover the forgotten ways of past providence, is no less difficult,
than to search out the hidden bowels of future promises; and therefore I
shall not busie my self to find out the particular instruments that brought
Gods presence into this dark corner, but only glance at the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that it may appear we were not forgotten, nor yet lost, or least in
mind, at that time of the dispensation of this grace unto all men. I dare
not instance as <hi>Gildas,</hi> the certain time of six years; yet I may say,
that no sooner was the Scepter departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> but with a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64112:11"/>
swift pace, both it and the Law-giver came hither like an Arrow flying
through other Countries, but sticking with a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> in this Island,
(then a People rather than a Commonwealth) as if we were the onely
White that then was in God's aim. It's probable in the highest degree
that the work was done within the first Century, and very nigh about the
Apostolick times; for that in the second Century <hi>Britain</hi> was a Church
of Fame, and known to the Fathers that dwelt afar off, even to <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
and <hi>Origen,</hi> and in short time had outreached the <hi>Roman</hi> confines in
that Island,<note place="margin">Tertul. adv. Judaeos.</note> (which had cost them above two Hundred years Travel) and
was grown to the state of the first Christian Kingdom that ever was.
Unto which, if we shall allow time for the gathering and growth thereof
unto this Royal pitch, proportionable to the half of that which afterward
was spent in the like work, upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Kings, we must
in reason conclude that the work was first ordered by Apostolical dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or some of their Emissaries. Customs also do not obscurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
Ages. For before that <hi>Pius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> began to speak in the
big Language of Decrees, it was indifferent to keep <hi>Easter</hi> either upon
the day observed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or on the day according to the
Jews custom:<note place="margin">Platina de vit. Eleuthe.</note> and although the <hi>Roman</hi> Church began within fifty years
after the death of <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist, to stickle to impose their custom
upon other Churches; yet the Church of <hi>Britain</hi> conformed not to that
course by the space of five Hundred years after that time;<note place="margin">Bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

probability, that the Church was there setled in times of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
not by <hi>Roman</hi> Order, but by some other purposed Messenger.</p>
               <p>The manner yet is more remarkable; for that not onely Principalities
and Powers, and Spiritual Wickednesses in high places, (which are but
Stumbling-blocks) but also natural wisdom of the Druides (who were
Masters of the Consciences of the <hi>Britons,</hi> and their high conceit of their
excellency above the ordinary strain of men, and unto which the Cross
of Christ is meer foolishness; and above all, the deep obligement of the
People unto these their Rabbies, in a Devotion beyond the reach of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations: All these, I say) stood in the way, and rendred the people
more uncapable of any new Light. But when the time fore-set is fully
come, all Mountains are laid low, and double-folded Doors fly open;
and this Conquerour of all Nations attempts <hi>Britain,</hi> not in the Rear,
nor by undermining, but assails them in their full strength, presents in
a clear Sun-shine that one true Sacrifice of God-man; at the appearing
whereof, their shadows of many Sacrifices of mans flesh fly away. And
thus those Druides that formerly had dominion of the <hi>Britons</hi> Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
now to be helpers of their joy,<note place="margin">Origen. hom. 4. Ezek.</note> and are become the leaders of the

that Light which through Gods mercy hath continued in this Island e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

God had subdued all Nations, thereby more speedily to bring to pass his
own conquest, both of that one Head, and all its Members. The first
<hi>Caesar</hi> had entred <hi>Britain</hi> before the Incarnation, and having seen and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
it, and played his prize, returned with the same only of Conquest of
some few Lordships neighbouring to the <hi>Belgick</hi> shore;<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> and so it continued
correspondent to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or rather forgotten of them, till the time of
<hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour; who being at leisure to bethink him of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
Tribute,<note place="margin">Vit. Agric.</note> or rather aspiring to honour by a way formerly untroden
by his Ancestors, first setled Colonies in <hi>Britain,</hi> and brought it into the
form of a Province, and ingaged his Successors in a continual War to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that work, which outwearied their strength at last, and made them
forego the prey, as too heavy for the Eagle to truss and carry away.</p>
               <p>It oft befals, that things of deformed shape are nevertheless of excellent
spirit, and serve the turn best of all: and it is no less remarkable, that
this tide of <hi>Roman</hi> invasion, however it represented to the world little
other than a tumour of vain-glory in the <hi>Romans,</hi> that must needs be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to the <hi>Britons</hi> liberty and welfare: yet by over-ruling providence it
conduced so much to the <hi>Britons</hi> future glory, as it must be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the chief master-pieces of supernatural moderatorship that ever
this poor Island met with. First, he taught them to bear the yoke, to
stoop, and become tractable; for stubborn spirits must first stoop under
power, before they will stoop to instruction. But this onely in the way,
for tractableness, if good ensue not, is of it self but a disposition for evil.
Secondly, it brought into <hi>Britain</hi> the knowledge of Arts and Civility;
and questionless it was a wise policy of <hi>Agricola,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. vit. Agric.</note> to go that way to work;
for it is an easie and Royal work to govern wise men, but to govern fools
or mad-men, is a continual slavery; and thus Religion already setled in
<hi>Britain,</hi> became honoured with a train of Attendants and Handmaids.
Thirdly, they reduced the number of little Lordships nigher to the more
honourable estate of Monarchy: for the <hi>Romans,</hi> by dear experience, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no stability or assurance in what they had gotten, so long as so many
petty Kings had the rule; they wisely brought the whole into one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
(because it is much easier to govern many subordinate each to other,
than co-ordinate one with another) over which they allowed one chief, to
rule the people according to their own Laws, saving their service to the
<hi>Romans</hi> and their Lieutenants, until they were necessitated to yield up all
to the next occupant. This served the British Church with a double inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
The first, Religion spreads sooner under one uniform Government,
than under variety; and under Monarchy rightly ordered, rather than
any other Government whatsoever; albeit that other Governments may
afford it faster footing when it is entred. Secondly, <hi>Rome</hi> was a renowned
Church throughout the world for gifts and graces; and it is obvious to
conceive, that it was specially purposed by Divine Providence to make
that place a Fountain, that from thence the knowledge of Christ might
convey it self joyfully with the influence of Imperial power, as the spirits
with the Blood, into all Nations of that vast body.</p>
               <p>Above one hundred years were spent in this Provincial way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Britain,</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Lieutenants; during all which time,
Religion spread under ground, whiles the <hi>Roman</hi> power in a continual war
sprang upward. Nor is it strange that Religion should thrive in War:
the <hi>French</hi> Wars in <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time, brought much of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64112:12"/>
to <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> had no less benefit
by the wars of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth with the <hi>Italians, French</hi> and <hi>Turks:</hi> and
thus the <hi>Romans</hi> levened with the Gospel, by exchanging men with <hi>Britain,</hi>
and other mutual correspondencies, insinuated that leven by degrees, which
in the conclusion prevailed over all.</p>
               <p>For the Roman Lieutenants having gotten sure footing in <hi>Britain,</hi> stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their course with a different hand; generally they were of the Roman
stamp, seeking to kill Christ in the Cradle; and by that means Religion
met with many storms of bitter persecution, and so was compelled to bear
a low sail: but some being more debonaire, and of wiser observation, soon
found, that the way of justice and gentleness had more Force in <hi>Britain</hi>
than Arms, and so endeavoured to maintain that by moderation, which they
had gotten by labour and blood; as it is ever seen that where conquest is
in the van, gentleness follows in the rear, because no Bow can stand
long bent, but at length must give in and grow weak. And thus by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance,
the <hi>Britons</hi> got a little more scope, and Religion more encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till it became acquainted with the Roman Deputies, began to treat
with the Emperours themselves, and under the wise government of <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Emperour mounting into the British Throne, Crowned <hi>Lucius</hi> first
of all Kings with the Royal Title of a Christian.</p>
               <p>He now not so much a Vassal as a Friend and Ally to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
perceiving the Empire to be past noon, and their Lieutenants to comply
with the Christians, began to provide for future Generations, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the two grand defects of Religion and Justice, applied himself for
the establishment of both.</p>
               <p>Religion in <hi>Britain</hi> hath hitherto been for the most part maintained by
immediate influence from Heaven. No Schools, no Learning, either
maintained or desired; the want whereof, together with the persecutions
stirred up by the Emperours, especially <hi>Domitian,</hi> brought the Church to
so low an ebb, that the Sacraments ceased: for Histories tell us that <hi>Lucius</hi>
sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for relief, and that the Bishop of that place (whether <hi>Evari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
or <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) sent over Learned men to Preach and Baptize both
King and People;<note place="margin">M. Westm. an. 181.</note> and this, <hi>Rome</hi> might probably gain some Honour,
although possibly the King intended it not, or much less to acknowledg any
Authority or Power in that Church, over that of <hi>Britain.</hi> This act of
<hi>Lucius</hi> so advanced him in the opinion of Writers, that they know not when
they have said enough. Some will have him to be the instrument of the
first entry of Religion into this Isle; others, that he setled a form of
Church-government under the three Archbishops of <hi>London, York,</hi> and
<hi>Caerlion</hi> upon <hi>Vske,</hi> and 28 Bishopricks: the first of which is cried down
by many demonstrative instances; nor can it consist with the second, nor
that with it, or with the truth of other stories. For it neither can be made
out that <hi>Lucius</hi> had that large circuit within his Dominion, nor that the
title of Archbishop was in his daies known; and 'tis very improbable that
the British Church was so numerous, or that Religion in his time was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
the whole Island: nor is there any mention in any Author of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of these Archbishops, or Bishops of <hi>Britain,</hi> for the space of 200.
years after this King's reign, and yet no continual raging persecution (that
we read of) that should enforce them to obscure their profession, or hide
their heads; or if such times had been, it would have been expected that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in those daies should be in <hi>Britain,</hi> (as well as in other places) most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for gifts and graces, and pass in the forefront of persecution. But we
find no such thing; no not in the rages of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> which made the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64112:13"/>
British Church famous for Martyrs: Writers speak of <hi>Alban, Amphibalus,
Aron, Julius</hi> and a multitude of Lay-people, but do not mention one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
nor Presbyter,<note place="margin">M. Westm. an. 303.</note> nor other Clergy-man, but <hi>quendam Clericum,</hi> a man it
seems of no note, and of unknown name. In Charity therefore the English
Church in those daies must be of mean repute for outward pomp; and
to liftedup to that height of Archbishops, when as <hi>Rome</hi> it self was
content with a Bishop.</p>
               <p>Somewhat more probable it is, that is noted by Writers concerning
<hi>Lucius</hi> his endeavour to settle the Commonwealth and good Laws for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to that end did write a Letter to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for a Model of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; probably being induced thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the splendor of the state of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church and Commonwealth,
the onely Favorite of fame in those times through the Northern parts of
the World. Things afar off, I confess, are dim, and it is meet that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
should have the honour due to great after-sight: And therefore
I might think (as some of them have done) that the Epistle of <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>
to King <hi>Lucius</hi> is spurious, if I could imagine to what end any
man should hazard his wits upon such a Fiction, or if the incongruities
charged against it were incurable; but being allowed to be first written in
Latine, and then translated into British for the peoples satisfaction, and
in that Language (the Original being lost) traduced to posterity; and
then by some Latine Writer in after-ages returned into Latine, and so
derived to these times (all which very probably hath been;) such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of exceptions well arise by mistake of Translators and Transcribers
in ignorant times, and the substance nevertheless remain entire and true.
Considering therefore that the matter of that Epistle savoureth of the
purer times of the Church,<note place="margin">Cic Attic. 2.</note> and so contrary to the dregs of <hi>Romulus,</hi> I mean,
the policy, practice, and language of the Roman Clergy in these latter
ages, wherein this forgery (if so it be) was made; I must allow it to pass
for currant for the substance, not justifying the syllabical writing thereof.</p>
               <p>To others it seemeth needless and vain, that <hi>Lucius</hi> should send for a
model to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> when as the Roman Deputies and Legions at home
might have satisfied the Kings desire in that particular, or their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
might have taught them grounds sufficient, after two hundred
years converse with the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they should have little needed a model
for that which they saw continually before their view, or might have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by inquiry of their own acquaintance. But what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of rough Souldiers, concerning form of government of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?
or if some exceeded the ordinary strain in policy, yet they were too
wise to communicate such Pearls to conquered Nations, that ought to look
no higher than the will of the Conquerour, and subsist in no better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than may be controlled by the Supream Imperial Law of the Lord
<hi>Paramount;</hi> or if in this they had corresponded to the desires of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
yet being for the most part ignorant of the main, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have satisfied the expectations of a Christian King, who desires such
a Law as may befriend Religion, and wherein no man was more like to
give direction than <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who seeing a kind of enmity between
the <hi>Roman</hi>-Laws, and Christ's Kingdom, sends to the King a fair refusal
of his request, upon this ground, that <hi>Leges Romanas &amp; Caesaris semper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probare
possumus.</hi> He saw that they were not well grounded, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
refers the King to the sacred Scripture, that is truth itself. Laws that
come nighest to it are most constant, and make the Government more
easie for the Magistrate, quiet for the People, and delightful to all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64112:13"/>
mens mindes are setled in expectation of future events in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to the present rule; and changes in course of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are looked at as uncoth motions of the Celestial Bodies, portending
Judgements or Dissolution. This was the way of humane wisdom;
but God hath an eye on all this beyond all reach of pre-conceit of man,
which was to make <hi>England</hi> happy in the enjoying of a better Law and
Government than <hi>Rome,</hi> how glorious soever then it was; and to deliver
that Island from the common danger of the World; for had we once
come under the Law of the first Beast, as we were under his Power, we
had been in danger of being born Slaves under the Law of the second
Beast, as other Nations were, who cannot shake it off to this day.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucius</hi> lived not to effect this work; it was much delayed by the
evil of the times, nothing was more changeable. Then the Emperours
grew many of them so vitious, as they were a burthen to Mankind;
nor could they endure any Deputy or Lieutenant that were of better
fame than themselves had. Some of them minded the affairs of the
East, others of the North, none of them were <hi>ad omnia.</hi> And the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
in <hi>Britain,</hi> either too good for their Emperour, and so were soon
removed; or too bad for the people of the Land, and never suffered to
rest free from Tumults and Insurrections: So that neither <hi>Lucius</hi> could
prevail, nor any of his Successors; but passing through continual cross flouds
of Persecutions under <hi>Maximinus, Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Maximinianus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Civil Broiles, till the times of <hi>Constantine,</hi> at length the Haven was
attained.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Constantine</hi> having overcome <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and gotten thereby into the
highest Orb of Government in the Empire; reflected such an amiable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
upon the Churches, especially in <hi>Britain,</hi> as if he had intended to pay
to them all that God had lent him. A wise Prince he was questionless;
yet towards the Church shewed more affection; endeavouring to reduce
the Government in every place unto the Roman Prototype, and therein
added much honour to that See, especially to Pope <hi>Sylvester,</hi> whose Scholar
he had been. This may seem a sufficient inducement to perswade, that he
was the first Patron of English Prelacy, seeing we find it in no approved
testimony before that time, nor was it long after, when as the presence of
the <hi>British</hi> Bishops are found at the Synod by him called at <hi>Arles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 42.</note> viz.
the Bishops (not Arch-bishops) of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and the Bishop of
<hi>Maldune,</hi> and those in no great pomp, if the relation be true, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their poverty they were not able to undergo the charge of their
Journey and Attendance; so as it seems they had but new set up, and had
not yet found out the right way of trade that the Bishops had attained.
And thus God ordered first the setling of a Government of the Church
in <hi>Britain,</hi> and its Liberties, before the Secular part enjoyed any; therein
working with this Nation, as with a man, making him to be <hi>bonus homo</hi>
before he can be <hi>bonus civis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Britain</hi> thus set together, is wound up for motion;
they soon learned the use of Synods from that Synod at <hi>Arles,</hi> if they
had it not before: and took as much power to themselves in their Synods
as in other Countries were used, and somewhat more to boot. For they
had the hap to continue in <hi>Britain</hi> in free course, a full century of years,
before the Civil Magistrate had any other power, but what was wrapped
up under the allowance of their <hi>Romon</hi> Masters; who like, <hi>Gallio,</hi> looked
upon the Church-affairs as out of their Sphear, and therefore cared for
none of those things; or if the zeal of any See far prevailed, it was much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64112:14"/>
in favour of the Bishops, upon whom the Emperours began to dote as
Oracles; and this raised the price of the Clergy, and taught them the
way to fish for themselves. No wonder it is therefore if Synods in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
or rather the Clergy in the Synods, (which probably were then the
representative Body of the Nation) swayed all that was free from the
<hi>Roman</hi>-Magistracy, and in some things out-reached their Limits, especially
during the interim wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> held the Arms of civil Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
bound, and let the Clergy have their scope, that soon began to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient,
and conceit a new Idaea of deportment, like that of the second Beast
in its Infancy. Nor did the <hi>Britons</hi> espy their danger herein, for they
had been used to idolize their Druides, and it was no more but facing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to do as much for their Bishops.</p>
               <p>Of this power of Synods I shall propound but three Presidents, and so
draw to a Conclusion of what I think meet to note concerning the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
affairs. I supose it will not be doubted but that publick Consultations
concerning the publick Government of any Place or Nation, ought not
to be called but by the Supream Power; and that such Consultations are
to be directed by that Supream Power. The <hi>Britons</hi> had a King, and
yet without his consent they call a Synod against the Pelagian Heresie,<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 446. Beda. Lib. 1. cap. 17.</note>
and chuse a Moderator from beyond the Sea, and by that Synod not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overwhelmed the Heresie, but excommunicated their King. This
was a National Synod, and might well stand with the rule of State, which

               <p>WAsted with time, and wounded by eternal doom, the glory of the
Western Empire going down apace, now draweth nigh unto its
everlasting night; and that vast body (not able longer to subsist, but dying
by degrees) abandons this Isle of <hi>Britain</hi> its utmost limit, and last inliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64112:14"/>
to subsist alone miserably, or else to die. The choice was more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
by how much the more <hi>England</hi> was much wasted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars,
the flower of their strength spent in Forraign service, the remainder but
few, and these exceeding vicious; and which was worst of all, ingaged
by the <hi>Romans</hi> in a War with the <hi>Picts,</hi> against whom the <hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
found it too burdensome for some of them to hold out, without the
help of a Wall: and albeit that the very name of an old Servant of four
hundred years continuance, might have moved a <hi>Roman</hi> heart to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate,
yet their spirits fail, and forsaken <hi>England</hi> must now go into the
wilderness, and naked as they are, endure the brunt of the cold storms of
the Northern <hi>Picts,</hi> without any shelter but the hidden will of God then
frowning upon them. In this condition, they half desperate, seek for a cure in
reason worse than the disease. For it had been better for them to have
stooped to hard conditions with the <hi>Picts,</hi> considering they were all but one
people, and differing only by the breadth of a wall, than to call in a new
people whose qualities they were ignorant of; and at the best to make
them their companions, who might prove (as they afterwards did) both
Lords and Masters over them. But there is no reason against God's will.
The <hi>Britons</hi> needed present help,<note place="margin">Amian. l. 16.</note> they overlaid by invasions from the
<hi>Picts</hi> (who soon espied the <hi>Romans</hi> gone, and their own advantage) sent
for aid where they were most like to speed for the present, and left the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to look to it self. <hi>Ireland</hi> was nigh, but we find nothing concerning
their interest in shipping; the <hi>French</hi> Coasts were not their own men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet within the <hi>Roman Line:</hi> and none were at liberty, but such as
were never subdued by the <hi>Romans;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zossimus hist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 3.</note> only the <hi>Saxons</hi> are in the thoughts
of the <hi>Britons,</hi> a mighty people not far off, able to mate the <hi>Romans</hi> in
their chiefest pride; and though in a manner Borderers upon the <hi>Roman</hi>
world, yet unsubdued by them, used to the Wars, mighty at Sea, and now
given over by the <hi>Romans</hi> in a plain field, were at leisure, and so well knew
the way to <hi>Britain,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> intituled the Coasts of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
<hi>Suffolk</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> Coasts, from the many visits that the <hi>Saxons</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made into those parts,<note place="margin">Amian. lib. 28. 30.</note> full sore against the <hi>Romans</hi> wills.</p>
               <p>I hold it both needless and fruitless to enter into the Lists, concerning
the original of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> whether they were Natives from the Northern
parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> or the Reliques of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army under <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
But it seems their Government about the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in
the general so suitable to the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suffrid. Petrus Fris. antiquit. lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> as if not by the Reliques of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Army (which is generally agreed, emptied it self into the North)
yet by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Greece</hi> unto these Nations, it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
but much of the <hi>Grecian</hi> wisdom was derived into those parts, long
before the <hi>Romans</hi> glory was mounted up to the full pitch; and because
this wisdom could never be thus imported, but in vessels of mans flesh, rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
according to the <hi>Grecian</hi> guize, it may be well supposed, that there is
some consanguinity between the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
be not known. The people were a free people, governed by Laws,
and those made not after the manner of the <hi>Gauls</hi> (as <hi>Caesar</hi> noteth) by the
great men,<note place="margin">Caes. Com.</note> but by the people; and therefore called a free-people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are a Law to themselves, and this was a priviledge belonging
to all the <hi>Germans,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observeth, in cases of most publick conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<hi>de majoribus omnes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Histor. Germ. Plutarch. vit. Solon. &amp; Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curg.</note> like unto the manner both of the <hi>Athenians</hi>

to be strangers in Blood unto the <hi>Britons,</hi> however nigh they were in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.
That some matters of action (especially concerning the publick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64112:15"/>
safety) were by that general vote concluded and ordered, seems probably by
their manner of meeting with their weapons. But such matters as were of
less concernment,<note place="margin">Albinus Sax. 72.</note> the Councel of Lords determined <hi>de minoribus Principes,</hi>
saith the same Author. Their Country they divided into Counties or Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
all under the government of twelve Lords, like the Athenian territory
under the <hi>Archontes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xenophon.</note> These (with the other Princes) had the judicial power of
distributive justice commited to them, together with one hundred of the
Commons out of each division.<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> The Election of these Princes with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
was concluded <hi>inter majora</hi> by the general Assembly, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
their Commission in Circuits,<note place="margin">Emius.</note> like unto the <hi>Athenian</hi> Heliastick or
Subdial Court, which was rural, and for the most part kept in the open aire.
In brief, their judicial proceedings were very suitable to the <hi>Athenian,</hi> but
their military more like the <hi>Lacedomonian,</hi> whom above all others in their
manners they most resembled. In their Religion they were very devout, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that they much rested in the reverence they bare to their Priests, whom
they made the moderator of their general Assembly, their Judge, Advocate,
and Executioner in Martial Law; therein submitting to them as unto Gods
instrument. They worship an invisible and an infinite Diety; mans flesh
is their Sacrifice of highest account: and as often as they make inquiry by
lots, they do it with that solemn reverence as may put all the Christian
world to the blush, <hi>precatus Deos, caelumque suspiciens;</hi> and this done by the
Priest of the Town, if it be in publick causes, or otherwise if private, then
by the master of the Family; so as they had Family-worship as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
These things I note, that it may appear how nigh these invited guests
resemble the old Religion of the <hi>Britons,</hi> and how probable it is, that this
Island hath from time to time been no other than as a Sewer to empty the
superfluity of the German Nations;<note place="margin">Avent. Anal. Bowr. 1. 10. Beuter. in Tac. 125</note> and how the influence of these old
principles doth work in the fundamental government of this Kingdom, to
this present day. These are the instruments chosen by God, and called by
the <hi>Britons</hi> to be their deliverers from their Enemies, which they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
yet not swayed thereto by love of Justice or compassion (for if writers
say true,<note place="margin">Amian.</note> they were no better than high-way-men both by Sea and Land)
but by their love of spoil and prey, and by the displeasure of God against a
dissolute people. They profess friendship nevertheless in their first entrance;
but espying the weakness of the <hi>Britons,</hi> and feeling the strength of the
<hi>Picts,</hi> and finding the Land large and good, they soon pickt quarrels with
their Hoast, made peace with the <hi>Picts,</hi> and of fained Friends, becoming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
Foes to the <hi>Britons,</hi> scattered a poor remnant of Christians, some to
the furthest corners of the Kingdom, others into forrain Nations, like so
many Seeds men, to sow the precious Seed of Life in a savage soil. And
those few that remained behind, profiting under much misery, by their
doctrine and good example yielded better blessings unto their new-come
guests than they either expected or desired. And thus the miseries of poor
<hi>Britain</hi> became riches of mercy to the North and Eastern people; and the
ruines here, the foundations of many famous Churches else-where. Nor
yet was mercy from the <hi>Britons</hi> utterly taken away, nor their blood drawn
out to the last drop, or their name quite blotted out of the book of fame:
for whereas two things make men miserable, <hi>viz.</hi> the heaviness of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
without, and the failing of the heart within, and Gods ordinary way of
redress of the former beginneth in taking away the latter; thus dealt he
with the <hi>Britons.</hi> For in danger, as want of strength breeds fear, and that
(by extremity) despair, so despair oftentimes revives into a kind of rage
that puts strength forth beyond reason; I say beyond reason, for cause can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64112:15"/>
not be given thereof, other than Gods extraordinary dispensation in a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary
way, when he seeth the stronger to wax insolent over the weaker.
Thus the <hi>Britons</hi> fled from the <hi>Picts</hi> so long as they had any hope of relief
from the <hi>Saxons;</hi> but being become their Enemies, and pursuing them to
the low-water mark, that in all reason they must either drink or bleed their
last; then their courage revived, and by divers Victories, by the space of
200 years, God stopped the hasty Conquest of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> The result
whereof, by truces, leagues, commerce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conversation, and marriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two Nations, declared plainly that it was too late for the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to get all; their bounds being predetermined by God, and thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the world. In all which, God (taming the <hi>Britons</hi> pride by the
<hi>Saxons</hi> power, and discovering the <hi>Saxons</hi> darkness by the <hi>Britons</hi> light)
made himself Lord over both people in the conclusion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Austin's coming to the Saxons in England. His Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and Work.</head>
               <p>DUring these troublesome times, came a third party that wrought
more trouble to this Isle than either <hi>Pict</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> for it troubled
all. This was the Canonical power of the Roman Bishop, now called the
Universal Bishop. For the Roman Emperour having removed the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
residence to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> weakned the Western part of the Empire;
and exposed it not only to the forrain invasions of the <hi>Goths, Vandals,
Herules, Lombards,</hi> and other flotes of people, that about these times, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
instinct were weary of their own dwellings; but also to the rising
power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naucler. 505.</note> and purposely for his advancement. Who
by patience out-rode the storms of forrain force, and took advantage of
those publick calamitous times to insinuate deeper into the Consciences of
distressed people, that knew no other consolation in a plundred estate, but
from God and the Bishop, who was the chief in account amongst them.
The power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> thus growing in the West, made him to
out-reach not only his own Diocess and Province, but to mind a kind of
Ecclesiastical Empire, and a title according thereunto; which at length he
attained from an Emperor fitted for his turn; and that was enough to
make him pass for currant in the Empire. But <hi>Britain</hi> was forsaken by
the Roman Empire above 153 years before: So as, though the Emperor
could prefer his Chaplains Power or Honour as far as his own, which was
to the French shore; yet <hi>Britain</hi> was in another world under the <hi>Saxons</hi>
power and not worth looking after till the plundering was over, and
the <hi>Saxon</hi> affairs setled; so as some fat may be had. Then an instrument is
sought after for the work, and none is found so far fit to wind the <hi>Saxon</hi> up
to the <hi>Roman</hi> bent as a Monk, that was a holy humble man in the opinion
of all, but of those that were so in the truth, and knew him. This is <hi>Austin,</hi>
sent by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to do a work that would not be publickly owned. It
was pretended to bring Religion to the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> therefore they
give him the title of the Saxon Apostle; but to be plain, it was to bring in a
Church-policy, with a kind of worship that rendred the <hi>Latria</hi> to God, and
the <hi>Dulia</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> were not wholly distitute of Religion, and
that,<note place="margin">Greg. Epist. lib. 5. Epist. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> himself in his Letter to <hi>Brunchilda,</hi> the French Queen, confesseth,
<hi>Indicamus,</hi> saith he, <hi>ad nos pervenisse Ecclesiam Anglicanam velle fieri Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anam;</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64112:16"/>
so as there was a good disposition to Religion before ever <hi>Austin</hi> came,
and such an one as rang loud to <hi>Rome.</hi> But far more evident is it from the
<hi>Saxons</hi> keeping of Easter <hi>more Asiatico,</hi> which custom also continued after
<hi>Austins</hi> coming fifty years,<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 3. cap. 25.</note> sore against <hi>Austins</hi> will. The dispute between
<hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Wilfride</hi> bears witness to that; and it had been a miraculous
ignorance or hardness, had the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a people ordained for mercy (as the
sequel shewed) conversed with the Christian <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> above 150
years,<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 1. cap. 23.</note> without any touch of their Religion. If we then take <hi>Austin</hi> in his best
colour,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 4.</note> he might be said to bring Religion to the South-Saxons, after the
Roman garb;<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 1. cap. 27.</note> and his hottest disputes about <hi>Easter, Tonsure,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>
supremacy;<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> and his own <hi>Legatine power,</hi> and his worthy <hi>Queries</hi> to the
Pope, shew he regarded more the fashion than the thing; and the fashion
of his person, more than the work he pretended; for he loved state, and to
be somewhat like to the Legate of an Universal Bishop;<note place="margin">Greg. Epist. l. 7. Epist. 13. 7.</note> and therefore of
a Monk he suddenly becomes a Bishop in <hi>Germany,</hi> before ever he had a
Diocess,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 92.</note> or saw <hi>England;</hi> and after he perceived that his work was like to
thrive, he returned, and was made Archbishop of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> before any
other Bishops were amongst them;<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 1. cap. 29.</note> and after three years had the Pall,
with title of Supremacy over the British Bishops that never submitted to
him.</p>
               <p>His advantages were, first his entrance upon <hi>Kent,</hi> the furthest corner
of all the Island from the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and so less prejudiced by their
Church-policy; and at that very time interessed in the Roman air above
all the other <hi>Saxons:</hi> for their King had Married a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi>
one that was a pupil to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 1. cap. 25.</note> and a devout woman; she first brought <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
into acceptance with the King, who also at that present held the chief
power of all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings in this Isle,<note place="margin">Greg. Epist. lib. Epist. 59.</note> which was now of great efficacy
in this work; for where Religion and power flow from one spring to one
stream, it is hard to chuse the one, and refuse the other. And thus <hi>Rome</hi>
may thank <hi>France</hi> for the first earnest they had of all the riches of <hi>England,</hi>
and we for the first entrance of all our ensuing bondage and misery. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
had also a gift or trick of working miracles,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.</note> whether more suitable to
the working of Satan, or of God, I cannot define. It seems they walked
onely in the dark; for either the <hi>Britons</hi> saw through them, or saw them
not; nor could <hi>Austin</hi> with his miracles or finess settle one footstep of his
Church-poliy amongst them; happily they remembring the Roman
Dagon, liked the worse of the Roman woman; and the rather because the
Carriage of their Messenger was as full of the Archbishop, as it was empty
of the Christian. I would not touch upon particular passages of action,
but that it is so remarkable, that <hi>Austin</hi> himself, but a Novice in comparison
of the British Bishops (the clearest lights that the Northern parts of the
world then had, and unto whom the right hand of fellowship was due by
the Roman Canon) should nevertheless shew no more respect to them at
their first solemn entrance into his presence than to Vassals. I would not
but note the same as a strong argument that this whole work <hi>ab initio,</hi>
was but a vapour of Prelacy. This the British Bishops soon espied, and
shaped him an answer suitable to his message, the substance whereof was
afterward sent him in writing by the Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and of late published
by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64112:16"/>
BE it known (and without doubt) unto you, that we all, and
every one of us, are obedient and subject to the Church of
God, and to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to every godly Christian,
to love every one in his degree, in perfect Charity, and to help e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of them, by word and deed to be Children of God: And
other obedience than this I do not know to be due to him whom
you name to be Pope; nor by the Father of Fathers to be clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or demanded. And this obedience we are ready to give and
pay to him, and to every Christian continually. Besides, we are
under the government of the Bishop of <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>Uske,</hi> who
is to oversee under God over us, and cause us to keep the way
spiritual.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Britons</hi> resolution, and they were as good as their word;
for they maintained the liberty of their Church five hundred years after
this time; and were the last of all the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> that gave their
power to the Roman beast; and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, that came of that blood
by <hi>Teuther,</hi> the first that took away that power again. <hi>Austin</hi> having
met with this affront, and perceiving that the <hi>Britons</hi> were stronger in
their Faith than he by his Miracles, cast about to try the <hi>Saxons</hi> courtesie;
that what the <hi>Ephod</hi> could not, the Sword wrapt up therein should. I say
not that he procured, but he threatned or prophesied the destruction of the
Monks of <hi>Bangor;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> and it came to pass, and the accasion by writers loudly
suspected. Nevertheless the <hi>Saxons</hi> were not so zealous of their new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as to make a new National quarrel between the <hi>Britons</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but left the game to be played out by <hi>Austin;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil Brit. fol. 111.</note> who finding by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that it would not prove the work of one man, left it to successors
to work out by degrees in efflux of time. And thus <hi>Austin,</hi> neither good
Servant to the Servant of Servants, nor good Monk, retires to settle his
Saxon province, and to present, or rather to prostitute it to the lusts of
that red Whore; which was the general piety of those ignorant times.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Imbodying of Prelacy into the Government of this Kingdom.</head>
               <p>I Cannot think that the platform of the mystery of iniquity (when boiled
to the height) was ever fore-seen, or in the aim of the wicked spirits on
Earth, or those in Hell. Yet were they all instruments of this monstrous
birth, filled with subtilty and mischief, guided principally by occasion, and
over-ruled by the Justice and Wisdom of God, to make a yoke for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
and a scourge to the world for their refusal of the government of
Christ, until this Monster came to perfection; and wherein themselves
were <hi>feloes de se,</hi> and wrought their own mischief. For <hi>Austin</hi> coming in
as a third Proprietor with King and People, and having gathered the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
of a Church, reason told them that a form of government must be
setled in that Church. The <hi>Saxons</hi> had no principles of their own (for
they had no learning) and to go to the <hi>Britons</hi> for a pattern might be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64112:17"/>
ignoble; and where the choice is small,<note place="margin">Tacit. mor. Serm.</note> it is soon made. <hi>Rome</hi> held now
the most part of the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> at School; the <hi>Saxons</hi> soon resolve,
<hi>Rome</hi> that had been their Mother, shall be also their Father: And thus at
one draught they drank up a Potion of the whole Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> from,
the Pope to the Apparator, with a <hi>quicquid imponitur &amp; imponetur,</hi> which
was of such lasting efficacy, that it ceaseth not to work even to this day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was slow in the first operation. For the <hi>Saxons</hi> had a Common-wealth
founded in the liberty of the people; and it was a masterpiece for
<hi>Austin</hi> and the Clergy, so to work, as to remain members of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and yet retain their hearts for <hi>Rome,</hi> which was now grown
almost to the pitch of that Antichrist. For reason must needs tell them,
that the Saxon principles would not suffer them to be <hi>ad omnia</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> nor
the Roman Canon allow them to be wholly Saxon; and they faw plainly
that the times were too tender to endure them to be declarative on either
part; and therefore they chose a third way, which was to preserve the
municipal Laws in moderation towards the Canon, and to that end to
endeavour such a temper upon the State as must admit them to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
such as without whom the Common-wealth could not well subsist,
no more than a body without a soul; and that few occasions should befal,
but (at least in <hi>ordine remoto</hi>) must reflect upon both, and then all reason
will bespeak them to joyn in the legislative power and government of this
Kingdom; but especially as Bishops, who are now <hi>Magnae spes altera Romae,</hi>
and the very top-flowers of wisdom and learning. And unto this temper
the <hi>Saxons</hi> were sufficiently prepared and inclinable; for it was no new
thing for them to admit their Heathenish Priests into their general mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and allow them much power therein; and then it is but the person
changed, and they must do as much for their Bishops, now they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christian; especially themselves being all for the field, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with a general ignorance, the common disease of those times. Kings
were in no better condition: it was hard for them to be Baptized, and not
to be Baptized into <hi>Rome,</hi> and commonly under such a Covenant as
though many might repent of, yet none durst amend: For whenas the
Pope is Lord of the Consciences of the people, the Kings power may
sometimes out-face, but can never govern: the Saxon Kings were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fain to make a vertue of necessity, and advance Bishops to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
favorites both of <hi>Rome</hi> and themselves, to maintain good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency
between both Swords; and to countenance the power of the
temporal Magistrate in cases of dispute, else he oftentimes might command,
and yet go without. Thus entred the Prelates upon affairs of Kings and
Kingdoms, and became lovers of Lordships, and troublers of States; and if
in any thing they served their Country, they served <hi>Rome</hi> much more;
their merchandise was made of the policies and Counsels of all Kingdoms
and States, and such returns proceeded as were still subservient to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
interest; and they intoxicated the domestick counsels in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as they generally staggered, and many times came short of home.
Nevertheless, at the first this was but rare, clancular, and covered with
much modesty; for (excepting such choice spirits as <hi>Austin</hi> had) Roman
Prelacy in these younger times was but Velvet-headed, and endured not
much greatness or big titles, but spake like a Lamb; <hi>Ego non verbis quaero
prosperari, sed moribus,</hi> said this <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Alexandrian Bishop, who
had put upon him the title of Universal Bishop or Pope: and whereas he
had in a way of Courtship called <hi>Gregories</hi> Counsels commands,<note place="margin">Greg. Epist. ad Eulog.</note> he startles,
at it; <hi>quod verbum jussionis,</hi> saith he, <hi>peto a meo auditu removeri, quia scio
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64112:17"/>
quis sum &amp; qui estis.</hi> Thus Prelacy first conveyed it self into opinion,
afterwards into conscience; and ambition coming in the rear, made it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
both Bishop and Lord.</p>

               <p>BEing in pursuit of the Government of this Kingdom in elder times, and
therein first of the persons with their relation, then of their work,
and lastly of their Courts and Laws, and now in hand with the Ecclesiastical
persons, I shall descend to their particular ranks or degrees, and shall shew
what they were in their original, and what overplus they had by Laws.
And first concerning the Metropolitan. In his original, his Office was to
visit the Bishops, admonish and exhort them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in full Synod to correct
such disorders as the Bishop could not reform, and in all things to proceed
according to the prescript Canon.</p>
               <p>Thus witnesseth <hi>Boniface,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 258.</note> an Archbishop to an Archbishop of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop;
not according to the practice of the times wherein it was written,
but according to the ancient rule.<note place="margin">An. 745.</note> For long before <hi>Boniface</hi> his time Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
were swoln beyond the girt of the Canon; and before that <hi>England</hi>

                  </gap>ians,
and above all rule, but that of their own will, and through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
custom had no regard to any other; so as if <hi>England</hi> will have them,
it must be content to have them with their faults. But the truth is, the
dignity, or title (which you will) was a plant of that virulent nature that
would scarce keep under-ground in the time of the hottest persecution:
For <hi>Steven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. cent. 3 cap. 7.</note> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> liked the title of Universal Bishop. And after
a little peace, it's a wonder how it grew to that height that it had; and no
less wonderful that the <hi>Saxons</hi> gave entertainment to such Potentates.
Much of whose spirits they might have observed in the entrance of their
first Archbishop <hi>Austin,</hi> if God had not given them over to thraldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the mystery of iniquity (of <hi>sinful man aspiring into the place of God,</hi>
taught by that Courtly messenger of <hi>Rome</hi>) because they would not stoop
to that mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh, as it was taught
in simplicity by the rural <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britons.</hi> But this was not all, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Archbishops were gotten above Canon, which was thought scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
therefore they gave as large a power by Canon as the former usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amounted unto, and so stretched the Canon to the mind of the man,
whenas they should have rather reduced the man to the Canon. The
words of the Canon in our English tongue, run thus: <hi>It belongs to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolian
Bishop to rule Gods Churches; to govern, chuse, appoint, confirm, and
remove Abbots, Abbotesses, Presbyters, and Deacons; and herewith the King
hath nothing to do.</hi> And thus, though the apparent power of Archbishops
was great and unlimited,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 190.</note> yet what more was wrapped up in that word
<hi>Churches,</hi> only time must declare; for it is very likely that in those daies
it was not understood: yet the practice doth not obscurely declare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for before this Law was established by <hi>Withered</hi> in a Council (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Bertnaldus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was president,<note place="margin">An. 694. Ant. Brit. p. 55.</note> and who was first
Primate of <hi>England) Theodore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> used such power
over other Bishops in ordaining or removing them, as a Writer saith, that
his rule was no other than <hi>perturbatio</hi> and <hi>impetus animi.</hi> But the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64112:18"/>
in <hi>England</hi> as the times then were,<note place="margin">Malmsb. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> had yet a further advantage,
even over Kings themselves;<note place="margin">Ant. Brit. p. 54.</note> for there were divers Kingdoms in this Island,
and Kings had no further power than their limits afforded them: But
there was but one Metropolitan for a long time in all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Territories,
so as his power was in spirituals over many Kingdoms, and so he became
indeed <hi>Alterius orbis Papa.</hi> And it was a remarkable testimony of Gods
special providence, that the spirits of these petty Popes should be so
bound up under the notion of the infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair, that
they had not torn the <hi>European</hi> Church into as many Popedoms as Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But no doubt God ordered it for a Scourge to the World, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
should be but one, that he might be the more absolute Tyrant; and
that Kings should bow down their necks under the double or rather mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiple
yoke of Pope and Archbishops, for their Rebellion against the King of
Kings.</p>

               <p>HAd not Bishops been somewhat sutable, the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy had not
been like it self; and it had been contrary to <hi>Austin</hi>'s principles to
have advanced to Bishopricks men better qualified than himself. They
first ruled the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church joyntly in the nature of a Presbytery, till about
Sixty years after <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, their pride would not endure together
any longer, and it may be grew somewhat untractable under the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,
that resolved to be prouder than all; and thereupon <hi>Theodore</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> first divided his Province into Five Diocesses, and by
appointment of the Kings and People placed Bishops over each,<note place="margin">Ant. Brit. Concil. Brit 133.</note> every one
of them being of the right <hi>Roman</hi> stamp,<note place="margin">Ant. Brit. 45. Ibid. 53.</note> as himself was of the right <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
shaving. And it had been a wonder if Episcopacy (now for the space of
Three hundred years degenerated, and that into such a monstrous shape as a
Pope) should by transplanting become regenerate into their original conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of meekness and humility. But it is a much greater wonder that they
should become so purely ambitious as not to endure a thought of the ways of
sobriety, but would be proud by Law; to let all the world know that they
held it no infirmity, but an honour. For albeit that in the first time the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
work was to instruct &amp; teach, to see the service of God to be diligently
&amp; purely administred in publick Congregations,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 238, 246, 261.</note> to Exhort, Reprove, &amp; by

are now grown up into State,<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 4. cap. 3.</note> and must now ride on horse-back, that were

they are equal to Princes and Emperours: and if any Bishop shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64112:18"/>
words of the Canon) for disgrace done to their Dignity they must be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended:
So as by their own confession, Bishops henceforth are Bishops of a
<hi>new fashion,</hi> that must incur a note of infamy for shewing any gesture of
humility to Princes; which if any man will see more fully, let him peruse
the Canon if he please. But this is not sublime enough; they must be not
only equal, but in many respects superiour to Princes: for in matters that
concern God, <hi>Omnibus dignitatibus praesunt;</hi> and more plainly, Princes must
obey them <hi>Ex corde cum magna humilitate;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. cent. 8. cap 9.</note> and this was allowed of by
<hi>Offa</hi> the great in a <hi>legatine</hi> Synod. And thus highly advanced, Bishops are

before them are of highest moment;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 128.</note> and therefore the trial of Crimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of Church-mens maintenance amongst the Saxons.</head>
               <p>I Take no notice in this account of the <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> and other such
Religious men, as they were then called; nor can I pass them amongst
the number of Church-governours or Officers, being no other than as a
sixth finger, or an excrescence that the body might well spare, and yet
they sucked up much of the blood and spirits thereof. But as touching the
maintenance of those formerly mentioned, who had a constant influence in
the Government of the affairs of the publick worship of God, and regard of
salvation of the Souls of the people; I say their maintenance was diversly
raised, and as diversly imployed. First, through the bounty of Kings and
great men, Lands and Mannors were bestowed upon the Metropolitan and
Bishops, in free Alms; and from these arose the maintenance that ascended
up in abundance to the higher Region of the Clergy, but came again in
thin dews scarce enough to keep the Husbandmans hope from despair; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
had not the Prelates so soon mounted up into the chair of Pomp
and State, as they did. I say, these are given in free Alms, or more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as Alms free from all service; and this was doubtless soon thought
upon, for it was formerly in president with their Heathenish-Priests
and Druids, as <hi>Caesar</hi> noteth, that they had <hi>omnium rerum immunita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem:</hi>
yet with the exception of works of publick charity and safety, such
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64112:19"/>
as are maintaining of High-ways, repairing of Bridges, and fortifying of
Castles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hereof the presidents are numerous. The work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this wages was appointed, was the worship of God, and increase of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and thus not only many of the Kings Subjects were exempted
from publick service, but much of the Revenue of the Kingdom formerly
imployed for the publick safety, became acquitted from the service of the
<hi>Field,</hi> to the service of the <hi>Bead;</hi> the strength of the Kingdom much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and the Subjects much grieved; who in those early times saw the
inconveniences, and complained thereof to their Kings, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
This was the vintage of Kings and great men,<note place="margin">M. Paris in vit. Eadrick. Abb.</note> but the gleanings of
the people were much more plentiful; for besides the Courts (which swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the irregularities of those times increased, and thereby enriched the
Cofers of that covetous Generation, the greatest part whereof ought by
the Canon to go to the publick) the best part of the setled maintenance,<note place="margin">An. 1009.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of the inferiour degrees,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 513.</note> arose from the good affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Ll. Aetheld. 31.</note>
who were either forward to offer, or easily perswaded to forgo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
supply for the Church-men out of their Estates, as well real as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
especially in the particulars ensuing. The most ancient of all the
rest was the first-fruits, which was by way of eminency called <hi>Cyrick-sceate,</hi>
or in more plain English,<note place="margin">First-fruits</note> 
                  <hi>Church free;</hi> which was always payable upon St.
<hi>Martins</hi> day unto the Bishop out of that house where the party did inhabit
upon the day or Feast of the Nativity.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 185.</note> It was first granted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the time of King <hi>Ina;</hi> and in case of neglect of payment,<note place="margin">An. 693.</note> or denial,
it was penal eleven-fold to the Bishop,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 545.</note> besides a fine to the King, as was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ordered by <hi>Canutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the first-fruits cometh to consideration the Revenue of Tythes,
the which I find no publick Act of State to warrant,<note place="margin">Tythes.</note> till the <hi>Legatine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
under <hi>Offa:</hi> Although the Canon was more ancient.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 298.</note> The Bishop at
the first was the general Receiver as well of these as of the former,<note place="margin">An. 787.</note> and by
him they were divided into Three parts,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 259.</note> and imployed one to the poor;
another for the maintenance of the Church; and a Third part for the
maintenance of the Presbyter. But in future times many Acts of State suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
concerning this, amongst which that grant of <hi>Athelwolfe</hi> must be
a little paused upon.<note place="margin">Ingulfus. Gest. pontif. Lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> Some Writers say that he gave the tenth Mansion,
and the tenth of all his goods: but <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saith, the tenth of the hides
of Land; but in the Donation it self, as it is by him recited, it is the Tenth
Mansion. But <hi>Matth. Westm.</hi> understands that he gave the Tenth part
of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">An. 854.</note> but in the Donation by him published it is <hi>decimam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
terrae meae.</hi> In my opinion, all this being by Tradition, little can be
grounded thereupon. The form of the Donation it self is uncertain and
various, the inference or relation more uncertain and unadvised; for if the
King had granted that which was not his own, it could neither be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pious or rational. Nor do we find in the Donation that the King in
precise words gave the Land, or the Tenth part of the Land of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but the Tenth of his Land in the Kingdom: And the exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
published by <hi>Matth. Westm.</hi> countenanceth the same, albeit the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
observed it not. But suppose that the Kingdom joyned with the King
in the concession, and that it was the course to pass it onely in the Kings
name, yet could not the Tenth Hide, Tenth Mansion, or Tenth part of
the Kingdom be granted, without confusion in the possessions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For either some particular persons must part with all their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or else out of every mans possession must have issued a proportionable
supply; or lastly a Tenth part of every mans possession, or House and Land,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64112:20"/>
must be set forth from the rest; or some must lose all and become beggars,
to save others: all which are to me equally improbable. Nevertheless I
do not take the thing to be wholly fabulous, but may rather suppose that
either a Tenth was given out of the Kings own Demesnes, which is most
probable; or else the Tenth of the profits of the Lands throughout the
Kingdom; and that it was by publick Act of State, and that clause forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Historians. And thus might a good president be led to <hi>Alfred,
Athelstan,</hi>

upon the Church,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 260. An. 750.</note> as otherwise. All these four last were payable to the

               <p>Lastly, the zeal of the charity of <hi>England</hi> was not so cold as to contain
it self within it's own bounds:<note place="margin">Peter-pence.</note> They were a dependent Church upon <hi>Rome,</hi>
and their old Mother must not be forgotten. An alms is granted; for
under that lowly title it passed first, but afterwards called <hi>Romscot</hi> or <hi>Romes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feogh,</hi>
or <hi>Heord</hi>-penny; for it was a penny upon every hearth or chimney,
payable at the Feast of St. <hi>Peter ad vincula;</hi> and therefore also called <hi>Peter</hi>-pence:
it was for the Popes use; and was setled under great penalties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the defaulters. It arose by degrees and parcels: For first <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
King granted a penny out of every house in his Kingdom:<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 230. An. 725.</note> After him
<hi>Offa</hi> granted it out of every dwelling house that had ground thereto occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
to the yearly value of Thirty pence,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 311. An. 791.</note> excepting the Lands which he
had purposed for the Monastery at St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. 313. An. 847</note> This <hi>Offa</hi> had a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Dominion than <hi>Ina,</hi> and was King over Three and twenty Shires. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom <hi>Aethelwolf</hi> passed a new grant thereof out of his whole Kingdom,
which was well-nigh all that part which was called <hi>Saxony,</hi> with this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
nevertheless, that where a man had divers dwelling houses, he was to
pay onely for that house wherein he dwelt at the time of payment. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. 6. 1.</note> confirmed that Donation out of such Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as had Thirty pence <hi>vivae pecuniae.</hi> If then it be granted, that the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Subjects had any property in their Lands or Tenements, as no man
ever questioned, then could not this charge be imposed without the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
consent of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the assertions of <hi>Polydore</hi> and the
Monks, who tell us that <hi>Ina</hi> and <hi>Offa</hi> had made the whole Kingdom tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to <hi>Rome,</hi> must needs be a mistake, both in the person, and the nature
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64112:20"/>
of the gift, seeing there is a much more difference between an Alms and
a Tribute, than between the King and the People. Now that it was an
Alms, and not a Tribute, may apear, for that the original was a suddain
pang of Zeal, conceived and born in one breath,<note place="margin">Vit. Offae. 19.</note> while the King was at
<hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore not imposed as a Tribute. Secondly, it was <hi>ex rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
munificentia,</hi> and therefore free. Thirdly, it was expresly the gift of the
King; for the Law of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> which provideth for the recovery of
the Arrears of this Money,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 445. 545.</note> and enjoyneth that they must be paid to the
King, and not to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 621.</note> as it was in the days of <hi>Canutus</hi> and <hi>Edgar,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
the reason thereof to be, because it was the <hi>Kings Alms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that it was an Alms onely from the King, and out of his own
Demesnes, may seem not improbable, because it was <hi>ex regali munificentia,</hi>
which could never be affirmed if the gift had been out of the Estates of
others. Secondly, it was granted onely out of such houses as yielded
Thirty pence Rent, called <hi>vivae pecuniae,</hi> because in those times Rent was
paid in Victual; so as it may seem that onely Farms were charged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
and not all mens Farms neither; for the general income will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
answer that proportion. The particular hereof I shall in brief set
forth. It appeareth in the former Quotation, that <hi>Offa</hi> charged this Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
upon the Inhabitants dwelling in Nine several Diocesses, <hi>viz. Hereford,</hi>
which contained the City and County adjacent. 2. <hi>Worcester,</hi> containing
the Cities and Shires of it and <hi>Gloucester. 3. Litchfield,</hi> containing <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickshire,
Cheshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire,</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire. 4. Leicester,</hi>
with the County adjacent. 5. <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with the County adjacent. 6. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
whereto belonged <hi>Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
Huntingtonshire, Cambridgeshire,</hi> and half <hi>Hertfordshire. 7. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
with <hi>Essex, Middlesex,</hi> and the other half of <hi>Hertfordshire. 8. Helm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
with <hi>Norfolk. 9. Domuck</hi> or <hi>Dunwich,</hi> with <hi>Suffolk.</hi> In which nine
Diocesses were two and Twenty Shires. And he further granted it out of
<hi>Spatinghenshire,</hi> (now <hi>Nottingham</hi>) whose Church belonged to <hi>York.</hi>
But in <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> time the Grant was enlarged, and extended into Fifteen
Diocesses; which, together with their several charge out of the English
Martyrology, I shall particularize,<note place="margin">Fox Mary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Money, if the weight of a Penny was not less in those times than
in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, when it was the Twentieth part of an

made may appear. Nor can the difference be much (if any) in regard
of the vicinity of the time of this extract to that of the Statute: for
though no particular date thereof appear, yet it seemeth to be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Translation of the See from <hi>Thetford</hi> to <hi>Norwich,</hi> which
was done in <hi>William Rufus</hi> his time; and after the erecting of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Ely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brit. Ant. p. 18.</note> which was in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the First. Now albeit
this charge was in future times diversly ordered and changed; yet upon
this account it will appear, that not above Eight and forty thousand and
Eighty Houses were charged in this time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second with this
Assessment; which is a very small proportion to the number of Houses
of Husbandry in these days, and much more inferiour to the proportion
of Houses in those times, if <hi>Polydores</hi> observation be true, that in the
Conquerour's time there were Sixty thousand Knights Fees; and as others,
Fifty thousand Parishes. It may therefore be rather thought that none
but the Kings Farmers were charged herewith, notwithstanding the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Relations of Writers, who in this case, as in most others, wherein the
credit of <hi>Rome</hi> is engaged, spare not to believe lightly, and to write
largely. And thus for their Sevenfold Church-Officers, we have also as
many kinds of constant maintenance. One in Lands and Tenements,
and Six several kinds out of the Profits and the personal Estate, besides
the emergent benefits of Oblations and others formerly mentioned.</p>

These are most ordinarily called Synods, although at the pleasure of the

National, and these either particular or general. The general consisted
of all the Bishops and Clergy; and such was the Synod under Arch-Bishop

sometimes by the Pope, sometimes by the King, as the first moving

the Arch-bishop alone, and sometimes they joyned together.

and attested the acts of that Synod, together with others of the
Clergy of greater degree. The matters in action were either the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or executing of Laws for Government; and (because few Laws
passed that did not some way reflect upon the King and people, as well
as the Clergy) the King was for the most part present, and always the
Lords, and others: Yet if the matters concerned the Church in the first
act, the King though present,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 245. 317, 387.</note> the Arch-bishop was nevertheless President;
as it besel at a Synod at <hi>Clevershoe,</hi> An. 747. and another at <hi>Celchith,</hi> An.
816. And in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, though the Synod was
called by the King, yet the Arch-bishop was President. Concerning all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64112:22"/>
which it may be in the sum well conceived, that in the penning of the
Councils aforesaid, either the Clergy (being Pen-men) were partial or
negligent in the setting down of the right form; and that the Kings cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
these Assemblies by instance of the Archbishop, and sometime presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his own person, and sometimes deputed the Archbishop thereunto.</p>
               <p>The executing of Laws was for the most part left to the Diocesan
Synods; yet when the cases concerned great men, the more general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
had the cognizance, and therein proceeded strictly, sparing no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of what degree soever.<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 955. 958.</note> Examples we find hereof, amongst others,
of one incestuous Lord, and two delinquent Kings, <hi>Edwy</hi> and <hi>Edgar.</hi>
Nay they spared not the whole Kingdom;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 479.</note> for in the quarrel between
<hi>Cenulphus</hi> the King, and Archbishop <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> the whole Kingdom was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
interdict for six years space; and no Baptism administred all that
time.<note place="margin">Ibid. 337.</note> Nor were they very nice in medling with matters beyond their
sphere, even with matters of Property; for at a Provincial Council (for
so it is called) they bore all down before them, even the King himself,
as in the case between <hi>Cenulphus</hi> the King,<note place="margin">Ibid. 319. 332.</note> and the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
concerning the Monastery of <hi>Cotham.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 334.</note> The like also of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Synod concerning the Monastery of <hi>Westburgh:</hi> It's true, the Lords
were present; and it may be said, that what was done, was done in their
right; yet the Clergy had the rule, and begat the Child; and the Lay-Lords
onely might challenge right to the name. This concurrence of the
Laity with the Clergy contracted much business, and by that means a
customary power, which once rooted, the Clergy after they saw their
time (though not without difficulty) turned both King and Lords out,
and shut the doors after them, and so possessed themselves of the whole
by Survivorship. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>The particular Diocesan Synods were, as I said, called by the Bishops
within their several Diocesses. The work therein was to preach the Word
as a preparative;<note place="margin">Mag. cent. 8. cap. 9.</note> then to visit and enquire of the manners of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in the worship of God, and of all matters of scandal, and them to
correct. These Synods were to be holden twice every year, at certain
times; and if they met with any matter too hard for them to reform,
they referred it to the Provincial or National Synod.</p>

In this Island the Pelagian <hi>Heresie</hi> brought in the first precedent of
Synods that we have extant; and herein it will admit of no denial,
but in the infancy of the Church the Teachers are the principal Judges
of the nature of Errour and Heresie, as also of the truth; as the
Church is the best guide to every Christian in his first instruction in the
principles; but after some growth there is that in every Church and
Christian that makes itself party in judging of truth and errour joyntly
with the first Teachers. And therefore 'tis not without reason, that in that

                  <hi>Blasphemy</hi> was questionless under Church-censure,<note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> but I find no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps

made to punish it with cutting out the Tongue of the Delinquent: But
it may be feared that neither the <hi>Saxons</hi> nor their <hi>Roman</hi> Teachers, were
so zealous for the honour of Gods Name, as to regard that odious sin; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

and so needed no Law.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Apostacy</hi> was an early sin, and soon provided against;<note place="margin">Apostacy.</note> the Church-censure
was allowed of in <hi>Britain</hi> before the <hi>Saxons</hi> Church had any

                  <note place="margin">Ibid. 367.</note> as he provided in like manner for other Church Laws.</p>
               <p>The times anciently were not so zealous for due observance of Divine
Worship,<note place="margin">False Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> unless by the Church-men who were the Leaders therein; a

not down with the rude <hi>Saxons:</hi> they, or the greater sort of them,
were content to come to Church onely to pray and hear the Word, and
so went away. This is noted by that ancient Writer in nature of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as if somewhat else was to be done,<note place="margin">Bed. hist. lib. 3. cap. 26.</note> which they neglected; this
somewhat was the Mass, which in those days was wont to be acted after
the Sermon ended.<note place="margin">Mag. Cent. 7. cap. 6.</note> And it's probable that if the Nobles were so ill trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

their diligence: or to speak more plainly, it's very likely the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi>
were so resolute in their Worship,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 306.</note> as there was either little need of
Law to retain them, or little use of Law to reclaim them. For it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their late Psalter, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy was not more forward
to Image or Saint-worship, than the people were backward thereto; and
therein shewed themselves the true Seed of their Ancestors in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. Mor. Germ.</note> of
whom it's observed that they endured not Images, but worshipped a Deity

               <p>
                  <hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Witchcraft</hi> they had in abomination: yet it was a sin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a mist, and hard to be discerned but by the quick-sighted Clergy;
and therefore it was left to their censure, as a sin against the Worship of
God.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 246. An. 745.</note> This <hi>Ethebald</hi> the Mercian King first endowed them with; and
they alone exercised the Cognizance thereof till <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">Ibid. 377.</note> who infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thereupon the penalty of Banishment:<note place="margin">Ibid. 405. An. 928.</note> but if any were killed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
the delinquent suffered death by a Law made by <hi>Aethelstan.</hi>
And thus by degrees became one and the same Crime punishable in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p>Concerning <hi>Perjury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Perjury.</note> the Prelates had much to do therewith in future
times; and they had the first hint from <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King's Grant to
them of power to take Testimonies upon Oath,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. fol. 4.</note> as supposing that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
that men might bear to their Persons and Functions, would the
rather over-awe their Tongues in witnessing; that they would not dare
to falsifie, lest these knowing men should espy it, and forthwith give them
their doom.<note place="margin">An. 9, 28.</note> But no positive Law allowed them that power of sentence,
till <hi>Aethelstan</hi>'s Law gave it; and upon conviction by the same Law, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stested
the delinquents Oath for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sacriledge</hi> comes in the next place,<note place="margin">Sacriledge.</note> being a particular Crime meerly of
the Clergy-mens invention and naming; for before they baptized it, you
might have well enough called it Theft, Oppression, or Extortion. This
Crime the Prelates held under their Cognizance by vertue of that general
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64112:23"/>
Maxime,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 127.</note> 
                  <hi>That all wrong done to the Church, must be judged by the Church.</hi>
The first time that I can observe they challenged this power,<note place="margin">An. 610. Ibid. 265.</note> was by <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> in the Seventh Century.</p>
               <p>But nothing was more their own than <hi>Simony;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simony.</note> and that may be the
reason why we find so little thereof either for the discovery or correcting
of it.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 163.</note> All former Crimes were in their first act destructive to the Church,
but this advantageous; and therefore though the Canons roar loud, yet
the execution is not mortal, because it's bent against the dignity, and not
the gain. And although the Canon would not that any Presbyter should
be made, but presented therewith to some place to exercise his Function
in, yet it serveth not for those times when men were sent forth rather to
make Flocks than to feed Flocks.</p>
               <p>And yet the Theam of <hi>Marriage</hi> was the best Dish in all their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment:
They had the whole common place thereof,<note place="margin">Matrimonial Causes.</note> with the Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
within the compass of their Text, before ever it attained the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> It was a branch of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, whereof they were
the sole Expositors, and so seemeth to be cast upon them by a kind of
necessity, as an Orphan that had no owner. Nevertheless a passage in
<hi>Eusebius</hi> seemeth to report this Trust in the Civil Magistrate: for he
relateth out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> concerning a Divorce sued out by a godly
Matron long before the Prelacie got into the Saddle, or the Clergie had
the power of Judicature. And whereas <hi>Lucius</hi> taxed <hi>Vrbicius</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
for punishing <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who was guilty of no Crime worthy of his
cognizance in that kind, amongst other Crimes (enumerated by him,
whereof <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was not guilty) he nameth the Crimes against the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Commandment; intimating thereby a power in the Judge to have
cognizance of those Crimes as well as others. But the Prelacie beginning
to mount, nibled at it in the second Centurie, but more cleerly in the
fourth, when the persecutions were allayed, and men of Learning began to
feel their Honour; and never left pursuit till they had swallowed the
Bait, and exercised not onely a Judiciary power in determining all Doubts
and Controversies concerning the same, but challenged an Efficienciary
power in the <hi>Marriage-making.</hi> This Garland <hi>Austin</hi> brought over with
him, and crowned the <hi>Saxon</hi> Clergie therewith, as may appear by his
<hi>Queries</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beda hist. l. 1. cap. 27.</note> And thus the <hi>Saxons</hi> that formerly wedded
themselves, became hereafter wedded by the Clergie. Yet the Civil
Magistrate retained a supream Legislative power concerning it, as the
joynt Marriages between the <hi>Saxons, Britons,</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> do manifest:
For it's said of that Work, that it was effected <hi>per commune concilium &amp;
assensum omnium Episcoporum, procerum, comitum, &amp; omnium sapientum, senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
&amp; populorum totius regni, &amp; per praeceptum Regis Inae;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 219.</note> and in the time
of <hi>Edward</hi> their King,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 427. An. 944.</note> were enacted Laws or Rules concerning Marriage;
and so unto the Lay-power was the Ecclesiastical adjoyned in this Work.</p>
               <p>The Clergie having gained the Principal, with more ease obtained the
Appurthenances;<note place="margin">Bastardy.</note> such as <hi>Bastardy, Adultery, Fornication,</hi> and <hi>Incest</hi>
There was some doubt concerning <hi>Bastardy,</hi> because it trenched far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Title of Inheritance; and so they attained that <hi>sub modo,</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
will appear. The Laws of <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, allowed
them the cognizance of <hi>Incest;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Incest.</note> although nevertheless the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
retained also the cognizance thereof,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 392. An. 905.</note> so far as concerned the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Temporal Law. <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi> they held without
controul;<note place="margin">Adultery. Fornication.</note> yet in the same manner as the former: for the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
had cognizance thereof, so far as touched the Temporal penalty.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64112:23"/>
And to give them as much as can be allowed,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 558.</note> it's probable that in all or
most of the Cases foregoing, they had the honour to advise in determining
of the Crime, and declaring the Law, or defining the matter; for in those
ignorant times it could not be expected from any other.</p>
               <p>But how the cognizance of <hi>Tythes</hi> crept under their wing,<note place="margin">Tythes.</note> might be
much more wondred at, for that it was originally from the Grant of the
People: nor can a better ground be found by me than this, that it was a
matter of late original: For till the Seventh Century the times were
troublesome; and no setled maintenance could be expected for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
where men were not in some certainty of their daily Bread. And
as it will hardly be demonstrated that this Title was ever in any positive
National Law before the time of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in whose time, by a Synod
of Clergie and Laitie, it was decreed that <hi>Tythes</hi> should be gathered by
selected persons, to pay the Bishops and Presbyters:<note place="margin">Synod Durien. cap. 7. An. 785.</note> So neither can I find
any <hi>Saxon</hi> National Constitution to settle this duty, till <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time,
although the Church-men had them as a <hi>voluntary Gift</hi> (so far as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the <hi>quota pars</hi>)<note place="margin">Rabban. Epist. ad Hadubrand</note> for the space of well-nigh a hundred years before.
But <hi>Alfred</hi> made a National Law, under a penalty, to enforce this Duty;
which the Canon could not wring from the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 277.</note> how dreadful soever
the Censure proved. And by this means the Church had their remedy
by Ecclesiastical censure for the matter in fact, and also the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the cognizance in point of Right, albeit future times introduced a
change herein.</p>

               <p>THis that I have said, might at the first view seem to represent a
curious Structure of Church-policie, which might have put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to time it self; but (to speak <hi>sine ira &amp; studio</hi>) the height was too
great, considering the foundation, and therefore ever weak, and in need of
props. The foundation was neither on the Rock, nor on good ground,
but by a Ginn screwed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Consistory, or like a Castle in the
Air, hanging upon a pin of Favour of Kings and great men. At the first
they thought best to temporize, and to hold both these their strings to
their Bow; but feeling themselves somewhat under-propped by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of the ignorant people, they soon grew wondrous brave, even to
the jealousie of Princes; which also was known so notoriously, that the
publick Synods rang, <hi>That the Prelates loved not Princes, but emulated them,
and envied their greatness, and pursued them with detraction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 254. An. 747.</note> And if the
Cloth may be judged by the List, that one example of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>York</hi> will speak much. He was once so humble minded,<note place="margin">Malmesb. gest. pontif. lib. 3. An. 680.</note> as he
would always go on foot to preach the Word; but by that time he was
warm in his Archbishops Robes, he was served in Vessels of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and with Troops of Followers, in such Gallantry, as his Pomp was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
of the Queen. A strange growth of Prelacy in so small a space as
Eighty years, and in the midst of stormy times, such as then afflicted this
poor Country! But this is not all; for never doth Pride lead the way,
but some other base Vice follows. I will not mention the lives of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64112:24"/>
Monks, Nuns, and other Clerks;<note place="margin">Bonis. epist. ad Cutbertum. An. 745.</note> 
                  <hi>Malmsbury</hi> speaks sufficiently of their
Luxury, Drunkenness, Quarrelling, and Fighting. Others witness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and tell us that the Clergie seldom read the Scripture, and did never
preach, and were so grosly ignorant, that <hi>Alfred</hi> the King being a diligent
Translator of Latine Writers into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, rendreth this reason,
<hi>Because they would be very useful to some of his Bishops that understood not
the Latine Tongue.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p 379.</note> Nor were the Presbyters of another dye; for that
King bewailing their ignorance, in his Letter to <hi>Wolfegus,</hi> saith, <hi>That those
which were</hi> de gradu spirituali, <hi>were come to that condition, that few of them
on this side</hi> Humber <hi>could understand their Common prayers, or translate
them into</hi> Saxon; <hi>and so few, as I do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>remember one on this
side the</hi> Thames <hi>when I began to reign.</hi> And the Synod that should have
salved all, covers the Sore with this Canonical Plaister, that those of the
Clergie that could not say <hi>Domine miserere</hi> in Latine,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 248, &amp; 253. An. 747.</note> should instead
thereof say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us</hi> in English. It was therefore a vain
thing for the Clergie to rest upon their Works, or Title of <hi>Divine Right;</hi>
their great Pomp, sacred Places, and savour of Kings, commended them
to the Administration, or rather Adoration of ignorant people; and
the favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair, unto the regard of Kings: who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their interest with the Conclave on the one side, and with the
People on the other side, by their means; and so they mutually served
one another. It cannot be denied but the Pope and Kings were good
Cards in those days; yet had the Prelacie maturely considered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government, so much depending upon the people,
they might have laid a more sure foundation, and attained their ends
with much more ease and honour. I commend not the base way of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity
by principles of Flattery, but that honourable service of Truth
and Vertue which sets up a Throne in the minds of the Vulgar, few of
whom but have some sparks of Nature left unquenched: for though
Respect may chance to meet with Greatness, yet Reverence is the proper
Debt to Goodness; without which we look at great men as Comets,
whose influence works mischief, and whose light serves rather to be gazed
upon, than for direction.</p>
               <p>The foundation thus happily laid, the progress of the building was
no less irregular in regard of their ends that they aimed at: For first,
they admitted the Laity into their Synods; who were not so dull but
could espie their ambition, nor so base spirited as to live in slavery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conviction. This Errour was espied I confess, but it was too late;
and though they reformed it, yet it was after Four hundred years labour.
And in the mean time, by the contentions of the Clergie amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Kings had first learned so much of their Supremacy, and the
Laity so much of their Liberty, as they began to plead with the Clergie,
and had brought the matter to issue, before the Synod could rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of these <hi>Lay-Spectators,</hi> or rather <hi>Overseers</hi> of their ways and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
A second Errour was the yoking of the Bishops power under that
of the Synods: for they had little or no power by the Canon that was
not under their controul,<note place="margin">Cantab. 10. 200, 263.</note> neither in admission or deprivation of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or others, determining of any Cause, nor passing sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
And this could not but much hinder the hasty growth of
Antichrist's power in this Kingdom. Nor could it ever be compleated
so long as the Synods had the chief power. Nevertheless the inthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
spirits of the Clergie, and terrour of the Papal thunder-bolt, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of time surmounted this difficulty, and Synods became so tame
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64112:24"/>
and easily led, as if there had been but one Devil to rule amongst them
all. For if any quick eye or active spirit did but begin to peep or stir, the
Legate <hi>e latere</hi> soon reduced him into rank, and kept all in awe with a
<hi>Sub poena,</hi> of unknown danger. A third error, was the allowing of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars
and exemptions of Religious Houses from ordinary jurisdiction;
and this was an error in the first concoction, a block in the way of Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and a clog to keep it down. This error was soon felt, and was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of much mutiny in the body Ecclesiastical; but exceeding profitable
for <hi>Rome,</hi> not only in point of Revenue by the multitude of Appeals, but
especially in maintaining a party for the <hi>Roman</hi> See, in case the Prelacy
of <hi>England</hi> should stumble at the Supremacy of <hi>Rome.</hi> Otherwise it
seemed like a Wen upon the body, rather than any <hi>Homogene</hi> Member;
and without which certainly the English Prelacy had thriven much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair much worse. In all which regards, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Prelatical Government in <hi>England</hi> was as yet like a
young Bear not fully licked, but left to be made compleat by time and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>

<hi>Germany</hi> were distributed into four Classes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Free-men,</hi>
the <hi>Manumitted</hi> persons, and the <hi>Bond-men.</hi> Under the Nobility, and from
them, arose one that was called a <hi>King,</hi> of whom I shall speak apart: the
two last differed only in the bare liberty of their persons, and therefore
may be comprehended under one head, as they were in their original.</p>
               <p>A <hi>King</hi> amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi> in probability was anciently a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the field, an Officer <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and no necessary Member in the
constitution of their State: for in time of peace, when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was it self, the executive power of the Law rested much in the
Nobility; but in times of War, and in publick distractions, they chose a
General, and all sware Obedience unto him during the War; it being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
the General laid down his Command,<note place="margin">Witik in gest. Saxon. lib. 1.</note> and every one lived <hi>aequo
jure propria contentus potestate.</hi> But in their transmigration into <hi>Britain,</hi>
the continuance of the War causing the continual use of the General, made
that Place or Office to settle and swell into the condition of a <hi>King;</hi> and
so he that was formerly <hi>Dux</hi> became <hi>Rex;</hi> there being no more difference
in the nature of their places, than in the sense of the words; the one sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
to <hi>Lead,</hi> the other to <hi>Govern;</hi> so as he that formerly was a <hi>servant
for the occasion,</hi> afterwards became a <hi>servant for life;</hi> yet cloathed with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestly,
like some bitter Pill covered with Gold, to make the service better
tasted. Nor was the place more desirable, if duly considered. For first,
his Title rested upon the good opinion of the <hi>Free-men;</hi> and it seemeth to
be one of the best Gems of the Crown, for that he was thereby declared
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64112:25"/>
to be most worthy of the love and service of the people. Yet was the
ground of their Election so uncertain, as a man might imagine that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there appeared more of the will than of the judgment in it; that it
might be said to be the more free, for they neither excluded women nor
children further than present occasions led them. The <hi>West-Saxons</hi> deposed
<hi>Seburg</hi> their Queen, because they would not fight under a woman; but
the <hi>Mercians</hi> obeyed <hi>Elfled</hi> their Queen,<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 672.</note> and under her fought vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
with good success against the <hi>Danes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 912, 919.</note> imitating the custom of
the <hi>Sitones</hi> or <hi>Norwegians</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. Cragius.</note> or they might borrow it from
the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> A Custom it was so much the more honourable, by
how much it demonstrateth freedom, and that the worth of the
people rested not so much in the head, as it's diffused through the
whole body. And it seemeth to run in the Blood of an <hi>English</hi>-man,
even to this day, to be as brave under a single Queen, as under the
most valiant King, if not much more; and still to strive to be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the defence of Majesty wherever they set it, as the <hi>Britons</hi>
were of old. Nor were they different in their respect of age, from that
of the Sex; for though after the death of <hi>Edmond, Edwin</hi> or <hi>Edgar</hi>
were to have succeeded in the Crown by the right of descent, yet the
States would not admit them, because they were Minors; but the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
admitted <hi>Kenelme</hi> a child of Seven years old to be their King. They
likewise excluded not Bastards till the Clergy interposed; for they having
wound themselves into the Councils of the Kingdom, procured a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
to back them in the Election of Kings Legitimate, <hi>&amp;c. Let the
Kings be legally chosen by Priests and Elders, and not such as are begotten by
Adultery or Incest:</hi> which Constitution was made in a <hi>Legatine</hi> Council,
and confirmed by great <hi>Offa.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. cent. 8. cap. 2.</note> The rule of their Election was the same
with that in <hi>Germany, viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 747. Tacitus.</note> to elect the chiefest out of the chiefest Family,
that is, the chiefest for worth, not by descent; yet the honour they bare
to their brave Kings who had deserved well, made some to honour their
posterity, and to chuse their eldest after their decease; and so in time
Crowns were taken up by custom, and Election oftentimes subsequent
was accounted but a ceremony, unless the people will dispute the
point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Election was qualified under a stipulation or covenant,
wherein both Prince and people were mutually bound each to other; the
people to defend their King,<note place="margin">Tacitus</note> which the Historian saith was <hi>praecipuum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum;</hi>
and the Prince to the people to be no other than the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Law,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 397.</note> sutable to that saying of <hi>Aethelstan</hi> the <hi>Saxon King, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I according to your Law allow you what is yours, do you so with me;</hi> as if
the <hi>Law</hi> were the sole umpire between King and people, and unto which
not only the people, but also the King must submit. The like whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>Ina</hi> the great <hi>Saxon</hi> King also,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. Lamb.</note> 
                  <hi>No great man,</hi> saith he, <hi>nor any other in
the whole Kingdom may abolish the written Laws.</hi> Kings furthermore bound
themselves (at their entrance into the Throne) hereunto by an <hi>Oath;</hi> as it's
noted of <hi>Canutus,</hi> unto whom, after<note place="margin">Miror cap. 1. Sect. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Aetheldred</hi> was dead, the Bishops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
Dukes, and other Nobles, came and Elected him to be their King,
and sware Fealty unto him; and he again sware to them, that <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Deum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wigorn. An. 1016.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; secundum seculum,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>according to the Laws of God, and
of the Nation, he would be a faithful Lord to them.</hi> It's probable, I grant,
that the <hi>praecipuum Sacramentum</hi> formerly mentioned, was in the first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more personal for the defence of the person of their Leader, whilst
he was their Captain: because it much concerned the good of the Army,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64112:25"/>
and without whom all must scatter, and be brought to ruine; and this
the words of the Historian do evidence. But the safety of the whole
people depended not on him after the War was done, and therefore the
Oath tied them not any further: nor did the safety of the people after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when as the <hi>Saxons</hi> entred this Land, so absolutely rest upon the
person of the King, especially if he proved unfit to manage the work:
and therefore the fealty that the people sware to their King, was not so
absolutely determined upon their persons, otherwise than in order to the
publick weal, as may appear from the Laws of the Confessor, who was
within Thirty years after the Reign of <hi>Aethelstan</hi> formerly mentioned.
The words in English run thus: <hi>All the people in their Folkmote shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
themselves as sworn Brethren, to defend the Kingdom against stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and enemies, together with their Lord the King, and to preserve his
Lands and Honours together with him with all faithfulness, and that within
and without the Kingdom of</hi> Britain <hi>they will be faithful to him as to their
Lord and King.</hi> So as 'tis evident, the <hi>Saxons</hi> fealty to their King, was
subservient to the publick safety; and the publick safety is necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
upon the liberty of the Laws. Nor was it to be expected that
the <hi>Saxons</hi> would endure a King above this pitch. For those parts of
<hi>Germany</hi> (whence they came) that had the Regiment of Kings (which these
had not) yet used they their Kings in no other manner than as <hi>Servants of
State,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> in sending them as Embassadors and Captains, as if they claimed
more interest in him than he in them: And the Historian saith expresly,
that amongst those people in <hi>Germany</hi> that had Kings, their Kings had a
defined power, and were not <hi>supra libertatem.</hi> And this Maxim of
State became afterwards priviledged by Sanctuary: for by the growth of
Antichrist, not only the Clergy, but even their Tenants and Retainers
were exempt from the reach of Kings; and even by their own concession
allowed of a Law that cut the throat of their indefined prerogative, <hi>viz.
That if the King defend not his people, and especially Church-men from injury,
nec nomen Regis in eo constabit, verum nomen Regis perdit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Ed. cap. 17.</note> Which Law
however it might pass for currant Divinity in those days, yet 'tis strange
it should get into a publick Act of State.<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 756. 758.</note> Nor was this a dead word; for
the people had formerly a trick of deposing their Kings (when they saw
him peep above the ordinary reach) and this was an easie work for them
to do,<note place="margin">Wigorn. An. 755.</note> where ever Neighbouring Princes of their own Nation watched
for the windfals of Crowns. This made the Monarchical Crown in this
Land, to walk circuit into all parts of the Countrey to find heads fit to
wear it, until the <hi>Norman</hi> times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Saxons</hi> had so hampered their Kings in their Elections, and
made them so properly their own, as they claimed an interest not only in
the person of their Kings, but also in their Estates, so as in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
they were scarcely <hi>sui juris.</hi> For King <hi>Baldred</hi> had given the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Malings</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi> to <hi>Christ-church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and because the
Lords consented not thereto, it was revoked,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 340.</note> and King <hi>Egbert</hi> afterwards
made a new grant by advice of the Lords; which shews that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesnes
of the Crown were holden <hi>sacred,</hi> and not to be disposed of to
any other use, though <hi>pious,</hi> without the consent of the Lords: and
herewith concur all the <hi>Saxon</hi> infeodations, attested and confirmed by
Bishops, Abbots, Dukes, and others of the Nobility, under their several
hands.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Kings were not then like unto plumed Eagles, exposed to
the charity of the Fowls for food, but had a Royal maintenance suitable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64112:26"/>
to their Majesty. Their power was double, one as a <hi>Captain,</hi> another as
a <hi>King;</hi> the first was first, and made way for the second. As <hi>Captain,</hi> their
power was to lead the Army, punish according to Demerits, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Laws, and reward according to Discretion. As <hi>Captain,</hi> they
had by ancient custom the spoil left to their ordering by permission of
the Army, <hi>Exigunt Principis liberalitate illum Bellatorem equum, illam
cruentam &amp; victricem frameam;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and they were not wont in such cases to
be close handed (<hi>per bella raptus munificentiae materia</hi>) the spoils in these
wasted parts of <hi>Germany</hi> bring little other than Horses and Arms. But
after they came into <hi>Britain,</hi> the change of Soil made them more fat;
Horses and Arms were turned into Towns, Houses, Lands, and Cattle;
and these were distributed as spoils amongst the <hi>Saxon</hi> Souldiers by their
Generals; and this redounded to the maintenance of the State and port
of the great men, who were wont to be honoured <hi>non stipendiis sed muneri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bus;</hi>
and the people used <hi>ultro &amp; viritim conferre principibus, vel armentorum
vel frugum aliquid.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> But now upon the distribution of conquered Towns,
Houses, Lands, and Cattle in <hi>Britain,</hi> a yearly product of Victuals or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
service was reserved and allowed to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings by the people;
as the people allowed to <hi>Joshua</hi> his Land, <hi>Jos.</hi> 19. 46. So as they needed
no longer the former course of Offerings, but had enough to maintain
their Royal port, and great superfluity of Demesnes besides; as their
charity to the Church-men does sufficiently evidence. And by this means
all the Lands in <hi>England</hi> became mediately or immediately holden of the
Crown, and a setled maintenance annexed to the same; besides the casual
profits upon emergencies, or perquisites of <hi>Felons</hi> or <hi>Fugitives goods,
mines of Gold and Silver, Treasure trove, Mulcts</hi> for offences, and other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
which being originally in the Kings,<note place="margin">Mir. 101. 298.</note> were by them granted, and
made <hi>Royalties</hi> in the hands of Subjects,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 4.</note> as at this day.</p>
               <p>To the increase of his Majesty and maintenance, there was an access of
<hi>power,</hi> not to <hi>make, dispense</hi> with, or <hi>alter Laws,</hi> but to execute and act
the <hi>Laws established:</hi> and against this power there was no rising up, so
long as it, like an unfeathered Arrow, gadded not at random. It's true,
the Church-men or Prelates checked them often, but could never give
them the mate. For peace sake, Kings many times yielded much; yet
would no King of <hi>Saxon</hi> principles allow of any Canon that extolled the
Clergy's Authority above that of Kings. And though the placing and
displacing of Bishops seemed to be all Ecclesiastical work, yet would not
the Kings altogether connive (as the examples of <hi>Ina</hi> in placing a Bishop
in <hi>Wells; Offa,</hi> in making two Provinces of one; <hi>Cenulphus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malmesb. gest. pontif. lib. 3. gest. Reg. lib. 1 cap. 4.</note> in restoring
<hi>Polydorus; Edfrid,</hi> in deposing <hi>Wilfrid;</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, in
making <hi>Robert Norman</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> may induce into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion:
and for their own safety sake,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1095.</note> the Prelates thought it wisdom
for them sometimes to stoop to that power that at other times they must
be beholding to. And therefore though in <hi>Synodical disputes</hi> they would
hold with the Canon, yet in <hi>matters of Action</hi> would suit with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and thereby taught Princes to account of Canons but as Notions;
and politickly to put the honour of Commissioners upon these men.
Thus the current of both powers passing in one channel, made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
drink double Beer at once: the turns both of Pope and King were
competently served, and these men had the honour of the two-handed
Sword; and all seemed composed into a fair compromise. But the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
finding its Authority becalmed, endured this but as a burthen, till
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second's time, who by the like trick commended all to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64112:26"/>
the Crown, as from the Papal Benediction. For <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessour,
upon his foundation of the Abbey of <hi>Westminster,</hi> sent to the Pope for
his allowance and confirmation of what he had done, or was to do; and
to make way for the more favour, sent presents, and a confirmation of
<hi>Romescot.</hi> The Pope was so inflamed with such an abundant measure of
blessing, as he not onely granted the Kings desire, but also discharged
that Abbey from ordinary jurisdiction, made it a <hi>peculiar</hi> subject onely to
the Kings visitation,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 614.</note> and concluded his Bull with this Horn,<note place="margin">An. 1066.</note> 
                  <hi>Vobis vero
&amp; posteris vestris regibus committimus advocationem &amp; tuitionem ejusdem lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,
&amp; omnium totius Angliae Ecclesiarum; &amp; vice nostra, cum concilio Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum
&amp; Abbatum, constituatis ubique quae justa sunt.</hi> How the King took
the conclusion, I find not, but he could never make better use than by way
of <hi>estoppel,</hi> unless he meaned to sacrifice his own right as a thank-offering to
a shadow, which I find not that he or his next Successors ever did. But as
touching the Laity, Histories do not touch upon any conceit of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
Monarchical power. It's true, Kings had their excesses, yet all
was amended either by the body of the people, when they pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the matter, or by the Princes fair compliance when complaint was
made, and so the Law was saved.<note place="margin">Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <head>CHAP XVII. Of the Saxon Nobility.</head>
               <p>THe ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Nobility in <hi>Germany</hi> were the chiefest in action
both in War and in Peace. That rank of men was continued by
three means, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Birth</hi> or Blood, by <hi>Valour,</hi> and by <hi>Wisdom.</hi> The
first was rather at the first a stem arising out of the first two, than a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degree or kind: for Noble blood was at the first enobled by brave
actions, afterward continued in their honour to their Posterity, till by
as base courses it was lost, as it was gained by worthy Atchievements:
these were called <hi>Adelingi.</hi> The Nobility of <hi>Action</hi> consisted either in
matters of War or of Peace. Those of Peace arose principally from
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> which being gained for the most part by much experience, were
therefore called <hi>Aldermanni,</hi> or elder men. The Nobility of <hi>War</hi> arose
somewhat from <hi>valour</hi> or courage with wisdom, but more from good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess:
for many brave and fortunate Commanders have not been very
daring; and the bravest spirits, though wise,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 35.</note> have not been ever honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with good success: these were called <hi>Heretochii.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nitard. lib. 4.</note> Nevertheless all these
names or titles were used promiscuously in following times, and all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nobiles:</hi> But both that, and <hi>Duces, Satrape,</hi> and <hi>Comites,</hi> were all of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect, as the former were of the <hi>Saxon.</hi> Time also brought
others into this honourable Band, <hi>viz.</hi> The great <hi>Officers of the Kings
Houshold,</hi> and their attests are found amongst the Kings Charters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Nobles;</hi> and that much advanced the price of Kings; for he
that is worthy to be not onely Lord above Nobles, but Master of some,
may by a little courtesie prevail over all. This starry Heaven had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Orbs; some so high, as in common esteem they were next the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Heaven, having a tincture of Royal Blood, and at the next door
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64112:27"/>
to the Throne:<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Others, though not of so clear light, had nevertheless
no less powerful influence upon the people, but rather more, by how
much more nigher to them. Their power in matters of Peace or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Commonwealth, was exercised either collectively, or
apart and severally. In their meetings they ordered the smaller emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of the publick in convocating and directing the people. <hi>De mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noribus

                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> These <hi>minora</hi> are such as are subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the <hi>majora,</hi> and <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> require suddain order touching any
particular part or member of the Common-wealth. At other times they
visited their several Territories or Circuits, hearing and determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Controversie, and executing Judgment according to the known
Laws, <hi>Principes jura per pagos vicosque reddunt;</hi> Yet they had <hi>Comites</hi> of
the Country joyned with them, whereof afterward. This was their
course in <hi>German Saxony;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> but in <hi>England</hi> the new stem of Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
arising higher than all the rest, sucked much from them, and kept
them under: for the <hi>judiciary power</hi> was in time drawn up into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
order, and the Lords executed the same as Deputies from and under
him, designed thereto by <hi>Writs</hi> and Commissions, as it is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
noted of King <hi>Alfred.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> The Lords thus lessened in their <hi>judiciary</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
carried the less authority in their <hi>Votes</hi> and Consultations. The King
was a perpetual Moderator in that work, and it was no small advantage
he had thereby to sway the <hi>Votes.</hi> Men that are advanced, if they have
any excellency, soon gain admiration; and it's a hard thing for one that
hath yielded his heart to admiration, to keep it from adoration. This
hath mounted up Kings to the top more than their own ambition, and
made them undertake what they ought not, because we esteem more
highly of them than we ought. I speak not against due, but undue Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for had the <hi>Saxon</hi> Lords remembred themselves, and the true
nature of the authority of their King, they needed not to be amazed at
their check,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 333.</note> nor to give way to their passion, as they did many times,
and advised others to do the like. Nor had Kings by degrees become be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
controul, and uncapable to be advised. This errour the Lords espied
too late, and sometimes would remember their ancient right and power,
and did take boldness to set a Law upon the exorbitancy of their King,
as in that case of <hi>Aethelwolf</hi> and his Queen amongst others may appear:
but that was like some enterprizes,<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 854.</note> that owe more to extremity of occasion,

to the full pitch of freemen; for the Lord might acquit his own title of
<hi>bondage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> but no man could be made <hi>free</hi> without the act of the whole
body. And therefore the Historian saith, that they are not <hi>multum supra
servos,</hi> or scarce not servants. They are seldom of account in any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
never in any City: but in Kingdoms sometimes advanced above
the <hi>Freemen,</hi> yea, above Nobles. Those are now adays amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and rank of such as are called <hi>Copy-holders,</hi> who have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Protection</hi> from the Laws, but no priviledge of <hi>Vote</hi> in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Laws.</p>
               <p>The most inferiour of all, were those which were anciently called <hi>Laz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi>
or <hi>Slaves;</hi> those were the dregs of the people, and wholly at the will
of their Lord, to do any service, or undergo any punishment.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> And yet
the magnanimity of the <hi>Saxons</hi> was such, as they abhorred Tyranny:
and it was rarely used amongst them, by beating, torture, imprisonment,
or other hard usage, to compel them to serve; they would rather kill
them as Enemies. And this wrought Reverence in these men towards
their Lords, and maintained a kind of generosity in their mindes, that
they did many brave exploits; and many times not onely purchased their
own freedom, but also brought strength and honour to the Kingdom.
And though the insolency of the <hi>Danes</hi> much quelled this <hi>Saxon</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet was it revived again by the Confessors Laws, which ordained,
<hi>That the Lords should so demean themselves towards their men, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incur guilt against God, nor offence against the King;</hi> or, which is all one,
<hi>to respect them as Gods people, and the Kings Subjects.</hi> And thus much of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
degrees of men amongst the <hi>Saxons,</hi> being the materials of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
a model whereof in the making and executing of the Laws,
and manner thereof, now next ensueth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of the grand Council of the Saxons called the Micklemote.</head>
               <p>IT was originally a Council of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Freemen;</hi> afterwards,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> when
they assumed the title of a Kingdom, the <hi>King</hi> was a Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and generally President therein; but always intended to be present,
though actually and in his own person by emergent occasions he may be
absent, and sometimes by disability of his person he be unmeet to vote
or be President in such an Assembly. As it was in the Council at <hi>Clano</hi>
or <hi>Cleve</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malmesb. gest. Reg. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note> when the great case between the Monks and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Priests was concluded; the King was absent, as the story saith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his minority; and yet if Writers say true,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. An. 978.</note> he was then in the
Sixteenth year of his age. The Lords were also nevertheless in the same
condition of priviledge as formerly; and though it appeareth that the
Kings had gotten the priviledge of summoning the grand meeting in his
own name, yet it was by advice of the great men; and being met, their
Votes were no other in value than as formerly: for all their Laws
were <hi>ex consilio sapientum,</hi> and (for ought can appear out of antiquity)
the vote of the meanest continued as good as of the greatest, <hi>arbitrium
est penes plebem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> And thus the <hi>Micklemote</hi> or <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> of the <hi>Saxons</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> continued in the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Freemen,</hi> by the space of One
hundred and fifty years, and in some parts of <hi>England</hi> nigh Two hundred
years before ever the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops foot entred, or the <hi>Roman</hi>-Clergy
crept into the Councils of State. Afterwards the Prelates were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>de bene esse,</hi> for advice, as <hi>sapientes,</hi> and continued by allowance; how
canonically, <hi>ipsi viderint,</hi> for I understand it not (especially as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
was then expounded) <hi>Nemo militans Deo implicet negotiis saeculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi>
yet if they be allowed (what in those days they ordinarily took up)
a degree of policy above devotion, that knot is also soon untied. I say,
they entred as <hi>Sapientes,</hi> not as <hi>Prelati,</hi> or Church-governours; for then
they had holden the same power in Church-matters agitated in the <hi>Witta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genmote,</hi>
that they had usurped in their Synods which they held onely for
Church-visitation; which they could never have, because the <hi>Sapientes
Regni</hi> had their votes therein as freely as they. Nor could the Prelates
by any Law entitle themselves to such power or priviledge, so contrary
to the priviledge of the <hi>Wittagenmote.</hi> For though it be true, that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Priests had a liberty to be present in these grand Assemblies, and to
have some presidency therein, as to command silence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is not title
to these,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> unless they will interest themselves as their Successors, to possess
by a <hi>jus Divinum</hi> that <hi>jus Diabolicum</hi> (which those Priests formerly had)
in a way of immediate providence; somewhat like the possession of the
Mantle of <hi>Eliah</hi> found by <hi>Elishah.</hi> They might, I grant, plead the title
from Kings; but, it must be granted also, that Kings as yet had no more
power over the Church than in the Commonwealth. Nor could they
have that from the Lords, which the Lords never had, but was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
amongst the <hi>majora,</hi> and of which the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> had the only
cognizance, as it will appear in some particulars ensuing.</p>
               <p>Unto the King, Lords, and Clergy, must be added, as I said, the Freemen,
to make up the <hi>Micklemote</hi> compleat; and though it be true that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of story speaks of this grand meeting from their being in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64112:28"/>
until after the coming of <hi>Austin;</hi> yet whenas the <hi>Saxon</hi> Histories
then find them in the same condition that the <hi>German</hi> story leaves them,
it is very probable that in the interval they continued their wonted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
although they had no Learning to leave monuments thereof unto
the world, And hereof the examples are not rare, in those remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that those ancient times have left us. For within six years after <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>

after him reformed the former Laws <hi>consulto sapientum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 22.</note> After him <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
called a Council,<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 53.</note> in which was the Archbishop, and with him the
<hi>Optimates &amp; sapientes frequentissimi,</hi> besides others, whereof I shall treat
now that I come to the matters handled in this Court.</p>
               <p>The matters in agitation in the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> generally, were all both
of publick and private concernment. That which concerned the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
were such as regarded removal of inconveniencies, such as are
Laws for Leagues and Affinity with other Nations for preventing of
War. And thus became the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britons</hi> united, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
feud between those two Nations laid aside,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 219.</note> and they made one:
And the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> reconciled,<note place="margin">Ll. Lamb. Cantab. fol. 36.</note> by a Covenant agreed unto, and
sworn between both Nations. The like also may be said of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of War of defence against Forrain Invasion. Matters of publick and
general charge also were debated and concluded in that Assembly,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. Lamb. Cant. fol. 139.</note> as
the payment of Tithes, it is said they were granted <hi>Rege, Baronibus, &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo.</hi>
Such also as concerned the Church; for so <hi>Edwin</hi> the King of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> upon his marriage with a Christian Lady, being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
to renounce his Paganism, answered, he would so do,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. p. 51.</note> if that his
Queens Religion should be accounted more holy and honourable to God
by the <hi>wise men,</hi> and <hi>Princes of his Kingdom.</hi> And all the Church-Laws
in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time were made in the <hi>Micklemote.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 127.</note> Monasteries were by
their general consent dedicated,<note place="margin">Ibid. 321.</note> and their Possessions confirmed. The
City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made the Metropolitan. Matters also of private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
were there proceeded upon, as not onely general grievances, but
perverting of Justice in case of private persons: as in that Council cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Synodale concilium</hi> under <hi>Beornulfus</hi> the Mercian King,<note place="margin">Ibid. 332.</note>

                     </gap>, seu quis injuste sit spoliatus.</hi> The name
of which Council called <hi>Synodal,</hi> mindeth me to intimate that which I
have often endeavoured to find out, but yet cannot, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
difference between the <hi>general Synods</hi> and the <hi>Wittagenmote,</hi> unless
merely in the first occasion of the summons. And if there be any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to be allowed to that book called, <hi>The Mirrour of Justices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 1. Sec. 3.</note> it tells us,
that this Grand Assembly is to confer of the Government of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
how they may be kept from sin, live in quiet, and have right done
them, according to the Customs and Laws; and more especially of
wrong done by the King, Queen, or their Children;<note place="margin">Sec. 2.</note> for that the King
may not by himself or Justices determine Causes wherein himself is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
And to sum up all,<note place="margin">Cap. 4. Sec. 11.</note> it seemeth a Court made to rise and stoop
according to occasion.</p>
               <p>The manner of debate was concluded by Vote, and the sum taken in the
gross by noise; like to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> who determined what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<hi>clamore non calculis;</hi> yet when the noise was doubtful,<note place="margin">Plut. Lycurg. Thucyd. lib. 1. de Lacedem.</note> they took
the votes severally. The meeting of the <hi>Saxons</hi> at this Assembly in the
first times was certain, <hi>viz.</hi> at the new and full Moon.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> But Religion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64112:29"/>
changing, other things changed these times to the Feasts of <hi>Easter, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi>
and the Nativity; at which times they used to present themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King at his Court, for the honour of his person, and to consult
and provide for the affairs of his Kingdom; and at such times Kings used
to make shew of themselves in their greatest pomp, crowned with their
Royal Crown.<note place="margin">An. 1158.</note> This custom continued till the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the second,
who at <hi>Worcester</hi> upon the day of the Nativity offered his Crown upon
the Altar, and so the Ceremony ceased.</p>
               <p>This grand Assembly thus constituted was, holden <hi>sacred;</hi> and all the
Members, or that had occasion therein, were under the <hi>Publick faith</hi> both
in going and coming, unless the party were <hi>fur probatus.</hi> If a Member
were wronged, the Delinquent payed double damages, and fine to the
King,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 127.</note> by a Law made by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> above a Thousand years ago. This
priviledge of <hi>Safe pass</hi> being thus ancient and fundamental, and not by
any Law taken away,<note place="margin">Ll Canut. p. 2. cap. 79.</note> resteth still in force. But how far it belongeth to
such as are no Members,<note place="margin">Ll. Ed. cap. 35.</note> and have affairs nevertheless depending on that
Court, I am not able to determine; yet it seemeth that Priviledge out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacheth
Members: unless we should conceit so wide, that the State did
suppose that a Member might be a notorious and known <hi>Thief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, this Assembly, though it were called the <hi>Wittagenmote,</hi> or the
meeting of <hi>wise men,</hi> yet all that would come might be present, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their liking or disliking of the Proposition, <hi>si displicuit sententia fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitu
aspernatur, si placuit frameas concutiunt.</hi> And some hints I meet with,
that this course continued here in <hi>England:</hi> for some Presidents run, in
<hi>magna servorum Dei frequentia;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Lamb. p. 1.</note> and that of <hi>Ina, commune concilium senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
&amp; populorum totius Regni,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 219.</note> in another Council by him holden. The
Council of <hi>Winton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ingulfus.</note> 
                  <hi>An</hi> 855. is said to be in the presence of the great
men, <hi>aliorumque fidelium infinita multitudine:</hi> and it will appear that it
continued thus after the <hi>Norman</hi> times. What power the <hi>vulgar</hi> had to
controul the Vote of the <hi>wise men,</hi> I find not; <hi>fremitu aspernabantur,</hi> it is
said, and probably it was a touch of the rudeness of those times; for it
was not from any positive Law of the Nation, but a fundamental Law in
Nature, that <hi>wise men</hi> should make Laws; and that the supream Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should rest in the <hi>Wittagenmote,</hi> was never an honour bestowed upon
it by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but an endowment from the light of Reason; which can
never be taken away from them by that headless conceit <hi>provoco ad popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
but that Body must be as monstrous as the <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> whose heads
are too nigh their belly to be wise.</p>

               <p>THis in the first condition was a meeting onely of the <hi>Lords,</hi> for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in emergent cases, concerning the government and good of
the Commonwealth, and for the promoting of administration of Justice;
these the Historian calls <hi>Minora,</hi> because they were to serve onely the
present passions of State. Afterwards, when they had gotten a King into
their number, they had so much the more work as might concern due cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
between him and the people, and of themselves towards both.
This work was not small, especially in those times of the growth of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64112:29"/>
Kings, but much greater by the access of <hi>Prelates</hi> into their number;
with whom came also a glut of Church-affairs, that continually increased
according as the Prelates ambition swelled; so as this Council might seem
to rule the Church alone in those days, whenas few motions that any
way concerned Church-men, but were resolved into the <hi>Prelatical cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi>
as the <hi>minora Ecclesiae.</hi> And thus under the colour of the <hi>minora

                  <note place="margin">Mag. cent. 8. cap. 9.</note> this mixt Council of Lords came by
degrees to intermeddle too far in the <hi>magnalia Regni.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 712.</note> For by this means
the worshipping of Images and the Mass was obtruded upon the <hi>Saxons</hi>
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop and his Legate,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 189.</note> and the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 694.</note>
and decreed, <hi>That no Temporal or Lay-person shall possess any Ecclesiastical
possessions. That elections of Ecclesiastical persons and Officers shall be by
Bishops. That the possessions of Church men shall be free from all Lay-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Taxes.</hi> And in one sum, they did any thing that bound not
the whole body of the <hi>Freemen.</hi> In which had these Lords reflected more
upon the office, and less upon the person, and not at all upon their private
interest, they doubtless had been a blessing to their Generations, and a
Golden Scepter in the hand of a righteous King: But contrarily missing
their way, they became a Sword in the Kings hand against the Subjects, a
snare to the Kingdom; and, had not the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> in their meeting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
those distempers, the <hi>Saxon</hi>-government had been little other than a

               <p>AS the condition of States or Kingdoms are diversly considered in
War and Peace, so also must their Government be: For howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
War in it self be but a feaverish Distemper in a Commonwealth, yet
in some cases it is as necessary, as a kindly Ague in due season is for the
preservation of the Body; which many times takes distemper rather
from the excellency of its constitution, than from the abundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
Nor did the temper of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Commonwealth ever shine
more than in War, while it set a Law upon that which ordinarily is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of all mis-rule and confusion, and so fought by rule rather than by
passion.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Their <hi>Chief</hi> in the first times was chosen by the <hi>Freemen</hi> in the
Field,<note place="margin">Ll. Ed. cap. 35.</note> either at the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> or the <hi>Folkmote,</hi> according to the extent
of his command; being carried upon a Shield born upon their shoulders, like
as now Knights of the Shire are. This Emblem they entertained him
with, to declare their trust in him, and the work that was expected from
him. His first title was <hi>Heretock,</hi> afterwards he was called <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Dux;</hi>
the latter whereof turned to a bare Title in the conclusion, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
maintained its own honour so long as the name lasted.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> After his
election, all sware to be at his order, and not to forsake him. This was a
trick of imbased times: for though the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Law was positive,
that <hi>none should flie or break his Rank, but get the Victory or die;</hi> yet were
they neither bound by Oath or Penalty, shame in those times being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worse than death by those brave minds. But times growing
more old, grew also more base-spirited, and men could not be (drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the field) holden in Rank by Oaths or Honour; and this occasioned
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64112:30"/>
that Law of <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Lamb. Cantab. 10.</note> that in such case a Country-Gentleman
should be fined One hundred and twenty shillings if he were landed;
but if otherwise,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 528.</note> Sixty shillings, and the Yeoman Thirty shillings; and
afterwards the penalty was increased to the forfeiture of all the estate of
the Delinquent.<note place="margin">An. 1009.</note> In their Wars they went forth by bodies collectively, as
they were united by the law of pledges; this made them stick close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for the honour of their Families and Friends, and rendered their
encounters mortal,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and to the worsted party commonly fatal: for once
beaten in the field, they could hardly recover either by rallying or gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new Army. Probable it is that the Lords might have their <hi>Villains</hi>
to follow them in the Battle, but the strength consisted of the <hi>Freemen;</hi> and
though many were bound by <hi>tenure</hi> to follow their Lords to the Wars,
and many were <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> yet it seems all were bound upon call under peril
of Fine,<note place="margin">Ll. Ed. cap. 35.</note> and were bound to keep Arms for the preservation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
their Lords, and their own persons; and these they might neither
pawn nor sell, but leave them to descend to their Heirs, and in default of
them, to their Lord, and in default of him, to their chief pledge, and for
want of such to the King. They mustered their Arms once every year
both in Towns and Hundreds, <hi>viz.</hi> the morrow after <hi>Candlemas;</hi> and such
whose bodies were unfit for service, were to find sufficient men for service
in their stead.<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 58.</note> They were strict in their Discipline, if they followed their
rule, which was made not by the arbitry of the General, but by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These, amongst other scattered principles concerning Sea-affairs,
may serve to let us know that the <hi>Law-martial,</hi> and that of the <hi>Sea,</hi> were
branches of the positive Laws of the Kingdom, setled by the general
Vote in the <hi>Wittagenmote,</hi> and not left to the will of a lawless General or
Commander; so tender and uniform were those times both in their Laws
and Liberties.</p>

having found the Land already divided into several parts called <hi>Comitatus,</hi>

being the Lieutenant,<note place="margin">Sheriffs.</note> and aided by the <hi>power of the County</hi> in certain
cases; for his Commission extended not to leavy War, but to maintain
Justice in that County, and within the same; and in this work, he was
partly ministerial, and partly judicial: in the one he was the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to execute his Writs; in the other he regulated the Courts of Justice
under his Survey.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 35.</note> He was chosen in the County-Court called the <hi>Folk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi>
by the Votes of the <hi>Freeholders;</hi> and as the King himself, and the
<hi>Heretock,</hi> were intituled to their honour by the <hi>peoples favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Coroner,</hi> though in original later,<note place="margin">Coroners.</note> was nevertheless very ancient:
he was the more Servant or Officer to the King, of the two. His work
was to enquire upon view of Manslaughter, and by Indictment of all
Felonies as done <hi>contra Coronam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 1. Sect. 13.</note> which formerly were only <hi>contra Pacem,</hi>
and triable only by appeal. And also he was to enquire of all Escheats
and Forfeitures, and them to seize. He was also to receive appeals of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
and to keep the rolls of the Crown-pleas within the County. It's
evident he was an Officer in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time;<note place="margin">Miror. p. 300.</note> for that King put a Judge to
death, for sentencing one to suffer death upon the <hi>Coroners</hi> record, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
allowing the Delinquent liberty of Traverse. This Officer also was
made by election of the <hi>Freeholders</hi> in their County-Court,<note place="margin">Fitz N. Br. 163, 164.</note> as the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi>
was, and from amongst the men of chiefest rank in the County, and
sworn in their presence; but the Kings Writ led the work.</p>

               <p>THE Government of the County in times of peace, consisted much
in the administration of Justice, which was done in the publick
meetings of the <hi>Freeholders;</hi> and their meetings were either in one place,
or in several parts of the County: in each of which the Sheriff had the
managing of the acts done there.<note place="margin">Folkmote, <hi>or</hi> County-court.</note> The meeting of the <hi>Free-men</hi> in one
place was called the <hi>Folkmote</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi> (saving the judgment of the
honourable Reporter, <hi>Coke Instit. 2. p.</hi> 69.) and of latter times the <hi>County-Court:</hi>
the work wherein, was partly for consultation and direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ordering of the County, for the safety and peace thereof;
such as were redress of Grievances, election of Officers, prevention of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and partly it was judicial,<note place="margin">Miror. p. 147.</note> in hearing and determining the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pleas of the County, the Church-affairs, and some trespasses done
therein; but not matters criminal, for the Bishop was Judge therein, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Sheriff;</hi> and by the Canon he was not to intermeddle in
matters of Blood: yet neither was the Bishops nor Sheriffs work in that
Court, other than directory or declaratory; for the <hi>Free-men</hi> were Judges
of the act, and the other did but <hi>edocere jura populo;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Canut. Miror. cap. 1. Sec. 15.</note> yet in special cases
upon petition, a Commission issued forth from the King to certain Judges
of <hi>Oier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> to joyn with the others in the hearing and determining of such
particular cases. But in case of injustice or errour, the party grieved had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64112:31"/>
liberty of <hi>appeal</hi> to the Kings Justice.<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. Ll. Edgar.</note> Nor did the Common Pleas
originally commence in the County-Court, unless the parties dwelt
in several Liberties or Hundreds in the same County; and in case any
mistake were in the commencing of Suits in that Court, which ought
not to be, upon complaint, the Kings Writ reduced it to its proper place;
and in this also the Kings own Court had no preheminence. In those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times this <hi>County-Court</hi> was to be holden but twice a year,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 197. tit. 22. Ll. Edw. cap. 35.</note> by the
constitution of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> but upon urgent emergencies oftner; and
that either by the Kings special Writ, or if the emergent occasions were
sudden and important, by extraordinary summons of ringing the Moot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.
Unto this Court all the <hi>Free-men</hi> of the County assembled to
learn the Law, to administer Justice,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 35.</note> to provide remedy for publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
and to do their fealty to the King before the Bishop and
Sheriff upon Oath; and in the work of administring Justice, causes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church must have the precedency;<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 4.</note> so as yet the Canon-Law
had not gotten footing in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The other Court wherein the <hi>Sheriff</hi> had the direction,<note place="margin">Sheriffs Torne.</note> was in the
meeting of the <hi>Free-men</hi> in several parts of the County; and this was
anciently,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 1. Sec. 16.</note> and now is called the <hi>Sheriffs Torne;</hi> which simply considered,
is but a <hi>Hundred-Court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edgar. cap. 5.</note> or the Sheriffs <hi>Torne</hi> to keep the Hundred-Court.
It was ordered to be kept twice every year, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Lady-day</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi>
or soon after.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 35.</note> Unto this Court all the <hi>Free-holders</hi> of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
repaired,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. p. 2. cap. 17.</note> and there they, the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Sheriff,</hi> executed the same
power and work for kind, that they did in the <hi>County-Court.</hi> In this Court
all the Suits in the Hundred-Court depending, had their determination,
and others had their commencement and proceedings, as well the Pleas
of the Crown as others. Some have conceived it to be a <hi>County-Court,</hi>
or superiour thereto; but there being no ground thereof, I conceive it to
be no other than a Visitation of the County by parcels or in circuit.</p>

               <p>COunties were too great to meet upon every occasion; and every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
too mean to put the whole County to that charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and this induced sub-divisions; the first whereof is that of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
now, and also anciently so called; but as ancient (if not more) is
the name <hi>Pagus;</hi> for the Historian tells us, that the <hi>Germans,</hi> in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of their Laws, a <hi>hundred</hi> of the <hi>Free-men</hi> joyned with the chief
Lord <hi>per pagos vicosque,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> which first were called <hi>Centenarii,</hi> or <hi>Hundre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
from their number; but used for a title of Honour, like the <hi>Triarii.</hi>
And as a second hereunto, I shall add that testimony of the Council at
<hi>Berkhamsted,</hi> which speaking the reduction of Suits from the Kings
Court <hi>ad pagi vel loci praepositum;</hi> in other places it is rendred, <hi>to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Hundred or Burrough.</hi> And at this day in <hi>Germany,</hi> their
Country is divided into Circuits, called <hi>Centen</hi> or <hi>Canton,</hi> and <hi>Centengriecht;</hi>
and the <hi>Hundreders</hi> they call <hi>Centgraven,</hi> or <hi>Hundred-chiefes,</hi> whether for
Government in time of peace,<note place="margin">Cluer. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> or for command in time of War; the latter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64112:31"/>
whereof, the word <hi>Wapentake</hi> doth not a little favour. Amongst these,
one was (<hi>per eminentiam</hi>) called the <hi>Centgrave</hi> or <hi>Lord of the Hundred,</hi> and
thereunto elected by the <hi>Free men</hi> of that Hundred, and unto whom they
granted a stipend in the nature of a Rent,<note place="margin">Malmesb. Reg. gest. p. 54.</note> called <hi>Hundredsettena,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the government of the same. The division of the County in
this manner, was done by the <hi>Free-men</hi> of the County, who are the sole
Judges thereof, if <hi>Polydores</hi> testimony may be admitted; and it may
seem most likely that they ruled their division at the first, according to
the multitude of the Inhabitants; which did occasion the great inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Hundreds</hi> at this day. The Government of the <hi>Hundred</hi> rested
at the first upon the Lord and the <hi>Hundredars;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Alured. cap. 4.</note> but afterwards by <hi>Alfred</hi>
they were found inconvenient, because of the multitude, and reduced to
the Lord or his Bailiff, and <hi>twelve</hi> of the Hundred; and these <hi>twelve</hi> were
to be sworn, neither to condemn the Innocent, nor acquit the Nocent.
This was the <hi>Hundred Court,</hi> which by the Law was to be holden once
every Month; and it was a mixt Court of Common-pleas and Crown-pleas:
for the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws order,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. 35.</note> that in it there should be done justice to
Thieves;<note place="margin">Ll. Aetheldr. 1.</note> and the trial in divers cases in that Court is by <hi>Ordeale.</hi> Their
Common-pleas were cases of a middle nature,<note place="margin">Ll. Aethelst. 20</note> as well concerning <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi>
persons and things, as <hi>secular;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 32.</note> for the greater matters were by

               <p>THis was the last subdivision of the County, and that rested upon

to be worthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> story, and therefore may rather be thought
an extract from <hi>Moses</hi> Law, introduced by <hi>Alfred</hi> or his direction. I say,
this rested on the persons, and not upon the place; for though the <hi>Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
were comprehended within certain bounds, yet the <hi>Decenners</hi> were
not limited but only within the limits of the <hi>Hundred.</hi> And of these
also, it appeareth to me there were divers sorts; for such matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
that did arise amongst the <hi>Decenners,</hi> if of greater moment, were
referred to the <hi>chiefer Justices,</hi> which were appointed <hi>super decem decanes,</hi>
which I conceive were <hi>ten chief pledges;</hi> and these might bear the names
of the <hi>Centeners,</hi> although they be not the <hi>Centgraven:</hi> and the rather I
incline thereto, because in all probability there must needs be above one
hundred <hi>Free-holders</hi> in <hi>Hundredo;</hi> and all <hi>Free-men</hi> were <hi>Decenners,</hi> that
is, ranked into several <hi>tens;</hi>

case of default of appearance, his nine pledges should have one and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64112:32"/>
thirty days to bring the Delinquent forth to justice. If this failed, then
the chief of those <hi>Decenners</hi> by the votes of that and the Neighbour <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
was to purge himself and his fellow-pledges, both of the guilt of the
fact, and of being parties to the flight of the Delinquent. And if they
could not this do, then were they by their own Oaths to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to bind themselves to bring the Delinquent to justice as soon
as they could; and in the mean time, to pay the damage out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the Delinquent; and if that were not sufficient, then out of their
own Estate;<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 15.</note> but if the Delinquents Estate was sufficient, the surplussage
thereof remained with the pledges. And lastly, the Master of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was a <hi>pledge</hi> for his whole Family.<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 28.</note> This was the Law of <hi>Decenners,</hi>
and may seem to be somewhat a rigorous Law, not only in case of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency,
but also for their abode;<note place="margin">Ll. Alured. cap. 33.</note> for none of them might depart from
their dwelling without consent of his fellow-pledges,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. p. 2. cap. 15.</note> nor out of the
County without allowance of the Sheriff, or other Governour of the
same.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 20.</note> And if any controversie arose between the pledges, the chief

               <p>WE have hitherto trod in the road-way of the Government of
the Common-wealth; but private regards have made by-paths,
which we must trace, or else the footsteps in many particulars
will remain unknown. These are called <hi>Exemptions,</hi> but more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<hi>Francheses,</hi> from which scarce any part of the Kingdom remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
free; and are to be considered, either in regard of the place or person.
In the latter I intend that of the Church-men, whose Persons and Estates,
in many particulars, were exempted from the civil power of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Their persons devoted to a peculiar work, they would have to be
under a peculiar Law, called the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> which at the first extended
only to their own persons, and that only <hi>pro reformatione morum:</hi> for so
an Archbishop tells us,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 258.</note> that it did teach <hi>quomodo Canonici, id est, regulares
Clerici vivere debent;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edw. Conf.</note> but when it grew to its full charge, it gave a louder
report, <hi>Quicunque aliquid tenuerit, vel in fundo Ecclesiae mansionem habuerit,
extra curiam Ecclesiasticam non placitabit quamvis foris fecerit.</hi> And thus
as Church-ground increased by the blind charity of those times, so long
Church-men multiplied, and the Canon inlarged from the persons of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars</hi>
to all Clergy-men, and from them to their Tenants and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
from thence to certain Spiritual or Ecclesiastical crimes or scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
wherever they were found; and wherever it touched, it took and
bound by <hi>Excommunication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 7.</note> and upon <hi>significavit,</hi> being first delivered to
<hi>Satan,</hi> they delivered him over to the Sentence of the Law, <hi>to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</hi>
If the offender be out of reach by the space of thirty and one
days, he is <hi>Outlawed;</hi> so as there is no way left to escape the Church-fury.</p>

now called the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> in which was a peculiar Government,
so far as concerned administration of justice; for otherwise the subjects
each of them submitted themselves to the service of their own Prince.
This was therefore a third, different, and mixt Government, agreed upon
joyntly between the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who after a long and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
War, (wherein both peoples were well wearied) by degrees became
Friends, entered Traffick, and into the strictest Societies by Marriage.
Thus finding the sweetness of peace, they provide against future occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and agree in one Law, and upon a certain number of Judges e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by common consent, who were to see to the execution of these Laws
as joynt <hi>Assessors.</hi> From these, as I conceive, arose those which are now
called the <hi>Lords Marchers,</hi> and were at the first twelve in number, <hi>viz.</hi>

although it is not of the Essence of a <hi>Manor,</hi> nor ought the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64112:33"/>
words of <hi>Bracton</hi> to be construed according to the literal sense;<note place="margin">Bracton. fol. 212.</note> for the
house may be destroyed, and yet the <hi>Manor</hi> continue; and the ground
was granted in tenure before any house built thereupon. The quantity
of the ground thus given to hold by Service, was according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Lord more or less, and therefore might extend into divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes;
as on the other part, one Town might comprehend divers <hi>Manors.</hi>
The Estate that was granted, depended partly on the condition of the
Grantee:<note place="margin">Fleta. lib. 4. cap. 15.</note> for some were <hi>servi</hi> or <hi>Bond-men,</hi> and their Estate was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the will of the Lord, as was also the benefit; but the servants
merit, and the Lords benignity concurring with some Conscience of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as the light grew more clear, abated the rigour of the tenure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which we now call <hi>Copy-hold.</hi> Other Estates were made to the
<hi>Free men,</hi> which in the first times were only for years; albeit therein they
were not niggardly, for they sticked not at Leases for a hundred years,<note place="margin">Ingulfus Croyl.</note> yet
with a render of Rent, which in those days was of Corn or other Victual;
and thence the Leases so made were called <hi>Feormes</hi> or <hi>Farmes,</hi> which
word signifieth Victuals. But times ensuing, turned the Victual into
Money, and terms of years to terms of lite and inheritance, retaining
the <hi>Rents,</hi> and those called <hi>Quit-rents,</hi> or the Rents of those persons
that are <hi>acquitted or free.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gloss. 1. 58. Ll. Saxon. 16, 17. Lamb.</note> But in case of estates of inheritance for the
most part after the death of the Tenants were reserved <hi>Heriots</hi> or a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi>
which were not left to the will of the Lord, but was put in certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the very letter of the Law:<note place="margin">Gloss. 348. Ll. Canut. p. 1. cap. 69.</note> for according to each mans degree,
such was his <hi>Relief</hi> or <hi>Heriot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But over and above all, they reserved special service to be done by the
person of the Tenant, or some other by his procurement, of which
those that were their <hi>servi</hi> or <hi>villains</hi> were at the will of the Lord: others
had their particular service set down in their grants. These concerned
either War or Peace; the former was afterwards called the service of the
<hi>Knight</hi> or <hi>Souldier;</hi> the latter the service of the <hi>Husbandman</hi> or <hi>Plough.</hi>
That of the <hi>Souldier</hi> was the more honourable,<note place="margin">Knight-service.</note> and suitable to the old
<hi>German</hi> trade; <hi>Pigrum &amp; iners videtur sudore acquirere quod possis sanguine
parare:</hi> and the work was to defend the Kingdom, the Lords person and
Honour; and to this end he was ever to have his weapons in readiness,
which gave name to the <hi>service,</hi> and altered as times and customs
changed. This <hi>service</hi> by custom, from a work degenerated into the
bare Title, and became a dignity: and the men named, or rather intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Milites;</hi> and many of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Charters were attested by men bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Title; yet the service itself was far more ancient, and called <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicium
loricae;</hi> of which sort also were the <hi>Custodes pagani</hi> that wore a
Helmet, a coat of Mail, and a guilt Sword: not unlike the old <hi>German</hi>
way of calling forth of their <hi>Tirones</hi> to the war.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Of this rank some
were more eminent than others; for some bare the single title of Knight,
and, it seemed, served on foot: others served on horseback, and were
called <hi>Rad knights,</hi> or <hi>Knights-riders,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> noteth;<note place="margin">Selden. Spicil.</note> and these I take
to be the <hi>Vavasours,</hi> noted in the Conquerours Laws: for that their <hi>relief</hi>
is a Helmet, a Coat of Mail, a Shield, a Sphear, and a horse. Now for
the maintaining of this service, they had Lands and Tenements called
<hi>Knights-Fees,</hi> which bound the owner to that <hi>service,</hi> into whose hands
soever they came, to be done either by the person of the owner, or other
fit person by him procured, and therefore were discharged from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Taxes and Tollage, which was the Law of the <hi>Goths</hi> of
old, and remains in <hi>Sweden</hi> at this day.<note place="margin">Co. Litlet. 75. Bureus.</note> The number of these <hi>Fees</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64112:34"/>
much increased, so as in the Conquerours time they were above sixty
thousand, which was a mighty body for a small Island, and brought
much honour to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But the profit arose from beneath, I mean from the <hi>soccage tenure</hi> or
service of the Plough,<note place="margin">Soccage tenure.</note> which in the first times was performed by those
that were unfit for the service of the Wars, either being green and
young, or decrepit and aged; and sometimes by the Women. But after
that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Conquest was at a stop,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and that no more was to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Blood, men endeavoured to satisfie their desires by sweat, and
turned their Swords into Plough-shares; and thus the Husbandry increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
exceedingly, and hath proved the best Pillar of the Common-weal;
the nature of this tenure is fully set out by the Reporter; nor can I add
thereto more than the Law of the Confessor concerning these men, <hi>viz.
That no man might trouble them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co. Litlet. fol. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>but for their Rent, nor any Lord thrust them
out of their Farm, so long as they do their service.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 33. Spiceleg.</note> And thus it appeareth,
that the <hi>service</hi> became in nature of a condition subsequent, begetting an
increaser of the Estate,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 33.</note> which by continuance wrought an inheritance,
and so the Title of Entry was turned wholly into distresses for service not
performed; yet the Lord was no looser thereby, so long as <hi>Heriots, Rents,</hi>
and <hi>Services</hi> accrewed unto him.</p>

               <p>BY Grants made by Lords unto Tenants already noted, the Lords had
power by common right to call their Tenants before them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
concerning their payment of Rents, and performance of service,
which became Courts of constant appointment: of which sort there-were
two, one for the Free-men, the other for the Bond-men; and this

                  <note place="margin">Court-leet.</note> The Court of <hi>Free-men</hi>
was holden from three weeks to three weeks, wherein the <hi>Free-men,</hi>
as in the <hi>Hundred</hi> and <hi>County</hi> were Judges of the fact,<note place="margin">Miror. p. 17.</note> and from them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

manumitted or <hi>Free-men.</hi> In this Court all Actions or Suits between the
<hi>Free-men</hi> of the same <hi>Manor,</hi> and within the same arising, were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
nor could any Court (no not the Kings) intermeddle with such
Suits before Trial had; but by the Lords allowance. And upon this
priviledge, the Writ of <hi>right Patent</hi> was grounded. But the full nature
of this Court is not within my intention, but I must refer the Reader to
the Law-books.<note place="margin">F. N. Br. 2.</note> For it was the least part of the work and power which
this Court obtained by continuance of time; in regard that <hi>Manors</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
multiplied, so as no part of the Land was left free; and many one
of them extended into divers <hi>Decennaries,</hi> the Lords obtained great power
over them, and had of Kings, grants of <hi>view of Frank-pledge</hi> within their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

<hi>Coroner</hi> within the <hi>Mannor</hi> to take Presentments, and certifie them
to the <hi>Coroner</hi> of the County. And thus this Court swallowed up much of
the power of the <hi>Decenners</hi> Court in the very infancie, so as we find no
foot-steps of any Writ of Right to the <hi>Decenners,</hi> or Chief-pledges; but
contrariwise many views of Frank-pledge granted to particular persons in
the time of <hi>Alfred:</hi>

Courts of these <hi>Mannors,</hi> as is to be yet seen in many ancient Court-Rolls.</p>
               <p>The other Court, which by common Right belonged to the Lords of
<hi>Mannors,</hi> was that of the Copy-holders, called or rather included under
the name of the <hi>Court-Baron;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Court-Baron.</note> which albeit it is called in the ordinary
stile <hi>Curia Baronum,</hi> yet not so properly, as I conceive; and it may be by
way of mistake for <hi>Baronis:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co. Instit. cap. 57.</note> for if it were so properly united formerly to
the Court of <hi>Free-men,</hi> as (<hi>ab excellentiori</hi>) it always passed under that
name, yet when that Court is omitted, and slipt out of the way, the
Court of <hi>Copy holders</hi> that remaineth, improperly retaineth the name of
that which is gone. This Court at the first was intended onely for the
Lords benefit, and for the Tenants right, as subservient thereunto. I say,
the Tenants right, not against their Lord; for they had no right against
him: but against any other they had protection of Law, both for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Estates. And, as I said before, by custom, or rather light
of Religion, their persons and Estates were considerable, even by the Lords
themselves.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw.</note> Which also caused a Law to be made, <hi>ut sic de suis hominibus
agant, quatenus erga Deum reatum non incurrant, &amp; Regem non offendant.</hi>
Which Law could never be intended of the <hi>Free-holders;</hi> for it had been
a vain redundancy to have made an especial Law for that, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the known fundamental Law of the Kingdom, against which
a speedy remedy lay by the Kings Writ. And these men, how mean so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
had even in those days a kind of <hi>Property</hi> both in Lands and Goods:

to their <hi>Bond-men,</hi> surely much rather, after their coming into this Island;

               <p>THE next <hi>Franchese</hi> is that of Towns: This was taken up as a
Birth of War and Nurse of Peace; for their Ancestors liked not
to dwell in crowds, <hi>ne pati quidem inter se junctas sedes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> it being their
trade or pastime to war upon Beasts, when they found no Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. This solitudinary custom could not be soon shaken off,
and might well occasion multitudes of Towns in those times (though small
ones doubtless) that Writers speak of; if true it be, that after the wasting
times of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> in the Conquerours time, were found in
<hi>England,</hi> Forty five thousand Parishes, and Sixty two thousand Villages.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64112:35"/>
Nor was Peace less beneficial to them, than they careful of it; for by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Peace, Husbandry, Manifactures, and Commerce, occasioned
people to gather to places commodious for Habitation, in good Soil, nigh
Navigable Rivers or Havens; and according to their scituation and trade,
so they swelled in multitude or decayed. Some of whom growing more
eminent than others, more care was had of their government and safety;
for the latter by building of Walls and Castles, and for the former by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a Magistracy peculiar to that place or Township; not as so many
<hi>Decenners,</hi> but as one body consisting of many members. And thus by
custom they grew to be <hi>Fraternities,</hi> or <hi>Corporations</hi> under one Magistrate
or Head, whom they called <hi>Alderman;</hi> and held a Court of Justice (at the
first holden twice a year) which was in nature of a <hi>Leet</hi> with a view of
Frank-pledge,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 44. Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> as may appear in the cases of <hi>Dorchester, Circester,</hi> and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
in <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time: and herewith they had publick Markets, which
served them for their better conveniencies.</p>
               <p>This priviledge of <hi>Market</hi> was a liberty of publick sale and trade in
Commodities that principally concern the Belly;<note place="margin">Markets.</note> but by common course
became a pass for Commodities of every kind almost. Concerning this
liberty, I shall desire leave to interpose this Parenthesis ensuing, before I
proceed in the intended discourse.</p>
               <p>In the first times, as every man by common right had property in his
own Goods, so by the same right he had power to alien to any person,
at any time, in any place, by gift, sale, exchange, or other ways; and
that by such Alienation, but especially by sale, a Right was vested in the
Buyer against all men, saving the <hi>Eigne-right,</hi> which was recompenced
upon warranty, and recovery in value. And in those days common
sense taught men to buy or sell, of or to the next Neighbour that would
bargain with them: and for want of such occasion, to repair to the next
Assembly, Meeting, or Concourse of people, for the sale of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as their Neighbourhood would not take off their hands. And
thus the greater Towns that had Walls or Castles, became the greatest
<hi>Markets,</hi> and others less; and this made the Neighbourhood of those
Towns to repair thither to buy, as others to sell. But time discovering
a double inconveniency herein, <hi>viz.</hi> that by these less publick sales in
smaller Villages, where little or no care of Right or Justice was had
(and by which means the word <hi>Pagan</hi> became a word of reproach) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mens Goods by clandestine Contracts were lost, and no care had of
their recovery; and (which was yet more prejudicial to the Publick)
that the greater Towns appointed for the strength and defence of the
Kingdom, became ill provided with supply of Victuals, either for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or future; and what was had, for the most part was gotten at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hand, and higher rate than the Country-Villages had. The <hi>wise
men,</hi> by publick Edict, laid a restraint of <hi>Markets</hi> in smaller Villages, and
more private places; and thus the greater Towns having <hi>Markets</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
became more <hi>publick Markets,</hi> not by any new Right or Priviledge
from the Crown; for it neither had such power nor could have (but
upon usurpation) against the common Right of such Towns and places
of publick defence. This Restraint, upon the reasons aforesaid, was made
first in the <hi>Saxon</hi>-times, as may appear by their Laws, but more cleerly
declared and confirmed afterwards by the Laws of the <hi>Normans,</hi> which
never gave any new Right of <hi>Market-overt</hi> unto those places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
defence, but onely did inhibit the same in the smaller Villages and
private places. In which respect, although the Kings of this Nation in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64112:35"/>
future times took leave to abolish that Restraint which did lie upon some
of those more private places, for certain reasons of State; and so these
places became <hi>Markets-overt,</hi> which formerly were none: yet could they
never take away that priviledge which Nature it self cast upon those
greater Towns (being the very Limbs of the Kingdom) without wrong
done to the common Right, and the publick Good; nor abridge them
of that power, but that they might still use their liberty at times and
places within their Precinct, as might best conduce with the benefit of
the Inhabitants of those places, even as any particular Free man may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his own Estate as him liketh best. And thus upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is to be concluded, that the ancient Burroughs of this Kingdom
properly do not hold their liberty of <hi>Market-overt</hi> by Prescription or
Charter, but by common Right; and not as a Corporation made by
Charter, but as they are a multitude of people anciently gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and united, upon whom the strength and wealth of the Kingdom
doth or did formerly much more depend, than on any of the smaller Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
and open Towns; even as every Free man possesseth and useth his
proper Inheritance and Estate without particular priviledge derived from
the Crown: Nor can the King take away the liberty of <hi>Market-overt</hi>
from such places, more than he can take away the liberty of buying and
selling from any Free man, to whom the Law alloweth a liberty of owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
This I submit to the censure of the learned in the Laws, in regard
of the different opinions concerning the same.</p>
               <p>This liberty of Township thus made, and the Place and People Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof being of such consequence in the publick administration, had
for their better support and safety liberty of Fortification,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 1.</note> and power to
charge one another with the maintenance of the Fortifications by an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
called <hi>Burghbote;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Aethelst. cap. 12.</note> and held their Tenements under a Rent to their
Lord or King called <hi>Burgage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Aethelst. cap. 13. Gloss.</note> as they were a body aggregate.</p>

for wild Beasts for the Chase, which we commonly call <hi>Forest,</hi>
being a precinct of ground neither parcel of the County, nor the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,

of the old <hi>German</hi> sport, but by custom turned from sport to
earnest: For although in the first times the <hi>Saxons</hi> were so few, and the
Country so spacious, that they might allow the Beasts their Farm as well
as themselves their own; People nevertheless so multiplied, as of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
they must intercommon either with Beasts or Fishes: the former
whereof, however more cleanly, yet the latter had the surest footing, and
was chosen as the least of two evils, rather than for any likelihood of
good Neighbourhood. For as Nature taught Beasts to prey for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so men to defend their own; and this bred such a fewd between
Beasts and men, as that Kings doubting to lose their Game, took in with
the weaker, that the world might see the happiness of <hi>England,</hi> where
Beasts enjoy their liberty as well as men. But this was, as it were, by
compromise; for it had been very hard to have pleased the <hi>Free men,</hi>

who had liberty of Game within their own ground by common Right,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 77.</note>
and to preserve the Kings liberty of Forest co-incident therewith, had not
the King employed on the one side the power of a <hi>Dane</hi> that looked
somewhat like a <hi>Conquerour;</hi> and on the other side, that which looked as
like to the bounty of a King, in allowing liberty of ownership to men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
within the bounds of the <hi>Forest,</hi> which at the first was set apart
onely for the Kings pleasure: and all his wits to make a Law somewhat
short of a full freedom, and yet outreaching that of Bondage, which we
since have commended to posterity under the <hi>Forest-Charter.</hi> And yet
for all that, it proved a hard matter for Kings to hunt by Law; and the
Law it self is a Yoke somewhat too heavy for a Commonwealth to bear

upon this ground a way was found out to punish the offender by <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Indictment.</note>
besides the satisfaction done to the party wronged.<note place="margin">Lambert. Ll. Inae. 15.</note> The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
against such Delinquents were by attachment of the party, who
thereupon, gave Pledges for his appearance. If the party could not be
found, a <hi>fugam fecit</hi> was returned, and that was a conviction in Law;
and pursuit was made after the party by <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Cry.</hi> If he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taken, the ancient way was that of <hi>Hallifax</hi>-Law; but in latter
times he was imprisoned,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. Lam. fol. 7.</note> or admitted to Bail if the offences were bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable:
and if the party bailed made default,<note place="margin">Ll. Alured. c. 6.</note> or did not abide the Trial,
his Bail suffered as Principal.<note place="margin">Miror. c. 2. Sec. 24.</note> If no Bail could be procured, the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
was imprisoned till he was legally acquitted;<note place="margin">Ll Edw. cap. 4.</note> but this imprisonment
was only in nature of restraint.<note place="margin">Miror. p. 255. Gloss. 335.</note> If the Delinquent was found upon the
<hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> and would not yield himself,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 9. &amp; 10.</note> he was in repute a common
Enemy,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 7.</note> and (as a <hi>Wolf</hi>) any man might kill him;<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 45.</note> as the Law was
also the same in case of <hi>Vtlary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sec. 22.</note> At the time of tryal (if at the Kings
suit) the Delinquent was indicted in this manner by any party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
<hi>I</hi> D. C. <hi>do say for the King, that</hi> I. S. <hi>is defamed by good men;
that he upon—day of</hi>—&amp;c. <hi>into the House and Goods of—did cast fire,
and the same did burn:</hi> or, (if it were for Bloodshed) <hi>with a Sword did
strike and wound him in the left arm, and that this was done Feloniously,</hi> or,
(if the case required) <hi>Traiterously: and if</hi> I. S. <hi>deny the same, I will for
the King prove the matter against him, as the King ought to do,</hi> that is to
say, by Witnesses, and Twelve men. But if the complaint was at the
suit of the party,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Appeal.</hi> Miror. cap. 2. Sec. 15.</note> then the Prosecutor sued him upon <hi>Appeal,</hi> in manner
following: I. C. <hi>appealeth</hi> D. H. <hi>here present, for that</hi> E. <hi>Father, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, or Vncle</hi> (according as the case was) <hi>to</hi> I. C. <hi>being in the
peace of God, and of our Soveraign Lord the King, at the dwelling house of</hi> E.
<hi>at</hi>—&amp;c. <hi>the said</hi> D. H. <hi>upon the—day of—in the—year of—with a
Sword made a Wound of two inches long, and six inches deep, in the left pap
of the body of the said</hi> E. <hi>whereof he died; and this was done Feloniously,
and of Malice forethought. And if the said</hi> D. H. <hi>shall deny the same,
the said</hi> I. C. <hi>is ready to prove the same against him in his body, or as a Monk,
Woman, or Clerk, behoveth to prove the same;</hi> that is, by <hi>Champion;</hi> for
neither <hi>Monk, Woman,</hi> nor <hi>Clerk</hi> was by Law to justifie by Battle in their
own person. The several causes of <hi>Appeal</hi> and <hi>Indictment</hi> may be
found in the Law-books, to whom I refer the Reader, it not being
within the compass of this Discourse to fall upon the particulars. I shall
onely observe the difference between <hi>Indictments</hi> former and latter, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64112:37"/>
between them and <hi>Appeals, viz.</hi> that <hi>Appeals</hi> are positive Accusations
in the name of the Prosecutor of the fact done by the party appealed;
whereas <hi>Indictments</hi> were onely a publication or affirmation of the same
of a fact done by the party indicted, and wherein Not guilty pleaded, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
onely as in nature of a Quere, to usher in the votes of the <hi>Freemen</hi>
concerning the fact.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the difference between former Indictments from these in these
days, consists in this, that the ancient Indictments were in the name of one
man; those of the later sort are in the name of the Jury; and the former
were onely of a <hi>same,</hi> the later, of the <hi>fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third way of bringing Controversies unto judgement,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sec. 23.</note> concerned
onely such matters as were of less consequence; and these were introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by way of <hi>Presentment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Presentment.</note> in the name or behalf of the King, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a positive Accusation of one for a Crime, first laid down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and then asserted by a particular fact, in this manner: <hi>I say, for
our Soveraign Lord the King, That</hi> H. <hi>here is perjured, and hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
saith against the King; because, whereas</hi> H. <hi>is or was Chancellour of
the King, and was sworn that he would not sell Right, or any remedial Writ
to any one: yet upon the—day of</hi>—&amp;c. <hi>he sold to</hi> B. <hi>a Writ of Attaint,
and would not grant the same under half a Mark.</hi> So as the difference
between an <hi>Indictment</hi> and <hi>Presentment</hi> in those days was onely in the
degree of the Crime for which the party Delinquent was accused, and in
the manner of conclusion of the <hi>Presentment,</hi> which was without <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last way of Trials concerns such offences that exceed not the
nature of <hi>Trespass</hi> done to a mans Person or his Goods;<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sec. 24.</note> and this was by
way of <hi>Action,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Action.</note> and it was to obtain recompence for Damage sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now because the former were called <hi>Personal Trespasses,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was by attachment of the Person; who thereupon put in <hi>Bail,</hi> or
else his <hi>Person</hi> was secured by imprisonment till Trial, and satisfaction
made. But in the later that concerned the <hi>reality,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Etheldr. cap. 20.</note> Three Summons
went forth in the <hi>Hundred-Court;</hi>

thereof ensued in the <hi>County-Court,</hi> and thence issued forth a <hi>Distrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas;</hi>
and if the Defendant still persisted in declining his appearance, the
<hi>Distress</hi> was forfeited, and a Summons issued upon the Land. If then
the Defendant would not appear, or upon appearance would not give
<hi>Pledges</hi> to abide Judgement, his whole Land was seized for the benefit
of the King, of the Lord of the Hundred, and of the Complainant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had offended against all three. But if the party appeared in
former times, he answered forthwith, and Judgement passed without
delay, as hath been said; unless in urgent cases, where the matter was
raw; and then it was adjourned, and <hi>Pledges</hi> given by the Defendant
to the full value,<note place="margin">Ll. Edgar. c. 7.</note> after the custom of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
made <hi>Default</hi> at the day, his <hi>Pledges</hi> were forfeited. But in
after-times, for better and more advised proceeding, the Defendant
was admitted to his <hi>Essoines;</hi> yet with a Proviso, that no <hi>Essoine</hi> should
be allowed for above Fifteen days;<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> and this was the direction of King
<hi>Alfred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the answer of the Defendant, he either traversed the matter in fact,
or confessed and justified,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 3. Sect. 16.</note> or confessed and submitted. The first put the
matter to the judgement of the <hi>Freemen;</hi> the second to the judgement
of the <hi>Judge;</hi> the third to the discretion of the <hi>Complainant,</hi> whereby the
Defendant generally found mercy, and in case of Trespass, rendred less
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64112:37"/>
damage. I find no footsteps in those times of Dilatorypleas, or <hi>Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
or other delays, unless in case of <hi>infancy;</hi> for the <hi>Saxons</hi> knew no
other age of ability to do or suffer, but the age above One and twenty
years: and in <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time a Judge suffered death for passing Sentence of
death upon one under that age. Albeit the Canonists had in those days
brought into custom other ages of ability in matters concerning <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lindenb. gloss. Miror. cap. 5. Sect. 1.</note>
although it may well be thought that it requireth no less maturity
to manage the affairs of a married life, than to discern the nature and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of manners, especially in case of crimes, which are contrary to the

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. Of the several manners of extraordinary trial by Torture, Ordeale,
Compurgators, and Battle.</head>
               <p>EVidence of the matter in fact, upon trial of Causes in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Judicatory, sometimes consisted in the pregnant testimony of the
Fact it self,<note place="margin">Torture.</note> and sometimes in the testimony of some Circumstances.
The first was an unquestionable ground of conviction; the second was
too weak to command the <hi>Verdict,</hi> although sometimes it perswaded
it; and therefore those incompassionate times found out a trick of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
confession, by torture of the party, following the principles of
passion therein, rather than sober judgement; for circumstances are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to irritate the hearts of those that are passionate; and where Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
is once entred, there's no place for sparing, be the matter never
so untrue. Yet I do not find any Law amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi> to patronize
this fashion of conviction; albeit it seemeth it was practised, for <hi>Alfred</hi>
the King punished one of his Judges with death for passing Sentence
upon an extorted confession by <hi>Torture</hi> before the Corner.<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1. Cragius.</note> And possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it might be gained from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> although little to the
praise of their <hi>Greekish</hi> wisdom in that particular: Seeing that in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it must be supposed, that Fear and Grief will enforce Flattery upon
the <hi>Tormentor,</hi> as well as Self-love draw forth Flattery to the <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second sort of Evidence was that of <hi>Ordeale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ordeale.</note> being also grounded
upon a pre-conceit or suspicion: the manner hereof was divers. The
thing seemeth to be the birth of the Brain of some <hi>Church-man,</hi> who had
read of the <hi>cursed Water.</hi> The first mention that I find thereof was at
the Council of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 813. An. 895. Ll. Aethelst. Can. 23. An. 928.</note> and afterwards in the Council of <hi>Triers;</hi> but not
a footstep thereof in this Kingdom till by <hi>Aethelstan</hi> it was advanced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the degree of a Law; after which time it continued in use well nigh
Three hundred years. A strange monument of God's idulgency to an
ignorant Age thus turning extraordinary to ordinary, for the clearing
of innocency; and (which is no less wonderful) allowing in those times
unto men under nature such a power over themselves, as to adventure
against nature. Doubtless that man or woman was of a daring spirit
that first tried the trick, if he had not a miraculous faith in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Cum ambulaveris per ignem,</hi> &amp;c. and it shewed metal in them that
followed the example. But the next age grew dull,<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 2.</note> and men being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64112:38"/>
weary of such bane-touches, the Clergy that cried it up, their successours
cried it down, and so devoured their own birth without any difficulty, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a bare injunction of a King,<note place="margin">Spicil. Selden.</note> that had power to command onely
such as would obey.</p>
               <p>But where fame was yet more slight,<note place="margin">Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> and springing rather from want
of charity and misapprehension, than promising circumstances, men
were wont to be contented with a <hi>voier Dire,</hi> or the Oath of the party
suspected, and the concurrent testimony of other men: The first attesting
his own innocency, the other contesting their Consciences of the truth
of the former testimony; and therefore were, and still are called <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgators.</hi>
Their number was more or less, and of greater or less value,
according as the offence or the party suspected was of greater or less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
This manner of trial was of ancient use,<note place="margin">Ll. Edm. c. 16.</note> and both it and
that <hi>Ordeale</hi> under the directory of the <hi>Clergie;</hi> yet this was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
by Three hundred years,<note place="margin">An. 647.</note> and first brought into this Nation by
the Council at <hi>Berghamsted</hi> under <hi>Bertwald</hi> Archibishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll Canut. cap. 5.</note>
And it was performed sometimes more solemnly by solemn receiving
of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> especially if the person suspected was of the sacred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>One manner of trial yet remains,<note place="margin">Battle.</note> which was used both in trial of
matters of <hi>Crime</hi> and <hi>Title;</hi> and it is the trial by <hi>Battle,</hi> which was in
<hi>criminal</hi> matters with sharp Weapons; but in <hi>titulary</hi> matters with blunt
Weapons. No Defendant could refuse <hi>Battle</hi> offered, but such as were
too excellent, as the <hi>King;</hi> or too sacred, as the <hi>Clergie;</hi> or too weak,
as <hi>Women, Maimed persons,</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> or too inscient, as <hi>Ideots</hi> and
<hi>Lunaticks;</hi> or too mean, as <hi>Villains.</hi> And as these were not necessitated
to answer in <hi>Battle,</hi> so was no <hi>Freeman</hi> compelled to answer them by <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sect. 13.</note>
This way was an old way, as may appear by the conclusion of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,</hi>
and seemeth more satisfactory than that of <hi>Ordeale;</hi> because this
rested upon the Consciences both of <hi>Appellant</hi> and <hi>Defendant;</hi> whereas
<hi>Ordeale</hi> rested onely upon the single Conscience of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> which
oftentimes was rather hardy than innocent. And the continuance of this
trial in <hi>title,</hi> even at this day, shews that men can away with this, and
that there is not evil sufficient in it to eradicate this weed, although it be
kept under ground; and experience shews, that Right and Victory always
do not concur.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVIII. Of the ordinary manner of Trial amongst the Saxons by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</head>
               <p>THe last and most ordinary way of trial was by Witnesses (upon
traverse of the matter in Fact) before the <hi>Jurors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inquest.</note> and their votes
thereupon: this made the <hi>Verdict,</hi> and it determined the matter in fact.
In former time questionless it was a confused manner of trial, by Votes
of the whole multitude; which made the <hi>Verdict</hi> hard to be discerned:
But time taught them better advice, to bring the Voters to a certain
number, according to the <hi>Grecian</hi> way, who determined controversies
by the suffrages of Four and thirty,<note place="margin">Emmius.</note> or the Major part of them. But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64112:38"/>
how the number came to be reduced to <hi>Twelve,</hi> I cannot conjecture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in imitation of that rule of <hi>Compurgators,</hi> that ordinarily exceeded
not that number. The first Law that defined this number, was that of
<hi>Aetheldred,</hi> about three hundred years before the Conquest. <hi>In singulis
Centuriis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 675. Ll. Sax. Lamb.</note> &amp;c. In English thus: <hi>In every Century or Hundred let there be
a Court; and let Twelve ancient Freemen, together with the Lord of the
Hundred, be sworn that they will not condemn the Innocent, nor acquit the
Guilty.</hi> And this was so strictly eyed,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> that <hi>Alfred</hi> put one of his Judges
to death for passing Sentence upon a <hi>Verdict</hi> corruptly obtained, upon
the votes of the <hi>Jurors,</hi> whereof Three of the <hi>Twelve</hi> were in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
And the same King put another of his Judges to death, for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sentence of death upon an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> returned by the Jury. And a
third, for condemning a man upon an Inquest taken <hi>ex officio,</hi> whenas the
Delinquent had not put himself upon their trial.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Saxons</hi> were more careful of the credit and life of man,<note place="margin">Two Juries.</note> for
no mans life or credit rested altogether upon the cast of <hi>Twelve</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but first <hi>Twelve</hi> men enquired of the fame and ground thereof;
which if liked, rendred the party under the spot of delinquency, and
meet to be looked upon as under the suspition of the Law, who formerly
was but under the suspition of some particular man. And then was a
second enquiry of the fact, if the party traversed the vote of Fame. In
both which trials the Verdict grounded it self upon those <hi>allegata</hi> and
<hi>probata</hi> which were before them. The first of these enquiries was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Coroner,</hi> who, even in these old days, had the view of Bloodshed.
The second was had before the Judge of life and death: neither of which
could legally indamage the party without the other, unless the Judge
meaned to answer it with the peril of his own person and Estate; as it
befel in <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time, when a Judge suffered death for passing Sentence
upon the <hi>Coroners</hi> onely Record; unto which a Replication is allowed,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> as
the Book saith. And another Judge had the same measure for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one without <hi>Appeal</hi> or <hi>Indictment</hi> foregoing. Where, by the way,
I might note another difference between <hi>Appeals</hi> and <hi>Indictments</hi> in this;<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sec. 11.</note>
that <hi>Appeals</hi> were and are the more speedy Trials than <hi>Indictments,</hi> inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the former were but one act, the latter two.</p>
               <p>And yet time and experience refined this way of trial into a more
excellent condition:<note place="margin">Medietas Linguae.</note> For the bloody times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> first age pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over, and peace arising by degrees, they, together with the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
began to <hi>intercommon,</hi> and about the <hi>Marches</hi> became a mixt
people under a mixture of Government and Laws, as hath been already
noted. Amongst which one concerned their way of trial of matters
in fact by a <hi>Jury</hi> mixt both of <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> which was setled
by a Law made by <hi>Aetheldred. Viri sint,</hi> &amp;c. In English thus: <hi>Let
there be Twelve men of understanding in the Law, six of them</hi> English, <hi>and
six</hi> Welch,<note place="margin">Ll. Aetheldred cap. 3. Lamb.</note> 
                  <hi>and let them deal Justice both to</hi> English <hi>and</hi> Welch. The
equity of this Law in future ages spread it self into all Trials of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
in every place throughout this Island. Unto such as stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at this conceit, because they are said to be <hi>aetate superiores,</hi> and <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
consulti,</hi> I shall onely note thus much; That it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the work of <hi>Jurors</hi> required chief men both for experience and
knowledge in the customs of those times, to enable them to judge
of the matter in fact; and upon whose judgement the Life and Death
of the party rested principally: And as probable it is, that those <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
as they were then chief men, so they sate in the most eminent
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64112:39"/>
place of the Assembly or Court, and were <hi>co assessors</hi> with the Bishop
and Sheriff, who did serve but onely to advise the rest; and they, or
one of them to publish the Sentence which the Law predetermined.
And this chief place the <hi>Jurors</hi> might have possessed at this day, as they
do in <hi>Sweden,</hi> had the chief men holden the service still worthy of their
attendance.</p>
               <p>But great men grew too great in their own esteem for the service of
their Country,<note place="margin">Peers.</note> betaking themselves to serve themselves; and matters
of highest employment were left to those of the meaner condition; who
being in their own persons of less admiration, were thought unmeet to
sit in such eminent places, and so from the Bench descended to the Floor,
as at this day. This disidiousness of the greater sort made one step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the full perfection of that manner of Trial both of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Estates of the <hi>English,</hi> which hath been the envy of other
Nations, and is called the trial <hi>per Pares,</hi> or by Peers. For the pride of
the <hi>Danes</hi> (now growing into one people with the <hi>Saxons</hi>) not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
such fellowship with the mean <hi>Saxon</hi>-freemen in this publick
service; and the wise <hi>Saxon</hi> King espying the danger in betrusting the
Lives and Estates of the poorest sort unto the dictate of these super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
humours; and on the contrary in prostituting the Nobler blood
upon the vote of the inferiour rank of men, provided a third way, and
by agreement between him and <hi>Gunthurne</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> setled the Law of
<hi>Peers. Si minister regius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Alured. Concil. Brit. fol. 492.</note> &amp;c. <hi>If a Lord or a Baron be accused of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
he shall be acquitted by Twelve Lords: but if of inferiour rank,
he shall be acquitted by Eleven of his Equals and one Lord.</hi> Thus Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
disposed of the pride of men, to be an instrument of its own
restraint: For the great men, ere they were aware, hereby lost one of
the fairest Flowers of their Garland, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Judicature,</hi> or rather the
mastership of the Life or Death of the meaner sort; and thereby a fair
opportunity of containing them for ever under their awe. And no less
remarkable was the benefit that redounded to this Nation hereby; for
had the great men holden this power, as once they had it, it might
soon have endangered the liberty of the <hi>Freemen,</hi> and thereby been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Fundamental Constitution of the Government of this
Realm, which consisteth in the just and equal participation of these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
wherein all are equally concerned. This was the trial wherein
the people of this Nation were made happy above all other people, and
whereby the <hi>Freemen,</hi> as they had the <hi>Legislative</hi> power, so likewise had
the <hi>Juridical;</hi> and thereby, next under God, an absolute dominion over
themselves and their Estates. For though this course of trial was first
applied to matters of Crime, yet it soon also seized upon the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas,</hi>
which for the most part was the work of main import in the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>AFter <hi>Verdict,</hi> Judgement passed according to the letter of the Law,
or known Custom; in criminal matters, according to the greatness
of the offence, either for death or loss of Member. But if the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
favoured the Delinquent, he was admitted to redemption of Life
or Member, by Fine also setled by letter of the Law, and not left to the
Judges discretion. If the Crime reached onely to shameful penance,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae.</note> such
as <hi>Pillory</hi> or <hi>Whipping,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Canut.</note> (the last whereof was inflicted onely upon Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
then might that Penance be reduced to a <hi>Ransom</hi> (according to the
grain of the offence) assessed in the presence of the Judge by the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and entred upon the Roll, and the <hi>Estreat</hi> of each Ransom several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and apart sent to the Sheriff. This <hi>Ransom</hi> was paid usually unto the
King and Lord, and the party indamaged, or his friends, if the case so
required; according to the old <hi>German</hi> rule,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. cap. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Pars mulctae Regi vel civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati,

                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> This course opened
indeed a way for Mercy; but, through corruption, a Floud-gate to Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in the conclusion. Of Imprisonment there was little use in the
eldest times; afterwards it was more used, not onely to secure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to come to trial of Law for miscarriages past, but sometimes to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
men against committing of future mischief, especially if it more
concerned the publick. I find but little or no use thereof barely as a
punishment, nor would their Ancestors so punish their Bondmen: <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis

was in nature of <hi>elegit;</hi> for the party wronged either had the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
goods to him delivered, or the value in money upon sale of the
goods made by the Sheriff; and if that satisfied not,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw.</note> then the moity of
the Lands was extended, and so by moities so far as was possible, <hi>salvo
contenemento;</hi> and when all was gone, the Defendants Arms (which were
accounted as the <hi>Nether-milstone,</hi> or stock of maintenance) were last
of all seized;<note place="margin">Ll. Alured. c. 1.</note> and then the party was accounted undone, and cast upon
the charity of his friends for his sustenance: but the person of the man
was never imprisoned as a pledge for the debt, no not in the Kings case.
<hi>Alfred</hi> imprisoned one of his Judges for imprisoning a man in that case.
One punishment of death they had in cases of crime,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> and that was by
hanging or strangling; and where the crime was not so great, sometimes
ensued loss of member or mutilation, and in many such cases <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
pronounced indeed by the Clergy, but determined by the Law;
which in the first conception was framed in the womb of the Legislative
power in Parliament,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 105, 251, 365, 420.</note> as may appear in many Laws there made; nor was
there in those times any question made of the cognizance thereof, so long

               <head>CHAP. XL. Of the Penal Laws amongst the Saxons.</head>
               <p>PAssing the Courts and manner of proceedings till Sentence, we are
now come to the particular Laws that directed the Sentence; and
first of those that concerned criminal offences. During the <hi>Saxons</hi> time
the Commonwealth was in its minority, the Government tender, the
Laws green, and subject to bend according to the blast of time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and according to the different dispositions of Governours, Ages,
and People. For though the <hi>Saxons</hi> were in name our <hi>first matter;</hi> yet not
they onely, but they having once made the breach open, and entred this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland,
it became a common receptacle of those Eastern people, the <hi>Angles,
Danes, Almains,</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> as their several Laws left with us in power do not
obscurely inform us; and amongst all the rest, the <hi>Goths</hi> were not the least
concerned herein; for the <hi>Saxon</hi> King determining what people shall be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Denizons</hi> in this Kingdom, saith, <hi>That the</hi> Goths <hi>ought to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and protected in this Kingdom, as sworn Brethren, Kinsmen, and
proper Citizens of this Commonwealth.</hi> Nor can any Nation upon earth
shew so much of the ancient <hi>Gothique</hi> Law as this Island hath. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
in this mixture of people of several Nations, there being a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
mixture of Laws; as the power of any one of these peoples chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
so likewise did their Laws change in power; and long it was
ere a right temper of one uniform Law could be setled: yet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
these short remembrances left unconsumed by time I have subjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it may appear their motions were excellent, though somewhat
inconstant in their practice.</p>
               <p>Those times were dark, and yet so far as any light appeared, the
people were to be honoured for their resolution in the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For there was few of the <hi>Commandments</hi> of the two Tables which
they did not assert by Laws by them made, the third and tenth excepted;
which latter <hi>commands</hi> the inward man onely, and whereof God hath the
sole cognizance.</p>
               <p>True it is that the first <hi>Commandment</hi> containeth much of the same
nature;<note place="margin">The first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Witchery.</note> yet somewhat is visible, and that they bound: For whereas
in those times the Devil had such power, as he did prevail with some
(and those it may be not a few) to renounce God, and deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to his own will; they punished this crime with banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as judging him unworthy their society that would communicate
with Devils. Yet if the Delinquent had done any mischief whereby
death ensued,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. cap. 6.</note> the parties punishment was death; yet might all be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
by <hi>Ransome,</hi> and good security for good behaviour for time to
come.</p>
               <p>For their worship of God,<note place="margin">The second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> they were no less zealous in maintenance
of the manner; as their Forefathers liked not the use of <hi>Images</hi> or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
for adoration, neither did they: and though the Clergy in other
matters led them much, yet in this they were alone for a long time:
for though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had the use of <hi>Images</hi> above Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years before <hi>Austin</hi>'s coming, yet could not that custom fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Saxons</hi> for the space of above One hundred years after <hi>Austin</hi>'s
coming; notwithstanding the endeavours of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and Pope
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64112:40"/>
                  <hi>Constantine</hi> (by his bastard-decree begotten upon the dream of the Bishop
of <hi>Worcester</hi>) that saw the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s picture brought him in his sleep
by her self, and with a command from her, <hi>That it should be set up in the
Church and worshipped:</hi> I say,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 218.</note> it could not fasten any constant practice of
Idol-worship, nor ever wrest a Law from the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> to countenance
the same; but rather on the contrary, they still preserved the memorial
of the second <hi>Commandment</hi> in the Decalogue, even then when as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
had expunged the same out of the number:<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 364.</note> and they enforced
the same by a Law of their own making, so far as their Clergie,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 5.</note> or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they bear to <hi>Rome,</hi> would allow.</p>
               <p>It hath been formerly observed, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> took no note of the vice
of <hi>prophane swearing</hi> and <hi>cursing;</hi> which crime (if it were in use, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be otherwise conceited but it was) as the times then were,<note place="margin">The third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> must lie
upon the Clergie-mens account for their neglect of teaching the point; or
upon the general ignorance of those times, which understood not the
<hi>Commandment</hi> nor the Scripture: For we find no Canon against it, nor
scarce any Doctrine concerning it, but onely in case of <hi>false swearing,</hi> till
<hi>Anselm</hi>'s time. True it is, that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> seemeth zealous against all
<hi>swearing;</hi> but that was his personal goodness, which for ought appeareth
died with him. And <hi>Anselm</hi> contending against <hi>swearing</hi> by the Creatures,
and <hi>idle swearing,</hi> renders his grounds in such manner,<note place="margin">Cent. 1. cap. 4. de leg.</note> as it may be well
conceived that he understood not the main.</p>
               <p>I am the rather induced to conceive charitably of those times,<note place="margin">The fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their exceeding zeal for the honour of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> which
sheweth, that so far as their knowledge would maintain them, they had
zeal to make it into action. They began this day doubtless as other days,
according to the custom of their Forefathers in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Nox ducere diem
videtur.</hi> And because they would not allow their secular affairs to trench
too nigh that days devotion, they made the <hi>Lords day</hi> to begin on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
at three of the clock in the afternoon, and to continue till <hi>Munday</hi>-morning.
No pastime, no not their beloved sport of Hunting,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 445, 446.</note> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
during all that while; nor no works were to be done, but such as
concerned the Worship of God: and those Laws they bound with penalty
of <hi>Fine,</hi> if the Delinquent were a <hi>Free-man;</hi> if he were a <hi>bond</hi>-servant, he
was to be whipped. Nor were these the Laws of one King or Age onely,<note place="margin">Ibid. 268, 377, 404, 518, 546.</note>
but of the whole current of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government; and may (although
dark times they were) yet put us in these days of light to the blush, to
enter into comparison with them for their Devotion.</p>
               <p>In their Conversation with men,<note place="margin">The fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the <hi>Saxons</hi> seemed yet more strict:
and being a people of a publick spirit, they preferred the good of their
Country above all; accounting Treachery against it, or neglect thereof in
time of danger, to be a Crime of the greatest concernment, and to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in the highest degree, <hi>Proditores, &amp; transfugas arboribus suspendunt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus. Treason.</note>
Other <hi>Treason</hi> than this, no not against Kings, did they then acknowledge
any; and therefore the form of the <hi>Indictment</hi> for contriving the death of
their King,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 2. Sec. 11.</note> concluded onely <hi>Felonicè,</hi> as may appear in that form of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi>
for an offence of that nature intended and plotted against <hi>Edmond</hi>
the Saxon King: Whenas for the plotting against <hi>Alliance,</hi> though of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and inferiour nature, the <hi>Indictment</hi> concluded <hi>Felonicè &amp; Proditoriè.</hi>
And wereas the penalty,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 2. Sec. 13.</note> in case of <hi>Treachery</hi> against the Country, was death,
and forfeiture of the whole Estate, both real and personal: In <hi>Treachery</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 38. Concil. Aen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. 26.</note> it was onely loss of life, and of the personal Estate.
And therefore it may seem that Majesty had not yet arrived at its full
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64112:41"/>
growth; or else that the greatest measure thereof rested in the body
still.</p>
               <p>If in any thing the <hi>Saxons</hi> were indulgent,<note place="margin">The Sixth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> it was in <hi>matters of Blood;</hi>
for they were a warlike people, and looked upon it as under the regiment
of valour; and therefore it was punished only with <hi>fine,</hi> according to the
old rule,<note place="margin">Man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                  <hi>Luitur homicidium certo armentorum &amp; pecorum numero.</hi> So as
even in <hi>Germany</hi> they had learned the trick to set a price upon that crime;
and this they afterward called <hi>Manbotta wera wirgida wita,</hi> and <hi>lashlight:</hi>
and, which was worse, they countenanced that which in after-ages was
called <hi>deadly feud;</hi> and so under colour of punishing Murder with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,<note place="margin">Sax. Lamb. sol. 17, 18.</note>
they added blood to blood. But as times grew more tame, and
inclining to civility or Religion, the cry of Blood was more hideous; and
this urged on the Law of <hi>Appeals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> and so private revenge became under
the power of the Law,<note place="margin">Li. Alured. Sax. praesace Lamb.</note> which punished death with death, savouring of
such a King as <hi>Alfred</hi> was, who first taught the Scriptures to speak in the
dialect of our own Laws; like the <hi>Rubrick</hi> amongst the <hi>Canons,</hi> bringing
therewith both strength and beauty: yet they had degrees of <hi>blood-shed,</hi>
and made a difference in the punishment; for some sprung from sudden
passion, but other was <hi>forethought</hi> and purposed; which last they called
<hi>Abere</hi> Murther,<note place="margin">Glossar. p. 4.</note> or Murther by <hi>foreplot</hi> or treachery; and this was made
<hi>nullo pretio emendabile;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Canut. cap. 93.</note> and yet towards the times of the <hi>Danes,</hi> devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grew of so high a dye, that a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> could represent any bloodshed
more allowable, if not acceptable, under the golden colour of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
made to the King, the Lord of the party slain, and the parties
friends, for the loss of a Subject, a Tenant, and a Friend according to that
of their forefathers, <hi>recepitque satisfactionem universa domus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> It would
be too tedious to recite all the particular Laws, with their changes, and
therefore they shall be lest to the view in the several Laws of <hi>Alfred, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
Canutus,</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. Yet one custom first begun
by the <hi>Danes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Englishire.</note> I cannot omit: That if a man were found slain, whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
or friends were unknown,<note place="margin">Stams. lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> by common intendment he was presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be a <hi>Dane;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 1. Sec. 13.</note> and then if the delinquent were not taken, nor fled
to <hi>Sactuary,</hi> nor known where he is, the whole Hundred was amerced for
the escape;<note place="margin">Bracton lib. 3. tract. 1. ca. 15.</note> but if the party slain were known to be of <hi>English</hi> Parents,
it was otherwise.<note place="margin">Breach of peace. Batteries. Maimes. Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> This custom lasted long after the <hi>Normans</hi> time, the
<hi>Dane</hi> being only changed into the <hi>Norman,</hi> and was called <hi>Englishire.</hi>
Batteries, Maimes, Imprisonments, and other breaches of peace, were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by Fine, which they called <hi>Fightwitt, Grithbrece,</hi> or <hi>Frithbreck;</hi> and
the Delinquent ordinarily put in sureties for the peace for future time.
The fine was increased by the number of Delinquents joyning in the fact:
for if seven joyned,<note place="margin">Alured. praef. Lam. 17.</note> it was a <hi>Riot,</hi> and the fine was then called <hi>Flothbote.</hi>
If the number were five times so many, <hi>viz.</hi> thirty and five, then it was
a <hi>Rebellion</hi> or War. Secondly, the fine was increased by the time or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the fact, as in <hi>Lent,</hi> or while the Army was in the field; because,
in the first case, the holy time was prophaned; in the second, the Countrey
was more endangered, when the strength was abroad, and the Army might
be discouraged at the news of the disturbance at home.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 31.</note> And therefore
the <hi>Saxons</hi> punished this with death,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. ca. 36.</note> or fine suitable. Thirdly, the fine
was the greater in case of the excellency of the place,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. cap. 6.</note> where it was <hi>holy
ground,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Seventh Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or in the presence of great persons, such as the King or Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adultery</hi> among the old <hi>Germans</hi> was holden a crime of a high nature;<note place="margin">Baron. Annal. 745. num. 5.</note>
the penalty of the woman that committed that crime was death:<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 558.</note> I find

penal, and more common.<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. 50. reg. 22.</note> By <hi>Alfreds</hi> Law it was finable, and the fine

was not only the damage to the party, but also fine to the King upon
Action, which in these days passeth under the name of <hi>Quare clausum fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi>
according to the words of the Writ.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. ca. 36.</note> The damages were more or
less, according to the time or season when it was done: for it when the
Army was abroad, the damages were doubled; and in like manner, if
done in <hi>Lent</hi> time. If the trespass was done by a Beast,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. 5. 6.</note> the owner must
pay the damages;<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 40.</note> but if it were occasioned through the complainants
default (as through his gap) no damages were paid. The constant fine
to the King in all such trespasses,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. c. 36.</note> was by <hi>Alfreds</hi> Law set at five shillings.
Other Actions also were then used, as touching damage done to Goods, and
Actions upon the case: for in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time the Plaintiff recovered not
only damages for trespasses done to Possessions and Goods, but also costs
for injuries in point of scandal and defamation,<note place="margin">Miror. p. 301.</note> in case the complainant

descent of <hi>inheritance,</hi> was to the eldest Son.<note place="margin">Inheritance.</note> For <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaking of the
<hi>German</hi> Cavalry, saith, <hi>That the Horse of the party dead went not to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Son, ut caetera, but to the most valiant man amongst them of that Linage;</hi>
which words <hi>ut caetera</hi> do plainly intimate, that other matters of profit
passed to the eldest Son in point of descent. Nor can I conceive how men
should be induced to conceit, that the custom of <hi>Gavelkind</hi> was the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
general custom of the <hi>Germans.</hi> It is true, the words of the same
Historian have misled some; the words are, <hi>Haeredes tamen &amp; successores
cuique liberi;</hi> these taken collectively, I grant may import somewhat
tending that way; but they may as properly be taken disjunctively, that
the Children inherit by course; and if none such were, then the Brothers;
if they failed, then uncles. And it is not only evident, that in the publick
Succession to the Crown they had an eye this way, but in the descent of
private and particular estates, as by many instances out of those old Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
may appear; and had any other custom been general, <hi>Alfreds</hi> rule
by <hi>Moses</hi> Law had never succeeded; nor could that other custom hold out
against the constant desire of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to perpetuate their Families in
greatness and honour: all which, besides the express Laws set forth in the
<hi>Codes,</hi> are in my conceit sufficient to induce an Historical Faith, <hi>That the
general course of descent was to the eldest Sons, and not to all joyntly.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
out of this Estate of Inheritance, divers particular estates were
created, as well by common custom, as by the especial act of the owner
of such an estate. Such of them as were wrought by custom, was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
from Marriage, whereby if the man was setled of such estate
as formerly hath been recited, and died, his Wife surviving, by ancient
custom she had her <hi>Dower,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dower.</note> or third part of such estate of inheritance. This
custom, though ancient, yet was not originally from the <hi>Germans,</hi> but
from the <hi>Latines,</hi> who used to give <hi>Dower</hi> with the man, and receive
<hi>Portion</hi> with the woman.<note place="margin">Plut. vit. Solon. Apotheg. Lacon.</note> But the <hi>Germans</hi> learned from the <hi>Greeks</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
for the Laws both of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> forbad the latter, lest
Marriages should be made for reward, and not grounded upon affection;
which, as they conceived, would be a means to maintain the strength of
mankind in generation. And therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> noteth this by way of
Antithesis, <hi>Dotem non uxor marito, sed uxori maritus offert.</hi> The <hi>Dower</hi>
that was given in the first times was Goods; and these were utensils for
War. And the Wife many times returned to the man tokens of her love, in
the same kind, and not as gages of future maintenance, unless we shall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64112:42"/>
account War their proper calling from whence their livelihood issued.
Succeeding times growing more calm, changed the custom of fighting
into trading, and taught them to prefer the stock gotten by commerce,
before that of War; and so the <hi>Dower</hi> was changed. This course conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, for ought I can find; for not much above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
years before the Conquest,<note place="margin">Ll Sax. Lamb. Edm. fol. 76.</note> it was by a publick Law confirmed,
that the Bridegroom before Marriage should set forth that portion of
Goods that should be his Wives;<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. 50. Reg. 22.</note> and these were ever afterward holden
her own proper Goods. But if no such provision was made before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
then the Law or Custom gave the Wife half her Husbands Goods,
if she outlived him; and if there were Children, then the whole estate in
Goods, to provide for herself and them, until she took a second Husband:
but if the Husband suffered death as a Malefactor, the Wife was to
have but one third part.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Lamb. fol. 14.</note> I find no footsteps of <hi>Dower</hi> in Lands until
the <hi>Normans</hi> time;<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. ca. 51.</note> who were also as well owners of the Wives personal
estate, as of their persons, and before which time the <hi>Saxon</hi> Wives in
divers regards were more absolute and independent; I say not more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
because they were never one with their Husbands; nor were they
ever under the Law of <hi>free-pledge,</hi> as Wives; nor was the Husband his
Wives <hi>pledge</hi> as he was her Husband, although as a Master he was <hi>free
pledge</hi> for his servants:<note place="margin">Ll. Ed. Lamb. cap. 7.</note> for the Law was, that in case the Husband carried
his Wife away into another Lordship, as he must give <hi>pledges</hi> that his
Wife shall have no wrong, so she must give <hi>pledge</hi> by her friends that she
shall do no wrong; and she passed therefore as an <hi>appurtenant</hi> to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
rather than one in unity with him; and her estate or portion was
rather <hi>appurtenant</hi> to her than him: for if she failed in her good carriage
to her Husband, she was to make amends out of her own Estate to her
Husband; and if her estate sufficed not, then her <hi>pledges</hi> were to satisfie
her Husband.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. 50. Reg. 22.</note> Nevertheless what failed in the relation of the Woman to
the Man, was supplied in the relation of the Man to the Woman; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the respect the Men bare to the Women, as their Wives, they honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them as <hi>German</hi> Women, that admired valour in all, Idolized it in
their Husbands, and shared in it themselves; and upon occasion merited
thereby not onely to be companions in honour, but triumphers above
Men, yea their Commanders and Governours. Nor was this the original
trick of the rude and <hi>uncompt Germans,</hi> or barbarous <hi>Britans,</hi> but of the
wise <hi>Greeks,</hi> and received (as may be supposed) from the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
upon as good ground as the Wife of <hi>Leonidas</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>
King rendred; who being asked <hi>why the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>women ruled
their Husbands: It is true,</hi> said she, <hi>for we only know how to obey our
Husbands.</hi> A second particular estate, which the Law derived out of
the inheritance, was advancement to the Husband; for the <hi>Saxons</hi>
were not so stupid as to refuse favour proffered: and therefore they made
a Law of Counter-tenure to that of <hi>Dower,</hi> which we commonly call
<hi>tenure by the curtesie of England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Curtesie of</hi> England.</note> which was but a perquisite of the Wives
estate given to the Husband, in case he over-lived his Wife, and had issue
by her born alive. The name was probably given by the <hi>Normans,</hi> who
as it seemeth had no such custom; and therefore they gave it the name
from the <hi>English</hi> (albeit since that time <hi>Scotland</hi> hath also allowed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them)<note place="margin">Ll. Alm. tit. 92. Lindenbr. cod.</note> who might probably bring it into this Kingdom or
Countrey amongst the mingled people: for this Custom or Law
is found amongst the ancient <hi>Almain</hi> Laws; differing onely from
the Law this day in the evidence of the title, which now ariseth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64112:43"/>
upon the birth of the Child heard to cry; whenas in those days the title
vested not unless the Child opened his eyes, <hi>ut possit videre culmen domus, &amp;
quatuor parietes,</hi> which toucheth not onely the opening of the eye, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the rowling of it about.</p>
               <p>Estates that were derived out of the Estate of an Inheritance by the
act of the party, either were such as concerned the whole Inheritance, or
part thereof. That which concerned the whole Inheritance, was nothing
but a parcelling of it out according to the will of the giver; and this was
afterwards called <hi>Estate Tail;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Estate tail.</note> which passed also amongst some places by
way of custom,<note place="margin">Ll. Ang. tit. 6. Lindenbr.</note> as amongst the <hi>Angles</hi> it was a Law that the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
should pass unto the Issue-males on the Fathers side until the fifth
generation, before any title could accrue to the Issue female; and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Proverb, it went <hi>from the Lance to the Spindle.</hi> But the
<hi>Danes</hi> possibly might prevent this in the continuance thereof; for they
brought along with them that which was formerly the <hi>Saxon</hi> custom,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. tit. 7. ibid.</note>
which carried the Inheritance unto the Daughters,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 333.</note> upon the failing of
the Issue Male, as in the example of <hi>Cenedritha</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cenulphus,</hi>
amongst multitudes of others may appear. But where Lands were
conveyed by writing or act of the party, it was a Maxime, <hi>That the
Will of the Conveyor should be strictly observed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Alured. Sax. c. 7.</note> nor could any one that
came in by vertue of such Writing ever alien the Land to cross the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the original Conveyance. The <hi>entailing</hi> of Estates therefore was
very ancient,<note place="margin">Plo. com. 251.</note> although by corrupt custom it was deluded, as the Lord
<hi>Dier</hi> in his argument of the L. <hi>Berklies</hi> Case observeth.</p>
               <p>Another custom of Inheritance was catcht I know not how, it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Burrough English,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Borough-English.</note> and by the name may seem to be brought in by
some Cynical odd <hi>Angle</hi> that meant to cross the World, and yet in a
way not contrary to all reason: for where nature affords least help, the
wisdom of men hath used to be most careful of supply; and thus the
youngest became preferred before the elder in the course of descent
of Inheritance, according to this custom. There is no further monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the antiquity hereof that I have met with, than the name it
self, which importeth that it sprang up whiles as yet the names of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi>
and <hi>Saxons</hi> held in common cognizance; and might arise first
from the grant of the Lords to their Tenants, and so by continuance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
usual. And by this means also might arise the custom of <hi>Copy-holds</hi>
of this nature so frequent, especially in those Eastern parts of this Island
where the <hi>Angles</hi> setled, and from whom that part had the name of the
East-<hi>Angles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another custom of descent remaineth, and that is to the Children
indifferently,<note place="margin">Gavel-kind.</note> and it is called <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> or <hi>Gave-all kind:</hi> and by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name seemeth at the first to arise rather from the donation of the
Parent or other Ancestor, contrary to common custom, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; otherwise no need had been of an especial name. In the
Original it seems it equally concerned all, both Sons and Daughters, as
partners; and for want of such, the Brothers and Sisters. It seemeth
to be first the Law of the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Jutes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stephan. Dan. Bureus. Suel.</note> for it remaineth in use in these
parts of the Eastern Countries. But in latter times this estate was also
<hi>tailed,</hi> or cut out sometimes to the Sons and Daughters severally; that
is, the Sons or Brothers to have two parts, and the Daughters or Sisters
one part: othertimes to all the Sons, and for want of such, to all the
Daughters. And thus these courses of estates passed over Seas to the
Southern part of this Island, where that people most setled, in a double
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64112:43"/>
stream; the first from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that loved the stateliness of their
Families;<note place="margin">Emmius Grec.</note> the other from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who desired rather the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their Families than their greatness.</p>
               <p>The manner of conveying of Estates between party and party,<note place="margin">Conveyances in writing.</note> was
either by act of the party executed in his life-time, or after his death.
Such as were executed in the life-time of the owner, and were such as
for the most part were in matters of great moment, were Estates pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by deed of Conveyance in writing: And for this way the <hi>Saxons</hi>
were beholding to the <hi>Latines,</hi> who taught them that course, both for
form and language.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. cap. 31.</note> And <hi>Alfred</hi> enforced by a particular Law, <hi>viz.
That all such as hold Lands by Deed in Writing should hold them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intent thereof, and not alien the same contrary thereunto, the
intent thereof being proved by the Witnesses.</hi> The nature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
in these ancient times may appear by a Deed of one of the
Kings of this Island about 400 years before the Conquest, whereby he
granted Four Plough-lands in the Isle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> unto an Abbess; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
instead of that which we now call the <hi>habendum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Habendum. Vse. Warranty.</note> the words are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulimus
possidendum,</hi> &amp;c. and after that followeth the <hi>uses</hi> of the Deed,
<hi>tuo usui,</hi> &amp;c. and then concludes with a <hi>Warranty,</hi> in these words, <hi>tu vero
successoresque tui defendant in perpetuum, nunquam me haeredesque meos contra
hanc chartulam aliquando esse venturos:</hi> the effect of which last clause
may appear by the Law of the sale of Goods, which in those times was,
that if the sale of Goods <hi>warranted</hi> did not hold,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. c. 74.</note> the loss should light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sellers.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. c. 24.</note> The Deeds were usually subscribed with the name of him
that made the Conveyance,<note place="margin">Ll Edw. c. 24. <hi>Signed.</hi>
                  </note> or passed the Estate; and if he could not
write his name (as it befel often) then the Deed was under-signed with
his <hi>mark:</hi> For <hi>Withered</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> used the sign of the Cross in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
his Grants, <hi>pro ignorantia literarum.</hi> They used also in those days
to <hi>seal</hi> their Deeds;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sealed.</hi> Concil. Brit. p. 198.</note> for so much the conclusion of King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Charter
to the Abbey of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> importeth, in words to this effect in English;
<hi>I</hi> Ina <hi>the King, do confirm this Grant and Liberty, by subscription of my own
hand, and under the seal of the holy Cross.</hi> True it is, <hi>Ingulphus</hi> tells us that
<hi>Seals</hi> to Deeds were of <hi>Norman</hi> original; I believe his intent is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Seals of Wax</hi> annexed or affixed unto Deeds. Lastly, in those days
also they used to attest their Deeds,<note place="margin">Witnesses.</note> by subscribing the names of such as
were present; who being of greater or meaner rank, rendred the credit
of the Deed accordingly more or less valuable: and upon this ground did
the acknowledging or proving of Deeds before the King,<note place="margin">Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</note> Bishop, County,
or Hundred, first arise.</p>
               <p>That was the <hi>Roman</hi> fashion; but the more ancient <hi>German</hi> way of
Conveyance was by <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seisin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Livery and Seisin. <hi>Cragius.</hi>
                  </note> as most suitable to their ignorance,
who had Learning in as slight account as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had, and
cared for no more than would serve the turn of natural necessity. A
property they had both in Lands and Goods; and where that resteth, no
man can deny them the natural way of giving and receiving by delivery.
And therefore though matters of ordinary use seldom come into the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of story, and this petty ceremony might very well pass <hi>sub si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio;</hi>
yet we are not altogether left destitute of the footsteeps thereof
in antiquity.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 319.</note> For <hi>Aethbald</hi> the Mercian King, above Eight hundred years
ago, gave the Monastery of <hi>Cutham,</hi> with all the Lands thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and for the confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
commanded a clod of earth with all the Writings to be laid upon the
Altar.<note place="margin">Concil Brit. 192.</note> Another monument hereof more ancient by the space of above
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64112:44"/>
an hundred years we find in that Grant of <hi>Withered</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> of
four Plough-lands in the Isle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> the latter part whereof this Clause
concludes thus: <hi>Ad cujus cumulum affirmationis, cespitem hujus supradictae
terrae super sanctum altare posui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every man had liberty to execute the Law of his Inheritance in his
life-time; but some were surprized with sudden occasions, and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
issues and ends; and in such cases they did what they could to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their intents by <hi>last Will;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Last Will.</note> which by common intendment being in
writing, hath occasioned some to think that the <hi>Saxons</hi> in their original
had no use thereof, being, as they conceived, so illiterate as not to have
the use of writing. But the Character remaining to this day evinceth
the contrary; nor can those words of <hi>Tacitus, Et nullum est testamentum,</hi>
in any rational way be expounded in this sence, if we consider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
which runneth thus: <hi>Haeredes &amp; successores cuique liberi, &amp; nullum
est testamentum.</hi> Which in my opinion founds in this sence: <hi>The Heirs
and Successours to every one are his Children, and there is no testamentary
power to disherit or alter the course of Descent, which by Custom or Law is
setled.</hi> Otherwise to deny them the use of all testamentary power, was
a matter quite abhorring the custom of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from whom they
learned all that they had.<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 817.</note> Nevertheless the <hi>Saxons</hi> had not been long
acquainted with the <hi>Romanists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malmsb. gest. Reg. l. 2. c. 2.</note> but they had gotten that trick of theirs
also of disheriting by <hi>last Will,</hi> as by the testament of <hi>Aethelwolf,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the like nature, in Histories may appear.</p>
               <p>The Conveyances formerly mentioned concerned Lands and <hi>Goods;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Goods.</note>
but if no such disposal of <hi>Goods</hi> were, the ancient <hi>German</hi> custom car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them after the death of the ancestor promiscuously, or rather in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the Children; but in succeeding times, the one half by the
Law of <hi>Edmond</hi> passed to the relict of the party deceased, by force
of contract rather than course of descent. After him <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
recollecting the Laws, declared that <hi>in case any one died intestate,
the Children should equally divide the Goods;</hi> which I take to be understood
with a <hi>salvo</hi> of the Wifes Dower or Portion. As yet therefore the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have nothing to do with the Administration, for <hi>Goods</hi> passed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
as well as Lands; and upon this custom the Writ <hi>de rationabili parte
bonorum</hi> was grounded at the Common-law, as well for the Children as the
Wifes part,<note place="margin">F. N. Br. 122.</note> according as by the body of the Writ may appear.</p>

they admitted no delays, till upon experience they found that by staying a

times of exemption,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 4. Sec. 16.</note> as that of <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Child-bearing,</hi> in case of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering

of holiness of the time: as that of the <hi>Lords day, Saints days, Fasts, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<hi>days,</hi> but <hi>seasons;</hi> as from <hi>Advent</hi> to the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Epiphany;</hi> from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuagesima</hi>

               <p>ANd this far of the joynts of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government in their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Precincts, Courts, Causes,</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> wherein as the distance
will permit, and according to my capacity, I have endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the Image of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Commonwealth, the more curious linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being now disfigured by time. Afar off it seems a Monarchy,
but in approach discovers more of a Democracy; and if the temper of
a body may appear by the prevailing humour towards age, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
did still appear more prevalent in all assaults both of time
and change. The first great change it felt was from the <hi>Danes</hi> that stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them, and shewed therein much of the wrath both of God and
man. And yet they trenched not upon the fundamental Laws of the
peoples Liberty. The worst effect was upon the Church, in the decay
of the power of Religion and the Worship of God. For after much toil
and loss both of sweat and bloud, the <hi>Danes</hi> (finding that little was
to be gotten by blows but blows, and that the Clergy at the least was
the side-wind in the course of all affairs) laid aside their Paganism, and
joyned with the Clergie: and as their Converts and Pupils, gained not
onely their quiet residence, but by the favour of the Clergie to make
trial of the Throne; and therein served the Clergie so well, as they
brought the people to a perfect Idolatry, with times, places, and persons,
and subjection of their Estates to Church-Tributes. And as at Tennis,
the <hi>Dane</hi> and Bishop served each other with the fond Country-man, that
whether <hi>Lord Dane</hi> or <hi>Lord-Bishop</hi> was the greater burthen, is hard to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64112:45"/>
determined. Thus became ambitious Prelacy in its full glory, and the poor
Church of Christ clouded in darkness, and little hold left for recovery, but
onely by the liberty of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Freemen, which the <hi>Danes</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conquer; not for want of will or power, but of time and occasion:
For the Crown returned to the <hi>Saxon</hi>-line again after the half age of
one man, although it was worn by three; so God would have it: nor did
any monument of the <hi>Danish</hi> Government remain, saving a few customs
in some places, which shew rather that the <hi>Danes</hi> were here, than that they
ruled here.</p>
               <p>To sum up all; The <hi>Saxon</hi> Common-wealth was a building of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
strength downward even to the foundation, arched together both
for Peace and War. That by the Law of <hi>Decenners,</hi> wherein Justice
was the bond, their Armies were gathered, not by promiscuous flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of people, but by orderly concurrence of Families, Kindreds, and
<hi>Decenners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> all chusing their own Leaders. And so Honour, Love, and
Trust conspired together to leave no mans life in danger, nor death unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful composure, mutually dependant in every part from
the Crown to the Clown; the Magistrates being all choice men, and the
King the choicest of the chosen: election being the birth of esteem, and
that of merit; this bred love and mutual trust, which made them as
corner-stones, pointed forward to break the wave of danger. Nor was
other reward expected by the great men, but honour and admiration,
which commonly brought a return of acts of renown.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it was a regular frame in every part, squared and made even by
Laws, which in the people ruled as <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> and in the Magistrate as
<hi>Lex intelligens;</hi> all of them being grounded on the wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and Judicials of <hi>Moses.</hi> Thus the <hi>Saxons</hi> became somewhat like the <hi>Jews,</hi>
distinct from all other people; their Laws honourable for the King, easie
for the Subject; and their Government, above all other, likest unto that
of Christ's Kingdom, whose <hi>Yoke is easie, and Burthen light.</hi> But their
motion proved so irregular, as God was pleased to reduce them by another
way.</p>

               <p>THus was <hi>England</hi> become a goodly Farm: The <hi>Britons</hi> were the
Owners, the <hi>Saxons</hi> the Occupants, having no better title than
a possession upon a forcible entry, with a <hi>continuando</hi> for the space of Four
hundred years: seldom quiet, either from the claim and disturbances of
the restless <hi>Britons,</hi> or invading <hi>Danes;</hi> who not onely got footing in the
Country, but setled in the Throne; and after gave over the same to the
use (as it proved) of another people sprung from the wilde stock of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
and thence transplanted into a milder Climate, yet scarcely civilized.
That in one Isle the glory of God's bounty might shine forth to all the
barbarism of <hi>Europe,</hi> in making a beautiful Church out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
of Nations. These were the <hi>Normans</hi> out of the continent of <hi>France,</hi>
that in their first view appeared like the Pillar of the Cloud, with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Revenge upon the <hi>Danish</hi> pride, the <hi>Saxon</hi> cruelty, and Idolatry
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64112:45"/>
of both people. But after some distance shewed like the Pillar of fire,
clearing God's providence for the good of this Island, to be enjoyed by
the succeeding generations. Nor was this done by Revelation or Vision,
but by over-ruling the aspiring mind of Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> to be
a scourge unto <hi>Harold</hi> for his usurpation, and unto the people for their
causless deserting the Royal Stem. Yet because the haughtiest spirit is
still under fame and opinion, and cannot rest without pretence or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Right and Justice, the Duke first armed himself with Titles,
which were too many to make one good claim; and served rather to
busie mens mindes with musing, whilst he catcheth the prey, than settle
their judgements in approving of his way. First, he was Cousin-german
to the Confessor, and he childless; and thus the Duke was nigh, though
there were nigher than he: but the worst point in the case was, that the
Duke was a Bastard, and so by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law without the line; nor was
there other salve thereto but the <hi>Norman</hi> custom, that made no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
so as the Duke had a colour to frame a Title, though <hi>England</hi> had
no Law to allow it. And this was the best flower of his Garland, when
he meant to solace himself with the <hi>English,</hi> as may appear by what his
Son <hi>Henry</hi> the first sets forth to the World in his Charter whereby he
advanced the Abbey of <hi>Ely</hi> into the degree of a Bishoprick; and wherein,
amongst his other titles,<note place="margin">Spicileg.</note> he calls himself Son of <hi>William</hi> the great, <hi>Qui</hi>
Edwardo <hi>Regi successit in regnum jure haereditario.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if that came short, he had the bequest of the Confessor, who had
designed the Duke to be his Successor: and this was confirmed by the
consent of the Nobility,<note place="margin">M. Paris. 1. Ant. Brit. Eccles. 96.</note> and principally of <hi>Harold</hi> himself, who in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereof promised his Sister to the Duke in marriage. This counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
a double Title, one by <hi>Legacy,</hi> the other by <hi>Election;</hi> and might be
sufficient, if not to make the Duke's title just, yet <hi>Harold</hi>'s the more unjust,
and to ground that quarrel that in the conclusion laid the Duke's way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the Crown. And for the better varnish, the Duke would not be his
own Judge, he refers his Title to be discussed at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so
flattered the Pope with a judicatory power amongst Princes (a trick of
the new stamp) whereby he obtained sentence in his own behalf from the
infallible Chair. The Pope glad hereof, laid up this amongst his Treasures,
as an <hi>Estoppel</hi> to Kings for times to come: And the King made no less
benefit of <hi>Estoppel</hi> against the English Clergie that otherwise might have
opposed him, and of assurance of those to him that were his friends, and
of advantage against <hi>Harold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. 2.</note> that had gotten the Crown <hi>sine Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
authoritate,</hi> and by that means had made Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> and all the
Prelates of <hi>England</hi> his Enemies.</p>
               <p>But if all failed, yet the Duke had now a just cause of quarrel against
<hi>Harold</hi> for breach of Oath and Covenant;<note place="margin">Hist. vit. Eadm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> wherein if <hi>Harold</hi> chanced to
be vanquished, and the Crown offered it self fair, he might without breach
of conscience or modesty accept thereof, and be accounted happy in the
finding, and wise in the receiving, rather than unjustly hardy in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
thereof. And this might occasion the Duke to challenge <hi>Harold</hi> to
single Combat, as if he would let all the World know that <hi>the quarrel was
Personal, and not National.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this mask soon fell off by the death of <hi>Harold;</hi> and the Duke must
now explain himself, that it was the value of the English Crown, and
not the Title, that brought him over. For though he might seem as it
were in the heat of the chase to be drawn to <hi>London,</hi> where the Crown was,
and that he rather sought after his Enemies than it; yet assoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64112:46"/>
the Crown in his power, he disputed not the right, although that was
<hi>Edgar</hi>'s, but possessed himself of the long-desired prey: and yet he did it
in a mannerly way, as if he saw in it somewhat more than Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones: for though he might have taken it by ravishment, yet he
chose the way of wooing by a kind of mutual agreement. Thus this
mighty Conqueror suffered himself to be conquered, and stooping under
the Law of a <hi>Saxon</hi> King, he became a King by lieve; wisely foreseeing, that
a Title gotten by Election, is more certain than that which is gotten by
Power.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLV. That the Title of the Norman Kings to the English Crown was
by Election.</head>
               <p>SOme there are that build their opinion upon passionate notes of angry
Writers, and do conclude that the Duke's way and Title was wholly
by <hi>Conquest,</hi> and thence infer strange aphorisms of State, destructive to the
Government of this Kingdom. Let the Reader please to peruse the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particulars, and thence conclude as he shall see cause.</p>
               <p>It will easily be granted that the Title of <hi>Conquest</hi> was never further
than the King's thoughts, if it ever entred therein: else wherefore did he
pretend other Titles to the world? But because it may be thought that
his wisdom would not suffer him to pretend what he intended, and yet in
practice intended not what he did pretend; it will be the skill of the
Reader to consider the manner of the first <hi>William</hi>'s Coronation, and
his succeeding Government. His Coronation questionless was the same
with that of the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings; for he was crowned in the
Abbey of <hi>Westminster</hi> by the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> because he of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
was not Canonical.<note place="margin">Hoveden. Eadmer. Hist. l. 1. p. 13. M. Paris. vit. Gulielm. Malmsb. l. 3. fol. 154. Wigorn. An. 1066. Glossar. Ll. Gul. Spicil. 190.</note> At his Coronation he made a solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to observe those Laws which were <hi>bonae, &amp; approbatae, &amp; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae
legis Regni; to defend the Church and Church-men; to govern all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
justly; to make and maintain righteous Laws; and to inhibit all spoil
and unjust judgements.</hi> The people also entred into Covenant with
him, <hi>That as well within the Land as without, they would be faithful
to their Lord King</hi> William, <hi>and in every place to keep with all fidelity
his Lands and Honours, together with him, and against Enemies and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to defend.</hi> It is the self-same in substance with the <hi>fealty</hi> that
the <hi>Saxons</hi> made to their Kings, as will appear by the parallelling
them both together. The <hi>Saxons</hi> were sworn to defend the Kingdom
against Strangers and Enemies, together with their Lord the King, and
to preserve his Lands and Honours, together with him, with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;
so as by the <hi>Saxon</hi> way, the Allegiance first terminated on the
Kingdom, and then, as in order thereunto, upon the King, with his Lands
and Honours. But the <hi>Norman</hi> either wholly omitted the first, as needless
to be inserted in a municipal Law, it self being a Law in nature; or else
includeth all within the words <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> taking the same in a
comprehensive sence for the whole Kingdom, and so made up the sum
of the <hi>Saxon fealty</hi> in fewer figures. Which may seem the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
of the twain, because little reason can be rendred why the King should
restrain that defence to his private Lands (if he claimed all by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64112:46"/>
whenas all equally concerned him; or why he should exclude the
publick, whenas both himself and all he had was embarqued therein,
and it might subsist without him, but contrarily not he without it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not to my understanding; nor did the thing enter into the King's
purpose, if the file of his purposes be rightly considered: For speaking
concerning <hi>Castles, Burroughs,</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> which are in nature limbs of
the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Ll. Gul. Spicil. 61.</note> he saith that <hi>they were built for the defence of the
people and Kingdom.</hi> Was this the service of Walls and Fortifications, and
not much rather of men within those places of strength? Certainly the
plain <hi>English</hi> is, that in time of breach of publick quiet and peace, the
Subjects were bound to defend the Kingdom, and in order thereto the
people of the same, and of the King's right included in the publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
else it were a strange conclusion, that each man in particular, and
in their own personalone, was bound to defend the King's right; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imbodied, the Kingdom. And yet more clearly it's apparent, in that
the service of the order of <hi>Knight-hood,</hi> which was the chief strength of
the Nation in those days, was determined upon the service of the King,
and defence of the Kingdom; or which is more plain, for the service of
the King in or for defence of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1100, 1213. Stat. 7. E. 1.</note> as the Statute of <hi>Mortmain</hi>
expounds the same. But not to force the King's sence by argument; if
the King had purposely omitted that clause of the Kingdoms safety, as of
inferiour regard to his own personal interest; it was one of his rashest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
wherein he soon espied his errour: for in the midst of his strong
and conquering Army he held himself unassured, unless he had a better
foundation than that which must change with the lives of a few at the
utmost. And therefore besides the Oath of <hi>fealty</hi> formerly mentioned, he
established a Law of Association, that all <hi>free men</hi> should be sworn Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
1. <hi>To defend the Kingdom with their lives and fortunes against all
enemies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. Spicil. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>to the utmost of their power. 2. To keep the peace and dignities of
the Crown. 3. To maintain right and justice by all means, without deceit and
delay.</hi> Joyn then these two Oaths together, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>fealty,</hi> and this
of <hi>fraternity;</hi> and it will easily appear, that the Allegiance of the <hi>English</hi>
to the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings was no other than what might stand with Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and tender regard of the publick above all: and differing from the
<hi>Saxon fealty</hi> on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y in this, that that was in one Oath, and this in two.
Wherefore whatsoever respects steered in the rear of the King's course,
it is less material so long as the van was right; albeit that the sequel will
prove not much different from the premises, as will appear in the foot of
the whole account.</p>
               <p>Thus entred the first <hi>Norman</hi> upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Throne;<note place="margin">William Rufus.</note> and as he had
some colour of right to countenance his course, so had his Son his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
last Will, and yet he had as little right as he. This was <hi>William
Rufus,</hi> that was of his Fathers way, but of a deeper dye; and therefore
might well be called <hi>William Rufus,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> in grain. He was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happy in the fear or favour of the people, for he had nothing else to
make room for his rising. True it is, he had the good will of his Father,
but he was dead; and probably the people as little regarded it, as he did
them. Nor was it ever observed that the <hi>English</hi> Crown was of so light
account, as to pass by devise of <hi>cestui que use;</hi> and therefore though it was
designed to him from his Father, yet both right and possession was left to
the people to determine and maintain. The <hi>Clergy</hi> first led the way,<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. Wigorn. M. Paris.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first taken a recognizance of him for his good behaviour towards
them; which he assured, as far as large promises and protestations would
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64112:47"/>
serve the turn; and within one year after, standing in need of the favour
of the <hi>Commons</hi> (to maintain possession against his Brother <hi>Robert</hi>) he gave
them as good security as the Clergy had; which he kept in such manner,
that it was a wonder that one of so small interest in the Title, but what
he had by the peoples lieve and favour, should rule in such manner, and
yet die a King; the favour of the people being like a Meteor, that must
be continually fed, or it soon goes out and falls: for evident it is, that
the right of inheritance was his elder Brother <hi>Roberts,</hi> who was the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man, and more experienced Souldier; and upon these principles had
obtained the love of the <hi>Norman</hi> Barons (the flower of his Fathers Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry)
and the liking of the Clergy,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1088.</note> after they had found by experience
the emptiness of their hope in his Brother <hi>William;</hi> and was every way
so superiour to his Brother in advantages, as we are left to believe that
<hi>William</hi> got the day without any other ground, but only that God would
so have it. It is true, the <hi>English</hi> stuck close to him; but how they were
gained or contained, Writers speak not, but tell us of his promises, which
also they tell us were vain, and never had issue further than would stand
with his profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exit William Rufus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Henry first.</note> and in comes his younger Brother <hi>Henry</hi> the first
of that name; a Prince that excelled in wisdom, and by it ruled his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
which served him so far, as his aims and ends reached: his Title
was no better than his Fathers or Brothers, but rather worse; for he had
no colour of last Will to propound him to the people, and his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Robert</hi> was still alive, and by his service of the Church in the War
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> might merit that respect of the Clergy, as not to permit
him to be a loser by so well-deserving service, as in those days that was
accounted. Nevertheless the <hi>English</hi> look upon <hi>Henry</hi> as the fitter man
for their turn; being now at hand, and <hi>Robert</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and being a
native born in <hi>England,</hi> civilized into the <hi>English</hi> garb by education; and
of a wiser and fairer demeanour, and more inclining to peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which both <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>English</hi> much inclined to, as being weary
of thirty years service in the Wars. And therefore it is not marvellous if
they applied themselves to him in a way of capitulation,<note place="margin">Math. 1100. Eadmer. Speed.</note> and less won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
if he hearkned thereunto; and yet neither unadvisedly yielded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by him, nor traiterously propounded by them, as some in zeal to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
conclude the point. The worst of the whole matter resting in
this, that the King bound himself to be just, that he might be great; and
the people to submit unto Justice, that they might be free, like as their
Ancestors were, and themselves by the Law established ought to be. For
the capitulation was in substance setled by the ancient Laws of the <hi>Saxons</hi>
mixed with some additions of Laws made by the Kings Father, with the
joynt advice of the grand Council of the Kingdom; all which both the
<hi>Norman Williams</hi> had often confirmed by solemn protestations and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
however their actions,<note place="margin">Math. Paris.</note> upon sudden surprisal, were <hi>malae consuetudines</hi>
and <hi>exactiones injustae,</hi> by this Kings own acknowledgment. Thus these
three <hi>Norman</hi> Kings made their way to the Throne; the first by Arms,
under colour of Title; the second by a kind of Title, under colour of
Arms; and the last by favour, but all entred the same by <hi>capitulation,
election,</hi> and <hi>stipulation;</hi> and for the general, had some regard to suit their
course in order of retaining the good will of their people, although in a
different measure, according to the differency of occasions.</p>

principles; and first of Parliaments.</head>
               <p>THE principles which I mean, are these: First, the <hi>Legislative power,</hi>
and influence thereof upon the whole. Secondly, the <hi>Members</hi>
of that Government, with their several motions. Thirdly, the <hi>Laws</hi> and
Customs, or Rules of those Motions. And first concerning the <hi>Legislative
power.</hi> Although it be true that the first <hi>Williams</hi> great and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
labour was to have and to hold, and had but little time or liberty
to enjoy; yet that time of rest which he had, did apply it and himself in
the setling of the Laws by the advice of <hi>Common-council:</hi> I say, not by
advice of his own heart, or two or three <hi>Norman</hi> Lords,<note place="margin">Spicileg. p. 5.</note> or of the <hi>Norman</hi>
Nobility only, as some men take the confidence to aver, as if they had
been eye-witnesses to the actions of those days; but by the joynt advice
of the <hi>grand-Council</hi> of the Lords, and wise men of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
I will not insist upon force of argument to shew, that common
reason must of necessity sway the King into this course, but shall reserve
that to another place; the testimonies of Writers must now serve the turn:
and herein, the testimony of the Chronicle of <hi>Lichfield</hi> must have the
first place, which speaks both of a Council of Lords; and saith, that by
their advice he caused to be Summoned a meeting of all the Nobles and
wise men through all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> to set down their Laws
and Customs. This was in the fourth year of his Reign, or rather after
his entry, and as soon as the Kingdom was brought into any reasonable
posture of quiet; and which, besides the intention of governing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
according unto Law, doth strongly pretend that the Parliament had
the <hi>Legislative power</hi> and right of cognizance, and judicature in those
Laws that concerned the Kingdom in general; and for the particular
Laws or Customs of several places or Precincts, it was referred to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
or Jury in every County to set them forth upon Oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Council had power to change Laws, may likewise
appear in that Act made concerning the introduction of the Canon-Law,<note place="margin">Spicil. 167. Fox. Mart. l. 4.</note>
which shews not only the power of that Council in Church-matters, but
also that the Canon was no further in force than the same would allow;
and this was also done by <hi>Common council,</hi> and the Council of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
Bishops, Abbots, and all the Princes of the Kingdom; which
connexion shews plainly, that there was a Council besides that of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and Princes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in matters of general charge upon the whole body of the
people, the King used also the help of this <hi>Grand-council,</hi> as may espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
appear in the <hi>charge of Arms</hi> imposed upon the Subjects;<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 58. Spicil.</note> which
was said to be done by the <hi>Common council</hi> of the whole Kingdom; as is
witnessed even by the Kings own Law. It may seem also, that the <hi>grand
Officers</hi> of the State were elected by such grand assembly of the wise men;
for we find that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> was elected to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Lords and Prelates, and of the whole people, that is,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. fol. 110.</note> by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England;</hi> and as probable it is, that Bishops were therein also
elected, for that the Bishop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> resigned his Bishoprick in such like
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64112:48"/>
Assembly,<note place="margin">Baron. Annal. An. 1070.</note> if the meaning of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> be rightly understood, who saith
in his Letter, that it was in <hi>conventu Episcoporum atque Laicorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, that one Law of the Kings, which may be called the first <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Charta</hi> in the <hi>Norman</hi> times, by which the King reserved to himself
from the <hi>free-men</hi> of this Kingdom nothing but their <hi>free service,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 55.</note> in the
conclusion saith that their Lands were thus granted to them in inheritance
of the King by the <hi>Common-council</hi> of the whole Kingdom; and so asserts
in one the liberty of the <hi>free-men,</hi> and of the <hi>representative</hi> body of the
Kingdom. These footsteps of the Parliament find we in the Conquerors
time, besides other more general intimations scattered amongst the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians;
which may induce opinion to its full strength, that this King,
however Conqueror he was, yet made use of this additional power of
Parliament to perfect his designs; and it may be, more often than either of
his Sons, that yet had less pretence of superlative power to countenance
their proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Rufus</hi> was a man of resolution no whit inferiour, if not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
his Father; and had wit enough for any thing but to govern his
desires, which led him many times wild, and might occasion conceit that
he was almost a mad King, though he were a witty man; and therefore
it is the less marvail if he used not the help of the <hi>Common-council</hi> more
than needs must; where Kings many times are told of that which they
are loth to know. Nevertheless <hi>William</hi> the second could not pass over
thirteen years without a parley with his Commons and Clergy, unless
he meant to adventure a parley between them and his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi>
who like an Eagle eyed his posture, though he hovered afar off.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> the first was more wise, and being trained up even from the
Cradle in the <hi>English</hi> garb, moralized by Learning, and now admitted
into the Throne, found it the wisest course to apply himself to the rule
of an <hi>English</hi> King, <hi>viz. To win and maintain the good opinion of the people,
by consorting together with them under one Law;</hi> and pledging himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by taking unto Wife one of the <hi>English</hi> Blood-royal: by this means he
refeised and reassumed the <hi>English,</hi> in partnership with the <hi>Norman</hi> in their
ancient right of Government; and reconciled the minds of the people,
under a lively hope of enjoying a setled Government. Nor were they
greatly deceived herein, for his course was less planetary than that of
either of his predecessors; and yet we find little said of his parley with
his people in a Parliamentary way, although more of his Laws than of
any of his predecessors. The reason will rest in this, that the Writers
of those times touch more upon matters of ordinary than political obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and regarded rather the thing, than the place or manner how.
The Laws therefore,<note place="margin">Bede Hist. l. 3. c. 30.</note> although they are not entituled as made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet in the continuation of the History of <hi>Bede,</hi> it is noted that the
King renewed or confirmed the ancient Laws in <hi>Concilio peritorum &amp; probo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
virorum regni Angliae;</hi> which may give sufficient cause to suppose, that
he declined not the ancient way, no more than he did the ancient Law.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLVII. Of the Franchise of the Church in the Normans time.</head>
               <p>THE Canon-Law, that ever since <hi>Austin</hi>'s coming, like Thunder,
rumbled in the Clouds, now breaks forth with confusion to all
opposers. It had formerly made many fair proffers of service to this
Island, but it was disaccepted, as too stately to serve; yet by often courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
received, it was allowed as a Friend afar off. For the vast body of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, like a body wasting with age, died upward, and left the
<hi>Britains</hi> to their own Laws, before the second Beast was grown; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
young, was nourished under the Imperial Law of the first Beast, till
it grew as strong as its Dam, and began to prey for it self. The Empire
perceiving its grey hairs, and the youthful courage of this Upstart, was
glad to enter mutual League with it, That to maintain the <hi>Ecclesiastical
Monarchy,</hi> and This again to support the <hi>Imperial:</hi> and so became the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Imperial Law to be united, and the Professours to be <hi>utriusque
juris.</hi> But this parity continued not long; the young Beast looked like
a Lamb, but spake like a Lion; and contrarily, the Eagle had cast its Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and could towre no more; so as by this time the Pope was too
good for the Emperour, and the Canon-Law above the Imperial; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it to serve the turn: And so the Professours of both Laws became
Students in the Civil, but Practisers of the Canon. This Composition
thus made beyond the Seas, the great work was how to transport it over
into this Isle: for the Emperour could entitle the Pope to no power here,
because none he had. <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk undertakes the work; he offers
it to the <hi>Britains</hi> under the goodly Title of Universal Bishop: but they
kept themselves out of Canon-shot. The <hi>Saxons</hi> allowed the Title, but
liked not the power; the Monk observed the stop, and left time to work
out that which present cunning could not, being content for the present
that a League of Cohabitation should be made between the two Swords,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 3.</note>
though the spiritual were for the present underling; not despairing that it
would work out its own way over the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law, as it had done over the
Imperial. Nor did his conceit altogether fail: for the <hi>Saxons</hi> by little
allowed much, and the <hi>Danes</hi> more; although the main was preserved
until the <hi>Normans</hi> came upon the Stage, who made their way by the
Pope's lieve, and gave him a colour of somewhat more than ever any of
their <hi>Saxon</hi> predecessors had done; and to gain the more quiet possession
of the Crown to themselves, allowed the Pope the honour of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
learned to draw the Conveyance: which, as some think, was made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously
for the Pope himself in point of tenure, but more probably
in the Covenants. For the Conquerour was scarce setled in his seat, but
the Canon-Law began to speak in the voice of a Royal Law:<note place="margin">Spicil. 167. Fox. Mart. l. 4.</note> First com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of misgovernment, as if the Church were extremely wronged by
having the same way and Law of Tryal with the Commons of <hi>England;</hi>
and then propounds four several Expedients, enough to have undone the
whole Commonwealth in the very entrance, had not the superstition of
those times blinded both Parliament and People, and rendred them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to that which their successours in future ages often repented of.</p>
               <p>No offence against the Bishops Laws, shall be handled in the Hundred.</p>
               <p>By the Saxon Law, Church-matters had the preheminence both in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64112:49"/>
Hundred and in the County; and it was the Bishop's duty to joyn with
the Sheriff in those Courts, to direct and see to the administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
and yet the Canon had been above three hundred years foregoing
in the Negative.</p>
               <p>No Case concerning the Regiment of Souls, shall be brought before the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Judge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Regiment of Souls</hi> was a common place sufficient to contain any
thing that was in order thereunto: and so every one that hath a Soul,
must be no more responsible unto the temporal Judge for any matter
concerning it, but unto the Ecclesiastical power: And this not onely in
case of scandal, as against the moral Law or rule of Faith; but for disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
done to the Canons, made afar off, concerning any gesture or garb
that may come within the savour of an Ecclesiastical conceit.</p>
               <p>That all Delinquents against the Bishops Laws, shall answer the Fact in a
place appointed by the Bishop to that end.</p>
               <p>So as now the Bishop hath gotten a Court by the Statute-Law, that
had formerly no other Cards to shew but that of the Canon; and a Court
of such place as the Bishop shall appoint, however inconvenient for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or uncertainty it be.</p>
               <p>That the tryal of such matters, shall be according to the Law of the Canon,
and not according to that of the Hundred.</p>
               <p>That is, not by <hi>Jury,</hi> but by Witnesses, in a clandestine way, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
please; or without any Accuser, or by more scrutiny, or any other
way that may reserve the Lay-man to the breast of a prepossessed spirit of
the spiritual Judge. And thus the poor Country-man is exposed to the
censure of an unknown Law, in an unknown Tongue, by an unknown
way; wherein they had no footing, but by an implicit Faith. And
herein the providence of God (I imagine) was more manifest than the
wisdom of Man, which was too weak to foresee events at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
for questionless it was a point of excellent wisdom, for the people
(now under a King of a rugged nature, that would not stick to catch
whatsoever he could get) to deposit part of their Liberties into the hands
of the Clergie; from whom moderation might be expected, as from
Friends and Neighbours, and (as Partners in one Ship) mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to withstand the waves of Prerogative of Kings, that seldom rest till
they break all Banks, and sometimes over-reach their own Guard, and
cannot return when they would. And thus it fell out: for many times
the Pope and Clergie became Protectors of the peoples Liberties, and
kept them safe from the rage of Kings, until the time of restitution should
come; and became not onely a Wall of defence to the one, but a Rock
of offence to the other. For the Tripple-Crown could never solder with
the <hi>English,</hi> nor it with that; the strife was for Prerogative, wherein, if
the Clergie gained, the Crown lost; and no moderation would be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For the conquering King was scarce warm in his Throne, whenas
the Pope demanded Fealty of him for the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spicil. 164. Baron. Annal. An. 1068.</note> and the
King's own good Archbishop and friend <hi>Lanfrank</hi> delivered the Message;
as also <hi>Anselm</hi> did afterwards to <hi>William Rufus;</hi> which though these Kings
had courage enough to deny, yet it shewed plainly that the Popes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no less Game than <hi>Crown-glieke</hi> with the King and people; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
and Bishops holding the Cards for the Pope, while in the interim he
oversaw all.<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. l. 1. p. 25.</note> The <hi>Norman</hi> Kings thus braved, paid the Popes in their own
Coin, and refused to acknowledge any Pope, but such as are first allowed
by their concurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64112:49"/>
Thus have we the second bravado of the Canon-Law; for as yet it
was not so fully entered, as it seemed. The words of the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it's true, were general; yet their sence was left to time to expound,
and the course of succeeding affairs nevertheless passed with a <hi>non obstante.</hi>
For whereas in those days the Clergie claimed both Legislative and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory
power in Church-matters, the <hi>Normans</hi> would allow of neither,
but claimed both as of right belonging to the Imperial power of this
Island, originally and onely. As touching the Legislative power, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that notwithstanding the Canon that had long before this time vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Laity from having to do with Church-matters; yet the <hi>Norman</hi>
Kings would neither allow to the Metropolitans the power of calling Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
nor such meetings, but by their lieve,<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. p. 6. &amp; 24. Spicil. 163.</note> although it was earnestly
contended for. Neither could the Clergie prevail to exclude the Laity
out of their Synods, being assembled, nor from their wonted priviledge
of voting therein; albeit that for a long time by Canon it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted.
The differences between the Clergie and the Kings, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these and other matters, grew so hot, that Kings liked not to have
any Synods or meetings of publick Council;<note place="margin">Epist. ad Pascal. p. p.</note> and Archbishop <hi>Anselm</hi>
complained that <hi>William Rufus</hi> would not allow any to be called for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years together: Which by the file of story, compared with that
Epistle, made up the King's whole Reign. And this was questionless
the cause that we find so little touch upon Parliamentary Assemblies in
the <hi>Norman</hi> times, Kings being too high to be controuled, and Bishops
too proud to obey: but necessity of State, like unto Fate, prevails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all other interests whatsoever; and the wisdom of <hi>Henry</hi> the first
in this prevailed above that of his predecessors, as far as their Will was
beyond his. For it was bootless for him to hold out against the Church
that stood in need of all sorts to confirm to him that which common
Right (as then it was taken) denied him; and therefore (though it
cost him much trouble with <hi>Anselm</hi>) he re-continued the liberty of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Consultations, and yet maintained his Dignity and Honour seemly
well. I shall not need to clear this by particulars; for besides the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Consultations at his entrance, and twice after that, for supply or aid
for his Wars, and the marriage of his Daughter with the Emperour, it is
observed that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> summoned a Council at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
but it was <hi>Authoritate Regia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conten. Wigorn. An. 1127.</note> and that there assembled <hi>magnae mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudines
Clericorum, Laicorum, tam divitum quam mediocrium;</hi> and that
upon the third day the Debate was <hi>de negotiis saecularibus nonnullis:</hi> The
issue of all was, that some things were <hi>determinata,</hi> others <hi>dilata,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters <hi>propter nimium aestuantis turbae tumultum ab audientia judican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
profligata.</hi> Out of which may be probably concluded, 1. That
the Laity as yet were present in Councils with the Clergie. 2. That they
were all in one place. 3. That they all had votes, and that the major
number concluded the matter. 4. That certain persons used to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the major number by the hearing, and that the Votes were still
<hi>clamore non calculis.</hi> 5. That they held an Order in debating of affairs,
<hi>viz.</hi> on some days Ecclesiastical, and on other days Secular. 6. That all
matters concluded, were attested by the King, who, as 'tis said, did give
his consent, and by his authority did grant and confirm the same. And
upon the whole matter it will be probable, that as yet Councils, and
those now called Parliaments, differed not in kind, although possibly there
might be difference of names, in regard that some might be immediately
and mainly occasioned and urged by Temporal Exigences, and others by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64112:50"/>
Ecclesiastical; but whether Temporal or Ecclesiastical the first occasion
was, yet in their meetings they handled both as occasion offered it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Clergie could not attain the sole Legislative power, so
neither had they the sole Juridical power in Ecclesiastical Causes: for not
onely in case of errour in the Ecclesiastical Courts was an Appeal reserved
to the King's Court, as formerly in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time; but even those things
which seemed properly of Ecclesiastical cognizance, were possessed by
the King's Court in the first instance, as that of <hi>Peter</hi> pence, which was a
Church-tribute, and might be claimed to be properly the Church-cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
much rather than Tythes:<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 20. Spicil. 180.</note> and yet by the Law of this Kingdom in
the Conquerour's time, it is especially provided, That defaults of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that duty shall be amended in the King's Court, and a fine for
default was given to the King, albeit that the Bishop was made the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector,
and the Pope the Proprietor. And many other particulars, which
were holden to be of Ecclesiastical cognizance, Kings would draw them
within the compass of <hi>maintaining the peace of the Church,</hi> which properly
belonged to them to defend; and so had the cognizance of them in their
own Courts, and fines for invasion of the Church-rights. But because
this may seem but colourable, and by way of flattery of the Churches
right, and not in opposition thereof; in other things it will appear plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Kings were not nice in vindicating their own claim in matters
which the Clergie held theirs <hi>quarto modo;</hi> as namely in the case of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi>
a Weapon first fashioned by the Church-men, and in the
exercise whereof themselves were in repute the onely Masters; and yet
in this were mastered by Kings,<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. p. 6. Ll. H. 1. cap. 5.</note> whose Laws directed and restrained the
swelling of that censure, and made it keep measure; whose Tenants and
Officers and Servants must not be meddled with by this censure, but by
the King's lieve; nor must they be called to answer but in the King's
Court. That Right still remained to them after the spoil made by the
Hierarchy upon the Rights of all the rest of the <hi>Free-men,</hi> and therefore
could not of right be called <hi>nova</hi> in the Historians sence; seeing that it
was no other than the ancient custom used amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi> before
that the Clergie had either purpose or power to reach at such a height as
afterwards by degrees they attained unto. Furthermore, the Hierarchy,
as they neither could possess the Legislative nor Juridical power in Church-matters,
so neither could they possess themselves: for as yet they were
the King's men, and the more the King's men, because they now think a
Bishoprick but a naked commodity, if not robed with a <hi>Barony.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
before that ever they knew that honour, whatever the Canon was
for their election, yet both their Title and Power <hi>de facto</hi> was derived to
them from the Kings, who also invested them with Staff and Ring; nor
had the Pope as yet (though he had conquered the Hierarchy) possessed
himself of their colours: but during all the <hi>Norman</hi> times, the Kings
maintained that trophy of the right they had from their Predecessours,
notwithstanding the many assaults from <hi>Rome,</hi> and treacheries of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals
within the Realm.<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. l. 2. p. 53. &amp; l. 3. &amp; l. 4. Eadmer. Hist. l. 1. &amp; l. 5. Wigorn. An. 1128. Spicil. 142.</note> And albeit sometimes Kings were too weak
to hold the shadow, yet the convention of the States did maintain the
substance, <hi>viz.</hi> the right of Election without intermission, as the examples
of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> unto the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Anselm</hi> and <hi>Ralph</hi> his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
and of <hi>Thomas</hi> into the See of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Ralph</hi> Coadjutor to <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
Archbishop of the same See, and of <hi>Gilbert</hi> into the See of <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
others, do sufficiently set forth. Whether it was because the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of States was more stout, or that the Bishops, now wedded to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64112:50"/>
                  <hi>Baronies,</hi> were so unquestionably interessed in the publick affairs of
the Commonwealth, that it was against common sense to deny the States
their vote and cognizance of their Election, I cannot determine; yet it is
a certain truth, the more <hi>Baron,</hi> the less <hi>Bishop,</hi> and more unmeet for the
service of <hi>Rome:</hi> Politickly therefore it was done by Kings to hold these
men by a Golden hook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that otherwise had prostituted themselves to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
power, and proved absolute deserters of their Countries Cause, which
now they must maintain under peril of the loss of their own honour.</p>
               <p>In the next place, as they were the King's men, so their Bishopricks and
Diocesses were under the King's power to order, as by the advice of the
Bishops and Baronage should be thought most convenient; either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
another Bishop with part thereof,<note place="margin">Eadm. l. 4. p. 95, 96.</note> and so to make two Diocesses of
one, as befel in the case of the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> out of which the Diocess
of <hi>Ely</hi> budded in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first; or to endow a Monastery
or other Religious foundation with part, and exempt the same from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
or ordinary jurisdiction, as in the example of the foundation of
the Abbey of <hi>Battel</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> in the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour,<note place="margin">Spicil. 165.</note>
may appear.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whatever the first intention of this recited Statute were, it may
probably be judged, that it was but a noise to still the Clergie; and that
it never had more than a liveless shape, not onely in regard of the before-mentioned
particulars, but especially in regard of that subservient Law of
<hi>Henry</hi> the first concerning the County-Court, which reciteth it as a custom
in his time used, that the Bishop and Earls,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> with other the chief men of
that County, were there present as Assistants in directory of judgment.
And that in order are handled first, <hi>matters of the Church:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>Crown-pleas:</hi> Thirdly and lastly, <hi>Common-pleas.</hi> However therefore the
Kings spake fair, they either acted not at all, or so coolly, as the current of
the custom was too strong; but most probable it is, that the Kings spake
fair till they were setled in their Thrones, and afterwards pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for by the general thred of story, it may appear that the Clergie
in those times were more feared than loved, and therefore ridden with a
strait Rein. The Prelacy on the contrary grew unruly, yet too weak for
the rugged spirits of the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings; they are glad to be quiet, and
the Pope himself to drive fair and softly, as judging it expedient <hi>potestatem
Regalem mitius tractandam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. Epist. l. 9.</note> and continued that course and posture till the
calmer times of <hi>Henry</hi> the first; wherein they mended their pace,<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. l. 4. p. 95.</note> and
got that without noise which they had long striven for, <hi>viz.</hi> the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and <hi>presidency in the Synods,</hi> though the King himself be present;
and (if the Historian writeth advisedly) the whole ordaining, or <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power,</hi> for so runs the stile or phrase of the Author, <hi>Archiepiscopi &amp;
Episcopi statuerunt in praesentia Regis,</hi> as if the presence of the King and his
Barons and People, were but as a great <hi>Amen</hi> at the Common-prayer (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the old stamp) to set a good colour upon a doubtful matter, to make
it go down the better. How the Kings brooked this draught, I cannot
say; but it hath made the Kingdom stagger ever since, and it may be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
will hardly recover its perfect wits, so long as the brains of the Clergie
and the Laity thus lie divided in several Cells.</p>

one principal work that he undertook to reduce the Laws into course,
which had been intermitted during the violent times of his Father and
Brother, (the first of whom never had liberty for reformation, and the
latter never had will) so amongst other Laws he setled those concerning
the <hi>County-court;</hi> namely,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 7.</note> 1. <hi>That the Bishops, Earls, and chief men, should

the Church-matters should precede, and then the Crown-pleas. And lastly, the
Common-Pleas;</hi> besides some other particulars concerning pleading, and
proceedings in the handling of Causes. Neither were these Causes of a
petty regard onely, but of greatest concernment: One example I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind

was by him made Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and therewith had the gift of a large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory

of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stigand.</note> possessed himself by disseism of divers Lands and
Tenements belonging to that See. <hi>Lanfrank</hi> the succeeding Archbishop
being informed hereof, petitioned to the King that Justice might be done
him <hi>secundum legem terrae:</hi> and the King sends forth his Writ to summon
a <hi>County-court.</hi> The Debate lasted three days before the <hi>Free men</hi> of the
County of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the presence of many chief men, Bishops and Lords,
and others skilful in the Laws; and the Judgment passed for the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Lanfrank</hi> upon the Votes of the <hi>Free men.</hi> This <hi>County-court</hi> was
holden by special summons, and not by adjournment, as was allowable
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law upon special occasions: And this Suit was originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and had its final determination in the <hi>County-court,</hi> and not brought
by a <hi>Tolt</hi> out of the Hundred-court, as is supposed by an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter;
nor by the ancient Laws could the Suit commence in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
because the Lands and Tenements did lie in several Hundreds and
Counties. The upshot of all is, that the <hi>County-courts</hi> in those days were of
so great esteem, that two of the greatest Peers of the Realm, one a <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
the other an <hi>Italian,</hi> did cast a Title in fifteen Mannors, two Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,

used to joyn several Hundreds together into one Court: but this was by

to be had,<note place="margin">Courts of Towns and Mannors.</note> being of too private a regard to come into fame in those
rough times: yet in <hi>Hen.</hi> the first's Laws it is ordered that <hi>Town-courts</hi> should
meet every month,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1, c. 7.</note> and that Lords should hold Pleas either in their own
persons, or by their Stewards; and that the chief man in the Parish, with
four other of the chiefer sort, and the Minister or Parish-Priest, should
joyn their assistance in that work. But in nothing more did the <hi>Norman</hi>
Kings shew their paternal love to the Commonwealth, than in the Law of
Pledges or <hi>Decenners:</hi> for as of all other Beauties,<note place="margin">Decenners.</note> this suffered most ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
from the storm of the <hi>Norman</hi> Invasion; so was it their especial care
to renew the life thereof, not now amongst the Natives onely, but joyning
the <hi>Normans</hi> to the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the same bond of Brotherhood, utterly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64112:52"/>
drowned thereby all memory of Lordly power; and so of divers peoples
making one, conquered even Conquest it self, if any were, and made all
joynt-partners in one common Liberty.</p>
               <p>Every Free-man must be under Pledges to satisfie Justice,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 64.</note> in case of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</p>

any be departed, to enquire the cause: and if any be come in, whether he be
under Pledges or not.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings had their people under treble guard: one
of <hi>Fealty,</hi> the other of <hi>Association,</hi> and the third that of <hi>Pledges;</hi> and all
little enough to secure that which they in their own Consciences might
have some cause to question whether it belonged to them or not.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLIX. Of the Immunities of the Saxon Free-men under the Norman
Government.</head>
               <p>THE freedom of an <hi>English</hi>-man consisteth in three particulars:
First, in <hi>ownership</hi> of what he hath: Secondly, in <hi>voting any Law,</hi>
whereby that <hi>ownership</hi> is to be maintained: And thirdly, in having an
influence upon that <hi>Judicatory power</hi> that must apply that Law. Now
that the <hi>English</hi> under the <hi>Normans</hi> enjoyed all this freedom unto each
Man's own particular, besides what they had in bodies aggregate, may
appear, as followeth: The Free-men of <hi>England</hi> were such as either
joyned in the War with <hi>Harold</hi> against the <hi>Normans;</hi> or such as absen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves from the way of opposition or enmity, and were either
waiting upon their own affairs, or siding with the <hi>Normans.</hi> And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
all the sadness of the War befel the first sort of the <hi>English,</hi>
whose persons and Estates (to make the ways of the first <hi>Norman Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
regular, and of one piece) never fell so low as to come under
the Law (or rather the Will) of <hi>Conquest;</hi> but in their worst condition
were in truth within the directory of the Law of forfeiture for Treason
against their Soveraign Lord, whose claim was by Title, as hath been
already noted. The other sort either did appear to be the <hi>Normans</hi> friends,
or for ought appeared so were: and so never offending the Law, never
suffered any penalty; but held their persons and possessions still under
the patronage of Law, as anciently they and their Ancestors had done.
And that this was the <hi>Normans</hi> meaning, they publish the same to the
World in a Fundamental Law,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 55.</note> whereby is granted, That all the <hi>Free-men</hi>
of the whole Kingdom shall have and hold their Lands and Possessions in
hereditary right for ever.</p>
               <p>And by this being secured against forfeiture, they are further saved from
all wrong by the same Law, which provideth,</p>
               <p>That they shall hold them well or quietly, and in peace, free from all
unjust Tax, and from all Tallage, so as nothing shall be exacted nor taken,
but their free service which by right they are bound to perform.</p>
               <p>This is expounded in the Laws of <hi>H. 1. cap. 4. That no Tribute or Tax
shall be taken, but what was due in the Confessor's time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64112:52"/>
Under the word <hi>Tax</hi> is understood <hi>monetagium commune per civitates,</hi>
or <hi>comitatus;</hi> so as aids and escuage are not included, for they are not
charged upon Counties and Cities, but upon Tenures in Knight-service;
nor was <hi>Dane gelt</hi> hereby taken away, for that was a Tax in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor's
time, and granted by Parliament.</p>
               <p>So then the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings claimed no other right in the Lands and
possessions of any of their Subjects, than under and by the Law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right; and they conclude the Law with a <hi>sicut,</hi> which I thus English,
<hi>As it is enacted to them, (or agreed by them) and unto them by us given and
granted by the Common-council of our whole Kingdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statutum est eis &amp; illis à nobii datum &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessum per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um totius Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni Nostri.</note> I leave the words
to be criticized upon as the Reader shall please; being well assured, that
the most strained sence can reach no further than to make it sound as
an Estoppel or Conclusion to the King and his Successors to make any
further claim unto the Estates of his Subjects than by Law or Right
is warrantable; under which notion <hi>Conquest</hi> never did nor can come,
as shall more fully be manifested hereafter. But the right <hi>genius</hi> of
this Law will also more evidently appear by the practice of those times,
which, even when Justice it self did most importune, so tenderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the liberty of mens Estates, that no Distress could issue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick Warrant obtained; and upon three Complaints first made,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 42, &amp; 45.</note>
and right not done. And when Rape and Plunder was in the heat, and
men might seem to have no more right than they had power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
yet even then this Law was refuge sufficient for such as were
oppressed;<note place="margin">Gloss. 227. Camb. Brit. Norsf.</note> and was pleaded in bar against all usurpations and intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
under pretext of the Conquerour's right whatsoever; as by the
Case of <hi>Edwyn</hi> of <hi>Sharneburn</hi> may appear. Secondly, the Freemen
of <hi>England</hi> had vote in the making of Laws, by which <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi>
was bounded and maintained, as may appear by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said; nor shall I endeavour further therein. Thirdly, they had
an influence upon the judicatory power: For first, the matter in fact was
determined by the votes of the <hi>Freemen,</hi> as the laws of the Conquerour,
and of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, do sufficiently manifest. Secondly, they had an
influence in the making of the Sheriff, who, as well as the Bishop, was
by Election of the people. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 15.</note> they had an influence upon all
Judges, by setting a penal Law upon them in case of corruption; which
if not so penal as to take away life, was nevertheless penal enough to make
an unjust Judge to be a living pattern and example of misery, to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to beware.</p>
               <p>Two things more must be added, though somewhat collateral to this
purpose. Concerning the right of the <hi>Freemen</hi> in the common <hi>Mint,</hi>
and in their <hi>Villains.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Mint,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Aethelst c. 6</note> that the <hi>Saxons</hi> having made
it as parcel of the demesues of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Ll. Aetheldr. c. 22.</note> and leaving to the King
onely an overseership, reserved the controul and chief survey thereof
to the Grand Council of the Kingdom, who had slated the same in the
<hi>Confessour</hi>'s time. But after him the <hi>Normans</hi> changed the current accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own liking, till by <hi>Henry</hi> the first it was reduced into the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
course,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1.</note> allowing no money but such as was currant in the days
of the <hi>Confessour,</hi> whose Laws also (with some alterations by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi>
with common advice) he also established. Concerning the
Lords right to their <hi>Villains,</hi> it is observable, first,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 65. &amp; 66.</note> that liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchisement
was allowed; which could never have been, had not the
Liberty of the Subject been saved. Secondly, that <hi>Infranchisement</hi>
properly is the work of the people, or the body; and the Lord was to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64112:53"/>
deliver his <hi>villain</hi> by his right hand unto the Sheriff in full County-court,
and pronounce him free from his Service; and shall make room for him
by free passage and open doors, and deliver him free Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> a Lance
and a Sword, and then he is made a <hi>Freeman,</hi> as I conceive, to all intents
and purposes. Otherwise there might be <hi>manumission;</hi> as if the <hi>villain</hi>
remained in a City,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 66.</note> Borough, walled Town, or Castle, by a space of a year
and a day, and no claim made to his service by his Lord, he shall be
thenceforth free from the service of his Lord for ever: and yet this <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numission</hi>
could not conclude any but the Lord, and his Heirs or Assignes;
nor could it enforce the body to allow that for a Member, which was none
before. Thirdly, that notwithstanding they allowed the Lords liberty of
<hi>infranchisement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. 65.</note> yet would they not allow them free liberty of disposing
them as other Chattels: nor by the Law of the Conquerour might they
sell their <hi>Villains</hi> out of the Countrey, or beyond Sea; for the King had
right to the mediate service of every <hi>Villain,</hi> though the Lord had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate;
and therefore that Law might hold in force: nevertheless the
Ordinance that <hi>Anselm</hi> made, that no Lord should sell his <hi>Villain,</hi> they
would never allow for a Law, nor did it hold in force.</p>

as to the future custom, which now began to alter, according to the
increase or wane of the Moon. I do not find this misdemeanour to be
formerly so much taken to heart by the Crown; nor possibly would it
have been at this time, but that the King must protect the Church, if he
mean to be protected by it: and it was taken kindly by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
till they found they were able enough to defend their own right
by themselves. Amongst all the rest of Church-rights this one especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is confirmed, <hi>viz. That any Delinquent shall have liberty of Sanctuary
to enjoy both Life and Member, notwithstanding any Law to the contrary.</hi>
This priviledge was claimed by the Canons; but it must be granted by
the Temporal power, or else it could not be had; and though it be true
that Kings formerly did by their Charters of foundation grant such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
in particular; yet could not such Grants create such immunities
contrary unto, or notwithstanding any publick Law of the Kingdom;
and therefore the Monasteries had their foundations confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>This was the ancient Law of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and was continued without

to be punished with death; but the <hi>Danes</hi> bringing in a moderation, if it
may rightly be so called, are now seconded by their kindred the <hi>Normans,</hi>
who will not admit of punishment by death, partly because being a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
people,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 67.</note> bloodshed might seem to rank itself under the Regiment of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and partly because they owed much to that Title for the possession of
all that they had gotten in <hi>England.</hi> And to prevent scandal, entring upon
the rear, opinion stept in, that a miserable life was more penal than death;
and therefore in crimes of the deepest die, they came to fine and loss of
Member: and which course prevailed most,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> either to stop or enlarge the
course of that sin, was left to the disposition of such as intended to make
trial. But in matters of less malignancy, the purss rather smarted than
the body, wherein they proceeded so far as to punishment of death by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
yet was not the fine to be measured by the judgment of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or rigour of any person,<note place="margin">Miror. 254. Ll. Gulielm. c. 8. 10, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> but only of the Law itself, which set down
in certainty both the nature and quantity of the fine; and left that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
upon record of a good mind at least to an equitable and just Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
In all these cases of breach of peace, the King's Court

the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>peace;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 3.</note> not so much because that it is left only to his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
care to maintain, as because the fines for most of those crimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the King: for otherwise there is a sort of crimes that are <hi>contra

               <p>I shall conclude this subject with these three Observations: First, that
the Laws in those ancient times of the <hi>Normans</hi> were so general, as they
then made no difference between places or persons; but whether the peace
was broken upon holy or common ground,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 10.</note> or upon a Lay-man, or one
in orders, the Lay-power seized upon all. The second is the care they had
for apprehending of the offenders in this kind. If the party slain were a
<hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>Frenchman,</hi> the Lord of the Manslayer was charged to have
him forthcoming within a certain time,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 53.</note> or pay the Kings Fine of 46 Marks,
so long as he had wherewith to satisfie, and for what remained the whole
Hundred was charged. But if the party slain were of any other people,
the Hundred was immediately charged with the Manslayer, and must
bring him to answer within a certain time,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 26.</note> or pay the Kings fine. The
third and last is, the care they had to prevent breach of peace for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
first in setling of night-watches by all Cities, Burroughs, Castles,
and Hundreds, in such manner as the Sheriff or chief Officers by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-council
shall advise for the best safety of the Kingdom. Secondly,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 56.</note>
in forbidding entertainment of unknown persons above three days,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 46.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
surety for their good abearance,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 8.</note> or becoming their pledge for the
publick safety, nor to let any persons pass away without testimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Ministers and Neighbours hand of their good carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Man committing Adultery with a Married Woman,<note place="margin">7. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
to his Lord the price of his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This made the crime enquirable at the common-Law, as an offence
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>contra pacem Domini;</hi> but afterward it was sinable to the King,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 14.</note> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
amongst the pleas of the Crown by the Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the first.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 10.</note>

Member.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The crime and offences against this Commandment were always puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Temporal Courts, by Fine at the least; and are still in the
<hi>Normans</hi> time prosecuted in the same way, notwithstanding the growing
authority of the Canon.</p>

<hi>Normans</hi> is setled in the more merciful way; and in case the delinquent
made flight, the pledge satisfied the Law for him. But in the latter times
of <hi>Henry</hi> the first the Law was again reduced to the punishment of this
crime by death,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 4.</note> and so hath continued.</p>

first branch whereof was ancient, and doubtless in continual use; but
the iniquity of the <hi>Norman</hi> rude times was such, that the Lords under
surmise of arrears or relief, would seize all the personal estate after the
Tenant's death, and so the right of last Wills was swallowed up; but

               <head>CHAP. LII. Of Laws that concern common interest of Lands.</head>
               <p>THe Laws that concern Lands, and peculiarly belonging to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
are such as concern principally the tenure of Lands; which
if duly considered, although savoured somewhat of the King, yet little of
the Conquerour. For generally it must be granted, that Tenures long
before and after this time, were, as the services, ordered according to the
Will of the giver, in which as the King had the greatest share, and he the
most publick person of all: so were his Donations ordered chiefly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the publick service; and in this regard the Tenure by Knight ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
might more principally challenge the King's regard, than the regard
of all the great men besides. But this was not the sore, yea, rather it
was the beauty and strength of the Kingdom; and for which the King
deserved an honourable name above most of his progenitors, who had not
so much Land to dispose of as he had, and therefore could not advance
that service in any proportion equal unto him. The sore that caused so
many sighs, was the incumbrances raised upon this most noble and free
service, which through the evil of times by this means became the most
burdensome, and the onely loathed and abhorred service of all the rest.
I say through the evil of times; for it cannot lodge in my thoughts
but that in the <hi>Norman</hi> times the incumbrances were nothing so great
as of latter Ages, and that much hath been imputed to the Laws
of the Conquerour, which they never deserved, as may appear in
these particulars, which the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First have preserved
in memory.</p>

Money as they pleased: and by the very words of the Law, it seems they
had brought it to an Arbitrary power, to take what they could get, and
yet all against Law.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The sence hereof in short is, that these might marry at their own will,
without paying Fine or Composition to the Lord; and yet must have the
liking of the Lord so far as to declare whether the man intended were
his Enemy or not, and fit to perform Knight-service. This Law was
therefore grounded upon the present distress of affairs, wherein the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was unsetled, and common right having established a mutual trust
between Lord and Tenant, found out this means to preserve the same:
for if the marriages of those that are related to the Tenant in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as may inherit part of all his Lands, or have joynture therein, should
be left altogether at the liberty of the Tenant or his Widow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must
needs follow, that the mutual trust between Lord and Tenant must fail,
and the publick receive damage. And therefore if this custom were of
<hi>Norman</hi> birth, it was begotten upon a <hi>Saxon</hi> Law, and might the rather
be owned by the <hi>English.</hi>

and Portion so long as she keeps unmarried.<note place="margin">Dower.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The portion here is in the Latine word <hi>maritagium,</hi> which I take to
be the <hi>Marriage portion</hi> given by the Husband according to the <hi>Saxon</hi>
custom, whenas the Dower in Land was not in use; whereof is spoken
formerly in that Chapter of Dower. And the <hi>Normans</hi> were necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to introduce this custom of theirs with themselves, partly because it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64112:56"/>
was a priviledge which was their own by birth, and it could not be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
without an evident wrong done to the Wives of these men who had
ventured their lives in that service; but principally because it would not
consist with the work in hand to disclaim that custom which must needs
be of infinite consequence in the effecting of what was principally sought
after, <hi>viz.</hi> the union of the two peoples, <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> into one:
I say, it was principally sought after by the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour, if not
led thereto by his own genius, yet necessitated thereto by force of reason
of State, as shall appear hereafter. And what could be imagined a more
ready way to stay the effusion of bloud, and all other unhappy events
of enmity, than by taking away enmity it self? or a more speedy and
certain course for union, than to reduce the Men and Women of each peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to mutual society, and to seal up all by a lasting bond of Marriage?
or greater encouragement for the comfortable proceedings therein, than
the setling of the constant maintenance of the Wife, in case of survivor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
by the Law of Dower of the Lands and Tenements of the Husband?<note place="margin">Lindenburg. Concil. Aen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. c. 19. Ll. Edm.</note>
which was so full of contingencies and uncertainties in the portion of
Goods that was by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law appointed to the Wife in such case. Nor
was this all; for by Marriage thus made to the <hi>Normans,</hi> they had a great
hold, not so much over the <hi>English,</hi> as in the <hi>English;</hi> and that not onely
during coverture, but by reason of this title of Dower, the Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Tenants, and under the Lords wing, so as they durst not willingly
and illegally offend their Lord in their Widowhood, nor by Law nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
match themselves and their Dowry to any other that was not first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Lord to be in friendship with him: and thus became the
Tenants Widows to be at the liking of the Lord for their marriage. And
the like hereto may be said concerning the Husband in case of Tenant by
the courtesie;<note place="margin">Miror. fol. 20.</note> and however by the <hi>Norman</hi> former practice it was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
yet by <hi>Henry</hi> the first it was again reduced to its former right,
rather than original arising from his grant, as some hold, and proved ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
for the ends aforesaid. Now as touching their marriage-por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Goods, because the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law had already endowed them thereof,
they could not be induced to lay down their known ancient right, till they
found the new Law of Dower to settle; and so for some time both Laws
were in force, until the more ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> law had an honourable burial.
Nevertheless for the present, the Law abridged that right so far as to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to the Widow during Widowhood, according to the former <hi>Saxon</hi>-law.
Upon consideration of all which, it may well be conceived that the
power of the Lords in consenting or dissenting to the marriages of their
Tenants, Widows, and Wards, was not so much an usurpation upon the
Common right of the <hi>English</hi> Subjects, as a custom rationally, and with
great wisdom, as the course of affairs then stood, upholden and allowed
amongst them, principally for the speedy setling of a peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and consolidating of two Nations into one, and wherein <hi>England</hi>
was then so happy as to come to a conclusion in seven years, which cost their
Ancestors night Two hundred years experience with the <hi>Britains,</hi> besides
a world of bloud-shed that might have been spared, e're they could find out
the right way to a desired peace by mutual marriages had between them.</p>
               <p>Such Widow shall have the custody of the Lands of such Children,<note place="margin">cap. 4.</note> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
such other person as by right ought to have the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This is the first news of Wardships that passed abroad <hi>cum privilegio</hi>
of a received Law,<note place="margin">Wardship.</note> which, together with the former, declare the right
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64112:56"/>
custom of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and thereby the <hi>injustas consuetudines quibus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioe

                  <note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> viz. <hi>Arbitrary Relief</hi> taken of the Tenant's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
<hi>arbitrary Marriages</hi> made of their Peersons, and <hi>arbitrary Grants of
Guardianship</hi> of their Lands: For as yet oppression was not so high-flown
as to cast the government of the persons of their <hi>Wards</hi> out of the view
of the Lords provisionary care, upon adventure of the next in Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man or woman, wise or unwise, under pretence to train him up in
military service fit for the Lord's own safety, and the Kingdoms lifeguard:
But it was the proper ground of the Lord's own seisure and right of <hi>Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
he being looked upon by the eye of common reason as the onely
meet man that both could and would effect that work, so as might be
most advantageous to the publick; which seemed to be chiefly concerned
herein. And upon the same general ground the survey of fools accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the former, albeit it was not in practice till <hi>Henry</hi> the First brought it
in,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. 37.</note> as the <hi>Mirror of Justice</hi> saith (fol. 258.) yet it came upon an ancient
foundation laid in the time of the <hi>Danes.</hi> For my own part, I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
the point whether this custom of <hi>Wardship</hi> was purely <hi>Norman,</hi> or
whether it was derived from the <hi>Saxons</hi> anciently, who possibly might
have some respect to Orphans, in such cases to train them up for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
service in point of War; especially being possessors of a known right
of <hi>Relief,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Asser. Menev.</note> as well as <hi>Alfred</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King did undertake the work for the
training of some such particular persons in Learning for the service of the
Publick, in time of peace and civil Government. Yet thus much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that <hi>Guardianship</hi> of Lands was a known Custom, enough to make

not in reason except against that custom which the other people had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

of the Kingdom; whereof afterwards. But the Law is, that these men
shall hold their Lands of that Tenure acquitted of all Taxes, though legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

be for the publick benefit, <hi>viz.</hi> either for the preparation or maintenance

beyond the fourth degree, that the death of the party is of so small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as it can scarcely be reputed a loss of such consequence to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to expose the life or price of the life of the Manslayer unto the

            <div n="54" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. LIV. Of the Militia during the Normans time.</head>
               <p>THe power of <hi>Militia</hi> is either the Legislative or Executory power:
the Legislative power without contradiction rested in the grand
Council of the Kingdom, to whom it belonged to establish Laws for the
government of the Kingdom in time of peace. And this will appear in
the preparation for War, the levying of War, and managing thereof after
it is levied. For the preparation, it consisteth in levying men and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or of money. In all which questionless will be a difference between
raising of War by a King to revenge a personal injury done to the King's
own person, and a War raised by the whole Kingdom, or representative
body thereof, which is commonly done in defence of publick interest, and
seldom in any offensive way, unless in recovery of a right possession, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
formerly lost, or as yet not fully setled. Now although it be true,
that seldom do injuries reflect upon the King's person alone, but that the
Kingdom will be concerned therein to endeavour a remedy; yet because
it may fall out otherwise, and Kings have taken occasion to levy War
of their own accord, in such case they could neither compel the persons
of their Subjects or their Estates to be contributary. And of this nature
I take the War levied by <hi>Harold</hi> against the Conquerour to be, wherein
the greatest part of the Kingdom was never engaged, nor therefore did
it feel the dint of the Conquerour's Sword at all; and in this case the <hi>Militia</hi>
must be allowed to such as bear the purse: nor can it be concluded to be
the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, nor any part thereof, although the Kingdom
may connive thereat. But to set this consideration aside, as not co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at all with the <hi>Norman</hi> engagements after they were crowned, and to
take all the subsequent Wars to be meerly defensive of the right of the
Crown, as in sober construction they will appear to be: as touching the
<hi>levying of money,</hi> 'tis evident that it lay onely in the power of the grand
Council of the Kingdom; for otherwise the Laws were setled that <hi>no Tax
should be made or taken but such as were due in the Confessor's time,</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath been shewed. Secondly, for the preparing of men and munition,
it was done either by Tenure, or by special Law. As touching Tenure,
it was provided by way of contract, that those that held by Knight-service
should be ready with their Arms to assist the King for the defence of the
Realm: So as they were not bound by their Tenure to aid him in any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64112:58"/>
other cases.<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 57.</note> Others were also by especial Law of the Land bound to be
ready for their service in that kind: For all the Inhabitants of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
held their Estates under a general service, which by common right
they are bound to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> in time of danger to joyn in defence of
their Country:<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 59.</note> This is the common <hi>Fealty</hi> or Allegiance which all men
owe; and which if neglected or refused, renders the party guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against his Country, and his Estate under the penalty of forfeiture,
according to the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Law revived and declared by <hi>Henry</hi> the first.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 13.</note>
Thus the Law made preparation for the War, both of Men and Arms.
Castles and Forts were likewise either first made by the order of the grand
Council, or otherwise allowed by them, for the defence of the Commons
and the Kingdom;<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 61.</note> so was the Law of <hi>William</hi> the first. The levying and
managing of the War must not be denied <hi>de jure</hi> to belong to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
body, so far as may consist with the directory part, for that it is
a main part of the Government of the Kingdom in times of War: And
therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the first, amongst his Laws made in the ordinary course
of Law-making, provideth for the ordering of men in the Army in the
field; and established a Law, that such as forsook their Colours or Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
in the field, during the Battle, should be punished with death, and
forfeiture of his whole Estate. Nor yet can it be denied but that <hi>de facto</hi>
Kings of their own accord, and by secret Council, did direct therein;
either in the vacancy of Parliament, which was the general case of the
first times of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour, and the whole Reign of <hi>William
Rufus;</hi> or by connivance of the grand Council, while they saw nothing
done but what was well done.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c, 13.</note> Nor can it be rationally said that Kings
by such advice as they have (in the recess of the grand Council) levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
War in defence of the publick according to rules, do otherwise than
their duty; or if the grand Council look on, see nothing misgoverned,
and say nothing, that they do other than is meet: For it must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that Kings in their first original were rather Officers for War than
Peace; and so are holden by all Antiquity, and as Generals in War were
called <hi>Reges</hi> or <hi>Imperatores,</hi> by the <hi>Grecians, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> And at
such times as War was concluded, at the general meeting of the people
they chose their <hi>Dux</hi> or <hi>Rex,</hi> call him which you please; and he being
chosen, all bound themselves to be at his command, and to defend his
person. So as while a King keepeth within his place, in time of danger
it is his duty first to stir himself, and stir up the rest; to lead them and
order them, as may be most for the publick defence, and to govern the
Army by such Laws as are or shall be established by order of the publick
Meeting, and in case of sudden exigencies to use his own wits; and in all
this is the common liberty no whit infringed, in regard that all is for the
publick defence, to which the Knights are bound by their Tenures, and all
others by the Law. And this was this Kingdoms case in the <hi>Normans</hi>
time, that both Leaders and Souldiers, whether by election of the people,
or prescription, yet all served for the defence of the Kingdom. Nor
were they compellable to any other service inconsistent therewith, nor to
stand to any judgement in such cases differing from, or contrary to that of
the Parliament it self.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LV. That the entry of the Normans into this Island, could not be by
Conquest.</head>
               <p>THat in point of fact, the entry of the <hi>Normans</hi> into <hi>England</hi> was
not by Conquest, will sufficiently appear from what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
noted. I shall make one step further, and shew, that as affairs then
stood with the Conquerour, it was impossible for him to merit that name
against the stream of Providence, that had pre-engaged him to three
sorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Normans,</hi> the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It must be taken for a ground, that Duke <hi>William</hi> must give all fair
correspondency to the <hi>Normans,</hi> considering they are Members of his
own Body, and the Arm of his Strength, without which he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And it is not less certain, that however the Sea divided the two
Countries, yet long before the arrival of the Army,<note place="margin">M. West. An. 1072. Ll. Gulielm. cap. 55.</note> the <hi>Normans</hi> and
<hi>Saxons</hi> were so well acquainted by the latter access of the <hi>Danes,</hi> that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by marriage and other interests, the <hi>Normans</hi> made so great a party in
<hi>England,</hi> as that party merited no less from the Duke in his entrance, than
those he brought with him: And therefore both they and their Allies in
all reason must expect such reward of their faithfulness to him, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had; nor could the Duke deny the same, unless he had disclaimed his
own interests, whereof he had none to spare. Secondly, their merit from
the Duke was accompanied with no less mutual relation to his Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same blood with themselves, and of ancient acquaintance; and
as impossible it was for the Duke to keep them from consociation with
the mixed people, as to abstract the mixed people each from other; one
or both of which must be done, and the Conquerours must be kept from
incorporating with the conquered, or else the Law of Conquest cannot
hold. Thirdly, if these two had failed, yet had the Duke by his manner
of rewarding his Army, disabled himself from <hi>holding,</hi> however he might
seem to <hi>have</hi> by conquest. Thus was his gift of Mannors, Lands, and
Franchises unto his Souldiers, compleated with their ancient Rights and
Priviledges in free service; otherwise it had been little better than a Trap
to bring his own men into bondage, who lately were free Souldiers under
no better than a Duke of their own election. And their Government in
their own Country, however big, yet had not brought forth a Soveraignty
into the World; their Duke no compleat King, nor themselves so mean
as Vassals; and it was equally difficult for him to get up higher, as for
them to stoop lower. And however, it was dangerous now for the Duke
to try masteries, unless he meant to hazard all, and to change the substance
for the shadow. Lastly, to lay them all aside, and to take the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
as in themselves considered, a People under such Laws and Customs
as were the same with the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and originally in them, and from them
derived into <hi>Normandy</hi> by <hi>Rollo,</hi> or some other; or take them as a People
willing to lay aside their own Law, as some Writers affirm, and more
willing to take up the <hi>Danish</hi> customs, which were also very nigh akin to
theirs, and in part setled by the <hi>Danes</hi> in that part of the Kingdom where
themselves most resided: It must be concluded, that a Government by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64112:59"/>
Law was intended, and such a Law that was no way cross to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of this Kingdom, but concurring therewith; in every of
which regards, the future Generations may justly claim their Immunities
as Successours and Heirs unto the <hi>Normans,</hi> albeit no <hi>Saxon</hi> could have
enjoyed or derived the same to Posterity.</p>
               <p>A second sort of men that made the King uncapable to hold by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
was the <hi>Clergie,</hi> a considerable part of the Kingdom in those days,
whenas in every Nation they grew checkmate; and in this Kingdom had
well-nigh the one half of the Knights fees, and thereby a principal part of
the strength of the Kingdom, besides the Consciences of them all: and
for a Reserve, they had the Pope in the rear, whose power in every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was little inferiour to that of the King's own, and therefore sufficient
to stop an absolute Conquest, unless the Clergie were first conquered.
But the King came in upon great disadvantages in both these regards: for
whereas his pretence upon his entry was to advance Justice principally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who formerly were wronged by <hi>Harold,</hi> or voiced so to
be; this bound him from Injustice and Oppression. And furthermore, the
Pope had him in a double bond; one as Prince of the <hi>English Clergie,</hi> the
other as Judge of the Title of the Crown by the King's own Election; and
that by Sentence: for the King had merited of him, if not to hold the
Crown it self by Fealty to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, yet by such services, as that the
Tripple-Crown should be no loser. The King therefore must resolve to
have no more to do with the Church than will stand with the Pope's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
unless he meaned to adventure himself and all he had into the danger
of the great Curse, of which the King would seem more sensible than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he was. Nor were those times of the Church so moderate, as to bring
forth Church-men that would catch the good will of the Laity by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention;
or Popes of that height of perfection, as to part with one tittle of
their great Titles, much less ought of that pitch of power which they had
griped, though it would save the World from Ruine. In all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke was too far inferiour to attain by Conquest any
thing in this Kingdom, wherein the Pope or Clergie claimed ought to
have or do.</p>
               <p>A third sort of People avoided the dint of Conquest, either by timely
siding with the <hi>Norman,</hi> or by constant resisting of him, or by neutrality.
Of the first sort were many, both Lords and others, that by affinity and
consanguinity were become <hi>English</hi>-men to the <hi>Norman</hi> use;<note place="margin">Hovedon l. 6.</note> others were
purchased thereunto by the Clergie, that were zealous for the Pope's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that was engaged in the Work. Of those likewise that were reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in the defence of the Liberty of their Country,<note place="margin">Ingulfus 512.</note> there were not a few
that purchased their Liberty, who otherwise might under pretence of
Treachery have forfeited the same to the rapacious humour of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
And this was not done onely by Valour; for <hi>Normandy</hi> stood
in a tottering condition with their Duke, partly drawn away by the
<hi>French,</hi> that feared the Duke would be too strong for them; and partly
declining their own further aid, lest their Duke should be too great for
the Dutchy. It was therefore wisdom in the Conquerour to settle the
<hi>English</hi> aflairs in the fairest way, to gain them for himself, who had been so
brave against him. But the greatest number, especially of the Commons,
looked on while the game was playing, as contented with the cast of the
Dice, whatever it should be. These were afterwards by the King looked
upon, not as Enemies (as the president of <hi>Edwin</hi> of <hi>Sharneburn</hi> witnesseth
sufficiently) but such as either were,<note place="margin">Gloss. 217.</note> or by fair carriage would be made
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64112:59"/>
his friends; and therefore he concluded them under a Law of assurance,
that they that had been so peaceable, should have and enjoy their Lands as
entirely and peaceably as they had formerly done before his entry. To
conclude therefore this point; if these three parties of the <hi>English Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
the <hi>English Clergie,</hi> the <hi>stout English,</hi> and the <hi>peaceable English,</hi> be set
aside from the Title of Conquest, it will be probable that not one tenth
part of the Kingdom were ever under other change than of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's
own person.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI. A brief Survey of the sence of Writers concernign the point of
Conquest.</head>
               <p>THE clamours in story that the <hi>Conquerour altered and made Laws at
pleasure, brought in new Customs, molested the Persons and Estates of
the People with Depopulations, Extortions, and Oppressions,</hi> and others of that
nature, have made latter times to conclude his Government to be (as of
a <hi>Conquerour</hi>) meerly arbitrary, and that he did what he list. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
this conclusion is from the intent of those Writers, I know not; but
if the King's Title and Government was as a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> then was his Will
the onely Law, and can administer no cause of complaint of wrong and
oppression: and therefore if these be taken in nature of complaints, they
declare plainly that there was a Law in Title, or else there could have been
no transgression or cause to complain. But if the Reader shall apprehend
these passages in Writers to be no other than sober Relations, then were it
not amiss to consider from what sort of men these Complaints or Relations
do proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> from Writers that have been cloystered men, little seen in
affairs of State more than by common report and rumour; prejudiced by
the King's displeasure against their Cloysters, and therefore apprehensive
of matters in the saddest sence, and many times far beyond the truth, and
might as well be supposed to mis-relate, as to mistake. For if we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
touch upon particulars, I think no man will deny but the King allowed
property indifferently, as well to <hi>Normans</hi> as <hi>English,</hi> if the premises be
rightly considered: and therefore though somewhat be true of the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of houses of Religion, persecuting of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, deposing
of Bishops and Abbots, whereof they speak; yet all might be deservedly
done in a legal way, and in execution of Justice, whereof Histories are
not altogether silent. Nevertheless, if in the prosecution the King did
shew a kind of rage, and some rashness, it might be imputed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
infirmity of great men: for as Oppression upon those that are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
makes them mad, so doth Treachery against them that are superiour
make them little other; especially if they be overtaken with a fit of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the instant, or their minds wrapped into a whirlpool of affairs.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>change of Laws</hi> makes the greater noise; wherein what change <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
they suffered, may appear from the premises, if Writers have dealt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly;
otherwise general imputations without particular instances, will
never sway Opinion contrary to the current of the Laws that are published;
especially seeing we have observed the errour of the best Historian of those
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64112:60"/>
times, in calling those things new, which were anciently used in <hi>England,</hi>
before <hi>Normandy</hi> was in a condition of a State. Yet if this should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that there were such change of Laws as is pretended, it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the point of Conquest, so long as the new Laws are made by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Common-council, and for the common good; and so long as they
are established to be Rules for Government. I remember it is affirmed
by some of those ancient Writers, That the Duke or King would have
brought in the Customs of <hi>Norway,</hi> but the earnest Mediation of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
prevailed against it: and this evinceth two things to my opinion:
First, that there was question made what Law should be established. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that notwithstanding the interest that the <hi>Normans</hi> had in the
Kingdom, they could not prevail to bring in the whole body of their Law,
or of the Customs of <hi>Norway;</hi> which were not onely the <hi>prima materia</hi>
of their Law, but also in kind had a setling at that very time in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Kingdom where the <hi>Danes</hi> had their principal seat: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not altogether strange to the <hi>Saxons</hi> themselves. The sum of which
will be this, That upon debate a Law must be setled, and that not the
Law of the Conquerour's own Will, nor the Law that suits with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
but the ancient Law of the Kingdom: And therefore if at any time the
unquietness of some of the <hi>English</hi> brought the King to some thoughts of
Arbitrary Rule, and to shake off the clog of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law, it was long
e're it stirred, and sprang up too late to raise the Title of Conquest, and
withered too soon to settle it.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>change of Customs</hi> (for that also is imputed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour)
it cannot be denied but some alteration might be in matters of
smaller consideration; yet are the Writers not without mistake in the
particular instances: For whereas they tell us that the Conquerour took
away the custom of <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> and brought the custom of discent to the
eldest Son; and that <hi>Kent</hi> saved their Liberties, and continued this custom
of <hi>Gavel-kind:</hi> I shall not contend about the Liberties of <hi>Kent,</hi> but must,
till I see better reason, hold the opinion of the change of Inheritance to be
a meer conceit. For (besides what hath been already said concerning that
custom of <hi>Gavel kind</hi>) if we believe <hi>Glanvil,</hi> the difference was between
Lands holden by Knight's-service, and in Socage; the first of which in his
time,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. cap. 3.</note> by ancient custom, always descended to the eldest: and those Lands
that were holden in Socage (if not partible by custom, in which case they
went equally to all the Sons) went by custom in some places to the eldest,
in other places to the youngest; so as the Rule of Inheritance in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
times was custom, as well as in former times. And furthermore, if
the custom of <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> had been the general custom of this Nation, the
King by his change had contradicted his own Prerogative, and granted as
great a Liberty to his Subjects as could have been invented: For had the
custom of <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> happened upon the Lands in Knight-service, it had
brought all the Sons under the Law of <hi>Wardship,</hi> and had made a ready
way to enthral all men of Worth, and undo all Husbandry; the first
whereof had been as advantageous to the King's private interest, as both
destructive to the publick.</p>
               <p>Nor is it clear from any Author of credit, that the <hi>Normans</hi> changed the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Tenures of Lands;</hi> albeit that it cannot be denied but such Lands as he
had by forfeiture, or otherwise, were in his own power to dispose upon
what Tenure he pleased: for as well before the <hi>Normans</hi> time, as long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Tenures were like as the Services were, all at the Will of the Donor;
and were of as many Individuals almost as the minds of the Owners.

Some being of more general regard and publick use, are recorded amongst
the grounds of <hi>English</hi> Laws;<note place="margin">Littlet.</note> none of which appear to me to be of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
original, although they received their names according to that
Dialect.</p>
               <p>The next thing objected, is the <hi>change of Language;</hi> which thing, some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Writers tell us, the King endeavoured; or which is worse, to be so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
as to be absolute Tyrant, and to publish Laws in a foreign Language,
that the people through ignorance might the rather transgress, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
forfeit their Estates. This (if true) so sar differed from the nature
of a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> as rather proveth that he was put to his shifts. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
the thing tasteth so much of Spleen, as it might occasion distrust of
other relations concerning this subject. For besides that it is nonsence for
a <hi>Conqueror</hi> to entitle himself by a cheat, where he hath an elder Title by
<hi>Conquest;</hi> I shall in full answer to that calumny, insert a passage of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
that was in the continual view of publick affairs in those times,
who speaking of the <hi>Conqueror,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ingulfus.</note> saith, <hi>That he commended the Confessor's
Laws to his Justices, in the same Language wherein they were wont formerly
to be written, lest through ignorance the people might rashly offend.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Author saith,<note place="margin">M. Paris. fragm. Gulielm.</note> 
                  <hi>That the King had a desire to learn the English Tongue,
that he might the better know their Law, and judge according thereto.</hi> It is
probable nevertheless, that the Laws were in the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue; and it
is no less likely that the Pleadings, in <hi>real Actions</hi> especially, were also in
the same Language; else must the <hi>Normans</hi> be put to School to learn <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
upon peril of loss of their Estates. But that either the written Laws
were wholly concluded into the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue, or that the publick plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Causes by word of mouth in all Actions where the issue was left
to the Country, were in any other Language than <hi>English,</hi> no advised
Reader will conceive: seeing it had been a madness for an <hi>English</hi> Jury to
pass their Verdict in any case wherein it is likely many of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
scarce a syllable of the <hi>Norman</hi> Language, much less ought of the
matter upon which their Verdict should be grounded. Adde hereunto,
that it is not likely but the Conquerour inhibited the use of the <hi>English</hi>
Language in all matters of publick Record, inasmuch as the Charters
made by him to corporate Towns and Franchises, were sometimes in the
<hi>Saxon,</hi> more generally in the <hi>Latine,</hi> but seldom or never in the <hi>Norman</hi>
Dialect; and that Pleadings and Indictments were entred in like manner
in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, as formerly by an old custom brought in by the
Clergie was used: for the Clergie, who had gotten the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Law into their own custody, laid it up it that Language
whereof the Commons had little knowledge, that they might thereby
be enforced to depend upon these men for Justice, as well as for Piety.
The <hi>Normans</hi> therefore either found it too hard to alter the former custom
in such cases, or else thought it the wisest way to chuse the <hi>Latine</hi> as a third
Language, indifferent as well to the <hi>Normans</hi> as <hi>Saxons,</hi> and best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of any foreign Tongue besides: and yet endeavoured to bring both
Peoples into one Language, as they were intended to be one People; and
to press the use of the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue in publick affairs, so far as might
consist with good Government and Justice, leaving time and occasion to
work the issue; which doubtless was much, and had been more, had the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Race continued in the Throne. But falling out otherwise, the <hi>English</hi>
bloud prevailed in the head, and the Language continued possession, mixed
onely with some <hi>Norman</hi> words, as the people also were a mixed people:
So as the Language was not changed, though it was altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64112:61"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, it is affirmed, that the <hi>Normans</hi> did impose a new custom called
<hi>Coverfeu;</hi> and it is thought by some to be a meer Vassalage, that every
man at the noise of the Bell every night, must put out both Fire and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
and yet it is a matter of so small concernment, that (being in its
own nature convenient) <hi>Scotland</hi> received it without such coercion: and
it can be reputed for no other than a seasonable advice, which any Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in time of danger might order within their own Precinct, without
transgressing the Liberty of the Subjects. Of less consequence is that
change, which is alledged was brought in by the <hi>Normans</hi> in the <hi>sealing of
Deeds</hi> of Conveyance, by setting a print upon Wax annexed to the Deed,
which formerly was wont to be by setting a print upon the blank at the
end of the Deed; and yet it is looked upon by some as a Trophy of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
or absolute Government. Concerning which, I will not dispute
whether the <hi>Normans</hi> first brought in this course, but shall rest in this,
That the King being about to compleat the unity of the Laws in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure
as well as in the fundamentals, if herein and in some other
particulars the <hi>English</hi> submitted to the <hi>Normans,</hi> they likewise stooped
to the <hi>English</hi> Law in other things: And therefore such Concurrences
ought not to be imputed unto a conquering power, but unto moderation
amongst a company of wise men.</p>
               <p>Thus having glanced at the changes of Property, Laws, Tenures, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and some Customs, we come to that which is the main occasion of
all these Complaints; I mean, <hi>unlawful Taxes, Afforrestings,</hi> and other such
Oppressions upon the Estates of the People: concerning which I purpose
not to contend; for much thereof is like to be true. The <hi>Norman</hi> Kings
(especially the two <hi>Williams</hi>) were under continual occasion of Expence,
many Wars, more Provocations, which kept them ever in Action, and
that wrought their spirits into an immoderate heat, little inferiour unto
Rage; and so they might soon out-reach their bounds, and sit heavie on the
People: and in such occasions no man escaped, <hi>Norman</hi> nor <hi>English, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-man</hi>
nor <hi>Lay-man;</hi> nor did the Kings themselves come off such gainers,
but that they might sometimes put up their gettings into their own eyes,
and see never a whit the worse. And yet to do them right, they were not
always of such sad influence, but had their <hi>lucida intervalla;</hi> especially he
that had the least cause, I mean the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> who certainly was a man
of a serious regard; and did not onely remit sometimes his Rigour in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
where he ought not, but also forbear to require that which he had
some colour to demand: For whereas the <hi>Dane-guelt</hi> was left unto him in
the nature of an Annuity, he was contented to turn it into a sum in gross,
and to demand it onely <hi>Cum ab exteris gentibus bella vel opiniones bellorum
insurgebant;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> and it was then done <hi>consultis magnatibus.</hi> These things thus
considered, might have mollified somewhat the Pens of angry Writers;
and where they fail, may be caution to Readers to consider occasions and
dispositions of Princes; and so long as Laws hold in Title, to construe the
irregularities of Princes to be but as steps out of the path to avoid a little
dirt, that a man may get home the more cleanly; and therefore rightly
can derive no other Title of absolute Soveraignty to their successours, than
to hold by infirmity. And thus the Government under the <hi>Normans,</hi> at
the worst, was but like that of childhood, following sudden and present
desires, not wise enough to plot for absolute Monarchy, nor to keep off a
Polity, which still rooted underneath; though the fruit, while it was now
green, was harsh and unpleasant.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this <hi>Norman</hi> Discourse with this Advertisement: That
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64112:61"/>
notwithstanding the words <hi>Conquerour</hi> and <hi>Conquest</hi> have often fallen from
my Pen, and hereafter may do the like; yet can I see no reason why di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
succeeding Kings, coming to the Crown by argument of the Sword,
and not by right of Descent, may not deserve the Laurel as well as the
first <hi>Norman</hi> King; onely because Fame hath fancied him that Title, under
a kind of prescription, I do the like.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVII. Of the Government during the Reigns of Steven, Henry the 2.
Richard the 1. and John. And first of their Titles to the
Crown, and dispositions in Government.</head>
               <p>I Have cut out this Portion of One hundred twenty and five years
(containing the Reigns of these Kings) apart from their Successours,
in regard of their Titles; all of them being under one general Climate,
and breathing one air of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Compact</hi> between them and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Now was the Issue male of the Stock of <hi>Normandy</hi> quite wasted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I mean, in relation to succession by inheritance: for although it was
the lot of <hi>Henry</hi> the first to have many Children, yet it was not his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to have many Lineal, nor to hold what he had; nor of them all
was there left above one that might pretend to the Crown, and it a
Daughter, who was the great Grandmother to all the succeeding Kings
till this day.<note place="margin">Steven.</note> Onely King <hi>Steven,</hi> like an unruly Ghost, coming in upon
the Stage, troubled the Play during his time. This Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi>
the first was married to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: and surviving
him, was in her Father's life-time acknowledged to be his Heir, the Sea
having formerly swallowed up the remainder of his hope: Unto her the
Lords sware <hi>Fealty,</hi> as to the next Successour in the Throne after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
of her Father; being led thereto by the instigation of her Father,
whose Conscience told him, that the Title to the Crown by inheritance
was weakned by his own precedent, himself coming to the same by
<hi>Election</hi> of the People, contrary to the Title of his Brother <hi>Robert.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
this was not the first time that the English Crown refused to
be worn by practice; for <hi>Henry</hi> the first being dead, <hi>Steven,</hi> the younger
Son to a younger Sister of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, put up head; who being of
the Royal Stem, a Man, and a brave Souldier, by the ancient course of
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> had Title enough to be thought upon in a doubtful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Besides, he was a rich man, and had enough to raise up his thoughts
to high undertakings; had a Brother a Bishop and Legate to the Pope
here in <hi>England,</hi> one who was of a high spirit, and vast power; advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
enough to have quickned a much duller spirit than his was, who
was a Son of a Daughter to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. And to make
him yet more bold, he had the upper ground of the Heir, who was a
woman, disadvantaged by a whispering of wilfulness, and customary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
like an <hi>Empress:</hi> which was too high a sail for an <hi>English</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
wherein so precious a Treasure as the Subjects Liberties was to be
shipped. Thus provided, <hi>Steven</hi> stepped up to the <hi>English</hi> Throne, and
with protestations of good Government, entred, and made up the match
both for Crown and Scepter, the People waving the Title both of <hi>Empress</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64112:62"/>
and <hi>Heir.</hi> The pretensions of the E. of <hi>Bloys</hi> elder Brother to <hi>Steven,</hi>
gave way to the common Law and Liberties of the Subject, to fasten, root,
and gather strength, after the violence of the <hi>Norman</hi> blasts was out of
breath; thus making way over Hedge and Ditch of all Oaths, till the
King was quietly setled in the Throne.</p>
               <p>Quietly, said I? that I must retract; for he never had quiet during his
life, though generally he was victorious, and did as much as a King could
do, that had the passions of a man and Souldier, to give the Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
The true cause whereof, was an errour in the tying of the Knot,
wherein he neither became theirs, nor they his; for the <hi>Fealty</hi> that was
sworn to him, was but conditional, and <hi>eousque:</hi> and yet the King's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
were absolute, and better observed than the Peoples were, possibly
because his Engagements were more. For besides his Protestations, the
King pledged his Brother the Legate to the people, and mortgaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Brother; and to boot, gave both to the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to build and hold Castles for their private security: The issue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may remind, that too much countersecurity from the King to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is like so many Covenants in Marriage, that make room for jealousie,
and are but seeds of an unquiet life. And thus it befel this King's Reign.
His first troubles are brought in by Historians, as if they dropped from
Heaven, yet probably came immediately from without, <hi>viz.</hi> from beyond
Sea, where the <hi>Empress</hi> was: for as the King's Engagements were in their
first heat on the one side, so was also the <hi>Empress</hi>'s Choler on the other
side; and therefore might make the first assault. And the King's first suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
therein falling out prosperously for him, gave him a conceit that he
was strong enough to encounter his own Covenant, although in truth he
invaded but the skirts thereof; I mean, that collateral security of Castles:
for by experience he now feels that they are blocks in his way, he must
therefore have them into his own power. But the Clergie (loth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
their pawn till they had their full Bargain; for now they were working
hard for investitures of the Mitred Clergie, under the patronage of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
that had the King in bonds) acted their parts so well, as they enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Nobility for their liberty of Castles; in which Atchievement the
King was taken prisoner. The <hi>Empress</hi> betakes her self to the Clergie, and
by the Legate's means, procures a kind of Election to be Queen: But she
sick of the Womans humour, and thinking too much of the <hi>Empress,</hi> and
too little of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and forgetting that the <hi>English</hi> Crown would not
fit an <hi>Empress,</hi> unless she could fit her head first to it, choaked her own Title
by <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and so let the Crown slip through her own hands; which
fell upon the head of <hi>Steven</hi> again, who maintained it by his Sword, after
by Composition, and then died a King. And thus like a Vapour moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up by the Clergie, tossed by Tempests for a time, and at length falling,
he gave way to the Crown to have its free course to the <hi>Empress</hi>'s Son by
<hi>Geoffery Plantagenet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>Henry</hi> the second,<note place="margin">Henry 2d.</note> the most accomplished for Wisdom, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Power, of all his Predecessors; and one that wanted nothing
but purpose, to have undone what the foregoing Princes had done, in
the setling of the Liberties of the People: for the Subjects were tired
with the unquiet former times, and the Clergie in distraction through the
Schism in the Popedom between <hi>Victor</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the
third; and very unfitting all were to dispute the point of Prerogative
with so mighty a Prince. And it was the wisdom of God to order his affairs
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64112:62"/>
so, as that he was not very fit to dispute with the people in that case: for his
Title to the Crown was not very excellent, being neither Heir to the
last King that Reigned, nor to the last of that Title, I mean to <hi>Henry</hi> the
first; but Son only to the <hi>Empress,</hi> who was now alive, and by descent
was to be preferred before all other. His Title therefore is clearly by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi>
and agreement made between the Lords, King <hi>Steven,</hi> and himself; all
being then ready to try the right by the Sword, to that, to which none of
them had any right at all at that time, but by the favour of the people.
Nor did the King ever after dispute the strength of this Title, although
before he died, his Mothers death conveyed over to him what right of
descent soever was consistent with the Law of the Crown: nor did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
favour him thereto; for as it is never seen that any man is honoured
by God with many advantages, without proportionable employment for
the same, so it befel with this King: His great Territories in <hi>France</hi> brought
jealousie in the rear; and thence strife and contention with <hi>France,</hi> enough
to turn his thoughts from waxing wanton against his own people; and
therefore his wisdom taught him to prefer peace at home to the chief of
his <hi>Prerogative;</hi> to become somewhat popular, and yet to lose nothing
of a King thereby. His way was to keep the Church-men down, that had
during his predecessors time grown, whether more obstinate against the
King, or insolent over the people, is hard to judge; and in this he had the
people to friend, and might have prevailed much more than he did, but
that the people feared the threats of <hi>Rome</hi> more than he; and he (if not
guilty of <hi>Becket</hi>'s death) more the conceit of Fame than there was cause.
These concurring with unnatural troubles from most unthankful Sons,
made that spirit of his to fail, that formerly knew no peer; as it is often seen
that the most generous spirits are sooner quelled with shame and grief, than
with fear of any danger whatsoever. Towards his <hi>Lay</hi>-Subjects he was
more regardant for the setling of <hi>Laws,</hi> and executing of <hi>Justice;</hi> so as
some have thought him the first source of our <hi>English Laws;</hi> others more
truly, the first <hi>Mecaenas</hi> since the <hi>Conquest,</hi> that brought on the spring-time
of a setled Common-wealth; and therefore left this fair testimony, by his
putting forth that Primrose of <hi>English Laws,</hi> under the name of <hi>Glanvil;</hi>
letting all men know, that thenceforth <hi>England</hi> would no more veil itself
in an unknown <hi>Law,</hi> but explain itself unto the World to be a regular
Government. Such was the King's Idea; yet was he touched with so
much of the common infirmity of Kings, as shewed him to be a man;
especially in his old age, being loaden with Military Affairs, wherein he
had been long exercised, he had contracted some shifting courses of a
Souldier, in gathering Money and Souldiers somewhat out of the road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of an <hi>English King;</hi> and led an ill example to future Ages; nor had
he other salve for this wound,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 348.</note> but that it was for the honour of <hi>Christian
faith,</hi> and for the sake of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next comes in <hi>Richard</hi> the first, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Son both in birth
and courage;<note place="margin">Richard <hi>the First.</hi>
                  </note> yet was his behaviour to his Father such, that his merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Holy War</hi> could never wipe it out of the Calendar of story. His
entrance was upon an <hi>Election</hi> made in his Fathers life-time, and the same
confirmed by receiving of Homage from the Peers. The sad troubles that
this <hi>Election</hi> amongst other things occasioned to his Father in his old age,
shew plainly that <hi>Richard</hi> trusted not to the Title of Inheritance;<note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> nor
the <hi>French</hi> King (that took his part) unto the <hi>English</hi> custom, for the
possession of the Crown, but all must be done in the Life of the Father;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64112:63"/>
that must secure the Government to the Son when the Father is dead.
And thus is he entred upon the Throne, not as Heir, but as Successor to
his Father, yea rather as Survivor, taking possession of what was by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>compact</hi> conveyed to him by the means of his Father in his life-time,
though sore against his will, if Writers speak true. As his entrance was,
it promised a better Government than followed; for though it was for
the most part hidden in the Womb, as himself did subsist in another
World; yet by a secret providence he was given over to the election of ill
Deputies; and therefore he was not well beloved, however dear he was
to this Nation. A third part of his Government was spent in a calm with
Pope, Clergy, Commons, and all Nations that were not Infidels, upon
conscience it seems that he ought not to be troubled, who adventured his
person so bravely in the <hi>Holy War.</hi> But above all, he was the Clergies dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
not only for his adventure in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> but now much more
in his return by his imprisonment in <hi>Germany;</hi> and therefore they sluck
close to him in his absence, not only in maintenance of his right to the

but emptied themselves to the utmost for his delivery, which they effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the envy of the <hi>French,</hi> and such as longed for his downfal here in
<hi>England.</hi> The King comes like the Sun-rising, scattering his Brothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
by his very view; then returns his thoughts for <hi>France,</hi> where he
spent the rest of a restless life: and as his entry upon the Throne was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
(for he made his way upon his Fathers Herse) so was his Reign full
of troubles, and his end not unlike; for it was violent, and by the hand
of his own subject; and so ended his Reign, that scarce had any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Next comes in King <hi>John</hi> to act his part,<note place="margin">John.</note> according to his entry, hand
over head; whether called by a people scared with the noise of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that <hi>John</hi> the youngest Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the second had by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
obtained amongst the Lords, or some or all concurring; it
is clear, they crossed the way of inheritance, waved <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Title, who
was Heir to <hi>Richard</hi> the first, and by him also appointed to succeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then but a Child; and they chose <hi>John,</hi> a man of War, trained up in
the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which made way for his active spirit; and
well seen in the Government of <hi>England,</hi> which might have made him
wise; and under these conceits they were willing to forget his oppression
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Treachery against his Lord and King in <hi>England,</hi> set the
Crown upon his head; and in conclusion acted the Tragedy of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>
in English, wherein the Cedar was rooted up, and the Bramble trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down.</p>
               <p>The general temper of his Government sheweth, that though the
King must be thought sober, yet the man was mad, for he hawked at
all manner of game, <hi>France, Scotland, England, Laity, Clergy,</hi> spared not
the Pope himself, scorned to stoop to occasion; all which he did by the
strength of the name of a King: till at length, being well cuft and plumed,
he was fain to yoke his lawless will under the <hi>grand Charter,</hi> depose his
Crown at the Popes foot, and instead of a King, became little better
than a chief Lord in <hi>England.</hi> Thus although <hi>Richard</hi> the First forgot
this mans disloyalty, yet God remembred it: for the King having
gotten the Pope upon the hip, and put him to his last shift to stir up
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64112:63"/>
the <hi>French</hi> to set his curse on work, was by a hidden providence conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the middest of a Royal Army, without view of Enemy, or
other weapon than a meer noise; his Nobility (either suspecting all would
be gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> or expecting that the King would not deny them their
own, seeing he had been so profuse in giving away that which was not
his) demand that their Liberties might be confirmed; but he being loath
to be mated by his Nobles, though he was overmatched by the Pope,
arms himself with the Popes curse, and the Lords themselves with
the <hi>Frenchmens</hi> power; thus the Tables are turned, and the <hi>French</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an after-game to gain to themselves the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after
they saw the death of a Warlike King, discovered their design before it
was ripe; and in the conclusion were beaten out of the Kingdom by a
Child.</p>
               <p>It is not worth inquiry what the King allowed or disallowed; for it
was his course to repent of any thing done contrary to his present sense,
and made it his chief principle in policy to have no principle but desire;
wherein he triumphed too long, by reason of the contentions between the
<hi>Clergie</hi> and the <hi>Laity;</hi> which coming nigh unto the push of pike, and
the King ready for the spoil of both; the <hi>Barons</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> suddenly close
their files, and like a stone-wall stood firm to each other, till the King
wearied with succesless labour, was glad to give and take breath, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Liberties of the people by his Charter, which is now called the
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1215.</note> for substance, and gave such collateral security for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
on his part, as did let the World know the thing was as just, as
himself had been unjust. The worst point in the case was, that the people
got their own by a kind of <hi>re disseisin;</hi> a desperate remedy for a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
condition, wherein the Common-wealth then lay between life and
death, upon the rack of the will of a King, that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
by nothing but his own appetite, and was in the end devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVIII. Of the state of the Nobility of England from the Conquest, and
during the Reign of these several Kings.</head>
               <p>UNder the Title of the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I shall comprehend all
such as are of the greatest eminency for birth, or wisdom and
learning, and advancement into place of Government and Honour.
These were in the <hi>Saxons</hi> times the flower of the people, flourishing
only from the honour that ascended from beneath; their deportment
then was full of chear and safety to the people: after that <hi>Royalty</hi> sprung
up, the influence thereof upon them exhaled such a reciprocal interest back
again, as made them less regardful of their own root; whereas we see
the more mature flowers are the more propense to turn head and look
downward to their own original. This distemper was yet much worse
by the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> whose <hi>Nobility,</hi> besides their Titles of
honour in their own Countrey, obtained by custom such command and
power amongst the meaner sort, being Souldiers under them in time
of the service in the field, that (when the Wars had breathed out
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64112:64"/>
their last) neither of them could forget, or were very careful to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
This was observed by Kings, and advantage espyed to climb to the
top of Monarchy by the help of these great men; whom if they could
make their own, all would be theirs; and therein they had prevailed
much more than they did, if they had been wise enough to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
them in unity; but in that failing, the Kings were necessitated to
take parties, and serve the Nobility to save the main: and thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they a considerable party in the Government of this Kingdom from the
<hi>Normans,</hi> for the space of two hundred years well-nigh, to the prejudice
both of the growth of the Prerogative of Kings, and Liberties of the
Commons; and benefit of none but the Lords, who in those unquiet
times were the chief Commanders in the field. This errour of the Kings
was soon espied, but could not be avoided: it is natural to man to be
proud, and to such to fall into contention; another course therefore is
taken, <hi>viz.</hi> to raise up some so high as may over-top all, and keep them
under: nor is it altogether without reason, for Kings are no ubiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and some must bear their power where they cannot be personally
present; yet it is dangerous to bestow too much upon one man, for there
is no man fitting to be a King, but himself that is a King; and where
Kings are immoderate in bestowing power, it many times works much
woe to the people, and not seldom sorrow to the Kings themselves. The
place of the <hi>chief Justice</hi> was in shew but one Office, yet in these times
was in nature of the Kings Lieutenant-general throughout the Kingdom.
A power and work too great for any one man in the World, that can
make no Deputies to manage it; and yet in those times you shall meet
with one man made up of an Arch-bishop, a Legat, and chief Justice of
<hi>England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoveden. 443. 375. Nubr. lib. 4. cap. 14.</note> or a Bishop, a Lord Chancellour, a Legat, and chief Justice of
<hi>England:</hi> and a strange kind of Government must that needs be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Servants Throne is above his Masters, and a Subject shall have a
plenitudinary power beyond that which his Lord and King had, or, as the
times then were, was capable of. By these and such like pluralities, the
great men of <hi>England</hi> kept the Commons below, and themselves above;
and probably rendred the temper of the Government of this Kingdom
more <hi>Aristocratical</hi> than in after-Ages. And if their personal authority
was of such value, how much rather in their joynt assembly or court of
Council! concerning which I must agree, that as in their original in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
they did consult and determine of the meaner matters, that is to say,
of matters concerning Property; and therefore were in their most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
work Meetings of Judges, or Courts of Judicature, and also mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of defensive War, because themselves were the Commanders: and
lastly, in matters of sudden concerment to the State, not only to serve
as eyes to foresee, but to provide also if they can, or otherwise to call in
the ayd of the peoples advice; so also they continued this course, and it
may be now and then (as all Councils have done) strained their endeavours
beyond their reach, especially since the <hi>Normans</hi> entrance: and therefore
I shall not deny but that they alone with the King, and without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
have made many Laws and Constitutions, some of which now
are called <hi>Statutes,</hi> (although many of them in truth are no other than
Rules for Judicature, which ordinary Courts may frame; or Judgments
in particular cases, such as are the constitutions at <hi>Clarindon</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's
time) and many other Laws which are reported to be made
between the King and his Lords. Nor can I look upon such Laws
otherwise, than as upon Judgments in Courts of Justice in new
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64112:64"/>
points of controversie, grounded upon ancient grounds, which properly
are not new Laws, but the ancient Rule applied to new particulars; and
being so published to the World, may bear the name of Laws, Ordinances,
Constitutions, or Judgments; the word Statute being of latter times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, and used in a more restrictive sence: of which, more in their due
place. Now that this Court was a setled Court of Judicature, and so used,
may appear,<note place="margin">Hoveden. An. 1175.</note> in that Fines were levied therein, and Writs of Right deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
as in the great Case between the two Kings of <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Castilè,</hi>
referred to the Judgment of <hi>Henry</hi> the second,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and tried in this Court,
it is said, that the Tryal was by <hi>Plea,</hi> and if need were, by <hi>Battel.</hi> The
Judges in this Court were the Baronage of <hi>England;</hi> for the entry of
Judgment in that great Case, is thus: <hi>Comites &amp; Barones Regalis Curiae
Angliae adjudicaverunt, &amp;c.</hi> So as though doubtless many were absent,
some being enemies, others discontented, others upon other occasions; yet
all might claim their Votes as <hi>Barons.</hi> The President over all the rest
was the Chief Justice, as if the King were present then himself; and by
him was the Sentence or Judgment declared, according to the entry in
that Case aforesaid, <hi>Habito Concilio cum Episcopis, Comitibus &amp; Baronibus,
adjudicavimus, &amp;c.</hi> The honour of this Court was great, so long as the
Lords had liberty or care to attend thereon: but when Kings began to
have private interests, they would have these to be more private Councils;
which weakned the esteem of Conclusions that there passed, and reduced
the honour thereof scarce to the degree of a Conventicle. And by this
means the necessity of calling together the whole Body-Representative,
was made more frequent, the power of the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> decayed,
and this Court forfeited all its Juridical power to the three Courts at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
viz. the <hi>Kings-bench, Common-pleas,</hi> and <hi>Exchequer;</hi> saving still the
supreme Judicature unto the grand Convention of Estates in Parliament,
where all the Lords had liberty of meeting, and free voting without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</p>

            <div n="59" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. LIX. Of the state of the Clergie, and their power in this Kingdom
from the Normans time.</head>
               <p>IF the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Kings prevailed not to its utmost pitch during the
<hi>Normans</hi> time, it did much less in these times succeeding, wherein the
Clergie took up the Bùcklers, and beat both King and Commons to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
themselves in the interim remaining sole Triumphers in the Field.
In their first Adventure they paced the Stage, no man appearing to oppose:
<hi>Steven</hi> then was King by their leave, and their Bond-servant; and they
might have any thing, sobeit they would suffer him to enjoy his Crown.
His Brother the Bishop was the Pope's servant, the Church-mens patron,
and the King's surety; in whom the Clergies favour to the King, and his
good behaviour toward them and all men, concentred. Besides all this,
the King was but so upon condition; and there being no better Title
than Election, Conscience in those times was well enough satisfied in the
breach of Covenant on their part, when on the King's part it was first
broken. All this the King saw full well; and therefore what can he
deny to such Benefactors? Vacancies of Churches he readily parts with;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64112:65"/>
and his right of investiture of the Mitred Clergie he dispensed: so as he
open'd the way to his Successours of an utter dereliction of that Priviledge.
He sees his Brother the Legate deflower the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Appeals from the Courts in <hi>England</hi> unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
he says nothing; he is contented with the stump of the Crown and (with
<hi>Saul</hi>) if he be but honoured above or before all others of the people, it
is enough: But the Clergie, like the barren Womb, hath not yet
enough. The King hath allowed them Castles; and too late he sees,
that instead of being Defences against the Imperial power of the <hi>Empress,</hi>
they are now made Bulwarks against the lawful power of a King: he had
therefore endeavoured to get them down, and gotten some of them into
his power. The King himself is now summoned to answer this before a
Legatine Council, wherein his Brother is President: That was a bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
in them; but it was extreme rashness in him to appear and plead
the Cause of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> before a Conventicle of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And thus to secure <hi>Rome</hi> of Supremacy in <hi>Appeals,</hi> he suffers a
recovery thereof against his own person in a Court of Record; and so
loses himself, to save the Crown. Thus are Synods mounted up on
Eagles wings; they have the King under them, they will next have the
Crown. Within a while <hi>Steven</hi> is taken prisoner: The <hi>Empress</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the power of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> betakes her case to them now assembled in
Synod; they now proud of the occasion (and conceiting that both Law
and Gospel were now under their decree) publish, That the Election of
the King belongeth unto them; and by them the <hi>Empress</hi> is elected Queen
in open Synod, <hi>Steven</hi>'s Brother leading the game: and had she been as
willing to have admitted of the Laws as <hi>Steven</hi> was, she had so continued,
and had left a strange President in the <hi>English</hi> Government for Posterity.
But the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who had made the way to the Throne for
<hi>Steven,</hi> reduced the Synod to sober consideration, and helped the King's
return unto his Throne again; wherein he continued a friend to the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
during the rest of his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the second succeeded him: as brave a man as he, but beyond
him in Title and Power; and one that came to the Crown without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement
by Promise or Covenant, saving that which was proper for
a King. A man he was that knew full well the Interests in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the growing power of the Clergie, and the advantages lost from
the Crown by his Predecessor: And to regain these, he smooths his way
towards these braving men,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1155.</note> speaks fair, profers fair; he would act to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the bounds of the Church: He would have the Pope's leave to do
him a kindness; and sobeit he might gain an interest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he
would take it from the Pope, who pretended, as <hi>Heir of Jesus Christ,</hi> to
have the Islands and utmost parts of the Earth for his possession; and, as
if he meaned to be as good to the Church as <hi>Steven</hi> was, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he desires the Pope's kindness for the confirmation of the Liberties and
Customs of his Crown and Kingdom; and no sooner desired than obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
This was a second Example of a King of <hi>England,</hi> but the first of
an <hi>English</hi> King, that sought to <hi>Rome</hi> for Right in the Crown; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taught the Pope to demand it as a priviledge belonging to the Tripple.
Crown. Nor was <hi>Henry</hi> the second less benign to the Church-men, till
he found by his dear-bought experience that he had nourished Scorpions;
and would have suppressed them, but was rather suppressed himself; as in
that shameful success of the death of <hi>Becket</hi> may appear, wherein he
yielded the day up to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who formerly scorned to stoop to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64112:65"/>
greatest Potentate on Earth. The State of Kings is to be pitied, who must
maintain a politick affection above, and sometimes against Nature it self,
if they will escape the note of Tyranny in their Undertakings,<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi>
                  </note> and of
a feeble Spirit in their Sufferings: For the King having made <hi>Becket</hi>
Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he became
so great, that his Feathers brushed against the King's Crown; who begins
to rouse up himself to maintain his Honour and Prerogative Royal.
The Bishops side with <hi>Becket:</hi> the King intending the Person, and not
the Calling, singles out the Archbishop, and hunts him to soil at <hi>Rome;</hi>
yet before he went, the King puts the points of his Quarrel in Writing, and
made both Archbishop and Bishops signe them as the Rights of his Crown,
and as the <hi>Consuetudines Avitae:</hi> But <hi>Becket</hi> repenting, went to <hi>Rome</hi> and
obtained the Pope's pardon and blessing, the rest of the Bishops yielding
the Cause.</p>
               <p>The particulars in debate were set down in the nature of Laws or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
commonly called the Constitutions at <hi>Clarindon;</hi> which shew
the prevailing humour that then over-spread the body of the Clergie in
those days: and therefore I shall sum them up as follows.</p>
               <p>Rights of Advowsons shall be determined in the King's Court.<note place="margin">cap. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This had been quarrelled from the first <hi>Normans</hi> time, but could never
be recovered by the Clergie. Before the <hi>Normans</hi> time, the County-courts
had them, and there they were determined before the Bishop and Sheriff;
but the Ecclesiastical Causes being reduced to Ecclesiastical Courts, and
the Sheriff and the Laity sequestred from intermeddling, the <hi>Normans,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom in their own Country, reduced also the tryal of
rights of Advowsons unto the Supreme Courts: partly because the King's
Title was much concerned therein, and the <hi>Norman</hi> Lords no less; but
principally in regard that Rights require the consideration of such as are
the most learned in the Laws.</p>
               <p>Rights of Tythes of a Lay-fee,<note place="margin">cap. 2.</note> or where the Tenure is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
belong to the King's Court.</p>
               <p>Pleas of Debts by troth-plight,<note place="margin">cap. 3.</note> belong to the King's Court.</p>
               <p>These were <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, and do intimate, that it was the endeavour of
the Clergie to get the sole cognizance of Tythes, because they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
their dues; and of Debts by <hi>troth-plight,</hi> because that Oaths seemed
to relate much to Religion, whereof they held themselves the onely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</p>
               <p>The King's Justice shall reform Errours of the Ecclesiastical
Courts,<note place="margin">cap. 4.</note> and Crimes of Ecclesiastical persons.</p>
               <p>Appeals shall be from Arch-Deacons Courts to the Bishops
Courts,<note place="margin">cap. 5.</note> and thence to the Archbishops Courts, and thence to the
King's Court, and there the Sentence to be final.</p>
               <p>No man that ever was acquainted with Antiquity,<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi>
                  </note> will question that
these were received Laws in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time; nor did the Clergie ever
quarrel them, till the <hi>Normans</hi> taught them by courtesie done to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to expect more from Kings than for the present they would grant; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64112:66"/>
see <hi>Cap.</hi> 47. But King <hi>Steven</hi> that was indebted to the Clergie for his
Crown, and could not otherwise content them, parted with this Jewel of
Supreme power in Causes Ecclesiastical to the Roman cognizance, as
hath been already noted; but <hi>Henry</hi> the second would have none of this
Cheat at so easie a rate. This struck so smart a blow, as though the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had but newly recovered out of a paralytick Schism, yet (seeing it
so mainly concerned the maintenance of the Tripple-Crown) <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Pope having lately been blooded against a brave Emperour, made the
less difficulty to stickle with a valiant King; who is conclusion was fain
to yield up the Bucklers, and let the Pope hold what he had gotten, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
against this Law, and all former Law and Custom. And
thus the Popes Supremacy in Spiritual Causes, is secured both by a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Judgment,<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi>
                  </note> by confession thereupon.</p>
               <p>The King shall have vacancies of Churches,<note place="margin">cap. 6.</note> and power to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
by his <hi>secret Council:</hi> The Party elected shall do homage
<hi>salvo ordine,</hi> and then shall be consecrated.</p>
               <p>This certainly was none of the best, yet it was a custom not altogether
against reason, although not suitable to the opinion of many; yet we
meet two alterations of the ancient custom. First, that the election shall
be by the King and <hi>secret Council;</hi> whereas formerly the election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Archbishops was of such publick concernment, as the Parliament
took cognizance thereof; and (that which was worse) a Council was
hereby allowed, called a <hi>secret Council,</hi> which in effect is a Council to serve
the King's private aims; and unto this Council, power given in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the publick affairs, without advice of the publick Council of Lords,
which was the onely Council of State in former times. And thus the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affairs are made to correspond with the King's private interest, which
hath been the cause of much irregularity in the Government of this Island
ever since. The second alteration resteth in the <hi>salvo,</hi> which is a clause
never formerly allowed, unless by practice in <hi>Steven</hi>'s time, whenas there
was little regard of the one or the other: Nor doth it concur with the file
of story,<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi>
                  </note> that it should be inserted within these Constitutions, seeing that
Writers agree it was the chief cause of quarrel between him and <hi>Becket,</hi>
who refused submission without the clause, and at which the King stuck
with the Archbishop for the space of seven years, which was six years after
the Constitutions were consented unto, and concluded upon.</p>
               <p>No Clergie-man or other may depart the Realm,<note place="margin">cap. 7.</note> without the
King's License.</p>
               <p>It is a Law of Nations, and must be agreed on all hands, that no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of State can allow dispensations therein, especially in a doubtful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the Supremacy is in dispute: and this the wilful Archbishop
never questioned, till he questioned all Authority, but in order to his own;
for but the year before, when he went to <hi>Turonn</hi> to the general Council
upon summons,<note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> he first obtained License from the King before he went.</p>
               <p>No Sentence of Excommunication or Interdiction to pass against
the King's Tenant or any Minister of State,<note place="margin">cap. 8.</note> without License first
had of the King, or his Chief Justice in the King's absence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:64112:66"/>

                  </note> no Excommunication passed without Warrant of Law
made by the joynt assembly of the Laity and Clergy; but the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
having let loose the Canons, and the Clergie having got the upper
hand in Councils, made Canons as they pleased, and so the Laity are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

               <p>A negative Law, that implieth another course was used upon light

                  </note> the
course anciently was, it seemeth, to give Pledge to stand to Order. Of
this the Bishops were weary soon, as it seemeth; and therefore waved it,
and betook themselves to other inventions of their own, <hi>viz.</hi> to bind them
by Oath or Bail; both which were contrary to Law: for no Oath was
to be administred but by Law of the Kingdom; nor did it belong to the
Ecclesiastical Laws to order Oaths or Bail; and therefore this Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

way, or scatter the censure of Excommunication according to their own
liking. This, together with all those that forego, the Arch-bishop upon
his repentance absolutely withstood, although he had twice consented, and
once subscribed to them,<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi>

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:64112:67"/>
Two things are hereby manifest. First, that notwithstanding the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>'s
Law formerly mentioned, Bishops still sate as Judges in the
King's Courts, as they had done in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; but it was upon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that merely concerned the <hi>Laity;</hi> so as the Law of the <hi>Conquerour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely to separate the <hi>Laity</hi> out of the <hi>Spiritual-Courts,</hi> and not the
<hi>Clergie</hi> out of the <hi>Lay-Courts.</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>Clergie,</hi> especially
those of the greater sort, questioned their services due by Tenure, as if
they intended neither Lord nor King, but the Pope onely. Doubtless the
use of Tenures in those times was of infinite consequence to the peace of
the Kingdom, and government of these Kings; whenas by these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
not onely all degrees were united and made dependant from the
Lord <hi>paramount</hi> to the Tenant <hi>peravale,</hi> but especially the <hi>Clergie</hi> with the
<hi>Laity</hi> upon the Crown; without which, a strange metamorphosis in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
must needs have ensued, beyond the shape of any reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
the one half almost of the people in <hi>England</hi> being absolutely put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of a foreign power.</p>
               <p>Sanctuary shall not protect forfeited Goods,<note place="margin">cap. 13, 14.</note> nor Clerks convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or confessed.</p>
               <p>This was Law; but violence did both now and afterwards much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
it.</p>
               <p>Churches holden of the King shall not be aliened without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense.<note place="margin">Constit. at <hi>Clarindon.</hi> cap. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient Law of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that no Tenements holden by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
could be aliened without License or consent of the Lord, because of
the Allegiance between Lord and Tenant. Now there was no question
but that Churches might lie in Tenure as well as other Tenements; but
the strife was by the Church-men, to hold their Tenements free from all
humane service; which the King withstood.</p>
               <p>Sons of the Laity shall not be admitted into a Monastery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Lord's consent.<note place="margin">cap. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the same ground with the former: for the Lord had not onely
right in his Tenant, which could not be aliened without his consent, but
also a right in his Tenant's Children, in regard they in time might
by descent become his Tenants, and so lie under the same ground of Law:
For although this be no alienation by legal purchase, yet it is in nature
of the same relation; for he that is in a Monastery is dead to all worldly
affairs.</p>
               <p>These then are the rights that the King claimed, and the Clergy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
at the first; although upon more sober consideration they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
consented unto the five last: But their Captain-Archbishop <hi>Becket</hi>
withstood the rest, which cost him his life in the conclusion; with
this honourable testimony, that his death, <hi>Sampson</hi>-like, effected more
than his life: For the main thing of all the rest the Pope gained to be
friends, for the loss of so great a stickler in the Church-affairs as <hi>Becket</hi>
was.</p>
               <p>In this Tragedy the Pope observing how the <hi>English</hi> Bishops had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64112:67"/>
their Archbishops, espied a muse through which all the game of the
Popedom might soon escape, and the Pope be left to sit upon Thorns
in regard of his Authority here in <hi>England.</hi> For let the Metropolitan
of all <hi>England</hi> be a sworn servant to the Metropolitan of the Christian
World, and the rest of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops not concur, it will make the
Tripple Crown at the best but double.<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 302.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope therefore
meaned not to trust their fair natures any longer; but puts an Oath
upon every English Bishop,<note place="margin">Fox. An. 1179.</note> to take before their consecration, whereby he

               </p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>English</hi> Bishops that formerly did but regard <hi>Rome,</hi> now
give their Estates, Bodies and Souls unto her service; that which remains,
the King of <hi>England</hi> may keep:<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1167.</note> And well it was that it was not worse,
considering that the King had vowed perpetual enmity against the Pope.
But he wisely perceiving that the King's spirit would up again, having
thus gotten the main battle, durst not adventure upon the King's rear,
lest he might turn head:<note place="margin">Baronius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 1164. Sec. 11.</note> and so he let the King come off with the loss of
<hi>Appeals,</hi> and an order to annul the customs that by him were brought in
against the Church, which in truth were none.</p>
               <p>This was too much for so brave a King as <hi>Henry</hi> the second, to lose
the scare-crow-power of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet it befel him as many great spirits,
that favour prevails more with them than fear or power: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards his last times worn with grief at his unnatural Sons, a
shadow of the kindness of the Pope's Legat unto him,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1176.</note> won that which
the Clergy could never formerly wrest from him in these particulars gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him: that,</p>
               <p>No Clerk shall answer in the Lay-courts, but onely for the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and their Lay-fee.</p>
               <p>This savoured more of courtesie than Justice, and therefore we find
not that the same did thrive, nor did continue long in force as a Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the claim thereof lasted.</p>
               <p>Vacancies shall not be holden in the King's hand above one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
year, unless upon case of necessity.</p>
               <p>This seemeth to pass somewhat from the Crown, but lost it nothing;
for if the Clergy accepted of this grant, they thereby allow the Crown a
right to make it, and a liberty to determine its own right, or continuing
the same by being sole Judge of the necessity.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In the licentious times of King <hi>Steven,</hi> wherein the Clergy played <hi>Rex,</hi>
they grew so unruly, that in a short time they had committed above a
Hundred murthers. To prevent this evil, the King, loth to enter the List
with the Clergy about too many matters, let loose the <hi>Law of feud,</hi> for
the friends of the party slain to take revenge; and this cost the bloud of
many Clerks: The <hi>Laity</hi> haply, being more industrious therein than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they would have been, because the Ecclesiastical Judge for the
most part favoured them. As an expedient to all which, this Law was
made, and so the Clergy was still left to their Clergy, and Justice done
upon such as sought their bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Clergy-men shall not be holden to trial by Battle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient Law of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and either by neglect worn
out of use, or by the valour of the <hi>Clergie</hi> laid aside, as resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rather to adventure their own bloud, than to end their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
before the <hi>Lay-Judge</hi> by Plea: but grown weary of that course,
and likely also put hard to the pinch upon Complaints made by them
against <hi>Clerk-slayers,</hi> they are fain to have recourse to their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Hitherto therefore it is manifest the <hi>Clergie</hi> were in their growing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
notwithstanding the policy and power of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, who
was the Paragon of that age.</p>
               <p>After him reigned <hi>Richard</hi> the first, that must expiate his disobedience
to his Father, by obedience to his ghostly Father the Pope, in undertaking
the holy War; and being gone, left the Government in his absence so
deeply intrusted to the Clergy, as they could lose nothing of what they
had gained, unless they would; and might have gained much more than
they did or should, had not the Bishop that was the overseer of the whole
Kingdom been drunken with vanity, and spued out his own shame. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the success was, it was not contrary to the principles of those times:
for <hi>Richard</hi> had experience in the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> and his Father's
example, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Clergie</hi> were too hard for all the Potentates
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore might most safely trust them with all he had at
home, whilst he was in their service abroad. Nor were they short of
what was intrusted to them, but stuck close for the maintenance of his
right to the Crown, and emptied themselves even to the very consecrated
Vessels, and procured the Laity of all sorts to do the like, to save the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the rape of strangers and usurpers, who esteemed the King
dead in Law, and as one buried alive.</p>
               <p>Thus passed they to King <hi>John</hi> the Government, supposing themselves
well enough assured of what they had gotten by their several atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had under the Reigns of three several Kings successively: And
King <hi>John</hi> might well enough have understood the times, if he had seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
considered them: but being heightned all his life-time with lawless
Government, wherein he was trained up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he knew not how to
stoop, till he stooped so low as the Legat's Knee, and his Crown at the
Pope's Foot; leaving an example to posterity to beware of striving with
the <hi>Clergie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:64112:68"/>
If then these sparks of ambition were so violent being alone, certainly
in their joynt consultations much more. They had long striven now since
the <hi>Conquest</hi> to have excluded the <hi>Laity</hi> from their <hi>Synods,</hi> and about these
days effected it. And yet about <hi>Henry</hi> the second's time it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the thing either was not yet done, or so lately, that the Law was
not clear in that point; for <hi>Petrus Blecensis,</hi> who was Arch-deacon of
<hi>Bath</hi> about those times, in his Epistle to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the restraint of the growing Sect of the Publicans, he adviseth
in these words: <hi>Accipite clerum, congregate populum, &amp; ex eorum communi
deliberatione, qui Spiritum Domini habent, terribilis constitutio promulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
&amp;c. And if the Historian doth not mistake, the proceedings against
that Sect being onely for errours in Religion, was in a Council of Bishops
and Lords. Nevertheless, whether present or absent, the <hi>Laity</hi> sate there
as Cyphers, making the number great, but not valuable by themselves.
For even in the <hi>Norman</hi> times they were brought so low, as the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
made by the <hi>Clergie</hi> wrought more upon them, than civility it self
can work upon professors of Religion in these days.<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 1127.</note> For it seems excess
of long Hair was grown to that measure, that the <hi>Synod</hi> cried out against
it, and decreed that men should cut their Hair so as their Eyes and laps of
their Ears might be seen; and the King himself, I mean <hi>Henry</hi> the first,
submitted to this cut, and made all his Knights to do the like, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
themselves to the then-odious by-names of <hi>Clowns</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> (like
to the round-heads of these days) who formerly marched under the title
of <hi>Criniti</hi> or <hi>Ruffians.</hi> This did but touch the Hair, but they went to the
quick, when they decreed that Lords should not sell their Villains, and
that Outlawries should pass in certain particular cases; as in the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

times they flew at the Throat of the Government,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 150. ibid. 155<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. LX. Of the English Commonalty since the Normans time.</head>
               <p>THe dignity of the <hi>English</hi> Crown thus deflowred by the great men,
was no loss to the Common people: For as in all decays of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
the great men get nothing if they please not the people, so the
King can hold nothing if they be not contented. And yet contented or
not contented, they could not gain much; for as affairs stood then in the
Christian world, the Politicians discourse of three kinds of Government
proved idle; neither could <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> nor <hi>Democracy,</hi> attain any
semblable condition in any place, so long as the Church held its design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and prevailed to have the greatest share in all; not now by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
either of great or small, but by a pretended <hi>divine right,</hi> through
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64112:69"/>
which they now had gotten to their full pitch of Lordship in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men. It must be acknowledged that this was a distemper in
Government; yet such it was, as kept humours low, and restrained the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
excesses that in all kinds of Government are subject to break
forth; so as neither King, nor Lords, nor People could swell into larger
proportion than would suit with the ends of the <hi>Church-men.</hi> But to mind
the matter in hand: somewhat the <hi>Commons</hi> gained in these stormy times:
The Taxes that they were charged with, were rather perswaded than impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon them; and generally they were sparing in that work: and it is
noted for the honour of King <hi>Steven,</hi> that though he was seldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
War, yet he not onely never charged the people with any Tax, but
released that of <hi>Dane-gelt,</hi> and acquitted the Subject for ever of that Tax,
which former Kings challenged as their right; all which shew him to be
a brave King, if he was not a very rich man. <hi>Henry</hi> the second was more
heavy, because he had more to do: yet find we but one assessment, which
was <hi>Escuage,</hi> unless for the <hi>holy War,</hi> which was more the Clergy-mens
than his. <hi>Richard</hi> was yet a greater burthen: his Reign was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to him, and he deserved it; for from the beginning thereof to the
ending, could never the guilt of his disobedience to his Father be blotted
out: but it was more troublesome to the people, because it cost so much
treasure, was managed by such ill Governours, (except the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) and was unsuccessful in most of his undertakings; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
invaded the liberties of the <hi>Commons</hi> by any face of <hi>Prerogative</hi> But
what wanted in him, was made compleat and running over in his Successor
<hi>John,</hi> who (to speak in the most moderate sence of his Government)
being given over to himself, when he was not himself, robbed the Lords
of their authority, bereaved the Church of its Rights, trod under foot the
Liberties of the people, wasted his own Prerogative: and having brought
all things into despair, comes a desperate cure; the head is cut off to save
the body, and a president left for them that list to take it up in future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And thus that which <hi>Steven</hi> gave, <hi>Henry</hi> the second lost, <hi>Richard</hi> the
first would not regain, and <hi>John</hi> could not; and so all were gainers but the
Crown.</p>

            <div n="61" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. LXI. Of Judicature, the Courts, and their Judges.</head>
               <p>IT is no silent argument that the <hi>Commons</hi> gain, where Laws grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
course; and it was the lot of these troublesome times to lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a constant Government, such as all men might learn, which
formerly was laid up onely in the breasts of wise experienced men. The
two most considerable points in Government, is the Law, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the latter being the life of the former, and that of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
I say not that the Law was augmented in the body of it, or
that the Execution had a freer course than in the best of the former times;
but both were more and more cleared to the world in many particulars,
as well touching matters concerning practice of the Law, as touching
rules of righteousness. For the first whereof, we are beholding to <hi>Glanvil</hi>
in <hi>Henry</hi> the second's time; and for the latter, to King <hi>John,</hi> or rather
the Barons in his time, in the publishing of the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> or an
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64112:69"/>
enumeration of the Liberties or Customes of the people derived from
the <hi>Saxons;</hi> revived, continued, and confirmed by the <hi>Normans</hi> and their
Successors: which for the present I shall leave in <hi>lance dubio,</hi> to stand or
fall, till occasion shall be of clearing the point, in regard that King
<hi>John</hi> soon repented of his Oath, (the Bond of his consent) and to heal
the Wound, got the Pope's pardon and blessing thereupon: so easie a thing
it was for a Son of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to pass for a good Catholick in an
unrighteous way.</p>
               <p>The execution of the Law was done in several Courts, according to
the several kinds of affairs, whereof some concerned matters of <hi>Crime</hi>
and <hi>Penalty;</hi> and this touched the King's honour, and safety of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of himself and his Subjects, and therefore are said to be <hi>contra coronam
&amp; dignitatem,</hi> &amp;c. The second sort concern the <hi>profits</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> or
treasure of the Kingdom. The third concern the <hi>safety of the Estates of
the people.</hi> These three works were appointed unto three several Courts,
who had their several Judges especially appointed to that work. Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
they were in one, <hi>viz.</hi> in the supream Court of Judicature, the
Court of Lords, whereof formerly was spoken; but after, through increase
of affairs, by them deputed or committed to the care of several men that
were men of skill in such affairs, and yet retained the Supremacy in all
such cases still. And because that which concerned the <hi>publick Treasure</hi>
was of more publick regard than the other, the deputation thereof was
committed probably to some of their own members,<note place="margin">Gloss.</note> who in those days
were <hi>Barons</hi> of the Realm, and afterwards retained the Title, but not the
Degree; and therefore were called for distinction-sake, <hi>Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</hi>
The particular times of these deputations appear not clearly
out of any monument of antiquity; nevertheless it is clear to me that it
was before <hi>Henry</hi> the second's time, as well because <hi>Henry</hi> the first had
his <hi>Judex fiscalis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 24.</note> as <hi>Glanvil</hi> so frequently toucheth upon the King's
Court of Pleas, which cannot be intended at the Court of Lords; for that
in those days was never summoned but in time of Parliament, or some
other special occasion. But more principally because the Historian spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Judges <hi>itinerant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> reciteth some to be of the <hi>Common-pleas;</hi>
which sheweth that there was in those days a distinction of Jurisdiction
in Judicatures. And it may very well be conceived that this distinction
of Judicature was by advice of the Parliament after that the <hi>Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of Lords was laid aside by Kings, and a <hi>Privy-Council</hi> taken up, unto
whom could not regularly belong any juridical power, because that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
originally in the grand assembly of the Lords.</p>
               <p>Over these Courts, or two of them, one man had the prime Title of
<hi>Chief Justice,</hi> who then was called <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
whose office was much of the nature of the King's Lieutenant in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and places, as well in War as Peace; and sometimes was appointed to
one part of the Kingdom, and by reason thereof had the name onely of
that part, and some other of the other parts. The greatness of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was such, as the man for necessity of state was continually resident at
the Court, and by this means the King's Court was much attended by
all sorts of persons; which proved in after-times as grievous the King, as
it was burthensome to the people. Other Judges there were, which were
chosen for their learning and experience, most of them being of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
as were also the under-Officers of those Courts; for those times were
<hi>Romes</hi> hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
               <p>Other Courts also were in the Country, and were <hi>Vicontiel</hi> or Courts

which were <hi>itinerant,</hi> over which certain Judges presided, which were
elected by the Grand-Council of Lords,<note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> and sent by Commission from
King <hi>Henry</hi> the second throughout the Kingdom, then divided into
Six Circuits, unto each of which was assigned Three Justices; so as
the whole number of Justices then was Eighteen. The office was before
the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> over hither, but the assignation was new; as
also was their Oath, for they were sworn. But the number continued
not long, for within four years the King re-divided the Land into four
Circuits, and unto each Circuit assigned five Justices, making in the
whole the number of Twenty and one Justices; for the <hi>Northern Circuit</hi>
had six Justices,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 137.</note> which the King made Justices of the <hi>Common pleas</hi>

               <p>Felonies, of Manslaughter, Burning, Robbery, Ravishment, and Fausonry, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

This was the Law derived from the <hi>Normans,</hi> and accordingly was
the direction in the Charge given to the Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's

the Oath,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 25.</note> Fealty, or Bond of Allegiance, as of the Servants against the
Lord, was punished with certain and with painful deaths: And therefore
though the murther of the King was <hi>Treason,</hi> yet the murther of his Son
was no other than as of another man, unless it arose from those of his own
Servants.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 79.</note> The penalty of loss of Estate, was common both to <hi>Treason</hi> and
<hi>Felony;</hi> it reached even unto <hi>Thefts;</hi> in which case the forfeiture, as to the
Moveables,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 7. cap. 17.</note> was to the Sheriff of the County, unto whose cognizance the
case did belong: and the Land went to the Lord immediately, and not
to the King. But in all cases of <hi>Felony,</hi> and of a higher nature, the party
(though not the King's Tenant) lost his personal Estate to the King for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
his Free-holds also for a year and a day; after which, they returned
to the Lord of the Soil, by way of Escheat. It seemeth also, that the loss
not onely of Chattels and Goods, but also of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extended to <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries</hi>
(I conceive in case of <hi>Felony;</hi>) and the King's Pardon in such case
could not bind the Lord's right of Escheat, although it might discharge
the Goods, and the year and day whereunto the King was entitled: which
case alone sufficiently declareth what power Kings had in the Estates of
their Subjects.</p>
               <p>

Law;<note place="margin">Manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Glanv. lib. 14. cap. 1. &amp; 3.</note> and questionless it was upon good ground: for the times
now were not as those in the <hi>Conquerour</hi>'s times, when shedding of Bloud
was accounted Valour, and in most cases in order to the publick service.
And now it seems it was a growing evil, and that cried so loud, as though

this was no Repeal thereof; and the rather, because <hi>Glanvil</hi> alloweth of
Pledges in all cases (except <hi>Manslaughter</hi>) yea in those Crimes that did
wound <hi>Majesty</hi> it self, although they concern the destruction of the King's
person, or Sedition in the Kingdom or Army thereof. The Justices here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  <hi>Fauxonry</hi> is of several degrees or kinds: some against the King, others
against other men;<note place="margin">Fauxonry. Glanv. lib. 14. cap. 7.</note> and of those against the King, some are punished as
Wounds of Majesty, as <hi>falsifying the King's Charter:</hi> and whether <hi>falsifying
of Money</hi> were in that condition or not, I leave; or <hi>falsifying of Measures,</hi> yet
more inferiour, I cannot determine; but it is clear by <hi>Glanvil,</hi> that <hi>falsify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of</hi> the <hi>Deed</hi> of a private person, was of smaller consideration, and at
the utmost deserved but loss of Member.</p>
               <p>Inheritances may not be aliened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64112:71"/>
                  <hi>Inheritances</hi> were in those times of Lands or Goods; for it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
then,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 1. Ibid. c. 5.</note> that the personal Estate (the Debts deducted) was divisible
into three parts; one whereof belonged in right to the Wife as <hi>her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
part,</hi> the other to the <hi>Heir,</hi> and a third to the <hi>Testator</hi> to make his
Will of them; and of the other two parts he could not dispose by Will.
Concerning Lands, it was regularly true, that no man could alien his
whole Inheritance to the disherisin of his Heir, either by Act in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
or any part thereof by his last Will, without the concurrence of the
Heir. But of purchased Lands he may give part by Act executed in his
life-time, though he have no Lands by inheritance; and if he hath no Issue,
then he may alien all. And where a man hath Lands by inheritance, and
also by purchase, he may alien all his purchased Lands as he pleaseth. If
the Lands be holden in <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> no more of the Inheritance can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to any of the Children, than their proportionable parts will amount
unto. This Law of Inheritance was divers, according to the Tenure: for
the Lands in Knights-service always descended to the Heir; but such as
were holden in Socage passed according to the custom, either to the eldest,
or to the youngest, or to all equally. And thus stood the general state of
Inheritance from the <hi>Normans</hi> time hitherto,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 88.</note> seeming somewhat too strait
for the <hi>Free men,</hi> that by Law of Property might challenge a power to do
with their own as they pleased. But the <hi>Normans</hi> saw a double prejudice
herein: the first was the danger of ruine of many of their Families, who
now ingrafted into the <hi>English</hi> stock, and yet not fully, one might expect
a late check to their preferments from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Parents, after a long and
fair semblance made of their good Will. The second prejudice was the
decay of their <hi>Militia,</hi> which was maintained by Riches more than by
multitude of men; partly because that rich men are most fearful of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
and therefore ordinarily are most serviceable both with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Estates against publick dangers; and partly because by their
Friends and Allies they bring more aid unto the publick, by engaging them
in the common Cause, that otherwise might prove unsensible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their Country.</p>
               <p>The Heir of a Free-man shall by descent be in such seisin as his Ancestor had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
at the time of his death,<note place="margin">Vide Glanv. l. 7. c. 9.</note> doing service, and paying relief; and shall have his
Chattels.</p>
               <p>If the Heir be under age, the Lord shall have the Wardship for the due time,
and the Wife her Dower and part of the Goods.</p>
               <p>If the Lord with-hold seisin, the King's Justice shall try the matter by twelve
men.</p>
               <p>The first of these branches is declaratory of a ground of common
Law; but being applied to the last, is an introduction of a new Law of
tryal of the Heir's Right by Assize of <hi>Mortdancester,</hi> where formerly no
remedy was left to the Heir, but a <hi>Writ of Right.</hi> If these three branches
be particularly observed, they speak of three sorts of Heirs; of <hi>Tenants by
Knight-service,</hi> viz. such as are <hi>Majors,</hi> or of full age; and such as are <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi>
or under age; and such as are of a doubtful age. Those that are of
full age at the death of their Ancestors, may possess the Lands descended,
and the Lord may not disseize him thereof; but may be resisted by the
Heir in the maintenance of his possession, so as he be ready to pay <hi>Relief,</hi>
and do service that is due: and if the Lord expel him, he shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
by Assize. Those Heirs that are <hi>Minors,</hi> shall be under the Lord's
guardianship till they come to one and twenty years. The Heirs of such
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64112:72"/>
as hold by <hi>Socage,</hi> are said to be at full age at fifteen years, because at that
age they were thought able to do that service; but the Sons of Burgesses
are then said to be of full age, when they have ability to manage their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Calling, such as telling of Money, measuring of Cloath, and the like:
yet doth not <hi>Glanvil,</hi> or any other, say that these were their full age to all
purposes; albeit that some Burroughs at this day hold the last in custom
to all intents whatsoever. The last branch provideth the remedy to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Heir his possession in case it be detained, either through doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of age of the Heir, or his Title: and it directs the Issue to be tryed
by twelve men. This tryal some have thought to be of <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it may well be that this tryal of this matter, as thus set down,
was directed by him: yet he useth often in his book the word <hi>solet,</hi> and
in his Preface saith, That he will set down <hi>frequentius usitata;</hi> and it is past
question, but that the tryal by twelve men was much more ancient, as
hath been already noted. One thing more yet remaineth, concerning the
Widow of the Tenant, whose Dower is not onely provided for, but her
reasonable part of her Husband's personal Estate. The original hereof was
from the <hi>Normans,</hi> and it was as <hi>popular</hi> as that of Wardships was <hi>Regal;</hi>
and so they made the <hi>English</hi> women as sure to them, as they were sure of
their Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The Justices shall by Assize try Disseisins done since the King's coming over
Sea, next after the peace made between him and his Son.</p>
               <p>This is called the <hi>Assize of Novel disseisin,</hi> or of disseisins lately made.
It seems that the limitation was set for the Justices sake, who now were
appointed to that work which formerly belonged to the <hi>County-courts;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 13. cap. 33.</note>
and to prevent intrenchments of Courts, a limitation was determined, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the copy seemeth to be mistaken: for the limitation in the Writ is
from the King's last Voyage, or going into <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Justices shall do right upon the King's Writ for half a Knights Fee, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
unless in cases of difficulty, which are to be referred to the King.</p>
               <p>The Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> ended the smaller matters in their Circuits; the
other were reserved to the King in his Bench.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Justices shall enquire of Escheats, Lands, Churches, and Women, in the
King's gift: And of Castle-guard, who? how much? and where?</p>
               <p>So as the Judges <hi>itinerant</hi> had the work of Escheators; and made their
Circuits serve as well for the King's profit, as justice to the Subjects. They
used also to take <hi>Fealty</hi> of the people to the King at one certain time of the
year, and to demand <hi>Homage</hi> also. These matters of the King's <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>
made the presence of the Judges less acceptable, and it may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
some kind of oppression. And as touching <hi>Castle-guard,</hi> it was a
Tenure in great use in these bloody times; and yet it seemeth they used to
take Rent instead of the personal service, else had that enquiry (how
much?) been improper.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Of a Tenants holding, and of several Lords.</p>
               <p>That one man may hold several Lands of several Lords, and so owe
service to them all, is so common, as nothing can be more: nevertheless
it will not be altogether out of the way, to touch somewhat upon the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64112:72"/>
nature of this mutual relation between Lord and Tenant in general, that
the true nature of the diversity may more fully appear. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or subject of service was a piece of Land, or other Tenement, at the
first given by the Lord to the Tenant, in affirmance of a stipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them presupposed, by the giving and receiving whereof the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
undertook to peform service to the Lord, and the Lord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
protection of the Tenant in his right to that Tenement.<note place="margin">Glanvil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> c. 4.</note> The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was first by service solemnly bound, either by Oath, which the Lord
or his Deputy by the Common-Law hath power to administer; as in the
case of <hi>Fealty,</hi> in which the Tenant bound himself to be true to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and safety of his Lords person, and to perform the service due to
the Lord for the Tenement so given; or otherwise by the Tenants hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
acknowledgment, and promise not only to perform the services due,
but even to be devoted to the Lords service, to honour him, and to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
limb and life, and be true and faithful to the Lord. This is called
<hi>Homage,</hi> from those words, <hi>I become your man Sir;</hi> and yet promiseth
upon the matter no more but <hi>fealty</hi> in a deeper complement, albeit there
be difference in the adjuncts belonging to eách. For though it be true that
by promise of being the <hi>Lord's man,</hi> a general service may seem to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
yet in regard that it is upon occasion only of that present Tenure,
it seemeth to me that it is to be restrained only to those particular servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which belong to that Tenement; and therefore if that Tenement be
holden in <hi>Socage,</hi> although the Tenant be bound to <hi>homage,</hi> yet that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
ties not the Tenant to the service of a <hi>Knight;</hi>

the <hi>homage</hi> of a Tenant in <hi>Knight-service</hi> tie him to that of <hi>Socage</hi> upon
the command of his Lord, though he professeth himself to be <hi>his man.</hi>
Nor doth the Tenant's <hi>homage</hi> bind him against all men, nor <hi>ad semper;</hi>
for in case he holdeth of two or divers Lords by <hi>homage</hi> for several Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 9. cap. 1. Lib. 7. cap. 10.</note>
and these two Lords be in War one against the other, the Tenant
must serve his chief Lord of whom the Capital house is holden; or that
Lord which was his by priority, who may be called the chief Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
having first received <hi>homage,</hi> he received it absolutely from his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
with <hi>a saving of the Tenant's Faith made to other Lords and to the
King;</hi> who in order to the publick had power to command a Tenant into
War against his own Lord. If therefore he be commanded by the King in
such cases unto War,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 9. cap. 1.</note> he need not question the point of forfeiture; but if
he be commanded by a chief of his other Lords into War, against a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in which another of his Lords is engaged, his safest way is to enter
upon the work, because of his Allegiance to that Lord, yet with a <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi>
of his <hi>fealty</hi> to that other Lord.<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 4.</note> But in all ordinary cases, Tenants
and Lords must have regard to their stipulation, for otherwise, if either
break, the other is discharged for ever; and if the fault be in the Tenant,
his Tenement <hi>escheats</hi> to his Lord; and if the Lord fail, he loses his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and the Tenant might thenceforth disclaim, and hold over for ever.
Nevertheless the Lords had two Priviledges by common custom belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Tenures, which although not mentioned in the stipulation,
were yet more valuable than all the rest; the one concerning matter of
profit, the other of power: That of profit consisted in <hi>aids</hi> and <hi>relief.</hi>
The <hi>aids</hi> were of three kinds,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 8.</note> one to make the Lords <hi>eldest Son Knight,</hi>
the other to <hi>marry his eldest Daughter;</hi> the third to help him to pay a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to his Lord Paramount;</hi> which in my opinion sounds as much as if
the Tenants were bound by their Tenures to <hi>aid</hi> their Lord in all cases of
extraordinary charge (saving that the Lord could not distrain his Tenant<note place="margin">Glanv. l. 9. c. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:64112:73"/>
for <hi>aid</hi> to his War) and this according to the Lords discretion;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for <hi>Glanvil</hi>
saith that the Law determined nothing concerning the quantity or value
of these <hi>aids.</hi> These were the <hi>Norman</hi> ways, and savoured so much of
<hi>Lordship,</hi> that within that age they were regulated: But that of <hi>reliefs</hi>
was an ancient sacrifice, as of <hi>first-fruits</hi> of the Tenement to the Lord,
in memorial of the first Lords favour in conferring that Tenement; and it
was first setled in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time. The Lords Priviledge of power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
so far, as to distrain his Tenants into his own Court to answer to
himself, in all causes that concerned his right; and so the Lord became both
Judge and Party; which was soon felt and prevented, as shall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Another priviledge of the Lords power, was over the Tenants
Heir after the Tenants death, in the disposing of the Body during the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority</hi>
and <hi>marriage</hi> of the same. As touching the disposing of the Body,
the Lord either retained the same in his own power, or committed the
same to others;<note place="margin">Glanv. 7. 10. Ibid. c. 12.</note> and this was done either <hi>pleno jure,</hi> or rendring an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
As concerning the <hi>marriage</hi> of the Females that are Heirs, or so
apparent, the Parents in their life-time cannot marry them without the
Lords consent; nor may they marry themselves after their Parents death,
without the same: and the Lords are bound to give their consent, unless
they can shew cause to the contrary. The like also of the Tenants <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
that have any Dowry in the Lands of such Tenure. And by such-like
means as these, the power of the <hi>Barons</hi> grew to that height, that
in the lump it was too massie both for <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Of the power of the last Will.</p>
               <p>It is a received opinion, that at the common-Law no man could devise
his Lands by his last <hi>Will.</hi> If thereby it be conceived to be against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, I shall not touch that; but if against custom of the ancient
times, I must suspend my concurrence therewith, until those ancient times
be defined: for as yet I find no testimony sufficient to assert that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but rather that the times hitherto had a sacred opinion of the <hi>last
Will,</hi> as of the most serious, sincere, and advised declaration of the most
inward desires of a man; which was the main thing looked unto in
all Conveyances, <hi>Voluntas donatoris de caetero observetur.</hi> And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more ordinary than for Kings in these times, as much as in them
did lie,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1216. Hoveden. An. 1199. Malmsb. nov. l. 1.</note> to dispose of their Crowns by their <hi>last Will.</hi> Thus King <hi>John</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third his Successour; and <hi>Richard</hi> the first devised the
Crown to King <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the first gave all his Lands to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror by his <hi>last Will,</hi> gave <hi>Normandy</hi> to <hi>Robert,
England</hi> to <hi>William,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malmsb. l. 3.</note> and to <hi>Henry</hi> his Mothers Lands. If then these
things of greatest moment under Heaven were ordinarily disposed by
the <hi>last Will,</hi> was it then probable, that the smaller Free-holds should be
of too high esteem to be credited to such Conveyances? I would not be
mistaken, as if I thought that Crowns and Empires were at the disposal
of the <hi>last Will</hi> of the possessor; nor do I think that either they were thus
in this Kingdom, or that there is any reason that can patronize that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
yet it will be apparent that Kings had no sleight conceit of the <hi>last
Will,</hi> and knew no such infirmity in that manner of conveyance, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
or else would they never have spent that little breath left them
in vain.<note place="margin">Glanvil. l. 7. cap. 1. &amp; 5.</note> I have observed the words of <hi>Glanvil</hi> concerning this point,
and I cannot find that he positively denyeth all conveyance of Land by
<hi>Will,</hi> but only in case of disherison; the ground whereof is, because it is
contrary to the conveyance of the Law; and yet in that case also allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64112:73"/>
of a disposing power by consent of the Heir; which could never
make good conveyance, if the <hi>Will</hi> in that case were absolutely void,
and therefore his Authority lies not in the way. Nor doth the particular
customs of places discountenance, but rather advance this opinion: for
if devises of Lands were incident to the Tenure in <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> and that so
general in old time, as also to the burgage Tenures, which were the rules
of Corporations and Cities,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>Vbi Leges Angliae deperiri non possunt, nec de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraudari,
nec violari,</hi> how can it be said contrary to the common Law?
And therefore those Conveyances of Lands by <hi>last Will,</hi> that were in and
after these times holden in use, seem to me rather remnants of the more
general custom, wasted by positive Laws, than particular customs grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up against the common rule.<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1181. Hoved. An. 1181.</note> It is true, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> put a power
into the Pope to alter the Law, as touching themselves in some cases:
for <hi>Roger</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> procured a faculty from the Pope to ordain,
that no Ecclesiastical persons <hi>Will</hi> should be good, unless made in health,<note place="margin">Decret. Alex. Pap. Hoveden. fol. 587. Glanv. l. 7. cap. 5. &amp; 16.</note>
and not lying in extremity; and that in such cases the Arch-bishop should
possess himself of all such parties goods: but as it lasted not long, so was
himself made a president in the case; for being overtaken with death e're
he was provided, he made his <hi>Will</hi> in his sickness, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
possessed himself of his Estate. And it is as true, that <hi>Feme
coverts</hi> in these days could make no <hi>Will</hi> of their <hi>reasonable part,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law it belonged joyntly to the Children. Nor could
<hi>Vsurers</hi> continuing in that course at the time of their death make their
<hi>Will,</hi> because their personal Estate belonged to the King after their death,
and their Lands to their Lords by <hi>escheat,</hi> although before death they
lie open to no censure of Law: but this was by an especial Law made
since the <hi>Conquerour</hi>'s time; for by the <hi>Saxon-Law</hi> they were reputed as
<hi>Out-Laws.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edw. 37.</note> Nevertheless, all these do but strengthen the general rule,
<hi>viz.</hi> That regularly the <hi>last Will</hi> was holden in the general a good convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in Law. If the <hi>Will</hi> were only intended and not perfected, or no
<hi>Will</hi> was made,<note place="margin">Glanv. l. 7. c. 6. cap. 8.</note> then the Lands passed by descent, and the goods held
course according to the <hi>Saxon Law, viz.</hi> the next Kinsmen and Friends
of the intestate did administer, and as administrators, they might sue by
Writ out of the Kings Court, although the Clergy had now obtained so
much power, as for the recovery of a Legacy, or for the determining of
the validity of the <hi>Will</hi> in its general nature, it was transmitted to the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical

               <head>CHAP. LXIII. Of the Militia of this Kingdom during the Reign of these
Kings.</head>
               <p>I Undertake not the debate of right; but as touching matter of fact
shortly thus much: that from the <hi>Norman</hi> times the power of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
rested upon two principles; the one the Allegiance for the common
defence of the King's person and honour, and Kingdom; and in this case
the King had the power to levy the force of the Kingdom: nevertheless
the cause was still under the cognizance of the great Council, so far as to
agree or disavow the War, if they saw cause; as appeared in the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64112:74"/>
of the <hi>Barons</hi> in the quarrel between King <hi>Steven</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
and between King <hi>John</hi> and his <hi>Barons.</hi> The other principle was
the service due to the Lord from the Tenant, and by vertue hereof (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
whenas the liberty of the Commons was in question) the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
was swayed by the Lords, and they drew the people in Arms either
one way or the other, as the case appeared to them: the experience
whereof the Kings from time to time felt, to their extream prejudice, and
the Kingdoms damage. Nor did the former principle oversway the
latter, although it might seem more considerable, but only in the times
of civil peace, when the Lords were quiet, and the people well-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Kings aims in reference to the publick; which happiness it was
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second's lot to enjoy: for he being a Prince eminent amongst
Princes both for endowments of mind and of outward estate, not only
gained honour abroad, but much more amongst his own people at home,
who saw plainly that he was for Forraign employment of honour to the
Kingdom; and not only contented with what he had in <hi>England,</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
together with the <hi>Laity</hi> against the growing power of the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
for the defence and honour of the priviledges of the Crown, wherein also
the <hi>Liberties of the people</hi> were included. They therefore were secure in
the Kings way, and suffered themselves to be engaged unto the Crown
further than they or their Ancestors formerly had been, out of pretence
of sudden extreme occasions of the Kingdom, that would not be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ordinary course of defence. For the King (finding by former
experience that the way of Tenures was too lame a supply for his acquests
abroad, and that it had proved little better than a broken reed to the
Crown in case of dispute with the people) aimed at a further reach than
the <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> foresaw; and having learned a trick in <hi>France,</hi>
brought it over (although it was neither the first nor last trick that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
learned to their cost from <hi>France</hi>) which was a new way of levying
of Men and Arms for the War,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 1181.</note> by assessing upon every <hi>Knights Fee, and
upon every Free-man of the value of sixteen Marks yearly, their certain
Arms; and upon every Free man of ten Marks yearly value, their certain
Arms; and upon every Burgess and Free-man of an inferiour value, their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Arms. 2. That these should be ready prepared against a certain day.
3. That they should be kept and maintained from time to time in the Kings
Service, and at his command. 4. That they should not be lent, pledged, sold,
or given away. 5. That in case of death they should descend to the Heir,
who if under age, should find a man to serve in his stead. 6. That in case
the owner were able, he should be ready at a certain day with his Arms for
the service of the King,</hi> ad fidem Domini Regis &amp; Regni sui. 7. <hi>That
unto this every man should be Sworn.</hi> I call this a new way of levying of
Arms and Men, not but that formerly other <hi>Free-men</hi> and Burgesses
found Arms, albeit they held not by <hi>Knight service;</hi> for it was so ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Conquerors Laws formerly used: but now the King thrust in
two clauses (besides the altering of the Arms) the one concerning the <hi>Oath</hi>
whereby all men became bound; the other concerning the raising and
ordering of Men and Arms, which here seems to be referred to the King
only, and in his service; and this I grant may imply much in common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
<hi>viz.</hi> that all the <hi>power of the Militia</hi> is in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. But this
trick catched not the people according to the Kings meaning: for the
words <hi>ad fidem Regis &amp; Regni</hi> still left a muse for the people to escape, if they
were called out against their duty to the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and taught the doctrine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64112:74"/>
which is not yet repealed, <hi>viz. That what is not according to their Faith to
the Kingdom, is not according to their Faith to the King.</hi> And therefore they
could find in their hearts sometimes to sit still at home, when they were
called forth to War: as may appear in one passage in the days of King
<hi>John,</hi> who had gathered together an Army for the opposing of foraign
Power, at such time as the Pope had done his worst against him and the
whole Kingdom; which Army was of such considerable strength, as
I believe none since the <hi>Conquest</hi> to this day exceeded or parallell'd it:
But the King's mean submission to the Pope's Legat so distasted the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
and <hi>People,</hi> as they left him to his own shifts; and that in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as although afterwards he had advantage of them, and liberty enough
to have raised an Army to have strengthned himself against the <hi>Nobles,</hi>
yet the Lords coming from <hi>London,</hi> brought on the sudden such a party
as the King was not able to withstand; and so he came off with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
made at <hi>Renny mead,</hi> which though in it self was honourable, yet
lost the King so much the more, because it was rather gained from him,
than made by him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXIV. Of the Government of Henry the third, Edward the first, and
Edward the second, Kings of England. And first, a general
view of the disposition of their Government.</head>
               <p>ONe hundred and ten years more I have together taken up, to add a
period to this first part of discourse concerning English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
principally because one spirit of arbitrary rule from King <hi>John,</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to breath throughout the whole, and therewith did expire.</p>
               <p>The first that presents himself is <hi>Henry</hi> the third, begotten by King
<hi>John</hi> when he was in the very first enterprize of oppression that occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the first <hi>Barons</hi> bloudy Wars, and which this King was so miserable
as to continue for the greatest part of his Life and Reign, and yet so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to see it ended about four years before he died. Although the soul
be not ingendred from the parent, yet the temperature of the body of
the Child doth sometimes so attemper the motion of the soul, that there
is in the Child the very image of the Father's mind: and this <hi>Henry</hi> the
third lively expressed, being so like unto his Father <hi>John</hi> in his worst
course, as if his Father's own spirit had entred into him, and animated him
in all his ways. He brought in with him the first president of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in point of Succession by inheritance in the <hi>English</hi> Throne; for
the stream of probabilities was against him. He was a Child, and the
times required a compleat man, and a man for War. He was the Child
of King <hi>John,</hi> whose demerits of the State were now fresh in the minds
of all men. He was also designed to the Throne by his Father's <hi>last
Will;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1216.</note> which was a dangerous president for them to admit, who had but
even now withstood King <hi>John</hi>'s depositing of the Crown in the Pope's
hands, as not being in the power of a King of <hi>England</hi> to dispose of his
Crown according to his own will. Yet leaping over all these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and looking on <hi>Henry</hi> the third as the Child of a King, that by good
nouriture might prove a wise and just King, they closed about this spark,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64112:75"/>
in hope it might bring forth a flame whereby to warm themselves in stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
times. Nor did their hopes soon perish: for, during his minority,
the King was wise to follow good Counsel, and by it purged out all the
ill humours that the Kingdom had contracted in the rash distempers of
his Fathers government. Nor did he onely follow the counsels of others
herein, but even at such times as their counsels crossed, he chose those
Counsels that suited with the most popular way; as is to be seen in the
different counsels of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>William Briware.</hi>
And yet two things troubled much those times:<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1223.</note> one, that they were
times of parties; the other, that the Protector was somewhat too excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be a meer servant; and it is hard for the <hi>English</hi> Nobility to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
him to be greater; although it may seem reasonable that they
that are thought worthy to govern a King, should be much more worthy
to govern themselves. But the Pope put an end to all occasion of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
hereabout; for by his Brief he declares the King to be sixteen years
old, and of age to govern himself; and therefore all Castles are forthwith
to be rendred up into the King's hands.<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1223, 1224.</note> This proved the rock of offence,
whilst some obeyed the Pope, and were impugners of those that put more
confidence in the Castles than in the Kings good nature. Hence first
sprang a civil broil, thence want of money, then a Parliament, wherein
the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> Liberties once more was exchanged for a
sum of Money. Thus God wheeled about successes. But the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
passed over his tame age under the Government of wise Counsellors,
and by this time beginning to feel liberty, it was his hard condition to
meet with want of Money; and worse, to meet with ill Counsellors,
which served him with ill advice, that the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> would keep him
down, make him continually poor, and in state of pupillage. To this
giving credit, it shaped an Idea in his mind that would never out for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years after; and thus advised, he neglects his own engagement, defies
the Government that by his Royal word, and the Kings his predecessors,
in cool bloud had been setled: and that he might do this without check
of Conscience, he forbad the study of the Law, that so it might die
without heir, and he have all by <hi>Escheat.</hi> This sadded the <hi>English,</hi> and
made them drive heavily: the King (to add more strengh) brought in
Foraigners and foraign Councils; and then all was at stand. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
were for new ways. The great designe was to get money to supply
the King's wants; and as great a designe was to keep the King in want:
otherwise it had been easie for those at the helm to have stopped the
concourse of Foraigners (other than themselves) from abroad; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the Queens poorer Allies, lavish entertainment, profuse rewards,
cheats from <hi>Rome,</hi> and all in necessitous times. But strangers, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their own interests, must maintain strangeness between the King and
his Subjects. To supply therefore these necessities, all shifts are used, as
<hi>revoking of Charters, displacing of Officers,</hi> and <hi>fining them, Afforestations,</hi>
with a train of oppressions depending thereon, <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Amercements,
corrupt Advancements, Loans,</hi> and many tricks to make rich men offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
especially projects upon the City of <hi>London.</hi> Nevertheless all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
infinitely short of his disbursements; so as at times he is necessitated to
call Parliaments, and let them know his wants. At the first the people are
sensible, and allow supply; but after by experience finding themselves hurt
by their supplies to the King, they grant upon conditions of renewing
the power of the <hi>Great Charter;</hi> and many promises pass from the King
to that end, and after that Oaths, and yet no performance: This makes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64112:75"/>
the people absolutely deny supplies. Then the King pretends Wars in <hi>France,</hi>
Wars in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Wars against the Infidels in the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> whither
he is going: the people upon such grounds give him <hi>aids;</hi> but finding all
but pretences, or ill success of such enterprizes, they are hardned against
supplies of him for the <hi>Holy War.</hi> Then he seems penitent, and pours
out new promises, sealed with the most solemn execration that is to be
found in the Womb of Story, and so punctually recorded, as if God
would have all generations to remember it as the seal of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King of <hi>England</hi> and his people; and therefore I cannot omit
it.</p>
               <p>It was done in full Parliament,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1253.</note> where the Lords Temporal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,

with an <hi>Amen</hi> from the representative body of the whole Kingdom, put
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64112:76"/>
in writing under seal, preserved to posterity; vindicated by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the ruine of so many opposers. And yet the dust of time hath
almost buried this out of the thoughts of men; so as few even of such
as know it, do seriously consider how far it may yet and even now be
charged upon the account of this Nation. Serious as it was, it was soon
forgotten: nor would the King be long holden with promises, some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Star struck him in his birth: he had been too hard for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
and now having the Pope at his Elbow, he can dispence with his
Oath, and bid defiance to an Execration: and in flat defiance of the
<hi>Grand-Charter</hi> professeth oppression, accumulates forreign Counsellors,
and forreign Guards, contemns his own people, ushers in the Pope's
Extortions upon them to fill up the measure: thrives in nothing but in
the match of his Son and Successor with a Sister of <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet that
also helps to hasten on the publick poverty, and that a Parliament that
brought forth a bloudy issue; although not by any natural power, but
occasionally. For the <hi>Barons</hi> mean now no longer to trust to promises;
strangers are banished the Realm, and others of the <hi>English</hi> bloud step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
into their places and Revenues. But this was not all, the King
must confirm the <hi>Grand-Charter;</hi> and thereto he addeth not onely his
own Oath, but causeth the Prince his Son to confirm the same in like
manner. It is likewise propounded to him, that the chief Officers of
the Kingdom may be chosen such as the Parliament shall like of. And
that other Laws meet for the government of the Kingdom might be
established: of all these the King made no bones. And to make men
believe that he was in good earnest, he was contented to disrobe and
disarm himself,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> and invest the <hi>Barons</hi> both with Sword and Scepter,
retaining nothing but the Crown for himself. This had been safety e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the Kingdom, but that it was a conclusion without an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement;
for as it was on the King's part made from a principle of shame
and fear, so it was determined in anger; for after that the King had
been thus drest and girt for the space of Four or Five years, (whatsoever
he thought all the while it is no matter) he began first to stretch his
Conscience, and having the Pope's Dispensation to help, soon makes
his Oath to fly assunder (although his Son had for the present more
Conscience.) But the other girt held more stoutly, for the Lords had
the <hi>Sword</hi> chained to their Arm by the King's own grant. <hi>Liceat om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

                     </gap>. 1258.</note> though not without some jealousies amongst themselves.
And it is very probable had the King been a little longer breathed
with patience, he might have had his will upon easier terms: for the
Lords were not so jealous of one another as the Commons were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Lords, that they meaned to rule onely for themselves. But
the King now being in a wood, and bemired, so as he must now resolve
to get all or lose all, and so either satisfie his natural desires, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his politick power, entred the field with the aid of those
Commons that chose rather to be oppressed by one King than many
Lords. And thus the Lords received the first blow, and gave the first
foil: Afterwards being worsted by their own divisions and jealousies,
they left a victory to the King that might have made him absolute,
if he had been moderate; but pursuing revenge too far, he was distasted
of his own party that looked on him as a <hi>Polyphemus</hi> that intended to
devour the Enemy first, that he might more freely feast upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64112:76"/>
in the issue. This made victory follow the King afar off, and
taught the King that the end of Civil War must be attended with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in the Conquerour, so far as may stand with publick safety; or
otherwise he that is Conquerour to day by Sword, may be conquered
to morrow by Jealousie. Thus many humours consumed, and all parts
tired after four years continual War, the State cometh to its right Wits.
The King's gains in all this bloudy sweat may be summed up in two
heads. First, that he had liberty to chuse his principal Officers of State
by advice of the Lords, and them also to displace by like Counsel. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in that he gained (though at a dear rate) wisdom to observe the
state of affairs, and to apply himself according to occasion: so lived
<hi>Henry</hi> the third for three or four years after these troubles; long enough
to let the World know that he was able to govern like an <hi>English</hi>
King, and to teach his Son by his own late experience to be a wise gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
betimes.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Edward</hi> the first being trained up in the Tragedy of a Civil War,<note place="margin">Edward 1.</note>
wherein he was one of the chief actors; and having expiated the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way of his riotous youth by his <hi>Holy War,</hi> as they called it;
now he betakes himself to amends making, by Justice in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
having found by his Father's experience, that a Kingdom well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
(like good husbandry) preserves the owner, but being neglected
destroys both.</p>
               <p>He came over in his third year in <hi>August,</hi> was crowned in <hi>September,</hi>
summoned a Parliament in <hi>February</hi> following, but adjourned it till after
<hi>Easter:</hi> and then it is found that the Church of late had been ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;
the Clergy-men grieved by many ways, the people otherwise
handled than they ought to be, the Peace ill kept, the Laws less used, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
less punished than was meet; and in the sence of these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
were the Laws of <hi>Westminster</hi> the first made; wherein the world
may see the great difference between the Prince and the King in one and
the same man.</p>
               <p>The most part of those Laws were little other than plaisters applied
to particular botches of those times; wherein the King dealt with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand, as if he feared to ulcerate any part, and especially the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
and therefore delivered the last Law in a petitionary way to the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> because it concerned the execution of Justice in prohibited times,
and yet bound up all with a <hi>salvo</hi> to himself and his prerogative, like a
wise King, that would neither lose right, nor do rong; nor yet stickle to
debate with his Subjects now, whenas his eye was upon a further mark.
For <hi>Leolin</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had affronted him;<note place="margin">Walsing. 46.</note> and though he could
not endure affronts, yet could he dissemble them for advantage; and so
he suffered the Parliament to run its course, that he might have done the
sooner. Otherwise he had a seed of his Father's conceit that Laws are not
made for Kings, as appeared afterward: for after he had gotten his Army
into the field, he took a <hi>fifteenth</hi> which was granted to his Father, and this
was <hi>inaudito more:</hi> but there was no disputing with power,<note place="margin">M. Westm. An. 1276.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Subject must be contented rather to score it up against the future,
than require present pay; so dangerous a thing it is for <hi>England,</hi> that Kings
should have occasion to gather Armies, though for never so honourable
employment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Welsh</hi> chase is hotly pursued, yet it did not rid much way; for it
cost the <hi>English</hi> a voyage of nine years travel before they could attain the
shore, although it had been often within their view. It may be the King
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64112:77"/>
found it advantageous for his Government, to maintain an Army in the
field under the colour of the <hi>Welsh War,</hi> that he might more bow his
Subjects to his own bent: for during these Wars, the King made many
breathings, and took time to look to the husbanding of his own Revenue,
as those Ordinances called <hi>Extenta manerii,</hi> and <hi>Officium Coronatoris,</hi> do
witness, and the Statute of <hi>Bigami.</hi> But the people were not altogether
yet tamed; for the times being still in Wars, and they occasioning much
waste of Treasure, put the King to the utmost pitch of good Husbandry,
and one degree beyond the same: so as under colour of seizing his own,
he swept up also the Priviledges and Liberties of his Subjects; some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
reciting the complaints of the <hi>Church-men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Westm. Polyd. virg.</note> others of the <hi>Laity:</hi> so
as it seemeth the King was no respecter of persons but his own. This,
and others not unlike, had almost occasioned another Combustion, had
not the meeting at <hi>Gloucester</hi> setled things for the present, by referring the
right of <hi>Franchises</hi> to debate in the <hi>Eyer,</hi> and ordering reseizure of such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
into the Subjects hands, whereof they had been dispossessed by <hi>Quo
warranto,</hi> and <hi>Quo jure,</hi> under colour of the fourth Chapter of the Statute
of <hi>Bigami.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, however debonair the King seemed to be, the sore between
him and his Subjects was not fully cured; nor did the Lords trust him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than needs must: for whether they served in the Field, or met at
Council, still they were armed; and during this daring of each other, were
many profitable Laws made, whilst neither party durst venture bloodshed
in touching too nigh upon the Priviledges of each other, principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the affairs in <hi>Wales</hi> were but laid asleep, and upon reviving, might
turn the ballance to either side.</p>
               <p>The Wars awake again, and therein are consumed nigh five years more
of the King's Reign; so as whatever his intent was, he could have hitherto
little opportunity to effect any thing for the advancement of the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the Crown at home: Nor had he scarcely breathed himself and
Army from the <hi>Welsh</hi> Wars, but he found both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
at once. The King faced onely the first, and fought the second;
which held him work the remainder of his days: and at the same time also
he arrayed both the Clergy and Laity at his own home, as if Providence
had given him security for the good behaviour; and yet it failed him in
the issue, and left him to the censure of the World, whether his Justice was
spontaneous, or by necessity; for as yet he held the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> at parley,
and therefore was rather eyed, than much trusted: Albeit he was put upon
confidence in the Subjects discretion for aid of him in his continual underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings:
nor did they disclaim him herein, however chargeable it was; for all
seem willing he should be employed any where, so as not within the <hi>four Seas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is probable the King knew it, and therefore having made a Voyage
into <hi>France,</hi> he changed the Scene of War, but to the other side as it were
of a River, in hope his Lords would follow; but it would not be. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
him, and he them: nor would his Clergy allow him any aid <hi>Papa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consulto,</hi>
and therefore he outs them from his protection. These and his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
preparations by War, by summons not onely of his Knights, but all
other that held Land worth 20 l. <hi>per annum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walsing. 69.</note> and Taxes imposed by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
way, increased Rancor into a kind of State-scoul, little better than a
Quarrel. For appeasing whereof, the King granted a consultation upon a
prohibition, and unto both Clergy and Laity a confirmation of the <hi>Grand
Charter</hi> at the long run, and allowed it as the common Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and seconded the same with many succeeding confirmations, in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64112:77"/>
the twenty seven and twenty eighth years of his Reign, as if he had
utterly renounced all thought of a contrary way.<note place="margin">25 Edw. 1.</note> But the Statute in his
<hi>28th</hi> year had a sting in the tail that was as ill as his <hi>saving of ancient
aids and prisals,</hi> which was in the Statute of confirmation of the Charters,
though it were omitted in this Statute; for the saving was of such a sence
as time and occasion would move the King's heart to make it: and thus
this Statute became like a <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> a thing to still the people for the
present, and serve the King's turn, that he might more freely intend the
conquest of the <hi>Scots;</hi> which once done, he might, if he would, try ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
with <hi>England.</hi> But God would not have it so; the King in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had power to take, but could not overtake; and the <hi>Scots,</hi> like birds of
the prey, had wit enough to fly away, and courage enough to return upon
advantages: and so the King was left to hunt the wind, which made him
to return.</p>
               <p>He might now expect the applause of his people for his good success,
and the terrour of those that had stopped the broad way of his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Prerogative; and therefore looks big, rubs up old sores, and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Army yet in the field) sends for those Lords that would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him in his Wars in <hi>Flanders.</hi> All come and submit, and as it were
in so many words let the King know that all <hi>England</hi> is now tame, and
like to be ridden at his discretion. And now there's nothing in his way
but the fatal execration, which he feared, not in relation to God's anger;
but rather to the exasperated <hi>Clergie,</hi> and the dread of the Pope's dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thunder-bolt. To avoid this storm, he procures a Dispensation from
<hi>Rome</hi> to perjure and oppress without sin; a trick that he learned of his
Father, and hid it within his breast, till now about two years before his
end he brings it forth, to tell all the world that hitherto he had been
just against his will. But having obtained his purpose, he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
misseth of his end; for a new King of <hi>Scots</hi> (our old good enemies)
by divine providence suddenly crossed his way before him; and now it
boots not to contend for arbitrary rule in <hi>England,</hi> and lose the Crown
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he once thought he had sure; he faces about there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and having spoken fair to his people, for <hi>Scotland</hi> he goes. Thus
if all were not in a Parenthesis, the King intended a good period; but
God onely knows what his furthest reach would have been if he had
returned, for he was taken out of this world in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so left this
his government somewhat like an imperfect sentence.</p>
               <p>His Son <hi>Edward</hi> should have compleated it,<note place="margin">Edward 2.</note> but that he wanted his
Father's sence, and had too much of his Grandfather's superbient hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that meeting with a stiff spirit, and a weak mind, brought sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fire into the course of government, till it consumed it self in its own
flame. For this King having newly slipt out of a bondage of wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
under his Father, ran the wild chase after rash desires, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his former time in inordinate love, and his latter time upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
anger, little inferiour to rage; and so in his whole government
was scarce his own man. His love was a precedent of a strange nature,
that commanded him from all the contentments of his Kingdom to serve
one man, a stranger, and prostitute to all manner of licentiousness, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for some personal endowments. It shews that his judgement was
weak, and his affections strong; and in that more weak, because he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it before he was crowned: like some of the weakest of the weaker
Sex, the birth of whose minds are born assoon as they are conceived, and
speak assoon as they are born. It is true, that the bravery of spirit may
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64112:78"/>
work after absoluteness in Kings, under the colour of some kind of wisdom.
But it is one thing to rule without Law, and another to live without Rule;
the one dashes against the Law of an <hi>English</hi> King, and may put on the
name of Policy, but the other destroys the Law of mankind, and can bear
no better name than of brutish desire.</p>
               <p>All the while <hi>Gaveston</hi> was in view, we find nothing concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
or monument of Parliament, saving two Ordinances made by
the King, and such Lords as suted to the King's way, rather than to his
wants.<note place="margin">1 Edw. 2.</note> The first was that <hi>de militibus,</hi> the other <hi>de frangentibus prisonam;</hi>
for all the King's labour was to royallize <hi>Gaveston</hi> into as high a pitch as he
could, and so to amaze his own eye-sight with contemplating the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his person. So as <hi>Gaveston</hi> is become the Image of the King, and
presents his beams and influence into all parts of the Kingdom; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Aspect they often change and wane, and yet at the best
were but as in a misty night.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barons</hi> liked not this condition of State-Idolatry; they were willing
to adore the King, but they could not bow to an Image: they desired
nothing more, than that their King might shine in his proper glory. Thrice
is <hi>Gaveston</hi> banished, thrice he returns; the last occasioned another Civil
War, wherein <hi>Gaveston</hi> lost his head. Thus the Lords removed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
but (little the better thereby) they find it a vain labour to compel
the Sun to shine by force, when it hath no light. Though <hi>Gaveston</hi> be
gone, the mist of foreign Councils prevail; this was bred in the Bloud,
fed with Bloud, and ended in Bloud. Through the Glass of foreign
Councils all things seem of foreign colour; the King to the People, and
the People to him. The King at length begins to see himself underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
and that it began in himself; ventures himself into the Wars
with <hi>Scotland</hi> to win honour; goes with much splendour, but returns
with the greatest blot that ever <hi>English</hi> King suffered, confounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and slighted at home. For the bravest men, by ill success, are lost
in common opinion; or, to speak in a higher strain, where God doth not
bless, man will not. The King thus almost annihilated, catches hold of
<hi>Rome,</hi> fawns on the Clergy, passes to them the Ordinances of <hi>Articuli
Cleri,</hi> and <hi>de prisis bonis Cleri:</hi> which lost the <hi>Free-men</hi> no Right, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it concluded the Crown. And to caress the Commons, made
the Statute <hi>de Vice-comitibus,</hi> and the City of <hi>London</hi> likewise by the
Statute <hi>de Gavelletto.</hi> But God saw all sorts of men run at riot, and
sends in upon the Nation Plague, Famine, and other extraordinary Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his displeasure, even to the wonderment of other Nations; and
this brought a kind of sobriety into Affairs, made all sorts tame, and
for the present onely prepared them for better times. For the King's
time of longing again is come, and he must have new Play-fellows;
finds the <hi>Spencers,</hi> or rather was found of them; they grow in honour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
beyond the reach of the Nobles, but not beyond their envy; and
are more secure than <hi>Gaveston</hi> in this, that in their first sprouting the
King's Council served himself and them to keep in with the Commons by
making good Laws; such as the Statutes at <hi>York,</hi> of <hi>Essoyns, Attaints
of Jurors, Levying of Fines,</hi> and <hi>Estreats</hi> into the Exchequer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of
them promising good Government. The <hi>Barons</hi> nevertheless liked not
the <hi>Spencers</hi> greatness, and being by several occasions exasperated,
joyn in one, and occasion a new War: The King, aided by the
Commons (who yet thought better of the King than of the <hi>Barons,</hi>
whom they saw prejudiced rather out of self-apprehensions, than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64112:78"/>
the publick good) prevailed against the <hi>Barons,</hi> and made them the first
president of death upon the Scaffold.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Spencers</hi> are Lords alone, thinking themselves above the
reach of the once formidable <hi>Barons,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> too inferiour for
their respect. Thus lifted up, they take a flight like that of <hi>Icarus.</hi> They
had so much of the King's heart, as they could not spare any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to the Queen; and she being as loth to spare so much for them as they
had, retired with the Prince to a relief which they brought from beyond
Sea, and with whom both Lords and Commons joyn. The favourites
missing of their wonted wings, come down faster than they ascended;
and together with them, the King himself, all of them irrecoverably.
Thus favourites, instead of Cement between Prince and people, becoming
rocks of offence, bring ruine sometimes to all, but always to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>The King foresaw the storm, and thought it safest first to cry truce
with the people, and come to agreement with them by common consent,
for the extent of his <hi>Prerogative</hi> in certain particular cases questionable;<note place="margin">Prerog. Reg. 17 Edw. 2.</note>
and this summed up, became a Statute for future times, to be a <hi>ne plus
ultra</hi> between the King and people.<note place="margin">Stat. de Homag.</note> The like agreement likewise was
concerning services of Tenants to their Lords; and an Oath framed to
vindicate them from all encroachments. And something was done to
calm the <hi>Clergie</hi> for the demolishing of the <hi>Templar-Knights;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. Templar.</note> but the
wound was incurable; words are not believed, if actions do not succeed;
nor will Oaths now made to bind Kings, Bishops, Counsellors of State,
Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffs, or Judges, to justice; nor directions for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Courts, nor Ordinances against false Moneys and Weights, nor
all of them, settle the people; but they adhere to the Queen, burning
with jealousie against the King, and both her self and the Lords with
rage against the <hi>Spencers.</hi> The King flies, and being forsaken of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Lords, the Clergie, his own Son, and the Wife of his own bosom,
and of God himself, as the most absolute abject that ever swayed the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
lost the same; and being made a monument of Gods revenge upon
inordinate desires in a King, and of the <hi>English</hi> people, being enraged, not
long surviving his demise, he died a death meet to be for ever blotted out
of the thoughts of all Subjects, but to be had in everlasting remembrance
of all Kings. For if a Kingdom or Parliament misleads the King, at the
worst he is but misled by his Council; but if he be drawn aside by favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
he must thank his own lust: in the one, he hath but the least share in
the burthen; in the other, he must bear the whole.</p>

of the Peers:</hi> and of <hi>Simon</hi> the E. of <hi>Leicester</hi> to the same King, <hi>that
he lyed, and were he not a King, the Earl would make him repent his word;</hi>
and of the Lords, that <hi>they would drive the King out of his Kingdom, and
elect another;</hi> and of the E. Marshal to <hi>Edward</hi> the first, that <hi>he would
neither go into</hi> Gascoine, <hi>nor hang;</hi> and such other, do savour of passion (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
that of the E. of <hi>Leicester</hi> and the Lords) and may seem harsh
and unmannerly; and yet may admit of some allay, if the general rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the time, the King's injurious provocations, and the passions of
cholerick men, be weighed together. Yet will not all these trench upon
the cause, nor render the state of the Lords too high, or disproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their place in the policy of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as things
then stood: I say, it was not disproportionable; for where the degree of a
King was mounting up to such a pitch as to be above Law, the Lords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not their places in pressing him with their Counsels to conform to
the Laws; and in maintaining that trust that was reposed in them, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off such sinister Counsels and invasions as might violate the Laws and
Liberties, or hinder the current of Justice; concerning which I shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
state the case, and leave it to the censure of others. The Government
of the people of this Nation in their original, was <hi>Democratical,</hi> mixt
with an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> if any credit be to be given to that little light of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
that is left unto us from those ancient times. Afterwards, when
they swarmed from their hive in Forreign parts, and came over hither,
they came in a warlike manner, under one conducter, whom they called
a King; whose power, whatever in the War, yet in time of peace was
not of that height as to rule alone; I mean, that whereas the Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had the principal executory power of Laws setled in them, they
never were absolutely devested of that power by the access of a King;
nor was the King ever possessed of all that power, nor was it ever given
to him; but the Lords did ever hold that power, the King concurring
with them; and in case the King would not concur, the people general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sided with the Lords, and so in conclusion the King suffered in the
quarrel. From this ground did arise from time to time the wandrings of
the people in electing and deposing their Kings during the <hi>Saxon</hi> times.
Nor did nor could the <hi>Norman Williams</hi> shake off this co-partnership, but
were many times, as well as other ensuing Princes, perswaded against
their own minds and plotted desires. Nor can it otherways be supposed
where Councils are setled; for whereto serve they, if (notwithstanding
them) the King may go the way of his inordinate desire? If the Lords
then did appear against these Kings whereof we treat, in cases where they
appeared against the Laws and Liberties of the people; it was neither
new, nor so heinous as it is noised, for them (who are equally, if not
more entrusted with the Common-wealth than the King, by how much
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64112:79"/>
the Counsellors are trusted more than the Counselled) to be true, for the
maintenance of their trust, in case the King shall desert his. But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
question is concerning the manner by Threats and War. It is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
I grant, that the Lords used the one as the other; for it was the
common vice of the times to be rugged: yet if we shall add to what
hath been already said, first, that <hi>Knight-service</hi> was for the defence of the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> principally. Secondly, that the greatest power of <hi>Knight-service</hi>
rested with the <hi>Lords,</hi> not only in propriety and ownership, but in
point of direction for the benefit of the Commonwealth; and lastly, that
the state of the times now, was such as the Kingdom was oppressed by
<hi>strangers Counsels,</hi> and the <hi>Counsels of the Kingdom</hi> rejected; that instead
of Law, Garrisons of strangers ruled; that no man could own his own;
that the Subjects were looked upon as enemies; and of all this the King
made the principal instrument, who had ruled and over-ruled in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and so was resolved to continue. I shall leave it to the better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, what other healing plaister was to be had for such a sore.
Albeit it cannot be denied, that more due respects might have been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to Kingly dignity than was in those times practised: And yet there
was a difference also in the occasions of War; for certainly that last War
with <hi>Edward</hi> the second, was more fatal, and yet less warrantable; and
in the issue declared that there was more of the Queen therein than of the
Lords, who knew a way of removing Favourites from the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
removing the King from the Kingdom, or driving him out of the
World. In all which nevertheless, it cannot be concluded that the Lords
party was encreased more than in the former Kings times; for the loss of
the field in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time against the Prince, kept them in awe
all the succeeding Reign (although they were not then tongue-tyed) and
their second loss against <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, which was yet more sharp,
questionless quelled their spirits (although they lost no right thereby) and
encreased the Kings party much by the access to the Crown of the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of such as held of those Lords that were attainted or disinherited:
And yet by a hidden providence, the King was little the better when it came
to the pinch: For when <hi>Edward</hi> the second's Queen came from beyond
the Seas, though with but a small force, all forsake the King; neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the former terrour of the Army of a King, nor the right or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
nor Oath of Fealty, nor Promises, nor Laws, nor other Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and so the King becomes a prey to an enraged woman; or, which
is worse, to a jealous Wife: So little can the name of a King do, when his
person is despised; and so vain for him to trust in his <hi>Militia,</hi> that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
disarmed himself of the hearts of his Subjects. The sum then of
all the labours of the <hi>Nobles</hi> during these times will rest in this, that they
won the day, and yet lost the field: although they lost their own blouds
and Estates, yet they saved all to the people, and left Laws in force, able
to debate with <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the hand of any King that should succeed.
Thus stood the matter in fact upon such grounds as it had, the validity
whereof it is not my work to censure neither by the ballance of Law or
Gospel, but leave it as a sore time, that scarce will endure touch, nor bear
a King further than he was good or brave.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXVI. Of the state of the English Clergie until the time of Edward
the Third: And herein concerning the Statute of Circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
agatis, Articuli Cleri; and of general Councils, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synods.</head>
               <p>IT was a time of much action throughout the whole Christian State;
and <hi>Rome</hi> now having attained to its full glory, began to be eyed on all
parts, as an irregular motion crossing all affairs, that it may like the sole
Empress command all, and be controuled by none; and this wrought
some stirrings in <hi>France,</hi> complainings in <hi>England,</hi> and facing between the
<hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. 720.</note> How chargeable this was to the Pope's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
it is not material, but it occasioned, or was pretended to be the
occasion, of all the intolerable exactions ensuing; there being scarce
one year passed over without some extraordinary exaction levyed upon
the Church-men, either by <hi>Provisors, Tenths, Procurations,</hi> Levies for the
<hi>Holy War, Quindizms, Benevolences,</hi> or other such like; and where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was not to be had, by levies of Ornaments, or of rich Apparel, by
<hi>intimation, begging, perswading, commanding, threatning;</hi> and in this
course they continued till they had out-faced shame it self, and that the
whole Law of <hi>Rome</hi> became comprehended in this one, <hi>Quicquid libet
licet.</hi> In general therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be said to thrive
during these extorting times, although <hi>Rome</hi> did; for if the <hi>Laity</hi> were
pillaged by the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Clergie</hi> much more both by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>King:</hi> if
the one complained, the other cried: the one sometimes found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
from the King, but the other was helpless; for the Pope had no
Ears to hear, nor the King Hands to help.<note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> He neither durst nor would
cross the Pope, although the <hi>Clergie</hi> told him, that by these exactions
they were impoverished in such manner, as they were disabled to do him
service for their Lay-fees. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> becomes a burthen to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Members weary of bearing their Head. Hereafter must the <hi>Pope</hi>
beware of falling out with Kings; for the <hi>English</hi> Clergie now, though
late, see, that all is not Gold that glitters; nor is it any great priviledge
to be the <hi>Pope's men,</hi> further than the Pope will be a good Master, but this
was not to be expected. Popes were grown so excellent, as they could not
amend; and <hi>England</hi> so enamoured of them, as it is become their <hi>verè hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
deliciarum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> as the Pope called it, when he saw the rich vestments of the
<hi>English</hi> Church-men; and therefore they must now be contented to be
the Pope's viands as often as his hungry maw doth call, or otherwise they
must fall out. An excellent posture of affairs, and brave preparative to
dispose the hearts of all sorts for entertainment of the easie yoke of Christ's
government, which was now at the door, and ready to be revealed! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
poor and mean as the <hi>Clergie</hi> was, they had courage enough not
onely to stickle both with King and people for their own liberties, but also
to invade the liberties both of the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> having this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that they had to do with a King and people that were two; and
themselves well seconded by the Pope, that had no less power in those times
of publick distraction, and was bound to serve the Cattle well that yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him so much milk. The particular matters of debate may appear
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64112:80"/>
in their Paper of Grievances composed in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, and their
Resolutions thereupon:<note place="margin">Vid. Addit. Baronius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 1306.</note> their Complaints were renewed again in the time
of <hi>Edward</hi> the first (if we may give credit to <hi>Baronius</hi>) after the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Circumspecte agatis.</hi> To the end therefore that the whole may lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

in regard they sound much alike; and note the difference: all which
I shall do, to the end that it may more plainly appear what the <hi>Church</hi>-mens
Idaea was, and how far the <hi>common Law</hi> and King's <hi>Prerogative</hi> would
agree thereto.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>The Complaints are of this nature.</head>
                  <item>1. That the Church-possessions in their vacancies are wasted, and that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheators

unless upon security to appear before the Justices in <hi>Oyer;</hi> and sometimes

                  <item>16. Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> do imprison Clerks defamed for Felony, or otherwise

26. The King's prohibition passeth in case of Tythes and Chappels.</item>

               </list>
               <p>This is the sum of their Paper of Grievances; and because they found
the King either wilful or unconstant, they resolve upon a Remedy of their
own, by <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Interdiction,</hi> not sparing the persons of any
principal or accessory, nor their Lands, no not of the King himself: and
for this they joyn all as one man. Now what scare this made, I know not,
but <hi>Henry</hi> the third in the Stat. of <hi>Marlb.</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the first in his Stat.
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and other Statutes: the first spake fair, and seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
some of these complaints: as also did <hi>Edward</hi> the second; and yet
the Common Law lost little ground thereby.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Henry</hi> the third did, besides his promises of reforming, was
done in the Stat. of <hi>Marlbridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The successors of Abbots,<note place="margin">Marlbr. c. 29.</note> Priors, and Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall have an
Action of Trespass for Trespasses done nigh before the death of their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64112:81"/>
decessors, upon the Estates of their Corporations. And shall prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
an Action begun by their Predecessors. And also shall have
an Assize against Intruders into any of the Possessions belonging
to the said Corporations whereof their Predecessors died seized.</p>
               <p>This might seem a remedy provided against the first Malady complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, and questionless bound all but the King; and so might perchance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
somewhat the edge of that Article. But it being the Clergies reach
to grow rich, and the Pope's cunning to help on that Work, that they
might be as stores for supply of his Treasury; and had forbidden Abbots
and other Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the liberty of disposing their Estates by <hi>last Will:</hi>
Kings therefore as supreme Patrons to these bodies in their vacancies, used
to seize all the Estates of the Prelates, with the Temporalities, to their own
use, as well to preserve the Riches of the Kingdom to it self, and the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of such Corporations from spoil, as to be a cloke of their own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.
And under the Estates of the Prelates, or Heads of these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
all the Goods and Chattels belonging to the said Corporations
were comprehended,<note place="margin">Fits. Abbe. 25.</note> in regard that all was by Law adjudged to be in the
sole possession of such Head, and without whom all the rest were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but as <hi>dead persons.</hi>

                  <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour first exempted the persons of the Clergy from

and in some measure a provision made against the grievance in
the 39th Article before-mentioned. These amends we find made to
the <hi>Clergie</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, besides his confirming the <hi>Grand Charter:</hi>
And his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the first pursued the same course, especially in his

one that had power never questioned right, and the King above all the rest.
By means whereof, the Church-revenues were exceedingly wasted: for
remedy whereof, all Offenders are by this Statute made liable to fine and
imprisonment, and double damages in case of Action of Trespass; the

With due respects to the judgment of those grave and honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Law,<note place="margin">Co. 2. instit. 164.</note> it seemeth to me that before the making hereof, the
use was,<note place="margin">Stams. 130.</note> that if a <hi>Clerk</hi> was defamed, or appealed by an Offender for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
before Conviction, he was forthwith imprisoned. Nor could he
be delivered unto the <hi>Ordinary</hi> upon demand before <hi>Inquest</hi> taken, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
upon sufficient Security to endure the Tryal before the Judges <hi>itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;</hi>
which thing was not easie to be had for a <hi>Clerk,</hi> as times then
were. This Law therefore was made in favour of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that such as were <hi>Clerici noti &amp; honesti,</hi> should forthwith upon their
apprehending be sent unto their <hi>Ordinary;</hi> and those which were <hi>vagi
&amp; incogniti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. fol. 200, 206, 207.</note> should upon demand be delivered to be judged by their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
freely, and <hi>non expectatis Justiciariis quibuscunque.</hi> Such wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<hi>Clerks</hi> therefore the Clergy will have delivered before <hi>Inquisition,</hi>
if demand be made. Nevertheless, because the Indictment passed many
times before the Demand came; for by the fifteenth Article of the <hi>Clergies
Complaints</hi> foregoing, it appears that the <hi>Lay-Judge</hi> made more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
speed, for fear of stop: This Law provided that such also should be
delivered to their <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and that due <hi>purgation</hi> should pass before the
party were delivered; and in case the <hi>Ordinary</hi> neglected his duty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he was liable to a Fine or Amercement.<note place="margin">Briton. 4. f. 11.</note> Thus is <hi>Briton</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in this point; whereas <hi>Bracton</hi> speaking of such as are convicted,<note place="margin">Bracton, lib. 3. fol. 123.</note>
affirmeth, That if demand be made of such as are not indicted (for of
such he speaketh) they ought to be delivered without Indictment: I
suppose he meaneth by the <hi>Church-Law;</hi> for till this Statute the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judges practice was otherwise, as appeareth by the fourteenth Article
of the <hi>Clergies Complaint</hi> foregoing; and so by this Law, the fourteenth
and fifteenth Articles of the <hi>Clergies Complaint</hi> are answered.</p>

               </p>
               <p>With submission to the judgment of others, I suppose that this was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
principally for the satisfaction of the <hi>Clergies Complaints</hi> in the third,
fourth, and fifth Articles foregoing: and I am the rather induced hereto,
because as touching <hi>Elections</hi> into Temporal places of Government, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Laws are especially framed; such as are <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
whereof the one is <hi>West. 1. cap.</hi> 10. the other <hi>Artic. super Cart.</hi> cap. 10.
and no Law is especially made as touching the <hi>Elections</hi> of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> if
not this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordinaries</hi> having the Goods of the Intestate,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 19.</note> shall answer
his Debts.</p>
               <p>Originally the Goods of the <hi>Intestate</hi> passed by a kind of descent to
the Children: afterward by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Law, the Wife had her part; and
this continued all the <hi>Normans</hi> time. But now the strength of the
<hi>Canon-Law</hi> growing to its full pitch, after a long chase attached the prey.
In <hi>Henry</hi> the first's time they had gotten a taste; for although the Wife and
Children, or next of kin, had then the possession, yet it was for the good of
the Soul of the deceased; and the <hi>Ordinary</hi> had a directing power therein,
and so was in the nature of an Overseer, and somewhat more. Afterwards
in the time of King <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Clergie</hi> had drawn bloud: for though the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>
was as formerly, yet the <hi>dividend</hi> must be made in the view of the
Church; and by this means the <hi>dividers</hi> were but meer instruments, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64112:82"/>
the right was vanished into the Clouds, or, as the Lawyers term it, <hi>in
Abeyance.</hi> But in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, the Clergy had not onely got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the game, but gorged it: Both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> was now become
theirs, and wrong done to none but the Clouds. This was not well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
before <hi>Edward</hi> the first recovered part of the morsel, and by this
Law declared the use to be for <hi>the benefit of the deceased.</hi> And thus the
one was satisfied in having what he used not, the other, in using what he
had not.</p>
               <p>But these are but gleanings; the Law of <hi>Circumspecte agatis</hi> brings in a
Load at once: For the <hi>Clergie</hi> being vexed with the passing of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Mortmain</hi> (whereof hereafter when we come to speak of the
<hi>Clergies</hi> losses) they make grievous complaints of wrongs done to their
priviledges. And after six years the King is at length won, and passed a
<hi>writing</hi> somewhat like a grant of Liberties,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 194.</note> which before-times were in
controversie: and this <hi>Grant,</hi> if it may be so called, hath by continuance
usurped the name of a <hi>Statute;</hi> but in its own nature is no other than a
<hi>Writ</hi> directed to the Judges, in substance as followeth:</p>
               <p>Take good heed that you do not punish the Bishop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
and his Clergie,<note place="margin">Circumspecte agaits.</note> if they hold plea in <hi>Court-Christian</hi> of
things merely spiritual: for in such cases the Ecclesiastical Judge
hath cognisance, notwithstanding the King's prohibition.</p>
               <p>It is therefore neither <hi>Grant</hi> nor <hi>Release,</hi> but as it were a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that
the Clergy shall hold peaceable possession of what they had, upon this
ground, that the King's <hi>prohibition,</hi> hath no place in such things as are
merely <hi>spiritual.</hi> So as hereby the Clergy got a Judgement against the
Crown by confession, and an Estoppel, upon this maxime,<note place="margin">Circumspect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> agatis.</note> that <hi>spiritual
things belong to spiritual men,</hi> into which rank the King's person cannot
come: thus thought they; but what are <hi>spiritual</hi> causes, and why so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?
are they such as concern <hi>spiritual</hi> persons and things? this was the
old way: mark; but if we bring into this Category, <hi>Adultery, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Incest,</hi> &amp;c. we shall mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all. <hi>Linwood</hi> tells us, that <hi>mere spiritualia</hi>
are such as are <hi>sine mixtura temporalium:</hi> there may be somewhat in this,
though I cannot find it; nor can I make out the sence of the term any
other way, but to limit it to such things which by common custom the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Judge</hi> had cognizance of: for otherwise neither King nor
Law ever intended it to be expounded by the <hi>Canon,</hi> nor was it the intent
of this <hi>Writ, Law,</hi> or <hi>License</hi> (call it what you will) thus to conclude,
as the particulars following will manifest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fornication, Adultery,</hi> and such-like, punished sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the body, and sometimes upon the purse.</p>
               <p>These crimes the <hi>Saxons</hi> punished by the <hi>Temporal</hi> power, as I have
already shewed. The <hi>Normans</hi> continued this course, if we may believe
the Conqueror's Laws,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 14, 19, 371.</note> which gave the fine in such cases to the Lord of
the Delinquent. And it is confessed, that <hi>Henry</hi> the first and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
continued it; as the Clergies own complaint, just or unjust, doth
witness. And what course was holden in the time of King <hi>Steven</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> is to me unknown; nor is it much to be regarded,<note place="margin">M. Paris addit. fol. 201. art. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> seeing the latter
did he cared not what, and the former to gain the good will of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
regarded not what he did. The custom therefore cannot be made
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64112:83"/>
good for the <hi>Clergie,</hi> much less to punish the bodies of <hi>Freemen</hi> in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it being contrary to the <hi>Grand Charter;</hi> never asked by the <hi>Clergie,</hi> formerly, nor no complaint before now for denial: for my part therefore
I shall not apprehend it of a higher nature than the King's Writ, which in
those days went forth at random, if the <hi>44th</hi> Article of the <hi>Clergies,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
foregoing be true. It being so contrary to the common sence of
Parliament to give the bodies of the <hi>Freemen</hi> to the will of the <hi>Clergie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Circumspecte agatis.</note> to
whom they would not submit their <hi>Free holds.</hi> But the Writ proceeds in
enumeration of particulars.</p>
               <p>Reparations and adornings of Churches, and Fences of Church-yards.
Violence done to a Clerk, Defamation to reform, not to
give damage. Perjury, oblations, payments of Tythes between
Rector and Parishioner. Right of Tythes between two Rectors
to a fourth part of the value. Mortuaries due by custom. A
Pension from a Rector to a Prelate or Advocate.</p>
               <p>The most of which were under the power of a prohibition in the time
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who was King but yesterday, as the Articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
formerly set down do manifest. Nor had the <hi>Clergie</hi> ever better
Title than connivance of some such favourites as King <hi>Steven,</hi> whose Acts
may, peradventure, be urged against Kings, but not against the people,
unless their own act can be produced to warrant them. The learning, <hi>in the
Princes case,</hi> will (I suppose) admit of a difference: for it can never be
made, out, that the King's Council in Parliament was the <hi>Magnum concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Regni,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coke lib. 8.</note>
but onely the <hi>House of Lords;</hi> and therefore whatever passed
in Parliament by their onely advice might bind the King, but could never
reach the <hi>Commons</hi> nor their Liberties. And thus the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> in
the first conception was conclusive to the King, but was not the act of
the Parliament; because the Parliament cannot grant a Charter to it
self of that which was originally custom. And therefore this Law,
however countenanced, can never be concluded to be other than a
<hi>Permission;</hi> not onely because it was never the Act of the <hi>Commons</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> but because it is contrary to the liberty of the <hi>Freemen.</hi> And
it is beyond all imagination, that the <hi>Commons</hi> should out themselves
from the protection of the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and yoke themselves, their
Free-holds, and Estates, under the bondage of the <hi>Canons;</hi> nor ought
such a construction to be admitted, without express words to warrant
it. As for the conclusion, it is worse, and not onely dishonourable to the
King in binding his Arms from protecting his Subjects by the Common
Laws, and so in some respects making them <hi>Outlaws;</hi> but dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to it self, whilst it makes <hi>Prohibitions</hi> grounded upon Laws to be nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
by a late trick of <hi>non obstante,</hi> which was first taken up by the Pope,
then by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and by this King granted to the <hi>Clergie:</hi> and
thus are all set at liberty from any rule but that of <hi>Licentiousness.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
this Law did thrive accordingly; for we find scarce any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
in story of any regard had thereof till it became grey-headed. For
it was not long e're the King stood in need of money, and was necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to try the good wills of the <hi>Clergie</hi> more than once: this occasioned
them to be slow in answer,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. vit. Winchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> and in conclusion to deny that they should aid
the King with any more money, <hi>Papa inconsulto.</hi> The King hereupon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64112:83"/>
disavows the Clergy, and leaves them to the <hi>Romish</hi> oppressions, which
were many; and then the <hi>Clergie</hi> rub up all old sores, and exhibit their
complaints to their holy Father, to this effect:<note place="margin">Baronius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. an. 1306.</note>

let the Reader see that the Writ <hi>Circumspecte agatis</hi> was but a face put on for
the present, after laid aside, and the Clergy left to the bare Canon. They
likewise shew what the Clergy aimed at: and in that they did not obtain,
it was to be attributed to the resolution of the <hi>Laity,</hi> and not any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in themselves; for the Arch-bishop died in the service,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> and it is
thought that grief for these matters was no little cause thereof. But
the times within a while grew troublesome, and the King in pursuit of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64112:84"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Wars, being unadvised in his way, angred the people by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
levie of Men and Money,<note place="margin">Articuli Cleri.</note> as it brought forth a <hi>State-scoul,</hi> little
inferiour to a Quarrel. And to pacifie the <hi>Clergie,</hi> he granted them the
Writ <hi>de consultatione habenda</hi> in all <hi>matrimonial</hi> and <hi>testamentary</hi> cases,<note place="margin">Stat. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultat. 14. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</note>
which were of their least doubted priviledges; and this qualified the first
Article of complaint next foregowing, if such cause they had of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
and this was all that the <hi>Clergie</hi> got at <hi>Edward</hi> the first's hands.
<hi>Edward</hi> the second was a man that was neither well-affected to <hi>Rome,</hi>
nor weak in spirit; and yet so unhappy, that his way neither promised
good success, nor ever had it; and so he became a Servant unto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of his Servants, to keep his head above water; but especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was chased by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and quite out of breath, he calls for help
of all, but first of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and bespeaks them with the Ordinance
of <hi>Articuli Cleri;</hi> wherein he gives some satisfaction to the complaints
formerly mentioned, which it seems by <hi>Baronius,</hi> were exhibited in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

and Mortuaries, and to pecuniary recompence.</p>
               <p>In the first times, neglect or denial of <hi>Church-duties</hi> was punished in
the King's Court by <hi>Fine.</hi> Afterwards the Bishop was joyned in that
Work, and the <hi>Tythable Goods</hi> were seized; eight parts whereof were
taken to the Lords and the Bishops use by moyeties,<note place="margin">Ll. Alfred. c. 9. Ll. Edw. c. 9. Ll. Canut. c. 8.</note> a ninth part left to
the Owner, and the tenth to the Church. Nor had the Bishops any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Courts of cognizance of causes, till the times of the <hi>Normans;</hi> nor
as yet in those times had they power to all intents: For though it be true,
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribute of <hi>Peter</hi>-pence was allowed by the Conquerour's
Law to the Bishop's Court, yet we find no Law for <hi>Tythes</hi> and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to be recovered by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gul. 20. c. Spicileg. 180.</note> till about the end of <hi>Henry</hi>
the second's Reign, or King <hi>Steven</hi>'s time. For at a Council at <hi>London</hi> in
<hi>Henry</hi> the second's time, it was ordained, that three Summons in the
Pope's name should be made to such as payed not their <hi>Tythes;</hi> and in
case they then refused,<note place="margin">Binius, Tom. 7 fol. 661. An. 1173.</note> they should be <hi>Anathema.</hi> And after that time, in
a Council at <hi>Oxford</hi> under <hi>Steven</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> it was decreed,
that the <hi>Laity</hi> should be entreated first to pay their <hi>Tythes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Articuli Cleri.</note> and then if
necessity require,<note place="margin">Baronius, Annal. 1222. cap. 19.</note> that they should be compelled by <hi>Ecclesiastical censure.</hi>
So as their power crept up by degrees in recovering of Church duties, as
it did in Testamentary matters; and at length <hi>Henry</hi> the third, worn
and spent with the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> about his latter end yielded to <hi>Boniface</hi>
the Archbishop his importunate demands; and first gave liberty to the
<hi>Clergie</hi> to be their own Judges: and yet the Lay-Judges, although divers
of them were <hi>Clergie men,</hi> did not suddenly forbear, till this Law came,
which gave some satisfaction to the first and fourth Articles of Complaint
foregoing.</p>
               <p>Ecclesiastical cognizance extendeth not to a fourth part of
the Tythes of any Living,<note place="margin">cap. 2.</note> nor to pecuniary mulcts for sin, saving
by way of commutation.</p>
               <p>The Complaint of the <hi>Clergie</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, was against the
King's <hi>prohibition</hi> in case of <hi>Tythes</hi> indefinitely: for in those times, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in <hi>Edward</hi> the first's time, the King's Court had the cognizance of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64112:84"/>
all <hi>Tythes;</hi> and therefore in the Statute of <hi>West. 2. c.</hi> 5. the Writ of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit</hi>
was allowed in case of right of any portion of <hi>Tythes;</hi> yet the
Church still gained ground, and about, or before the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the
first,<note place="margin">Artic. 1.</note> the Temporal Judge had yielded unto the <hi>Clergie</hi> the cognizance of
a portion of <hi>Tythes</hi> under the value of the fourth part: for in the Article
next foregoing, the Clergies complaint was, <hi>that the Kings Justices held
cognizance of the fourth part;</hi> and here they were confined thereto by this
Law, which the Clergie could never remove.</p>
               <p>For violence done to Clerks the offender shall render damage
in the Kings Court; but Excommunication,<note place="margin">cap. 3.</note> Penance, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
shall be in the Bishops Court.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Canon-Law</hi> had an ancient claim to the protection of <hi>Clerks,</hi> both
as touching their persons and estates; and prevailed so far, as they were
thereby emboldened to offer violence unto others. But as I formerly
shewed, by a Law in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's time, the Temporal Judge resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his original power; and this became a sore evil between the <hi>Clergie</hi>
and <hi>Laity:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Articuli Cleri.</note> for though it were allowed that <hi>Clerks</hi> should not be sued but
before the Ecclesiastical Judge in such cases, yet it was no warrant for
the <hi>Laity</hi> likewise to be called before the Ecclesiastical Judge in such cases;
and therefore the <hi>Clergies</hi> complaints shew that the matter was doubtful,
and that the <hi>Lay-Judge</hi> generally maintained his Jurisdiction, although
sometimes he disclaimed it; as it may appear in the case of a Trespass
in the nature of a riot committed upon the Priory of <hi>St. John's</hi> of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in the seventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">Fits. Herb. 7 Hen. 3. prohibition 30.</note> when as it was adjudged
<hi>per Curiam,</hi> that it <hi>belonged to the Ecclesiastical Court to punish.</hi> But in
<hi>Edward</hi> the First's time, by the Ordinance of <hi>Circumspecte agatis,</hi> and
Articles concerning <hi>prohibitions,</hi> the difference was made between <hi>dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and <hi>pro reformatione,</hi> and the same affirmed by this Law; and so the
matter setled, and the fourth Article of the Clergies complaint in some
measure was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Defamation within Cognizance of the Ecclesiastical Court,<note place="margin">cap. 4.</note> and
corporal penance therefore, and Commutation.</p>
               <p>The words are general and peremptory, with a <hi>non obstante</hi> the Kings
<hi>prohibition;</hi> and yet the Law afterwards restrained the sence to <hi>defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
for crimes, or offences triable in the Ecclesiastical Court: and
this gave further satisfaction to the fourth Article of the Clergies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
foregoing.</p>
               <p>Tythes of new Mills may be recovered in the Ecclesiastical

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Tythe of Mills</hi> was a new encroached <hi>Tythe</hi> never mentioned in
any former Law of this Kingdom, nor demanded by the Synod at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64112:85"/>
next foregoing, it appears that the <hi>Kings Mills</hi> refused to pay this
<hi>Tythe:</hi> now whether the <hi>new Mills</hi> were called the <hi>Kings Mills,</hi> as being
made upon the publick streams by the Kings license; or whether the
<hi>Mills</hi> newly made within the Demesnes of the Crown, it is not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon; but it is evident, that till this Law made, the <hi>new Mills</hi>
would not <hi>Tythe</hi> their labours.</p>
               <p>One and the same matter may be tryed at the Common-Law,<note place="margin">cap. 6.</note>
after Sentence in the Spiritual Court, in divers respects.</p>
               <p>The great sore that was complained of, was, that the <hi>Clergie</hi> after <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
in the Ecclesiastical Court made, were proceeded against in the
Kings Court in case of <hi>breach of peace</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> as may appear out of
the 16th Article of the <hi>Clergies</hi> first complaints, and the 8th Article of
that taken out of <hi>Baronius.</hi> Nevertheless, the present Law subjoyns an
example of the questioning a <hi>Lay-man</hi> in the Ecclesiastical Court, in
case of violence done to a <hi>Clerk,</hi> as a matter which may be tryed in the
Ecclesiastical Court, and yet reviewed by the Kings Court.</p>
               <p>The Writ <hi>de Excommunicato deliberando</hi> shall not issue
forth,<note place="margin">cap. 7.</note> but upon evident breach of the Kings Liberty.</p>
               <p>This might be intended in satisfaction of the Tenth Article of the
<hi>Clergies</hi> complaint in <hi>Baronius,</hi> and the Tenth Article in the <hi>Clergies</hi>
complaint first recited; although that complaint both in the 10, 11, 12,
and 33 Articles, seem to be but clamour upon Officers, and not the
Kings Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Clerks Officers to the Exchequer are to be corrected by their
Ordinaries;<note place="margin">cap. 8.</note> and yet not tyed to residence during their attendance
on the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>This is in part an answer to the second Article of the <hi>Clergies</hi> last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
and a justification thereof, as a thing that is <hi>pro bono publico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Clergie-mens Goods shall not be Distrained either in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

purchase.<note place="margin">cap. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The complaint exhibited in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, and the 8th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
was only in ordinary personal Actions; but in the complaint made in
<hi>Edward</hi> the second's time, Article 12. is, that it is without cause that they
are so distrained. This Law yieldeth them somewhat, <hi>viz.</hi> immunity
from distress within their ancient possessions, which had been by ancient
custom priviledged; but yields nothing as touching their latter purchased
Lands, because they had no such custom.</p>
               <p>High-ways and Sanctuaries shall be free for such as abjure, so
as they shall neither be restrained from liberty,<note place="margin">cap. 01.</note> nor necessaries
kept from them. Felons may make free confession to the Priest
without danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64112:85"/>
The grievance in the 22th Article of the Clergies complaint in <hi>Henry</hi>
the Thirds time, and the ninth in that of the times of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. are
hereby relieved; provided that the Delinquent keeps himself in due
order.</p>
               <p>Houses of Religion shall not be oppressed with Corodies, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,<note place="margin">cap. 11.</note>
or entertainments of great men.</p>
               <p>This answered the grievance in the 42. and 43. of the first complaint,
and the 18th of the latter, and in effect little other than what was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
setled by <hi>West. 1. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Kings Tenant may be cited before the Ordinary out of
their own Town; and if Excommunicated for want of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">cap. 12.</note>
the Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo</hi> shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
               <p>A remedy this was against the grievances in the 12 and 33 Articles of
the first complaint, and in the 10th Article of the last schedule of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
And thus the Clergie have gotten the day of the <hi>Kings Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi>
which they had been striving for ever since the <hi>Conquest,</hi> as may
appear by what hath been formerly said; and now the <hi>Kings Tenants</hi> are
in no better condition than other men,<note place="margin">Articuli. Cleri.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> they may now be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
without the Kings license: nor is the answer <hi>Nunquum fuit nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
to be referred to the point of Excommunication; for that power was
denyed them but unto the citing them out of their own Parish, which
cannot be found to be denyed to the Clergie, by any thing that yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
               <p>A Clerk presented and found unable by the Ordinary,<note place="margin">cap. 13.</note> shall be
tryed again by the Ecclesiastical, and not the Lay-Judge.</p>
               <p>Although the fitness or sufficency of the party presented, is to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> yet the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> hath power in action
brought to enquire and determine whether the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> work was
rightly done; and so the 17th Article of the last complaint answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Elections shall be free.<note place="margin">cap. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws was of the same with this in the <hi>Stat. W. 1. cap.</hi> 5. which see
before; and it may be that the iniquity of the times continued notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and so occasioned the renewing of this Law.</p>
               <p>A Clerk having taken Sanctuary shall not be compelled to
adjure.<note place="margin">cap. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nor after confession of the Crime, or appealing others before
the secular Judge, shall be denyed his Clergie.<note place="margin">cap. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Although the Temporal Courts proceeded not so far as to pass sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against a <hi>Clerk</hi> that had taken <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to enquiry, as may appear by what was said formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64112:86"/>
the <hi>Stat. West. 1. cap.</hi> 2. and therefore though this Law in the
15th <hi>Chap.</hi> alloweth that a <hi>Clerk</hi> in <hi>Sanctuary</hi> shall enjoy his Ecclesiastical
liberty, yet the words <hi>legi Regni se reddens</hi> are interposed; and the reason
is, because the King upon Indictment found, had right to the Delinquents
goods,<note place="margin">7 E. 2. Fits. tit. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiture 34.</note> and profits of his Lands, until due <hi>purgation;</hi> and then his Lands
were by a Writ out of the Chancery to be restored to him again: nor
could any <hi>purgation</hi> regularly pass before the party was Indicted.</p>
               <p>No Religious House shall be charged with Tax to any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
without the Realm of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. de asport. relig. 35. E. 1.</note> nor shall send to any visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
out of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was neither at the request of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> nor act of kindness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto them; but for the good of the Kingdom, to prevent the
bleeding of the Treasure of the Kingdom into Foraign parts.</p>
               <p>Patrons of Abbies shall have their custody during their vacancies.<note place="margin">Mag. Charta cap. 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ancient Law, now revived by the <hi>Clergies</hi> consent, and
intended for the safeguard of the Revenues of the Houses, and their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and therefore it is with a <hi>sicut superius dictum est,</hi> cap. 5.</p>
               <p>The Goods of the Clergie freed from purveyance, unless they
will.<note place="margin">Stat. de prisis Edw. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was a favour given by <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> to gain their good will
after the death of <hi>Gaveston,</hi> the shameful defeat received in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
some particular testimonies of God's displeasure, whereof he began to
be somewhat sensible.</p>
               <p>Franchises holden by prescription or Charter confirmed, and
Tryals by <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> allowed to be in Eyer.<note place="margin">Stat. de Quo Warranto. 18 Edw. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was the common share of the great men, but especially of the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> to have their <hi>Franchises</hi> exposed to the prey of the Eagles, or to
such as hawked for them; and it is likely the King had not so easily for
gone his prize, if all the fat had fall'n to his own share: but perceiving
that more benefit came to his instruments than was meet, and himself
little the better thereby; he sacrificed his Judges to the people, but it was
to his own behoof, and so gained both credit and favour from the people,
and profit to himself; and in some measure satisfied the 48, 49, 50. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Clergies complaint in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and the
15th Article of their last complaint.</p>
               <p>Lands or Tenements aliened to a Religious house shall escheat
to the Lord,<note place="margin">Mag. Charta cap. 37.</note> if the alienor take the same back to hold of that
House.</p>
               <p>The ground hereof principally was the prejudice done to the Lord by
destruction of the Tenure, albeit that it had been an ancient grievance
complained of in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, <hi>That the Clergie were covetous, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64112:86"/>
swallowed down estates, and thereby weakned the Kingdom.</hi> But now they
are become even cheaters, serving the turns of treacherous Tenants, that
would give their Lands by compact with the Church-men, to receive them
again from them to hold of the <hi>Church;</hi> which was a liberty that men
thirsted after in those times, wherein the Church-men were more adored
than their Images.<note place="margin">Bracton, lib. 1. fol. 13.</note> It seems this Law was made after <hi>Bracton's</hi> time, if
that be true in the <hi>second Institutes:</hi> for he saith that a man may give his
Lands to any one,<note place="margin">Coke 2. Instit. super Magna charta, cap. 36. p. 74. &amp; 75.</note> whether Christian or Jew, or religious person, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall hinder it but the special reservation of the donor; and yet he
saith that such gift or grant taketh not away the right of the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
in his Tenure,<note place="margin">Bracton. lib. 2. cap. 10. fo. 27.</note> albeit the gift be in <hi>free Alms.</hi> Nevertheless it
seemeth to be such restraint, that the <hi>Templars</hi> and <hi>Hospitallers</hi> were fain
to find out a new way, which was to protect mens Tenements from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Law by levying crosses thereon, albeit the right of the Lords
was not barred;<note place="margin">Stat. West. 2. cap. 33.</note> and therefore <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. provided a Law to make this also
in nature of a <hi>Mortmain</hi> within the Statute made in the seventh year of his
Reign,<note place="margin">Stat. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiosis 7 E. 1.</note> called the Statute <hi>de Religiosis;</hi> by which it was enacted, that in
case of such alienations in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> should have liberty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if he failed, then the <hi>Lord Paramount;</hi> or if he failed, the <hi>King</hi> should
enter, and dispose of the same; and that no license of <hi>Mortmain</hi> should be
sued out, but by the <hi>mean Lord's</hi> assent; and where part of the premises
remain still in the Donor,<note place="margin">Stat. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortizandis terris.</note> and the original Writ mentioneth all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
And thus at length was this issue for the present stayed, which
hitherto wasted the strength of the Kingdom;<note place="margin">M. West. An. 1280. Mag. Charta cap. 39.</note> and by continual current
emptying it into the <hi>mare mortuum</hi> of the Clergie, consumed the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <hi>Knight service,</hi> by converting the same to <hi>Clerk-service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Judge shall compel a Free-man to make Oath without the
Kings command.</p>
               <p>So is the sence of the Law rendred by an ancient Authour;<note place="margin">Miror. Just. cap. 5. sec. 3.</note> and I hope
I shall not wrong the Text, if I affirm, that the Ecclesiastical Judge was
included within the equity, though properly he be not <hi>Balivus;</hi> for the
Law intends to shew that it is a liberty that the Subject hath, not to be
compelled to take Oath without the Kings especial command; and by
consequence it sheweth also, that the King at that time, and until then, had
the directory of Oaths; for it was an ancient Liberty given in the Kings
Charters unto such as they pleased, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>impose Oaths,</hi> and to punish for
breach of Oath;<note place="margin">Malmsb. de gest. Reg. lib. 2.</note> and this passed under the word <hi>Athae</hi> or <hi>Athas;</hi> and so
<hi>Edmund</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King gave to the Abbey of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> amongst other
<hi>Athas &amp; Ordulas;</hi> and the Church-men that first procured vacations from
Suits of Law during holy times, procured a Law also to be setled by
<hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King,<note place="margin">Ll. Ed. cap. 9.</note> and <hi>Gunthurne</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> that <hi>Ordeal</hi> and <hi>Oaths</hi>
should be forbidden upon the <hi>holy Feasts</hi> and <hi>lawful Fasts.</hi> And a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it is how it escaped the gripe of the <hi>Clergie</hi> so long, who catched at
any thing that had but a glance of Gods worship in it. And if this were
the Subjects Liberty, not to be compelled to Swear, surely much more
not to be compelled to accuse himself, unless by the Law he be especially
bound;<note place="margin">Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 7. fo. 106.</note> for it is <hi>Glanvil's</hi> rule, <hi>Ob infamiam non solet juxta legem terrae ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
per legem apparentem se purgare, nisi prius convictus fuerit, vel confessus in
curia.</hi> But the power of the <hi>Clergie</hi> now was grown strong, and they
begin to remember themselves; and that <hi>Oaths</hi> are of a <hi>holy</hi> regard, and
they men for <hi>holiness</hi> best able to judge when, and to whom they shall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64112:87"/>
be ministred, and therefore now they begin to enter their claim; and to
make a sure Title, they get a grant from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to <hi>Steven Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of a <hi>faculty of licensing administration of
Oaths during the time of Lent;</hi> and he accordingly enjoyed it during the
mad time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third. But <hi>Edward</hi> the first quarrelled it, and
left it questionable to <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, who being in his condition as
a lost man, had less care of such smaller matters, and therefore allowed
that his <hi>Judges of Assizes</hi> should be licensed by the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Oaths</hi> in their Circuits in the sacred times of <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Septuagessima:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. Eccles. 209.</note>
and this course continued till <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time. The <hi>Clergie</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus gotten the bridle, gallop amain: they now call whom they will,
and put them to their Oaths to accuse other men or themselves, or else
they are Excommunicated. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third withstood this course, if
the <hi>Clergie-mens</hi> complaints in the times of that King, <hi>Artic.</hi> 9. be true;
and notwithstanding the same, the Law holds its course; and in pursuance
thereof, we find an attachment upon a prohibition in this form ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Put the Bishop of <hi>N.</hi> to his pledges,<note place="margin">Regist. fo. 36.</note> that he be before our Justices, to
shew cause why he made to be summoned, and by Ecclesiastical censures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
Lay-persons, men or women, to appear before him to swear unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the Bishops pleasure, to the great prejudice of our Crown and Dignity,
and contrary to the custom of the Kingdom of <hi>England. And thus both</hi>
King <hi>and</hi> Clergie <hi>were at contest for this power over the peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
to which neither had the right otherwise than by rules of
Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bigamists shall not be allowed their <hi>Clergie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. Bigam. 4 Ed. 1. cap. 5.</note> whether they
become such before the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> or since; and that
Constitution there made shall be so construed.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever therefore their <hi>Synods</hi> in those times pretended against the
married <hi>Clergie,</hi> it seemeth by this Law that they had <hi>Clergie</hi> that were
married once and again; and yet before and after the Council, were
admitted as <hi>Clerks</hi> in the judgment of the Law. But the general
Council interposes their authority, and deprives them that are the second
time married, of all their priviledges of <hi>Clergie.</hi> It was it seemeth
twenty years and more after that Council, before the Church-men in
<hi>England</hi> were throughly reformed; for either some were still <hi>Bigami</hi>
at the making of this Law, or as touching that point it was vain; nor
is it easie to conceive what occasion should after so long a time move such
exposition,<note place="margin">General Councils.</note> the words of the Constitution being, <hi>Bigamos omni privilegio
clericali declaramus esse nudatos.</hi> Now whether this slow Reformation
arose from the defect in Law, or in obedience thereto, may be gathered
from some particulars ensuing. First, it is apparent that the <hi>Canons</hi> of
general Councils, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> had formerly of ancient times gotten a kind
of preheminence in this Nation; but by what means, is not so clear. In
the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, they were of no further force than the great Council of
this Kingdom allowed by express act. For the <hi>Nicene Faith,</hi> and the
<hi>first five general Councils,</hi> were received by Synodical confirmations of
this Kingdom made in the <hi>joynt meeting</hi> both of the <hi>Laity and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;</hi>
and during such joynt consulting, the summons to the general
Councils was sent to the King <hi>to send Bishops, Abbots,</hi> &amp;c. but after that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64112:87"/>
the <hi>Laity</hi> were excluded by the <hi>Clergie</hi> from their meetings, and the
<hi>King</hi> himself also served in the same manner; the Summons to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council issued forth to the Bishops immediately, and in particular to
each of them, and to the Abbots and Priors in general; by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they went <hi>inconsulto Rege,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bineus tom. 13 Ps. 2. p. 674. M. Paris.</note> and sometimes <hi>Rege renitente,</hi> and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either personally or by <hi>proxie.</hi> Others came as parties, to give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
direction, or hear Sentence in matters tending to spiritual regards.
And for this cause issued Summons even to Kings; as at the Council of
<hi>Lyons</hi> aforesaid,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1245.</note> it is said, that the Pope had cited <hi>Regis terrae, &amp; alios mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
principes, &amp; dictum principem,</hi> meaning <hi>Henry</hi> the third: the matter
was for assistance to the <hi>holy War,</hi> and to determine the matter between
<hi>Henry</hi> the third and his <hi>Clergie men.</hi> And as in that case, so in others of
that kind, Kings would send their <hi>Embassadors</hi> or <hi>Proctors,</hi> and give them
power in their Princes name <hi>interessendi, tranctandi, communicandi &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludendi.</hi>
First, of such matters <hi>quae ad reformationem Ecclesiae universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
in capite &amp; membris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bineus tom. 3. P. 2. pag. 913 &amp; tom. 4. p. 1. pag. 21.</note> then of such as concern <hi>fidei orthodoxae fulciamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
Regumque ac principum pacificationem,</hi> or any other particular cause
which occasionally might be inserted. So long then as Kings had their
votes in the general Councils, they were engaged in the maintenance of
their decrees; and by this means entred the <hi>Canon-law</hi> into Kingdoms.
Nor was the vote of Kings difficult to be obtained, especially in matters
that trenched not upon the Crown; for the Pope (knowing well that
Kings were too wise to adventure their own persons into foraign parts
where the general Councils were holden, and that it was thrift for them
to send such <hi>Proctors</hi> that might not altogether spend upon the King's
purse) allowed Bishops and Clergy-men to be <hi>Proctors</hi> for their Princes,
that in the <hi>Negative</hi> they might be <hi>pii inimici,</hi> and less active; but in the
<hi>Affirmative</hi> zealous; and so make the way wider, by the <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
vote</hi> joyned in one. Neither did Kings onely save their purse, but
they also made their own further advantage hereby; for by the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and respect which these their <hi>Proctors</hi> had in Councils, they (being
for the most part such as were had in best esteem) obtained better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the cause that they handled, and speedier dispatch.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless the case sometimes was such, as could not expect favour;
and then as the King's temper was, they would sometimes ride it out with
full sail, and to that end would either joyn with their Ecclesiastcal <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
some of the <hi>Barons</hi> and great men of their Realm, to add to the
cry, and make their affairs ring louder in the ears of fame (although
the Pope had the greater vote) or otherwise would send an <hi>inhibition</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their <hi>Proctors</hi> and their assistants; or an <hi>injunction</hi> to look to the rights
of the Crown,<note place="margin">Fox Mart. P. 2. 263.</note> as <hi>Henry</hi> the Third did at the Council at <hi>Lyons;</hi> and this
sounded in nature of a <hi>Protest,</hi> and (within the Realm of <hi>England</hi>) had
the force of a <hi>Proviso,</hi> or <hi>Saving.</hi> But if the worst of all come to pass, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the <hi>Council</hi> passed the cause against Kings without any <hi>Inhibition</hi> or
<hi>Injunction,</hi> yet could it not bind the Law of the Land, or Kings just Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
no not in these times of <hi>Rome</hi>'s hour, and of the power of darkness. For
at a Synod holden by Arch-bishop <hi>Peckham, An.</hi> 1280. the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lyons</hi> were ratified, and amongst others, a Canon against <hi>non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
and <hi>pluralities;</hi> and yet neither Council nor Synod could prevail;
for in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time an Abbot presenting to a Church vacant
(as was supposed) by the Canon of <hi>pluralities,</hi> the King whose Chaplain
was disturbed,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. Eccles. fol. 209</note> enjoyned the Abbot to revoke his presentation upon this
ground, <hi>Cum igitur,</hi> &amp;c. in English thus: <hi>Whereas therefore that Decree
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64112:88"/>
bindeth not our Clerks in our service, in regard that the Kings and
Princes of</hi> England <hi>from time to time have enjoyed that liberty and
prerogative, that their Clerks whilst they attend upon their service shall
not be constrained to undertake holy things, or to be personally resident on their
Benefices,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if this present Law be considered whereof we now treat, which
took leave to enact a sence upon a former Canon so long since made,
and (which is all one) to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a general Council (will or nill it)
to tread in the steps of an <hi>English</hi> Parliament, or (which is more
mean) to speak after the sence of an <hi>English Declaration,</hi> that had not
yet attained the full growth of a <hi>Statute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">30 ass. pl. 5.</note> as was then conceived; it
will evidently appear, that the power of a council made up of a
mixture of a few votes out of several Nations, or the major part of
them, being unacquainted with the Laws and Customs of Nations,
(other than their own) was too mean to set a Law upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Nation contrary to its own original and fundamental Law. And
as the <hi>Voters</hi> sent to the grand Councils from <hi>England</hi> were but few,
so neither were the <hi>Proctors;</hi> as may appear from this, that Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
out of his moderation, if we may believe it, and to avoid much
expence, as he saith, did order that the number of <hi>Proctors</hi> in such
cases should be few. But in truth, the times then were no times
for moderation amongst Popes and their Officers, and therefore it was
another thing that pinched; for multitude of <hi>Proctors,</hi> if their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
had not been moderated, might perhaps, if not prevail, yet so
blemish the contrary party, that what the <hi>Pope</hi> should get, must cost
him loss of spirits, if not bloud. And although the Bishops being
fast Friends to the <hi>Pope,</hi> by vertue of their Oath, did prevail in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the <hi>Pope</hi> had the controul of the Council: yet the exceeding
number of the <hi>Proctors,</hi> on the contrary, might render their conclusions
somewhat questionable in point of honesty, as being made against the
mindes of the greater number of persons present, though their <hi>votes</hi>
were fewer. To avoid this difficulty therefore, for more surety-sake,
the Popes enlarged the number of <hi>Voters;</hi> for whereas it seemeth to be
an ancient rule, that onely four Bishops should go out of <hi>England</hi> to
the general Council,<note place="margin">Hoveden. An. 1179.</note> in after-ages not one Bishop could be spared, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in cases of great and emergent consequence (as may appear by the
Pope's Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> Third) and the case required it: for the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Pope began to ring so loud,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1245.</note> as the holy Chair began to shake.
Neither did Kings confine themselves to any certain number of <hi>Proctors,</hi>
notwithstanding the Pope's moderation; but as the case required, sent
more or less: as unto the Council at <hi>Pisa,</hi> for the composing and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
that great <hi>Schism</hi> in the Popedom, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth sent solemn
Embassadors, and with them nigh eighty in all. But unto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Basil, Henry</hi> the Sixth sent not above twelve or thirteen, as Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
more particularly relateth.<note place="margin">Spicil. 215.</note> And unto the Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, the Parliament sent but six or seven, to remonstrate
their complaints of the extortions of the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> their <hi>Legates</hi>
and <hi>Emissaries.</hi> The sum of all will be, that the Acts of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
were but <hi>Counsels,</hi> which being offered to the sence of the Parliament
of <hi>England,</hi> might grow up to the degree of <hi>Laws,</hi> if the Parliament liked
them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, <hi>National Synods</hi> in <hi>England</hi> undertook the quarrel of
<hi>general Councils:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Synods.</note> for Arch-bishop <hi>Peckham,</hi> in a <hi>Synod,</hi> 1280. enjoyned
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64112:88"/>
the Constitutions made in the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> to be observed under a
curse, without consultation first had with the Parliament, or before he
knew whether they would be right or wrong. And before him <hi>Boniface</hi>
made Constitutions in opposition to the customs of the Kingdom; so
as the matter was now come to a kind of contest, whether <hi>Synods</hi> or
<hi>Parliaments</hi> should hold supremacy in doubtful cases concerning the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the Ecclesiastical and Temporal power. For henceforth Kings must bid adieu to the <hi>Synods,</hi> and sit no more amongst them; and
<hi>Synods</hi> now think themselves free to consult and determine what they
please, without speaking <hi>under correction;</hi> nor was there other remedy
left to Kings but <hi>threats,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rot. Pariiam. 18 <hi>H.</hi> 3. num, 17.</note> by <hi>Writs</hi> directed to the Bishops, <hi>firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

quod si fecerint, Rex inde se capiat ad Baronias suas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this prevailed so effectually, that the Bishops durst not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
too far, lest they should go beyond their guard; and therefore
they come and ask leave of the Parliament in cases that trenched upon
the Law of the Kingdom;<note place="margin">Stat. Merton cap. 9.</note> as they did in the case of <hi>Bastardy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they would have had their consent, <hi>That Children born before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
might be made legitimate by the Marriage subsequent.</hi> And yet they
could not prevail; for they were answered, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
notwithstanding that the <hi>Canon-law</hi> and the Laws of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
sided with them. And so they obtained not their desire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they still retained the Tryal of general <hi>Bastardy</hi> unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless the times were such, as <hi>Kings</hi> being too weakly assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the people, and the <hi>Clergie</hi> strongly seconded by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
they took advantage of those times of distraction, so as to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no farther obliged to the <hi>King,</hi> than the <hi>Pope</hi> and their own
covetousness would allow them: and to make all sure, they had set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it so far as they were able, by a Constitution <hi>that the Clergie
were not bound to aid the King Papa inconsulto:</hi>

in a Synod under Arch-bishop <hi>Winchelsie,</hi> Anno 1295. in the time
of <hi>Edward</hi> the First; and although the King prevailed in the conclusion
at that time, yet from the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the <hi>Clergie</hi> for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times granted their aids to the King by themselves, and apart from
the rest of the body of the Kingdom, and held themselves not bound

in their <hi>Synods</hi> were not obligatory unto the body of the <hi>Clergie</hi> in

               <p>That <hi>Reliefs</hi> were setled by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> hath been already shewed, and

               <p>The Law of <hi>Wardship</hi> may seem more anciently seated in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
than the <hi>Normans</hi> times;<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 6. c. 1, &amp; 4.</note> for if the Statutes of <hi>Scotland</hi> bear any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that Law was in <hi>Scotland</hi> before those times. The Lords were not
to have the <hi>Wardship</hi> before they were possessed of the <hi>Tenure,</hi> because it
was theirs as a fruit of the <hi>Tenure,</hi> according to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
distress, that it could not be in the power of the Lord to distrain till
he was possessed of the service.<note place="margin">Stat. Marlb. c. 6, &amp; 7.</note> And if by fraudulent conveyance the
Heir did hold the Lord out of possession, a Writ of <hi>Ward</hi> did lie against
him; and if he did not appear, the Lord might seize the Lands, unless in
case of <hi>Wardship, per cause de guard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:64112:89"/>
And in case the Lord would hold the <hi>Wardship</hi> longer than the full age
of the Heir,<note place="margin">Stat. Marlb. cap. 16. and Prerog. Reg. c. 3.</note> an Assize did lie against the Lord; for the Heir could not
enter without <hi>Livery.</hi> But if the Heir were of full age at the time of the
Ancestor's death, the Lord could not enter the Lands; and yet he should
have a <hi>Relief,</hi> and the <hi>primer seisin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the Heir entred the Lands before <hi>Homage</hi> done, he gained no
<hi>Free hold,</hi> though he were <hi>Knighted</hi> before, as this Law provideth. For
it may seem that these times of Civil War,<note place="margin">Prerog. Reg. c. 13.</note> brought forth a trick of <hi>Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
betimes, as an honourable encouragement for young sparks to enter
the field before they were compleat men of discretion to know whether
the cause of War was good or evil. And yet reason might induce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that he that was thought meet to do <hi>Knight-service</hi> in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
might expect the maintenance fit for the ability of the person, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the service.</p>

               <p>The first of these is the Law of common reason; for it is contrary to
<hi>Guardianship,</hi> to destroy that which by their office they ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
As touching the words of the Law, the <hi>Grantees</hi> are omitted in
the Charter of King <hi>John;</hi> and also their <hi>Assignees,</hi> albeit that doubtless
they were within the intent and meaning of the Law. The matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
plainly not onely the oppression of Lords upon their <hi>Wards,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the corruption even of the Law itself, that at the first aimed at the good
of the Publick, and honour of <hi>Knight-service,</hi> but now was degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the base desire of profit, by making market of the <hi>Wards</hi> Estates and
<hi>Marriages,</hi> that brought in strip and waste of Estates, and niggardly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the education and training up of the persons of the <hi>Wards,</hi> and an
imbasing of the generation of mankind, and spoil of times. Nor did these
times ever espy, or provide against the worst of these, but onely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to save the estate by punishing the wasters in damages by this
Law,<note place="margin">Stat. Gloc. c. 5.</note> and by forfeiture of the <hi>Wardship</hi> by a Law made in the time of

so had he the care of the <hi>marriage</hi> in such manner as the Ancestor

might have had if he had lived. For in case the <hi>Ward</hi> were stoln and <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi>
the Delinquent suffered fine and imprisonment. Or if the <hi>Ward

Lands till he have received the full value; and in case where one Tenant

These Laws were in use during the Reigns of those Kings,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 16.</note> although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be certainly concluded hereby, that the Wives portion properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Lord, as for his own benefit; partly because the <hi>Female-Wards</hi>
should have no advancement, if it belonged to the Lords; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because this forfeiture was given to the Lords in nature of a <hi>penalty,</hi> as
appeareth by the frame of the Statute of <hi>Merton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Widows shall have their Dower,<note place="margin">cap 8.</note> inheritance, their inheritance

               </p>
               <p>With due regard of the opinion of others, I shall propound my own.
It seemeth to me that the King is within this Law, as well as within the
former Laws of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and those of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that are of
this kind; and as he is within the compass of every Law of this <hi>Charter;</hi>
and that it is called the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> as most immediately coming from
the King to the people, and not from the Lords. Nor is there any ground
that the Law should intend to give liberty to Widows of <hi>Wards</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to inferiour Lords to <hi>marry</hi> whom they will, and that onely the
<hi>Kings Widows</hi> shall be bound. Nor did this suit with the contest between
the <hi>Barons</hi> and the King, that their <hi>Widows</hi> should be bound unto the
King,<note place="margin">Mag. Charta.</note> and the <hi>Widows</hi> of their Tenants discharged from their tuition;
and therefore I conceive, by the word <hi>maritagium</hi> is not meant liberty
of <hi>Marriage,</hi> but her <hi>Marriage-portion,</hi> or <hi>rationabilis pars,</hi> according
to the foregoing Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Customs. But as touching the liberty of <hi>Marriage,</hi> it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and expressed,<note place="margin">cap. 9. Glanv. lib. 7. cap. 12.</note> that the <hi>Widows</hi> shall not be compelled to <hi>marry;</hi>
nevertheless if they shall <hi>marry,</hi> they must <hi>marry</hi> with the Lord's liking;
otherwise he might have an enemy to be his Tenant, that might instead
of <hi>homage</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> prove <hi>Traitor,</hi> and be his ruine. Lastly, touching
the <hi>Widows dwelling,</hi> the Law thought it unreasonable that she should
immediately after the death of her Husband be exposed to be harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and therefore ordained that she might continue in her Husband's
house <hi>Forty days,</hi> if it were not a <hi>Castle;</hi> and then she was to have
another dwelling assigned to her, because by common intendment she is
not supposed to be a person meet to defend a <hi>Castle:</hi> and this was called
her <hi>Quarentine;</hi> which I meet not with amongst the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, and
therefore suppose it to be of <hi>Norman</hi> original.</p>
               <p>No Man's Land shall be seized for Debt to the King so long

The first part hereof, was the issue of the Law concerning <hi>elegit,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
observed in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; for the regard of Law principally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto the person, next unto the <hi>Free-hold,</hi> and lastly unto the <hi>goods.</hi>
The latter part of this Law was the Law of Pledges or <hi>Decenners</hi> in the
same times; unto which the Reader may resort for further light herein.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">cap. 11.</note> and other Cities, Burroughs, and Towns,
and the Cinque-ports, and other Ports, shall enjoy their ancient
Liberties.</p>
               <p>The whole Kingdom, and the Members thereof herein expressed, had
all their Liberties saved from the dint of <hi>Conquest</hi> by the Law of <hi>William</hi>
the first;<note place="margin">Mag. Char.</note> upon which, although some of the succeeding Kings did invade,
yet none of them made any absolute disseisin,<note place="margin">Seld. Spicil. fol. 192.</note> although disturbance in
some particulars. But King <hi>John</hi> did not only confirm them by his grand
Charters, but by particular Charters to each Corporation, with some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements;
and in his <hi>grand Charter</hi> inserted one clause which in the
<hi>grand Charter</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third appeareth not, which thus ensueth:
<hi>Et ad habendum commune concilium Regni de auxiliis assidendis, aliter quam
in tribus casibus praedictis;</hi> which if the barbarism of the <hi>Latine</hi> mislead
me not, is thus in <hi>English: And to have right of Common-Council, or to
be of the Common-Council of the Kingdom, for the assessing of aids, other than
in three cases aforesaid,</hi> viz. for <hi>redemption of their Captive King, for Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Kings Son,</hi> and for <hi>his Daughters Marriage:</hi> because these three
might be due by the Common-Law; the two latter by custom, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
by common right; although mentioned from the late disaster of
King <hi>Richard,</hi> which King <hi>John</hi> might with shame enough remember, and
expect the same measure from the censure of an unquiet conscience. I
shall not enter into debate concerning the omission hereof in the later
<hi>Charters;</hi> possibly it might seem a tautology. Nor concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
as if it did imply that the <hi>Burgesses had Vote only in cases of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
assesments,</hi> but shall leave it to the consideration of the Reader.</p>
               <p>No Distress shall be taken for greater service or other matter
than is due.<note place="margin">cap. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Distresses</hi> are in nature, no other than a summons in act, or the bringing
of a man to answer by seizure of part of his Goods; and it was used
by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as hath been shewed: and because the rich men under
colour of seeking their right, many times sought for wrong, and though
they could not prevail in the issue, yet prevailed so far, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
could not escape without charge and hinderance; therefore the Law
provided a Writ of remedy against unjust vexation,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 12. cap. 9.</note> which <hi>Glanvil</hi>
remembreth us of:<note place="margin">Mag. Char.</note> and yet because that remedy also carried with it
matter of charge and disturbance to the Plaintiff, and so the remedy
might be worse than the disease; therefore the Law defined <hi>distresses</hi> by
circumstances of person, matter, time, and place, under penalties of fine
and amercement,<note place="margin">Stat. Marlb. cap. 1.</note> besides the recompence to the party; first, it must
not be taken,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 9. cap. 1. &amp; 8.</note> but by leave from the Kings Court, unless in case of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
due by <hi>common right,</hi> and upon complaint made by the Plaintiff. The
King sent out a Summons in this manner:<note place="margin">Gloss. 215.</note> 
                  <hi>Henricus Rex Ang. Hominibus
Abbatis de Ramsey, salutem. Precipio quod cito &amp; juste reddatis Abbati Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino
vestro quicquid ei debetis in censu, &amp; firma, &amp; debitis, &amp; placitis; quod
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64112:91"/>
si nolueritis, ipse vos inde constringat per pecuniam vestram.</hi> And in all
cases of matters due by <hi>common right,</hi> the <hi>distress</hi> never was done in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
way,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 9. cap. 8. Stat. Marlb. cap. 2, 3, 4, 15.</note> but by Judicial Act in the Lord's Court. Secondly, no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi>
for suit shall be made out of the <hi>Fee,</hi> nor against any person, but such
as are of that <hi>Fee.</hi> Nor shall any <hi>distress</hi> be made in the King's <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
or open street, but by the King's Officer, and special Writ; because
<hi>distress</hi> is incident to service, and that is due as from the <hi>Fee:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by <hi>common right</hi> the same must be recovered from the <hi>Fee,</hi> and such as
owe service in the same; but the <hi>High-way</hi> or open street are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a <hi>Franchise</hi> belonging to the King, although the Soil haply may be
the Lords. And therefore it was an old Law, that they should be under
the King's safeguard,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae.</note> 
                  <hi>Sit pax publica per communes vias;</hi> and no violence
must be there tolerated but by the King's special Writ, which presupposeth
the especial notice taken by the King of the nature of the occasion. A
moderation also must be observed in the taking of the <hi>distress,</hi> for it must
not be excessive; and also in keeping thereof: for if the owner will, he
may <hi>replevy</hi> the same,<note place="margin">Marlb. c. 21. Glanvil. lib. 12. cap. 12.</note> according to the ancient course; and the Sheriff
must grant <hi>replevy</hi> if it be demanded, although formerly no <hi>replevy</hi> was
without special Writ; and yet that also not always readily obeyed: for
the times were such, as the Lords were bold with the King's Courts and
Ministers, and refused the order of the Law. Now in such cases wherein
the matter concerned contempt of the King's Authority,<note place="margin">Mag. Chart.</note> a Fine was set
upon the Offender; but in case it concerned onely a <hi>Tort</hi> done to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he was amerced: The one is called <hi>Redemption,</hi> because the penalty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
must lie upon the <hi>person,</hi> if it be not redeemed by pecuniary Fine;
the other is called <hi>Amercement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mircr. cap. 5. Sect. 3.</note> which is originally a satisfaction unto the
party wronged, by recompence out of the <hi>personal Estate</hi> of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
Thirdly, as touching the matter of the <hi>distress,</hi> it must not be of
<hi>Plough beasts</hi> or <hi>Sheep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Distric. Scac. Artic. Mag. Cart. cap. 12.</note> unless in case of <hi>damage fesant,</hi> if other <hi>distress</hi> may
be had; for the Law had a care of such Cattel as were most of publick
concernment, and which was the main stock of subsistence, so far as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
would allow. And therefore the unjust taking of any man's Cattel
by any person whatsoever, is liable to the same penalties that unjust <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses</hi>
are.<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 16.</note> Fourthly, concerning the using of the <hi>distress,</hi> it must not be
sold, no not in the King's case, till fifteen days be past, after it is taken;
nor must it be carried out of the County,<note place="margin">Marlb. cap. 4. Distric. Scac.</note> but it must be so <hi>impounded</hi> as
the owner may come to feed it; and it must be discharged if the owner
give security of satisfaction before the return of the Writ.<note place="margin">Artic. sup. Cart. cap. 12.</note> Fifthly, the
intent of the <hi>distresses</hi> must be that which is just, and therefore not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suit than by the Feoffment is due, or else by Prescription; and in case
many are joyntly seized,<note place="margin">Marlb. cap. 9.</note> the suit shall be by one, and the rest shall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.
Nor must any man be compelled to shew his Title to his Land by
<hi>distress.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">cap. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Common-pleas shall be holden in one certain place.<note place="margin">cap. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Office of Judge of the <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> was, in my opinion, distinct
and several from that of the <hi>Crown-pleas;</hi> nor though one and the same
man might execute both Authorities, doth it therefore follow that it
was by one and the same power; as if being Judge, he had thereby pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in all matters of the <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> and also of the Crown. For though
it be true that <hi>Bracton</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Capitales Just. nostri.</note> The King hath one proper Court wherein are
the Chief Judges, which both by his own Testimony, and <hi>Briton</hi>'s also,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64112:91"/>
did hear and determine Causes of all sorts; yet is it true also, that it was
by <hi>Appeal,</hi> or <hi>Writ of Errour,</hi> as in case of false Judgment; and that the
King had <hi>plures curias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marlb. cap. 20.</note> which doubtless had their proper work. And in
the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, it is clear that six were especially assigned for
the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> throughout the whole Realm; and yet by another espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Commission, or Letters-Patents, the same men might also have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to determine matters of the Crown, as at this day, in their several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits.
This Law therefore doth not, as I conceive, work any alteration,
but onely in this, that whereas formerly the Judges of <hi>Common-pleas</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on the King's Court continually, as all other Judges did; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King removed, they did the like, which was a great uncertainty and
grievance unto the Commons; henceforth they are fixed to a certain
place.</p>
               <p>Assize of <hi>Novel Disseisin</hi> and <hi>Mortdancester</hi> shall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the proper County onely,<note place="margin">cap. 14.</note> and by the Justices <hi>itinerant</hi>
sent by the King or his Chief Justices.</p>
               <p>The Law was so declared in <hi>Henry</hi> the second's time, and was question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
put in practice, so far forth as with convenience to the Judges might
be; but now the convenience of the people is preferred, and they must
not be brought up to the <hi>King's Court,</hi> but the Justices must come down
to them. And yet in case of difficulty, the Bench, where the <hi>Common-pleas</hi>
are holden, must determine the matter; and where the time in the <hi>Iter</hi> in
one County is too scant, the <hi>Remanets</hi> shall be adjourned over to be tryed
elsewhere in that Circuit:<note place="margin">Westm. c. 51.</note> which sheweth that the Judges <hi>itinerant</hi> had
their time proportioned out to every County. These Tryals also were so
favoured, as in the then holy times of <hi>Advent,</hi> and <hi>Septuagessima</hi> or Lent,
they might be tried; which although it was gained by Prayer made by
the King to the Bishops, as the words of that Law are concluded, yet it
shews that the Parliament had so much light as to hold the time not <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
holy,</hi> but meerly <hi>sequestred</hi> by the Will of the <hi>Clergie.</hi> The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
also in <hi>Mortdancester</hi> may be divers,<note place="margin">Stat. Gloc. c. 6.</note> if there be divers Heirs of one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor
by one Title. And if there be joynt-Tenants, and the Writ be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
but one,<note place="margin">Conjunct. feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. An. 34. E. 1.</note> and the same pleaded, the Writ shall abate; but if joynt-Tenancy
be pleaded, and the Plea be false, the Defendant shall be fined and
imprisoned. And if in the Action the Verdict be for the Plaintiff, he shall
recover Damages.</p>
               <p>Darrein presentment shall be taken onely in the common Bank.<note place="margin">cap. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Tryals in the <hi>common Bank,</hi> or other Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> have ever
had an honourable esteem above those in the County by <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all be equally available. This might be one cause why the Titles
of Churches were still retained at the <hi>common Bank,</hi> whenas all other rode
Circuit; for that Churches affairs in those times were of high regard.
Speed of Tryal also was not little regarded herein; for Justices by <hi>Nisi
prius</hi> properly were but for enquiry, till the Statute at <hi>Westm,</hi> the second
made them of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in the cases of <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">West. 2. c. 30.</note> and <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
presentment,</hi> and gave them power to give Judgment. And thus the
<hi>Commons</hi> gained still in point of conveniency.</p>
               <p>Free-men shall be amerced according to the degree of the fault,<note place="margin">cap. 16.</note>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64112:92"/>
saving to them their Free-hold, and to Merchants their main
Stock, and to Villains their Waynage; and Clergie-men shall be
amerced according to their Lay-fee. Barons shall be amerced by
their Peers, others by the Vicinage.</p>
               <p>In this, regard is to be had first of the persons that are to be <hi>amerced,</hi>
then of the parties by whom, and lastly, of the nature and quantity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercements.</hi>
The persons <hi>amerced</hi> are ranked into four Classes; <hi>Barons,
Clergie, Free-men,</hi> and <hi>Villains.</hi> But in regard of the parties by whom
they are to be <hi>amerced,</hi> they are but two; <hi>Barons,</hi> and <hi>Free-men;</hi> for the
<hi>Clergie, Villains,</hi> and <hi>Free-men,</hi> are to be <hi>amerced</hi> by the <hi>Free-men</hi> of the
Neighbourhood. In what Courts these <hi>Amercements</hi> shall be, the Stat.
<hi>Marlbr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marlb. cap. 19.</note> tells us, not before the <hi>Escheator,</hi> nor other that make enquiry by
Commission or Writ, nor before the Justices of Assize, or <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
but onely before the Chief Justices, or Justices <hi>itinerant.</hi> The Statute
of <hi>Westminster</hi> adds a fifth Classis of Cities and Towns,<note place="margin">Westm. 1. c. 6.</note> by express words;
which seems not so necessary, unless in pillaging and oppressing times: for
they were taken to be within the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. sect. 4.</note> though not
therein named. The rule of the quantity of <hi>Amercements</hi> is now set down
in general, and left to the discretion of the <hi>Peers</hi> or Vicinage, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
by the <hi>Saxons</hi> were specially set down in the Law. The rule in
general is with a <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> viz. not <hi>further or more than that the party
amerced may spare, and yet hold on in the maintenance of his course, according
to his degree.</hi> And it must be also according to the quantity of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
for the greatest <hi>Amercements</hi> must not be ranked with the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences:
so as in every degree the main sustenance of the party is saved;
yea, the <hi>Villains</hi> (however mean they be) they must have their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
And this sheweth that <hi>Villains</hi> had a maintenance, which was
under the protection of the Law, and not under the gripe of their Lords
to all intents, unless they were the <hi>Kings Villains,</hi> who it seemeth were
meerly under the Kings mercy, as being both their Lord and King, against
whom they could hold nothing as properly their own. And therefore in
all other cases, even then the <hi>Villains</hi> were born under a kind of liberty, as
in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time formerly hath been declared; which the Law protected
against their own Lords.</p>
               <p>No man shall be compelled to make, repair, or maintain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bridges,<note place="margin">cap. 17. &amp; 18.</note> Banks, or Causies, other or otherwise, than they
were wont to be made, repaired, or maintained in the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the second.</p>
               <p>The limitation to the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, sheweth that his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
was such as maintained the common rights of men; but in the times
of <hi>Richard</hi> the first,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 5. sect. 2.</note> and more especially of King <hi>John,</hi> those Rivers, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Fishings formerly used in common, were encroached upon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
and appropriated to particular mens uses; which occasioned many
Bridges, Banks, and Causies to be made and repaired, to the great charge of
private men: all which are discharged by this Law.</p>
               <p>No Sheriff,<note place="margin">cap. 19.</note> Constable, Coroner, or other Bayliff, shall hold any
Pleas of the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:64112:92"/>
                  <hi>Escheators</hi> are also expressed in the old books of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the
Abridgements, however it seemeth that it is within the intent of the Law,
which was made to avoid the extraordinary oppression that these Officers
exercised upon the people. For <hi>Escheators,</hi> under colour of inquiry of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of men, would enquire of matters concerning the lives of men; and
Sheriffs that had power of Tryals in cases of Theft,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 8. Glanvil. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> as hath been already
shewn, abused the same for their own benefit, because in such cases they
had the forfeitures. This Law therefore takes away such occasions, <hi>viz.</hi>
from the Sheriffs and Coroners, and Bayliffs or Justices (other than by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
commission thereto assigned) all power to hold Pleas of the Crown
by tryal, leaving unto them nevertheless, power of enquiry, of which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
they had the right.</p>
               <p>If the Kings Tenant dieth supposed in arrear,<note place="margin">cap. 20.</note> an Inventory
shall be made of his Stock by honest men, but it shall not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
till Accounts be cleared; and the overplus shall go to the
Executors, saving to the Wife and Children their reasonable part.</p>
               <p>The first clause hereof was a Law in <hi>Henry</hi> the first's time, and a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Law in <hi>Henry</hi> the second's time,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 5.</note> being a remedy against an old <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Riot of the Lord's seizure of the whole personal Estate of the party
deceased, under colour of a Law. The second part concerning the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,
hath this additional subjoyned in the Charter of King <hi>John: If any
Free man die intestate, his Chattels shall be divided by his Parents and his
Friends in the presence of the Church, saving to every one their proper debts.</hi>
And thus since the Conquest, the Church-men encroached by degrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great power in matters <hi>Testamentary;</hi> I say by degrees: for as yet by
this Law it appeareth, that they were but Overseers or Eye-witnesses; for
as yet right of ordering or disposing they had none, as may appear in that
case of a <hi>Bastard</hi> dying without Issue and <hi>intestate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 16.</note> the Lord shall have
his personal Estate: And in all cases the Executor had then nothing but
bare <hi>Assets,</hi> and the overplus was assigned between the Wife and Children,
according to their reasonable part. Or if the party died <hi>intestate,</hi> the
next friends did administer, paying the Debts, and making Dividend of
the overplus into the <hi>reasonable parts;</hi> according to the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
still continued.<note place="margin">Coke Instit. 2. page 33.</note> Nor doth the testimony cited out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> prove
any other than that the Ancestor hath free power to order his Estate as he
pleaseth, and that the Children shall have no more than is left unto them
by their Ancestor, either in his Will, or in case of dying <hi>intestate,</hi> by the
custom or Law, which is, and ever, was the <hi>rationabilis pars.</hi>

               <p>No purveyance for any Castle out of the same Town where the
Castle is,<note place="margin">cap. 21.</note> but present satisfaction must be made: and if in the
same Town, satisfaction must be made within forty days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purveyance</hi> was ancient provision for the necessities of the publick,
and so far was commendable, seeing it is not the common case of all
men to regard the publick above their own private interest; therefore
the publick must provide for it self, by their means in whom the publick
is most concerned. And this was in those elder times, but in two cases;
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Castles;</hi> in the one of which the Government is
principally concerned, in the other the publick defence. For it may
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64112:93"/>
be well conjectured, that <hi>Castles</hi> were either first made in places commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
for habitation, and great Towns gathered to them for their better
safety; or that the Towns were first gathered in places of commodious
habitation, and then <hi>Castles</hi> were made for their better defence. Or if
they were imposed upon them by the Victor to keep them in awe, they
were nevertheless by continuance together become tractable, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the mutual defence of each other. But as touching such Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
or <hi>Castles</hi> that were set in solitary places, they may seem rather first
intended for the particular defence of some particular Man and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and neighbouring Tenants; and therefore in the <hi>purveyance</hi> for
<hi>Castles,</hi> it seems the proper Town wherein it is, principally liable to that
duty, because their safety is more principally interested: and therefore
<hi>Prizes</hi> there taken, may be paid at a day to come; but in all other places
immediately. Nevertheless this lasted not long; for the Souldiers found
out a trick of favouring their own Quarters, and preserving them in heart
against a back Winter, knowing that at such times it is better to seek for
provision nigh, than to be compelled to seek far off. But this Stratagem was
cut off by the next King, who inhibited all manner of <hi>purveyance</hi> in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Town,<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 7.</note> than in the same Town wherein the <hi>Castle</hi> is seated. This was
a charge that was but Temporary and occasional: That which was more
lasting and burthensome upon the Subjects, was <hi>purveyance</hi> for the King;
which nevertheless cannot be avoided, by reason of the greatness of his
Retinue, especially in those days; and if they should have their resort to
the Market, the same could not be free to the people, for that the first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
must be for the Kings Houshold, and so what scraps will be left for the
<hi>Commons,</hi>

to be maintained by <hi>purveyance;</hi> and to avoid the many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
which might and did arise in those spoiling times, It was ordained,
1. <hi>That it should be Felony for any Purveyor to purvey without Warrant.</hi>
2. <hi>That none but the Kings Purveyor must purvey for the Kings house, and
that he must purvey onely for the Kings house; and to purvey no more than is
necessary; and to pay for the things they take.</hi> And because Kings were
oftentimes necessitated for removal from place to place, <hi>purveyance</hi> of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was also allowed:<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 32.</note> And in case the Subjects were grieved, either by
more <hi>purveyance</hi> than was necessary, or by non-payment for the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
so taken, or with composition for the Kings debts; for such <hi>purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
the Offenders were liable to fine and imprisonment.<note place="margin">Artic. super cart. cap. 2.</note> Or if they were
grieved by <hi>Purveyors</hi> without Warrant, the Offender was to be proceeded

               <p>He that serveth in Castle-guard,<note place="margin">cap. 22.</note> is not liable to payment of

be is in the service in the Army.</p>
               <p>By the ancient custom none but a <hi>Knight</hi> might be charged with the
guard of a <hi>Castle</hi> belonging to the King, for the letter of this Law mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
onely such; and therefore to hold by <hi>Castle-guard,</hi> is a Tenure in
<hi>Knight-service.</hi> And it seemeth that Rent for <hi>Castle-guard</hi> originally was
consistent with <hi>Knight-service,</hi> and that it was not annual, but promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Knights might either perform the service, or pay Rent in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and upon occasion did neither, if the King sent them into the field.
And lastly, that a <hi>Knight</hi> might either do the service in his own person, or

Institutes upon this Law; and this was to the detriment of the <hi>Free-men,</hi>
especially of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in regard that all <hi>Free-men</hi> were to
have right of free passage through Rivers, as well as through Highways;
and <hi>purprestures</hi> in either were equally noxious to the common liberty.
And therefore that which is set down under the example or instance of the

It seemeth that it was one of the oppressions in those times, that if a
Suit were commenced in the inferiour or Lords Court, concerning a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
a Writ of <hi>precipe in capite</hi> might be had, upon a Surmise that the
<hi>Freehold</hi> was holden in <hi>capite;</hi> which might prove an absolute destruction
to the inferiour Court, and was the spoil of the Demandants case: and
therefore I think the Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> instead of the word <hi>Court,</hi> hath
the word <hi>Cause.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Law of <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> was anciently established amongst

                  <note place="margin">Ll. Edgar. c. 8.</note> as formerly hath been shewed, and continued in the <hi>Normans</hi>

the <hi>measure of the breadth of Cloaths,</hi> although it might seem to abridge
the liberty of particular persons, yet because it was prejudicial to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Trade of the Kingdom, it was setled in this manner to avoid deceit,
and to establish a known price of Cloaths. And it seemeth that Wine was
ordinarily made in <hi>England</hi> as well as Ale; otherwise the Measures of
Wine could not have been established by a Law in <hi>England,</hi> if they had

               </p>
               <p>This was a Law of latter original, made to take away a <hi>Norman</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
for by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Law, as hath been already noted, <hi>No man was
imprisoned for Crime (not bailable) beyond the next County-court or Sheriff's
Torn:</hi> but when those rural Courts began to lose their power, and the
Kings Courts to devour Tryals of that nature, especially by the means of
the Justices <hi>itinerant,</hi> which were but rare, and for divers years many
times intermitted; during all which time, supposed Offenders must lie
in Prison; which was quite contrary to the liberty of the <hi>Free men</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Saxons:</hi> This occasioned a new device to save the common
liberty by special Writs sued out by the party imprisoned or under bail,
supposing himself circumvented by hatred and malice; and by the same
directed to the Sheriff and others, an Inquisition was taken, and Tryal
made of the Offence, whether he deserved <hi>loss of Life or Member;</hi> and
if it were found for the supposed Offender, he was bailed till the next
coming of the Justices: and for this the Writ was called the <hi>Writ of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of Life or Member;</hi> and sometimes the Writ <hi>de odio &amp; atia.</hi> But
these <hi>Inquests</hi> were soon become degenerate, and subject to much corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore as soon met with a countercheck from the Law: Or
first rather a regulation;<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 11.</note> for it was ordained, that <hi>the Inquest should be
chosen upon Oath;</hi> and <hi>that two of the Inquest at least should be Knights,</hi> and
those <hi>not interessed in the Cause.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Glocest. cap. 9.</note> But yet this could not rectifie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for it seemed so impossible to do Justice and shew Mercy this way,
that the Writ is at length taken away, and men left to their lot till the
coming of Justices <hi>itinerant.</hi> But this could not be endured above seven
years;<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 29.</note> for though the King be a brave Souldier, and prosperous, yet
the people overcome him, and recover their Writs <hi>de odio &amp; atia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

King; unless they held of him in <hi>Knight-service,</hi> which was a service done
by the Tenant's own person, or by the person of his <hi>Esquire,</hi> or other
deputy in his stead. But as touching such service as was wont to be done
to him by render, or serving him with Arms, or other utensils; this was
no Knight-service,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 7. cap. 9.</note> though such utensils concerned War, but was called
<hi>Petit Serjeanty,</hi> as in the Law-books doth appear. Nevertheless <hi>Henry</hi>

               <p>No Judge shall compel a Free-man to confess matter against
himself upon Oath,<note place="margin">cap 30.</note> without complaint first made against him.
Nor shall receive any complaint without present proof.</p>
               <p>This Law in the Original is set down in another kind of phrase in the
first part thereof, which is obscure by reason thereof: in express words
it is thus; <hi>No Judge shall compel any man ad legem manifestam;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,
that the matter was otherwise obscure, if the party that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, or suspected, did not <hi>manifest</hi> the same by his own declaring
of the truth, or matter enquired after; and therefore they used in such
cases to put him to Oath, and if he denied the matter, or acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Judge would sometimes discharge him, or otherwise put him to
his Compurgators; and this was called <hi>lex manifesta,</hi> or <hi>lex apparens.</hi>
And it was a trick first brought in by the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and the Temporal
Judges imitated them therein; and this became a snare and sore burthen
to the Subjects. To avoid which, they complain of this new kind of
Trial; and for remedy of this usurpation, this Law reviveth and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
the onely and old way of Trial;<note place="margin">Bracton f. 106.</note> for <hi>Glanvil</hi> saith, <hi>Ob infamiam
non solet juxta legem terrae aliquis per legem apparentem se purgare, nisi pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
convictus fuerit vel confessus in curia:</hi> and therefore no man ought to
be urged upon such difficulties, unless by the express Law of the Land.
The old way of Trial was, first to bring in a Complaint, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
ready to maintain the same; and therefore both <hi>Appeals</hi> and
<hi>Actions</hi> then used to conclude their <hi>pleas</hi> with the names of Witnesses
subjoyned, which at this day is implied in those general words, in their
conclusions, <hi>Et inde producit sectam suam;</hi> that is, he brings his <hi>sect</hi> or
<hi>suit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seld. super Hengham.</note> or <hi>such as do follow or affirm his complaint;</hi> as another part also is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in those words, <hi>Et hoc paratus est verificare.</hi> For if the Plaintiffs <hi>sect</hi>
or <hi>suit</hi> of Witnesses did not fully prove the matter in fact, the Defendant's
<hi>Averment</hi> was made good by his own <hi>Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Oaths of Twelve men,</hi>
and so the Trial was concluded.</p>

This is a comprehensive Law, and made up of many <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; or
rather an enforcement of all Laws, and a remedy against oppression, past,
present, and to come. And concerneth first the <hi>person,</hi> then his <hi>livelihood;</hi>
as touching the <hi>person, his life,</hi> and his <hi>liberty;</hi> his <hi>life</hi> shall be under the
protection of the Law, and his <hi>liberty</hi> likewise, so as he shall be shut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
no place by Imprisonment, nor out of any place by Banishment; but
shall have liberty of ingress and egress. His <hi>Estate</hi> both real and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
shall also be under the protection of the Law; and the Law also
shall be free, neither <hi>denied</hi> nor <hi>delayed.</hi> I think it needless to shew how
this was no new Law, but a confirmation of the old, and reparation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereto, being much impaired by stormy times; for the sum of all
the foregoing discourse tendeth thereto.</p>
               <p>Merchants shall have free and safe passage,<note place="margin">cap. 32.</note> and trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
unjust Taxes, as by ancient custome they ought. In time of
War, such as are of the Enemies Countries shall be secured till
it appear how the English Merchants are used in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>That this was an ancient Law, the words thereof shew, besides what
may be observed out of the Laws of <hi>Aetheldred,</hi> and other <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws.
So as it appeareth, that not onely the <hi>English Free-men</hi> and Natives had
their liberties asserted by the Law, but also Forreiners, if Merchants, had
the like liberties for their persons and goods, concerning Trade, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the same; and were hereby enabled to enjoy their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of the Law, as the <hi>Free-men</hi> had. And unto this Law
the <hi>Charter</hi> of King <hi>John</hi> added this ensuing.</p>
               <p>It shall be lawful for every Freeman to pass freely to and from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
saving Fealty to the King, unless in time of War; and then also for a
short space, as may be for the common good, excepting Prisoners, Outlaws, and
those Country-men that are in enmity, and Merchants, who shall be dealt with
as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And it seemeth that this Law of <hi>free passage</hi> out of the Kingdom, was
not anciently fundamental, but onely grounded upon <hi>reason of State,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Freemen</hi> have liberty of free passage within the Kingdom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that original Law, <hi>Sit pax publica per communes vias;</hi> and for
that cause, as I suppose, it was wholly omitted in the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third; as was also another Law concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it left an influence behind it, (after the <hi>Jews</hi> were extinct in this
Nation) and which continueth even unto this day, I shall insert it in this
short sum:</p>
               <p>After death of the <hi>Jew's</hi> debtor, no usury shall be paid during the minority
of the Heir, though the debt shall come into the King's hand. And the debt
shall be paid, saving to the Wife her Dower and maintenance for the Children,
according to the quantity of the Debtors Land, and saving the Lord's service;
and in like manner of debts to others.</p>
               <p>The whole doctrine of <hi>Vsury</hi> fell under the Title of <hi>Jews;</hi> for it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it was their Trade, and their proper Trade hitherto. It was first
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64112:95"/>
that I met with,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mag. Char.</hi> Concil. Brit. 299.</note> forbidden at a <hi>Legatine Council</hi> nigh 300 years before
the <hi>Normans</hi> times: but by the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Law it was made penal to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
to the forfeiture of Estate, and Banishment; and therefore the <hi>Jews</hi>
and all their substance were holden to be in nature of the <hi>King Villains,</hi>
as touching their Estate;<note place="margin">Ibid. 623. Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 16.</note> for they could get nothing, but was at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And Kings did suffer them to continue this Trade for their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
yet they did regulate it as touching Infants, as by this Law of
King <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1229. Merton cap. 5.</note> and the Statute at <hi>Merton,</hi> doth appear. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Third
did not put it into his <hi>Charter,</hi> as I think, because it was no liberty of the
Subjects,<note place="margin">Stat. de Judais. An. 18. E. 1.</note> but rather a prejudice thereto; and therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the First
wholly took it away by a Statute made in his time, and thereby abolished
the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenants Lands,<note place="margin">cap. 33.</note> holden of Lands escheated to the King, shall
hold by the same services as formerly.</p>
               <p>In all alienations of Lands,<note place="margin">cap. 34.</note> sufficient shall be left for the Lords
distress.</p>
               <p>Submitting to the judgement of the learned,<note place="margin">Perog. Reg. cap. 7.</note> I conceive that as well in
the <hi>Saxon</hi> times as until this Law, any Tenant might <hi>alien</hi> onely part of
his Lands, and reserve the services to the <hi>alienor,</hi> because he could not
reserve service (upon such <hi>alienation</hi>) unto the <hi>Lord Paramount,</hi> other
than was formerly due to him, without the Lord's consent; and for the
same reason could they not <hi>alien</hi> the whole Tenancy, to bind the Lord
without his express license, saving the opinion in the book of Assizes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>no Tenant could be enforced upon any Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 ass. pl. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>lest he might be his Enemy.</hi>
Nevertheless, it seemeth that <hi>de facto</hi> Tenants did usually <hi>alien</hi> their
whole Tenancy; and although they could not thereby bar the Lord's
right, yet because the Lord could not in such cases have the distress of his
own Tenant, this Law saved so much from <hi>alienation</hi> as might serve for
security of the Lord's distress. But Tenants were not thus satisfied;
the Lords would not part with their Tenants, although the Tenants ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
was never so urgent upon them to sell their Lands; and therefore
at length they prevailed by the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores</hi> to have power
to sell all,<note place="margin">18 Edw. 1. West. 3. c. 1.</note> saving to the Lords their services formerly due: and thus the
Lords were necessitated to grant Licenses of <hi>alienation</hi> to such as the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
could provide to buy their Lands. Nor was this so prejudicial to
the Lords in those days, when the publick quiet was setled, as it would
have been in former times of War, whenas the Lord's right was maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more by might, and the aid of his Tenants; than by Law, which then
was of little power.</p>

it was by another Law established,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 13.</note> that if the party <hi>appealed</hi> was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

<hi>amerced.</hi> Yet they lost much of their respect within the compass of these
few years by two Laws;<note place="margin">Merton. c. 10.</note> the one of which, made at <hi>Merton,</hi> allowed all
suiters to the rural Courts to appear by Proxie or Atturney, which it
seemeth had power to vote for the Masters, in all cases publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
and did not onely themselves grow into parties and maintenance
of Quarrels, and so spoiled these Courts of their common Justice, but
rendred the <hi>Freemen</hi> ignorant and careless of the common good of the
Country, and given over to their own private interest. And though the
corruption of Justice was soon felt, and against it a Law was provided, <hi>viz.
That the Sheriff should not allow of such corrupt Attorneys;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">West. 1. c. 33.</note> yet this was no
cure to the <hi>Freemen,</hi> who were still suffered to wax wanton at home, albeit
that they were discharged from doing their suit in all other Hundreds but
that wherein they dwell.<note place="margin">Marlb. c. 10.</note> The second Law that took away much honour
from these Courts,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> was that Law at <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> that discharged the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of <hi>England</hi> and the Clergie from their attendance at such service;
and this also opened the door wider to oppression. For where greatness is,
it carrieth therewith honour from the meaner sort, and a kind of awe and
stop unto the minds of such men that otherwise would riot without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint:
and though it might also be said, that the pretence of great
men in such Courts would oversway the meaner, and make strong par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
yet it must also be acknowledged, that these parties being greater
are the fewer, and do not so generally corrupt all sorts, as the corruption
of the meaner sort do. It is said by the wise man, <hi>Where the poor oppress
the poor, it is like a raging rain that leaves no food.</hi> The last branch in
this Law is an inhibition to the Sheriff from extortion; and surely
there was great need, and much more need than ever, now that the Lords
and Clergy are absent. It was thought that the great occasion of the
Sheriff's oppression was from above; I mean from the King, that raised
the values of the Farm of Counties granted to the Sheriffs;<note place="margin">Artic. sup. cart. cap. 13, 14 Stat. de vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. An. 9. E. 2.</note> for in those
days Sheriffs gave no accounts, as of later times they have done; and
therefore the Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> between the <hi>17th</hi> and <hi>18th</hi> Chap.
inserteth this Clause, <hi>Omnes Comitat. &amp; Hundred. Wapentag. &amp; Trethingi
sint ad antiquas firmas, absque ullo incremento, exceptis Dominicis Maneriis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris.</hi>
But this did not work the work, although it took away occasion;
for the humour was fed from within, and turned to a sore upon that place
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64112:96"/>
that could never be cured to this day.<note place="margin">Mag. Chart.</note> Nor could the wisdom of times
find other help to keep the same from growing mortal, but by scanting
the dyet, and taking away that power and jurisdiction which formerly it
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>37th</hi> Chapter hath been already noted in the Chapter of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Charter of King</hi> John <hi>hath superadded hereunto this ensuing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision:</hi>
There shall be no Escuage set in the Kingdom, except for the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the King's person, making of his eldest Son a Knight, and on marriage
of his eldest Daughter; and for this there shall be onely reasonable aid. And
in like manner shall the aids of the City of <hi>London</hi> be set. And for the
assessing of Escuage, we will summon the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls,
and greater Barons of the Kingdom, specially by our several Writs; and will
cause to be summoned in general by our Sheriffs and Bailiffs all other our Tenants
in <hi>capite,</hi> to be at a certain day after Forty days at the least, and at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place; and we will set down the cause in all our Writs. And the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at the day appointed shall proceed according to the counsel of those that
shall be present, although all that were summoned do not come. And we will
not allow any man to take aid of his Freemen, unless for redemption of his body,
and making his eldest Son a Knight, and on marriage for his eldest Daughter;
and this shall be a reasonable aid onely.</p>
               <p>Thus far the <hi>Charter</hi> of King <hi>John</hi> concerning this point of Tax or
Assessment;<note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> and if the History saith true, the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third was one and the same with that of King <hi>John,</hi> then either this was
not lest out in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Charter, in that Historians time; or if
it was omitted in the original, it was supposed to be included in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
words of the Law, as <hi>being accustomed in times past.</hi> And then these
particulars will be emergent: First, that the <hi>Aids</hi> and <hi>Escuage</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi>
the First's time, were assessed by the same way with that in this <hi>Charter</hi>
of King <hi>John;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1214, 1215.</note> for that all the quarrel between the Lords and King <hi>John,</hi>
was concerning the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, which the Lords sware to
maintain. Secondly,<note place="margin">25 Edw. 1. c. 6.</note> that neither <hi>Aids</hi> nor <hi>Escuage</hi> were granted, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
taken,<note place="margin">34 Edw. 1. c. 1.</note> but by Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 36.</note> although the rate of them was
setled by common custom, according to the quantity of their Fee. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that some Parliaments in those times, as concerning such matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
onely of such men as were concerned by way of such charge, by
reason of their Tenancy: for <hi>Escuage</hi> onely concerned the Tenants by
<hi>Knight-service,</hi> and therefore those onely were summoned unto such Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as onely concerned <hi>Escuage.</hi> Nor had the City of <hi>London</hi> nor the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
right to vote in such cases, it is said <hi>p.</hi> 258. And thus the Forest-Laws
that were made in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the First, were made by the consent
of Archbishops,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 44. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Bishops, Abbots, Earls, Barons, and Knights of the whole
Kingdom: for what the great men gained, they gained for themselves
and their Tenants. And the truth is, that in those times, although pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
damage concerned all, yet it was ordinary for Kings to make a shew
of summoning Parliaments, whenas properly they were but Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
meetings of some such Lords, Clergy, and others, as the King saw
most convenient to drive on his own design. And therefore we find that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64112:97"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Third about the latter part of his Reign,<note place="margin">Mag. Charta.</note> when his Government
grew towards the dregs, he having in the Kingdom Two hundred and
fifty <hi>Baronies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gloss. tit. Baron.</note> he summoned unto one of these Parliamentary meetings
but Five and twenty <hi>Barons,</hi> and One hundred and fifty of his Clergy.
Nevertheless, the Law of King <hi>John</hi> was still the same; and we cannot
rightly read the Law in such Precedents, as are rather the birth of will
than reason. Fourthly, that no <hi>aids</hi> were then granted, but such as pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
under the title <hi>Escuage,</hi> or according thereunto; for the words are,
<hi>No Escuage shall be demanded, or granted, or taken, but for redeeming the
King's person, Knighting of his Son, or Marriage of his Daughter.</hi> Nor is
the way of assessing in these times different, saving that instead of all the
<hi>Knights,</hi> two onely are now chosen in every County; the Tenure (as it
seemeth) first giving the Title of that Order, and both Tenure and
Order now changed into that Title taken up for the time and occasion.
Fifthly, that it was then the ancient custom, and so used in the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the First, that the advice of those then present, was the advice of
the whole, and that their advice passed for a Law without contradiction,
notwithstanding the King's <hi>Negative voice;</hi> for the words are, <hi>The matter
at that day shall proceed according to the counsel of those that shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
although all do not come;</hi> and therefore that clause in the King's Oath,
<hi>quas vulgus eligerit,</hi> may well be understood in the future, and not in the
preter tense. Last of all, though not gathered from the Text of this
Law whereof we treat, yet being co-incident with the matter, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that though the <hi>Clergie</hi> were now in their ruffle, and felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their full strength, yet there befel a posture of state that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the world, that the <hi>English</hi> held not the interest of the <hi>Clergie</hi> to
be of such publick concernment, or necessary concurrence in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdom, as was pretended.<note place="margin">Walsing. An. 1297.</note> For the <hi>Clergie</hi> finding Assess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Laity</hi> so heavy, and that occasions of publick charge were
like to multiply daily, they therefore, to save the main stock, procured
an Inhibition from <hi>Rome</hi> against all such impositions from the <hi>Laity,</hi> and
against such payments by the <hi>Clergie;</hi> and in the strength of this they
absolutely refuse to submit to aid <hi>Edward</hi> the First by any such way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all the Parliament had thereunto consented. And thus, having
divided themselves from the Parliament, they were by them divided
from it; and not onely outed of all priviledge of Parliament, but of all
the priviledge of Subjects, into the state of <hi>praemunire:</hi> and thus set up
for a monument to future times, for them also to act without the consent
of those men, as occasion should offer. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Third not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this ancient and ordinary way of Assessment upon ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
took up that extraordinary course of Assessment upon all the
<hi>Freemen</hi> of the Kingdom, which was formerly taken up onely in that
extraordinary occasion of redeeming of the King's or Lord's person out
of captivity, and common defence of the Land from piracy; and under
the Title of <hi>Dane-gelt,</hi> which was now absolutely dead, and hanged up
in chains as a monument of oppression. Nevertheless, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that in former times the <hi>Freemen</hi> were as deeply taxed, if not
oppressed with payments to their Lords at such times as they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
over to the King in the cases aforesaid, as by the latter words of the
Law aforesaid of King <hi>John</hi> doth appear, and whereby it is probable that
the inferiour Lords were gainers. The conclusion of the Charter of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third (the same suiting also with the third observation fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going)
doth not a little favour the same: for it is expresly set down,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64112:97"/>
                  <hi>that in lieu of the King's confirmation of the Charter of Liberties aforesaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. Chart.</note>
                  <hi>not onely the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and Knights,
but also the Freemen, and all the Kingdom, gave a fifteenth of all their movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have I summed up and compared both the Copies of the
<hi>Grand Charters</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> Liberties, (saving two particulars inserted
into the Forest-Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third) wherein if any thing had been
new and unreasonable, King <hi>John</hi> might have colour to except against
them as extorted by force;<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1227.</note> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third might (as he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised)
plead <hi>nonage,</hi> and so they might have been choaked in their birth;
but being all <hi>Consuetudines,</hi> as in the conclusion they are called, and Kings
ashamed to depend upon such frivolous exceptions, it may be wondred
what might move them to adventure so much blood-shed, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into so many troubles, to avoid their own acts; unless the writing
of them were an obligation acknowledged before the world; and they
resolving secretly to be under none, were loth to publish the same to all
men. It is a strange vanity in great men to pretend love to Justice, and
yet not endure to be bound thereto; whenas we see that God himself
loves to be bound by his word, and to have it pleaded, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
as much to be acknowledged true in performing, as good in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
But neither was King <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of this spirit; fain
they would undo, but could not. It is true, it was at the first but a King's
<hi>Charter of Confirmation;</hi> and had Kings been patient therewith, it might
have grown no bigger: but by opposition it rooted deeper, and grew up
unto the stature of a <hi>Statute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marlb. c. 5.</note> and setled so fast, as it can never be avoided
but by surrender from the whole body.</p>
               <p>Having thus summed up the Liberties of the Subjects and <hi>Free-men</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> under this <hi>Charter,</hi> I shall make some Appendix hereunto,
by annexing a few additionals in these times established; and although
they come not within the letter of the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> yet are they
subservient thereunto. And first concerning the King; and this either as
he is King, or as he is Lord. As King, he had these Prerogatives above
all Lords.</p>
               <p>The King shall have the custody of Fools and Ideots Lands
for their maintenance,<note place="margin">Prerog. Reg. cap. 9.</note> and shall render the same to their Heirs.</p>
               <p>And concerning Mad-men and Lunaticks,<note place="margin">cap. 10.</note> the King shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a Bailiff for their maintenance, rendering account to them
when they are sober, or to their Administrators.</p>
               <p>It is no less liberty or priviledge of the People, that <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Mad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
are to be ordered by <hi>Tutors,</hi> than Children; and therefore this may
be annexed to the rest of the Liberties, as well as the other. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
it seemeth that the Laws took them into their regard, in respect of
their Estates, which might be abused to the prejudice of the Publick, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than out of any respect had to their persons. Now because there is
a difference between the disability of these persons, the one being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
the other temporary; therefore is there also by these Laws a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the disposal of their <hi>Estates:</hi> for the <hi>Tutor</hi> had a right in the
disposing of the one, and but a bare authority or power in providing for
the other. Secondly, the person of the <hi>Tutor</hi> is to be considered: Anciently
it was the next kindred, grounded, as I conceive, upon the natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64112:98"/>
going along with the blood; and this so continued in custom until
these times: for though the <hi>Mirrour of Justice</hi> saith, that <hi>Henry</hi> the First
brought in that course of giving the custody of these disabled persons to
the King, as hath been formerly observed; yet <hi>Bracton,</hi> that wrote long
after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the First,<note place="margin">Bract. lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> speaking of these kind of persons, saith,
<hi>Talibus de necessitate dandus est tutor vel curator;</hi> not so much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the King in the case.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 10.</note> And in another place, speaking of such as are
<hi>alieni juris,</hi> saith, that <hi>some are under the custody of their Lords, and others
under their Parents and friends.</hi> But let the time of the entrance of this
Law be never so uncertain, it is now a declared Law, that the King in
such cases is the common <hi>Curator</hi> or <hi>Tutor</hi> of all such persons, as he is a
<hi>Chief Justice,</hi> rendring to every one his right.</p>
               <p>The King shall have the Wrecks of the Sea.<note place="margin">Prerog. Reg. cap. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What shall be called a <hi>Wreck,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">West. 1. c. 4.</note> the Statute at <hi>West.</hi> 1. declareth, <hi>viz.
Where the Ship so perisheth, that nothing therein escapeth alive;</hi> and these
are rather in their original committed to the King as a <hi>Curator,</hi> than gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him as a <hi>Proprietor;</hi> although that Custom hath since setled a kind of
right, which may perhaps be accounted rather a Title by Estoppel. For
the fundamental ground is, that the right owner cannot be manifested,
and therefore the King shall hold it; and if the right owner can be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
the King shall hold it till the owner doth appear.</p>
               <p>The Heir in Socage-tenure shall have an Action of Waste,<note place="margin">Marlb. c. 17.</note> and
an account against his Guardian for the profits of the Lands and
Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Heir in <hi>Socage</hi> being under age,<note place="margin">Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> shall also be under custody of such
Guardian of the next kinred, who cannot challenge right of Inheritance
in such Lands so holden: as if the Lands descended from the Father's side,
the <hi>Mother,</hi> or next of the kinred of the Mothers side shall have the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody;</hi>
and so if the Lands descend from the Mother, the <hi>Father,</hi> or next
kinred of the Father's side shall have the <hi>custody.</hi> And this custody brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
with it an Authority or Power onely, and no Right, as in case of
the Heir in Knight-service; and therefore cannot be granted over as the
Wardship in Knight-service might, but the <hi>Guardian in Socage</hi> remaineth
accomptant to the Heir, for all profits both of Land and Marriage. The
full age of <hi>Tenant in Socage,</hi> is such age wherein he is able to do that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which is Fourteen years; for at such age he may be able by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
repute to aid in Tillage of the ground, which is his proper ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But the Son of a Burgess hath no set time of full Age, but at such
time as he can <hi>tell Money, and measure Cloath,</hi> and such work as concerns
that calling.</p>
               <p>Widows deforced of their Dower of <hi>Quarentine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Merton. c. 1.</note> shall by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
recover damages till they recover their Dower.</p>
               <p>They shall also have power to devise their crop arising from
her Dower.<note place="margin">cap. 2. Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 40.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was used that the Heir should have the crop with the Land; but this
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64112:98"/>
Statute altered that former usage, and yet saved the Lord's liberty to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
if any services were due.</p>
               <p>Writs <hi>de consimili casu</hi> granted in cases that fall under the
same Law,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 24.</note> and need the same remedy; and such Writs shall be
made by agreement of the Clerks in the Chancery, and advice of
such as are skilful in the Law.</p>
               <p>It was none of the meanest Liberties of the <hi>Freemen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that
no Writs did issue forth against them, but such as were anciently in use, and
agreed upon in Parliament. And it was no less a grievance and just cause of
complaint, that Kings used to send Writs of new impression to execute
the dictates of their own wills, and not of the Laws of the Kingdom; as
the complaints of the Clergy in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third do witness.<note place="margin">M. Paris ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Artic. 44.</note>
Nevertheless, because many mens cases befel not directly within the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of any Law for remedy, and yet were very burthensome; for want
of remedy it is provided by this Law, that such emergent cases that do
fall within the inconvenience, shall be comprehended within the remedy
of that Law.</p>
               <p>Aid to make the Son of the Lord a Knight,<note place="margin">Westm. c. 36.</note> and to marry his
eldest Daughter, shall be assessed after the rate of twenty shillings
for a Knights Fee; and twenty shillings for twenty pounds in
yearly value of Socage-tenure.</p>
               <p>The uncertainties of <hi>Aids</hi> are by this Law reduced and setled, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sum; and thereby delivered the people from much oppression
which they suffered formerly. Nor was onely the particular sum here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
but also the age of the Son when he was to be made a Knight, <hi>viz.</hi>
at <hi>the age of Fifteen years;</hi> too soon for him to perform Knight-service,
but not too soon for the Lord to get his money. And the Daughter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
was allowed to be fit for Marriage at <hi>Seven years of age,</hi> or at least
to give her consent thereto, albeit that in truth she was neither fit for
the one or other: and therefore it must be the Lords gain that made the
Law; and it was not amiss to have the <hi>aid</hi> beforehand, though the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
succeeded not for many years after; and if the Lord died in
the interim, the Executors having Assets paid it, or otherwise his
Heir.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXVIII. Of Courts and their Proceedings.</head>
               <p>BEsides the Courts of Justices <hi>itinerant,</hi> which were ancient, as hath
been said, other Courts have been raised of later birth, albeit even
they also have been of ancient constitutions, and divers of them <hi>itinerant</hi>
also, and some of them setled in one place. The work of the Justices
<hi>itinerant</hi> was universal, comprehending both the matters of the Crown
and Common-pleas. That of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> is onely of Crown-pleas
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64112:99"/>
originally commenced, and enquired of by themselves, and granted forth
upon emergent crimes of important consequence that require speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and reformation. Justices of <hi>Gaol-delivery</hi> have a more large work,
that is, to deliver the Gaols of all criminal offenders formerly indicted,
or before themselves. Justices of <hi>Assize</hi> and <hi>Nisi prius</hi> are to have cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of Common-pleas onely, and for the most part are but for enquiry.
All which, saving the Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> in ancient use, were instituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these times; and therewith ended both the work and common use
of the ancient <hi>iters;</hi> and yet all these later Courts, joyntly considered,
have not the like comprehensive power that the <hi>iters</hi> had, for they had
the power of hearing and determining all causes, both of the Crown and
Common-pleas, albeit in a different manner: That is to say, in the first
times, promiscuously united into one and the same person; but soon after
the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and more clearly in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second,
that power was divided into several persons, some sitting upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pleas,</hi>
others upon the <hi>Crown-pleas.</hi> The Judges of these journeying
Courts were specially assigned by the King, as in the case of the Gaol-delivery;
or setled by the Law upon the Judges of both Benches at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister,</hi>
as in case of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi>

               <p>Now concerning the Courts that were setled: some were setled or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the King's personal residence, as the <hi>Chancellor's Court;</hi> for in
these times it began to have a judiciary power of eminent stature, and
growing out of the decays of the great <hi>chief Justice</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Then
also the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> was annexed by the same Law unto the Kings Court
or personal residence,<note place="margin">Fleta. Artic. sup. cart. c. 15.</note> as it anciently ever had that honour; although it
seems the endeavours were to make it like the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Another and last Court that was setled in this manner, was the
<hi>Marshals Court,</hi> which in the original onely concerned the Kings houshold,
but afterwards compassed in a distance of the neighbouring places,<note place="margin">5 E. 4. sol. 129.</note> because
the Kings attendants were many in those times, whenas the Courts of
Justice continually attended on his person: and this precinct was called
the <hi>Verge;</hi> and all cases of debt and covenant, where both parties were
of the Houshold,<note place="margin">Artic sup. cart. c. 3.</note> and of Trespasses <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> where one of them was
of the Houshold, were handled in the Court of the <hi>Verge,</hi> or the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals
Court.</hi> And Inquests of death within the same, shall be taken by the
<hi>Coroner</hi> of the County with the <hi>Coroner</hi> of the Houshold. Other Courts
were rural, and affixed also to some certain place, either of the County
or Town, or other particular place. That of the County suffered in
these times great diminution,<note place="margin">Stat. Glou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the power thereof onely to <hi>Trespasses</hi> of 40 <hi>s.</hi> value or under:
for though formerly the Kings Justices incroached upon the County-Courts,
and contracted suits before themselves, which by the ancient Law
they ought not; yet it was ever illegal, and the County-Courts held their
right till this Law was made, which kept under those inferiour Courts,
and made them of less account than formerly. Nevertheless, the Kings
<hi>Justicies,</hi> or Writ to the Sheriffs, oftentimes enableth the inferiour Court
to have cognizance of cases of greater value.<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 23.</note> Lastly, a rule was set to
the smaller Courts of Corporations, Fairs, and Markets, <hi>viz. That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be sued in any of them, which was not a debter or pledge there.</hi>

and chief men of the Country.</p>
               <p>Of these Officers formerly hath been spoken, as touching their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
qualification, and work: this Law brought in no change of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Law, but onely of a former Custom gained by these degenerating
times, which brought men into place that were far unfit, who otherwise
of poor and mean condition maintained themselves by bribery and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and being found guilty had not sufficient to give recompence. This
Law therefore revives the first Law, and holds these men to their work
of taking <hi>Inquests</hi> and <hi>Appeals,</hi> by Indenture between themselves and the
Sheriff; and these were to be certified at the next coming of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The Free-holders in every County,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sheriffs.</hi> Artic. sup. cart. c. 9.</note> if they will, shall elect their
own Sheriff, unless the Sheriffwick be holden in Fee.</p>
               <p>This was indeed the ancient custom: as the Officers of the Kingdom
were elegible by the Common-council of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Mirror. cap. 1. sec. 3.</note> so were all the
Officers of the County chosen by the County. But within a few years,
in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Stat. de vic. 9 E. 2.</note> comes another Law, <hi>That the Sheriffs
shall be appointed by the Chancellor, Treasurer, Barons of the Exchequer, and
the Justices.</hi> Which Law was made in favour of the people, as by the
file of that Statute doth more fully appear: for though at the first blush
it may seem a priviledge lost by the <hi>Freemen,</hi> that these great men should
have the election of the <hi>Sheriff;</hi> yet it proved a great advantage to the
common quiet of the people in those times of parties, and was so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
Otherwise as the case stood in those days of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second,
it was no time for him to gain upon the peoples Liberties. Nor had the
Statute of <hi>Articuli super cartas,</hi> whereof we how treat, been penned with
these words, <hi>if they will.</hi> And questionless in these days we now live in,
if the people had but a little taste of this seeming liberty of electing <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs</hi>
in the County-court, as formerly it was used, it would be soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the election of these chief Officers were better disposed in some
other hand, if rightly pursued.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Saxons</hi> made difference between Homicide by <hi>misfortune,</hi> and
that which was done <hi>felleo animo,</hi> or <hi>with a spirit of gall,</hi> formerly hath
been shewed: now what it was that altered the case, I cannot say, unless
the violence, cruelty, and oppression of the times. Formerly all kind
of Manslaughter was <hi>finable,</hi> I mean in the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and so might
more rationally be ranked into one degree; but now the punishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to change from <hi>forfeiture of Estate</hi> and <hi>loss of Member,</hi> to <hi>death</hi> and
<hi>forfeiture of Estate;</hi> and therefore it was more necessary to make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64112:100"/>
in the <hi>penalty</hi> (seeing in the <hi>fine</hi> formerly a difference was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)

               <p>This crime hitherto was punished by <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>loss of member,</hi> at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
but is now made capital, and punished with death. One example
whereof, and the first that Story maketh mention of, we find of an <hi>Irish</hi>
Nobleman in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who suffered death for <hi>piracy;</hi>

forty days, shall have right. If the Delinquent be convicted
without such complaint made, he shall be fined and impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Before this Law, this crime was but <hi>finable,</hi> unless the fact was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon a <hi>Virgin,</hi> for then the member was lost. And this was the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
Law; but the <hi>Normans</hi> inflicted the loss of the member upon all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
in any <hi>Rape.</hi> Nor was this made <hi>Felony</hi> by any Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
that I can finde, till about these days. It is true, that <hi>Canutus</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
it <hi>capitis aestimatione,</hi> by way of compensation; which rather gives
a rule of damages to the party wronged, than importeth a punishment
inflicted for an offence done against the Crown, as if it were thereby made
<hi>capital.</hi> But for the more certainty of the penalty, another Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth,
that if the <hi>Rape</hi> be committed without the Womans consent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 34.</note>
she may have an <hi>Appeal of Rape.</hi> And though a consent be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
yet the Delinquent upon indictment found shall suffer death, as
in the case of <hi>Appeal.</hi> But if a Wife be carried away with the goods of
her Husband, besides Action of the party, the King shall have a <hi>fine.</hi> If
the Wife <hi>elopeth,</hi> she shall lose her <hi>Dower,</hi> if she be not reconciled before
her Husband's death. All which now-recited Provisoes are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
together in one Chapter, and yet the Chapter is <hi>partee per fess, French</hi>
and <hi>Latine.</hi> So far thereof as concerneth death, was written in <hi>French,</hi>
being the most known Language to the great men in general, many of
whom were <hi>French,</hi> by reason of the interest that <hi>Henry</hi> the Third had
with <hi>France</hi> in his late Wars against the <hi>Barons.</hi> It was therefore publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by way of Caveat, that no person that understood <hi>French</hi> might
plead ignorance of the Law that concerned their lives. The residue of
that Chapter was written in <hi>Latine,</hi> as all the other Laws of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were, upon grounds formerly in this discourse noted. One Proviso
more remaineth, which is also comprehended in the same Chapter with
the former, <hi>viz. Any person that shall carry away a Nun from her house, shall
suffer imprisonment for three years, and render damages to the house.</hi> This
crime was formerly onely inwombed in the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> and now born
and brought forth into the condition of a <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> rather to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the right of the <hi>Freemen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. fol. 197.</note> than in any respect had to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who
had been very bold with the liberty of the <hi>Freemen</hi> in this matter. For
Archbishop <hi>Peckham,</hi> not a year before the making of this Law, for this
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64112:100"/>
offence had excommunicated Sir <hi>Osborn Gifford;</hi> nor could he get absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but upon his Penance. First he was disciplin'd with rods three
times; once in the open Church at <hi>Wilton,</hi> then in the Market-place at
<hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and lastly in the publick Church there: Then he must fast
divers moneths. Lastly, he must be disrobed of all Military habiliments,
<hi>viz.</hi> Guilt Spurs, Sword, Saddle, golden Trappings, and to use no brave
garments but russet, with Lamb and Sheep-skins; to use no Shirit, nor
take up his Order again, until he had spent three years Pilgrimage in the
Holy Land: and unto this Penance the Knight by Oath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
A strange power! and to repress which, it was time for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to look about them, and rather to punish Delinquents themselves, than
to leave it to the will of such men as never had enough.</p>
               <p>Concealment,<note place="margin">

by Fine and Imprisonment.</p>
               <p>In those ancient times, pursuits of <hi>Felons</hi> with <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> were
made by Lords of Manors, Bailiffs of Liberties, Sheriffs, and Coroners;
whereas now they are made by Constables. See more in the Chapter of
Peace.<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Escapes</hi> also were punished with <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Imprisonment:</hi> and in
some places the Lord had the <hi>Fine,</hi> in other places the Sheriff, and in
some cases the King; yet in no case was any <hi>Fine</hi> assessed or taken till the
Trial before the Justices.</p>
               <p>Persons defamed for Felony,<note place="margin">Defamed Felons.</note> not submitting to Trial by Law,
shall be committed to close and hard Imprisonment.<note place="margin">West. 1. c. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been accounted an extream construction of this Law, and
questionless so it is, that this Law should warrant that punishment of
pressing to death, which hath been of later times more constantly used
than former times ever knew of: for though it be granted that some
trick of torture was sometimes used, even before the <hi>Normans</hi> times, and
so might now and then leave some few examples after the <hi>Norman</hi> times;
yet did the Law never patronize such courses,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 1. sec. 9.</note> especially if the death
of the party suspected ensued thereupon, but accounted it Manslaughter.
And the end of this Law was not to put a man to death, but to urge
him to confess:<note place="margin">Briton cap. 4. sec. 24.</note> and so <hi>Briton</hi> saith, Such as will not submit to Trial,
shall be put to Penance till he shall pray to be admitted thereunto; and
therefore the Penance then used was such as did not necessarily infer
death; nor was it a final Judgement in the Trial, but onely a means
thereto: and therefore it might rather consist in denial of conveniencies,
than inflicting of pain. Now in what cases it was used, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
from the manner of the Indictments in those days, whereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Appeals by the party) some were of particular <hi>fact</hi> done; others
onely of a <hi>Fame:</hi> and it may be conceived that the course in the second
was,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 10. cap. 1.</note> that if a man would not submit, but would <hi>stand mute,</hi> he was put
to this kind of Imprisonment; for the discovering Law was by <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third taken away. But if the Delinquent was positively accused of a
Felony, and thereupon indicted by a witness of the Fact, and then if the
Delinquent would not submit to his Trial by Law, in such case the final
Judgement was to die, <hi>Onere, fame, &amp;c.</hi> because in the one was a <hi>Fact</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
against him by a Witness, and in the other onely a <hi>Fame</hi> or suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64112:101"/>
which is not pregnant against the life of a man. But this manner
of Indictment being now laid aside, and all proceedings being upon a
<hi>Fact</hi> affirmed against the party, I conceive this Law of no use at all in these
days.</p>
               <p>Bail shall not be allowed to Outlaws fore-jured,<note place="margin">Bail. West. 1. c. 15.</note> Thieves ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the act, notorious Thieves, appealed persons, burners of
Houses, breakers of Prison; false Coyners, counterfeiters of the
Broad-seal, prisoners upon excommunication, open Malefactors,
and Traitors against the King.</p>
               <p>The six first are in nature of persons attainted either upon their own
confession, or such manifest Evidence as in common reason cannot be
gainsaid; all which were before this Law under bail; yea the last of all,
although the most heinous of all,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 14. cap. 1.</note> was in the same condition. As touching
<hi>breakers of Prison,</hi> in these times it was <hi>Felony,</hi> for what cause soever they
were committed; and therefore their imprisonment was without bail:
for whoso makes no Conscience of breaking the Prison, his credit will
little avail. Yet it must be acknowledged, that the Law imprisoned
few without bail in those foregoing times, but in case of <hi>Felony</hi> or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
but afterward the cases of commitment being ordinary, even
in matters of mean process, and because mens credits waxing weak by
the weakness of their Estates, now wasted by the Civil Wars; therefore
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time a Law was made to restrain the <hi>Felony</hi> in such
cases, onely to the <hi>breach of Prison by such as were committed for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</hi>
And as touching Imprisonment upon Excommunication, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that within five years before the making of this Law,<note place="margin">Addit. M. Paris.</note> it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
that such were set at liberty by the King's Writ <hi>de homine reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giando,</hi>
without the Bishop's consent. But now the <hi>Clergie</hi> had gotten the
day of the Law, which did much decline from that guard of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but hated perpetual imprisonment. Nor was this complaint groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon any other Law than that of the Canon; for the Common Law
ever held the supreme cognizance of Excommunication within its own
power, as upon the Writ <hi>de quare excommunicato</hi> may appear. Other crimes
are yet also by this Law allowed bail, such as are persons indicted of
<hi>Larceny,</hi> before Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> persons imprisoned upon slight grounds,
Receivers, and Accessories before Felony, Trespassers, persons appealed by
<hi>provers,</hi> after the death of the <hi>approvers.</hi> If bail be granted otherwise than
the Law alloweth, the party that alloweth the same shall be fined, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
render damages, or forfeit his place, as the case shall require. And
thus the iniquity of the times was so great, as it even forced the Subjects
to forgo that which was in account a great liberty, to stop the course of a
growing mischief.</p>

               <p>It is therefore an offence against the <hi>Crown,</hi> to procure or maintain an
ill conceit in the King of the people, or an ill conceit in the people of the
King; and it is as well an offence against the Crown for the King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ill of his people, as for them of him. But all must be grounded
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64112:101"/>
upon falshood; for truth respects no man's person; and all men are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
bound by the woe, <hi>if they call good evil, or evil good;</hi> although
difference must be made in the manner of representation. And upon this
ground of maintaining strife,<note place="margin">33 Edw. 1.</note> was a Law made also against Conspiracy to
make or maintain Indictment, Suit, or Quarrel; and it was likewise finable.</p>

               <p>Formerly <hi>Redisseisin</hi> was under no other Law than that of <hi>Desseisin,</hi>

the same Judges that had the power of enquiry of all offences against
the <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marlb. c. 8.</note> The penalty of imprisonment in this case, was to be without
bail, but onely by the King's Writ <hi>de homine replegiando;</hi> and yet even
thus the penalty was not sufficient to restrain the offence, and therefore a
Law was made to abridge the power of that Writ,<note place="margin">West. 2. c. 26.</note> as touching such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and they became irremediable as touching their liberty by that

               <p>From the times of King <hi>Steven,</hi> the Lords and great men endeavoured
to advance their power and greatness so high above the meaner sort of
<hi>Free men,</hi> as they made Kings continually jealous of their power. <hi>Castles</hi>
had been a bone of long contention between them, but they being for the
most part taken away, the strife was about Prisons, and power to imprison
offenders; and that also after much opposition they laid aside. Yet the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of these times being such, as (though Felonies were somewhat drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
Trepasses of the highest nature were little regarded, such as were
riotous hunting in their Parks, and fishing in their Waters; The Lords
and great men made it their last request, that at least in such cases <hi>they
might have power to imprison such as they found so trespassing;</hi> but this was
also denied them,<note place="margin">Merton. c. 11.</note> though by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third in his first time, when as
yet the Government was not worsted by projects of Arbitrary power,
or corrupt Counsels of Forreigners, nor himself a man able to sway with
the Lords in matters that were of doubtful prerogative. And to speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,
it is better for the Liberty of the Subject, that the power of
imprisonment should be regulated onely by the Kings Writ ordered by
Law, than by the Warrants of great men, especially in their own cases;
and therefore in this matter the Kings <hi>Prerogative</hi> was a patron to the
<hi>Free mens liberty.</hi> Nevertheless, these great men give not thus over their
game: for though in times of publick calamities, little place is left for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to any man; yet when times are grown to more quiet, pleasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives,
and the great men renew their motion: and though they could
not obtain <hi>prisons</hi> to their own use, as they endeavoured at the meeting at
<hi>Merton;</hi> yet now they obtain the <hi>Kings prisons</hi> to the use of a Law that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64112:102"/>
was as good as their own, and thereby satisfied their own displeasure for the
loss of their pleasure. And yet this Law sufficed them not, but they obtain
a further priviledge,<note place="margin">An. 21. Ed. 1.</note> that such persons as are found so trespassing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to submit, may be killed without peril of Felony.</p>

were as formerly, not onely such as were <hi>milites,</hi> or Tenants in Knight-service,

it is to be considered what the Law made by <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2 <hi>d.</hi> holdeth forth.</p>
               <p>All such as ought to be Knights and are not, shall be distrained
to undertake the weapons of Knighthood, if they shew not cause
to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Regularly all Tenants by <hi>Knight-service</hi> ought to be <hi>Knights,</hi> but <hi>de
facto</hi> were not; so as in these times there was a further work to make a
man a <hi>Knight</hi> than his bare Tenure; for such onely were <hi>milites facti,</hi> who
had both Lands sufficient to maintain the Arms and state of a <hi>Knight,</hi> and
also a body fit to undertake the service in his own person, and whereof
he had given sufficient proof the field. Others that had Land, either
had not sufficient maintenance, or not habiliments of person, and as not
expected were laid aside; of this sort were many, by reason of the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars, in which they had much impaired both their bodies and Estates.
This rendred the strength of the Kingdom and <hi>Militia</hi> so much decayed,
and the minds of men so wearied, that they began to love ease before the
times would brook it, and a cessation from Arms before they had any
mind to peace. The Parliament espyed the danger, and how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it was for the people to be well armed in these times of general
broil; and upon that ground allowed this Law to pass; <hi>That all such
as had Lands worth</hi> 20 l. <hi>yearly besides Reprizals, should be ready</hi> (not to
be Knights, nor, under the favour of others, is there any ancient prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to warrant it, but) <hi>to find, or to enter into the field with the Arms
of a Knight, or to provide some able person to serve in their stead, unless they
were under 21 years of age, and so not grown up to full strength of body;
nor their Lands in their own possession, but in custody of their Lords or
Guardians.</hi> Nevertheless, of such as were grown to full age, yet were
<hi>maimed, impotent,</hi> or of <hi>mean estate,</hi> and Tenants by service of a Knight,
it was had into a way of moderation, and ordered that such should pay
a <hi>reasonable fine</hi> for respit of such service; nor further as concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
persons were they bound. But as touching such that were under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
onely, and not perpetual disabilities of body upon them incumbent,
as often as occasion called, they served by their deputies or servants: all
which was grounded not onely upon the Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, but
also upon common right of <hi>Tenure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arms</hi> that these men were to finde, are said to be those belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a <hi>Knight;</hi> which were partly for defence, and partly for offence. Of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64112:102"/>
the first sort were the <hi>Shield,</hi> the <hi>Helmet,</hi> the <hi>Hauberk,</hi> or <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> or
<hi>Coat of Mail;</hi> of the second sort were the <hi>Sword and Lance:</hi> and unto all
a <hi>Horse</hi> must be provided. These <hi>Arms,</hi> especially the defensive, have
been formerly under alteration; for the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> could not be worn
with the <hi>Coat of Mail,</hi> and therefore must be used as occasion was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of either: and for this cause the service of a Knight is called by several
names; sometimes from the <hi>Horse,</hi> sometimes from the <hi>Lance,</hi> sometimes
from the <hi>Helmet,</hi> and not seldom from the <hi>Coat of Mail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of immediate command, or calling forth the <hi>Knights</hi> to their
service, in its own nature was but ministerial, and subservient to that power
that ordered War to be levied: and therefore, as in the first <hi>Saxon</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
under their Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> so after,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> under their Kings, War
was never resolved upon, but if it were defensive, it was by the Council of
Lords; if offensive, by the general Vote of the Grand Council of the
Kingdom. So by vertue of such Order, either from the Council of Lords,
or Grand Council, the Knights were called forth to War, and others, as
the case required, summoned to a rendezvouze: and this instrumental
power regularly rested in the Lords, to whom such service was due; and
the Lords were summoned by the Lord Paramount, as chief of the Fee, of
which their Tenants were holden, and not as King or chief Captain in the
Field: for they were not raised by Proclamation, but by Summons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
forth to the Sheriff, with distress; and this onely against such as were
within his own Fee, and held of the Crown. The King therefore might
have many <hi>Knights</hi> at his command, but the Lords more; and if those
Lords failed in their due correspondency with the King, all those of the
inferiour Orb were carried away after them: so the King is left to shift
for himself as well as he can. And this might be occasioned not onely
from their <hi>Tenures,</hi> by which they stood obliged to the inferiour Lords,
but probably much more by their popularity, which was more prevalent,
by how much Kings looked upon the <hi>Commons</hi> at a further distance in
those days, than in after-times, when the <hi>Commons</hi> interposed intentively
in the publick Government. And thus the <hi>Horse-men</hi> of <hi>England</hi> beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
less constant in adhering to their Soveraign in the Field, occasioned
Kings to betake themselves to their <hi>Foot,</hi> and to form the strength of
their Battels wholly in them, and themselves on foot to engage with
them.</p>
               <p>One point of liberty these Souldiers by <hi>Tenure</hi> had, which made their
service not altogether servile; and that was, that their service in the Field
was neither indefinite, nor infinite, but circumscribed by place, time, and
end. The time of their service for the continuance of it was for a set
time, if it were at their own charges: and although some had a shorter
time, yet the general sort were restained to <hi>forty days.</hi> For the Courage
of those times consisted not in wearying and wasting the Souldier in the
Field by delays, and long work in wheeling about and retiring, but in
playing their prizes like two Combatants of resolution to get Victory by
Valour, or to die. If upon extraordinary occasions the War continued
longer, then the Tenant served upon the pay of the common Purse. The
end of the service of the Tenant (<hi>viz.</hi> their Lord's defence in the defence
of the Kingdom) stinted their work within certain bounds of place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which they were not to be drawn, unless of their own accord: And
these were the borders of the Dominion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which
in those days extended into <hi>Scotland</hi> on the North, and into a great part
of <hi>France</hi> on the South. And therefore the Earl-Marshal of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:64112:103"/>
(being by <hi>Edward</hi> the first commanded by vertue of his <hi>Tenure</hi> to attend
in person upon the Standart under his Lieutenant that then was to be sent
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> which was no part of the Dominion of <hi>England</hi>) refused;
and notwithstanding the King's threats to hang him, yet he persisted,
saying, <hi>He would neither go nor hang.</hi> Not onely because the Tenants by
<hi>Knight-service</hi> are bound to the defence of their Lord's persons, and not of
their Lieutenants; but principally because they are to serve for the safety
and defence of the Kingdom: and therefore ought not to be drawn into
foreign Countries. Nor did the Earl-Marshal onely this, but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also, both Knights and Knights fellows, having twenty pounds <hi>per
Annum;</hi>
for all these with their Arms were summoned to serve under the
King's pay in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walsing. f. 69. &amp; 71.</note> I say, multitudes of them refused to serve, and
afterwards joyned with the rest of the <hi>Commons</hi> in a Petition to the King,
and complained of that Summons as of a common Grievance, because that
neither they nor their Ancestors were bound to serve the King in that
Country: and they obtained the King's discharge under his broad Seal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
The like whereunto may be warranted out of the very
words of the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> which was made within the compass
of these times;<note place="margin">Stat. Mort. 7 Edw. 1.</note> by which it was provided, That in case Lands be aliened
contrary to that Statute, and the immediate Lords do not seize the same,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> King shall seize them, and dispose them for the defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>viz.</hi> upon such services reserved as shall suit therewith: as if all the
service of a <hi>Knight</hi> must conduce thereto; and that he is no further bound
to any service of his Lord, than will consist with the safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
This was the Doctrine that the sad experience of the latter Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Kings in these times, had taught the Knighthood of <hi>England</hi>
to hold for the future Ages.</p>
               <p>No Tenant in ancient Demesnes,<note place="margin">Stat. de Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the service of a Knight.</p>
               <p>Clerks and Tenants in Socage of other Mannors than of the
King, shall be used as they have been formerly.</p>
               <p>Tenants in <hi>ancient Demesne,</hi> and Tenants in <hi>Burgage,</hi> are absolutely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
from foreign service; the one, because they are in nature of the
King's Husbandmen, and served him and his Family with Victual; the
other, because by their Tenure they were bound to the defence of their
<hi>Burrough,</hi> which in account is a Limb or Member of the Kingdom, and so
in nature of a <hi>Castle guard.</hi> Now as touching <hi>Clerks</hi> and Tenants in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage</hi>
holding of a Subject, they are left to the order of ancient use appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon Record. As concerning the Clergy, it is evident by what hath
been formerly noted, that though they were importunate to be discharged
of the service Military, in regard that their profession was for Peace, and
not for Bloud; yet could they never obtain their desire: for though their
persons might challenge exemption from that work, yet their Lands were
bound to find Arms by their Deputies; for otherwise it had been unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that so great a part of the Kingdom as the <hi>Clergie</hi> then had, should
sit still and look on, whilst by the Law of Nature every one is engaged in
his own defence. Nor yet did the profession of these men to be <hi>men for
Peace,</hi> hold always uniform: some kind of Wars then were holden <hi>sacred,</hi>
and wherein they not onely adventured their Estates, but even their own
Persons; and these not onely in a defensive way, but by way of invasion,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64112:103"/>
and many times where no need was for them to appear. Tenants in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage</hi>
also, in regard of their service, might plead exemption from the Wars:
for if not the Plough must stand still, and the Land thereby become poor
and lean. Nevertheless, a general service or defence of the Kingdom is
imposed upon all; and Husbandmen must be Souldiers, when the debate
is, who shall have the Land. In such cases therefore they are <hi>evocati ad
arma,</hi> to maintain and defend the Kingdom, but not compellable to foreign
service, as the Knights were, whose service consisted much in defence of
their Lord's person, in reference to the defence of the Kingdom; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times policy of War drew the Lords into Arms abroad, to keep the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
further from their borders, and the <hi>Knights</hi> then under their Lords
pay went along with them: and therefore the service of <hi>Knighthood</hi> is
commonly called <hi>servitium forinsecum.</hi> Of these <hi>Socagers</hi> did arise, not
onely the body of <hi>English Foot-men</hi> in their Armies,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 406.</note> but the better and
more wealthy sort of them found Arms of a <hi>Knight,</hi> as formerly hath been
observed, yet always under the pay of the common Purse. And if called
out of the Kingdom, they were meer <hi>Voluntiers;</hi> for they were not called
out by distress as <hi>Knights</hi> were, because they held not their Land by such
service; but they were summoned by <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and probably were
mustered by the high Constables in each Hundred; the Law nevertheless
remaining still entire, that all must be done not onely <hi>ad fidem Domini
Regis,</hi> but also <hi>Regni;</hi> which was disputed and concluded by the Sword.
For though Kings pretended danger to the publick oftentimes to raise the
people; yet the people would give credit as they pleased. Or if the
King's Title were in question, or the Peoples Liberty, yet every man
took liberty to side with that party that liked him best; nor did the King's
<hi>Proclamation</hi> sway much this or that way.</p>
               <p>It is true, that precedents of those times cry up the King's power of <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raying</hi>
all Ships and men without respect, unless of age, or corporal disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
but it will appear that no such <hi>array</hi> was, but in time of no less
known danger from abroad to the Kingdom, than imminent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might be wrought more from the general fear of the Enemy, than
from the King's command: And yet those times were always armed in
neighbouring Nations, and Kings might have pretended continual cause of
<hi>arraying.</hi> Secondly, it will no less clearly appear, that Kings used no such
course, but in case of general danger to the whole Kingdom, either from
foreign Invasion,<note place="margin">21 E. 1. rot. 81.</note> as in the times of King <hi>John,</hi> or from intestine Broils, as
in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the two <hi>Edwards</hi> successively. And
if the danger threatned onely one coast, the <hi>array</hi> was limited onely to the
parts adjacent thereunto. Thirdly, it seemeth that general <hi>arrays</hi> were
not levied by distress,<note place="margin">23 E. 1. Memb. 5.</note> till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and then onely for
the rendezvouze at the next Sea-coast, and for defence against foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion;
in which case all Subjects of the Kingdom are concerned by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
service: otherwise it can come unto no other account than that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Prerogative,</hi> and therein be charactered as a trick above the ordinary
strain. Fourthly, those times brought forth no general <hi>array</hi> of all persons
between the ages of sixteen years and sixty, that was made by distress in
any case of Civil War, but onely by Sheriffs summons; and in case of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
by summons to appear before the King and his Council: which
sheweth, that by the common Law they were not compellable or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Lastly, though these <hi>arrays</hi> of men were sometimes at the charge of
the King, and sometimes at the Subjects own charge, yet that last was out
of the road-way of the Subjects liberty, as the subsequent times do fully
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64112:104"/>
manifest. And the like may be said of <hi>arrays</hi> of Ships, which however
under command of Kings for publick service, were nevertheless rigged
and paid out of the publick charge. The sum of all will be, that in cases
of defence from foreign Invasion. Kings had power of <hi>array</hi> according to
the order of Law; if they exceeded that Rule, it may be more rightly
said, they did what they would, than what they ought.</p>

                  <hi>WAR</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are two births by several venters, and may like
the day and night succeed, but can never inherit each to other;
and for that cause they may claim to belong to one Father, and that one
and the same power should act in both: and yet it is no good Maxime,
That he that is the chief Commander in <hi>War,</hi> ought to be the chief in the
order of <hi>Peace.</hi> For it naturally befalls that <hi>War,</hi> especially that which
we call <hi>Civil War,</hi> like some diseases in the body, does rather breed ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
than consume them; and these must be purged by dieting the State,
and constant course of Justice, unto which the rugged Waves of <hi>War</hi> have
little or no affinity, if they have not enmity. Nevertheless, the wisdom
of our Ancestors thought it most meet to keep their Kings in work, as
well in time of <hi>Peace,</hi> as of <hi>War;</hi> and therefore as they anciently referred
the principal care thereof to the Lords, who together with certain select
persons in every County, did administer Justice in several <hi>Iters</hi> or Circuits:
so when Kings had once gotten the name of being chief in civil affairs, as
they had it in martial; they soon left the Lords behind them (who also
were willing enough with their own case) and had the name of doing all,
notwithstanding it was done by advice of the Lords, and directory of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
or Commissioners thereto deputed, And thus that <hi>Peace</hi> which
formerly passed under the Titles of <hi>Pax Domini, pax Vicecomitis,</hi> which is
<hi>pax Regni,</hi> became by eminency swallowed up in that which was called
the <hi>Kings Peace;</hi> and the Justices called the <hi>Kings Justices,</hi> and himself flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into that Title of <hi>Fountain of Justice,</hi> which belongeth onely to him
that is The Most High or Chief Law-giver.</p>
               <p>The manner how this honourable care of the Safety and <hi>Peace</hi> of the
Kingdom was employed, may be referred to a double consideration; the
one in execution of Justice upon Delinquents, the other in preventing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of offence or delinquency, by means whereof the <hi>publick Peace</hi>
might be endangered. The first was acted diversly according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sence of affairs; for what was at first done by the Princes in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits,
with one hundred of the Commons called <hi>Comites,</hi> and that done
<hi>per pagos, vicosque,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> was afterwards done by <hi>itinerant</hi> Judges, sent from the
King for the greatest matters; and by Lords in their <hi>Leets,</hi> Governours
or chief Magistrates of Towns in their <hi>Courts,</hi> and Sheriffs in their <hi>Torns,</hi> as
<hi>Judices stati</hi> for the ease of the people in matters of less moment. I say,
I conceive it was in the <hi>Torn;</hi> for I suppose no emergent Court, taken up
upon occasion,<note place="margin">52 Hen. 3. Marlb. cap. 25.</note> could by the Law draw a necessity of a sudden appearance
of all above twelve years of age at the same. And for the same cause it
seemeth, that one certain <hi>Torn</hi> every year was holden for inquiries of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,</hi>
unto which all above twelve years of age were to come, except
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64112:104"/>
                  <hi>Barons, Clergie,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> or otherwise all such had been bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on every <hi>Torn.</hi> Nevertheless, the work of the <hi>Torns</hi> continued
not to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>determine,</hi> as anciently they had done. For in <hi>Henry</hi> the
third's time,<note place="margin">Miror. cap. 2. Sect. 9.</note> and formerly, divers men had Prisons to their own use; some
as <hi>Palatines,</hi> others as Lords of <hi>Franchise,</hi> and others by power and usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and had the benefit of all <hi>Fines</hi> incident: and by this means many
were <hi>fined</hi> that deserved it not, and some also that deserved worse.<note place="margin">Mag. Charta cap. 19.</note> To
prevent which evil, <hi>Henry</hi> the third took away that power of holding <hi>Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas:</hi>
And <hi>Edward</hi> the first took away their power to <hi>determine Escapes,</hi>
and left them onely the power of <hi>inquiry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Glocest. cap. 8. West. 1. cap. 3.</note> and to <hi>certifie</hi> at the next coming
of the Justices.</p>
               <p>But these injurious times had holden too long to be forgotten, or laid
aside by such cool pursuit. Men were still ordinarily imprisoned, and so
continued oftentimes, till the coming of the Justices <hi>itinerant.</hi> For
whereas in case of Bloudshed, the Writ <hi>de odio &amp; atia</hi> was a remedy; the
other had no remedy but by procuring a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi>
which ordinarily was a cure worse than the hurt. As a remedy hereof,
<hi>Edward</hi> the first found out the new way of making <hi>Justices of Peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. Wint. 13 Edw. 1.</note> as
may appear by the Statute at <hi>Winton;</hi> which Law being purposely made
for the conserving of the <hi>Peace,</hi> providing for penalty of Crimes already
committed (as well as for the suppressing of future) ordaineth, <hi>That of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
against that Law shall be presented to Justices assigned to enquire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi>
and though these at the first might be <hi>itinerant,</hi> yet it soon made way
to <hi>resiant.</hi> And before that Statute, it seemeth the King had found out
the way, if that Note be true which is left revived into memory by that
honourable Reporter, which relating to the sixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the
first,<note place="margin">Coke Inst. 4. p. 176.</note> saith, That then <hi>prima fuit institutio justiciariorum pro pace conservanda.</hi>
And yet some semblance there is, that it was yet more ancient, even in
the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, if I mistake not the sence of that clause in his
Laws concerning Vagabonds; he ordereth that they shall be carried <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae
quae praeest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hen. 1. cap. 58.</note> although the Language be not so Clerkly as to speak the
sence out. Now though their Work as yet was but in tryal, and they
were onely trusted with power of <hi>inquiry,</hi> yet it induced a new way
wherein the <hi>Sheriff</hi> was not so much as intrusted to intermeddle; and
which not onely intermitted the course of his proceedings in such matters,
but also led the way to the dispoiling of the <hi>Sheriff's Torn,</hi> and <hi>Lord's
Leet,</hi> of that little remainder that was left them of Judicatory power in
matters that were against the <hi>Peace,</hi> and made their <hi>Inquisitory power</hi> less
regardful, and eased the Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> of much of their Work, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they were speedily to certifie up to the King, and so these matters
should be determined in Parliament, according as those Justices were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in Parliament; who as it seems were jealous of giving the power of
determining those offences into any sudden hand. To sum up then the
first part; as touching the punishment of offences against the <hi>Peace,</hi> the
wheel is now in the turning, the <hi>Leets</hi> and <hi>Torns</hi> begin to be slighted, the
labour of the Justices <hi>itinerant</hi> lessened, the Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi>
disused, by the bringing in of a new Order of <hi>Justices for the Peace</hi>
especially appointed; and the Parliament, as the supreme Providers, left
as the reserve for the asserting and maintenance of the same; albeit that
under it the power of determining much rested upon Justices or Judges
that attended the King's Court, after that the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> were setled
and confined to a certain place.</p>
               <p>The preserving of the <hi>Peace</hi> for the future, consisted in preventing and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64112:105"/>
suppressing <hi>Riots, Routs, unlawful Assemblies,</hi> and in apprehending and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of such as were actors and contrivers of such designes, and other
Malefactors. And herein we are to consider, 1. The <hi>Laws:</hi> 2. The
<hi>Means:</hi> 3. The <hi>executive power.</hi> Concerning the first, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to be made, but that the power of making <hi>Laws</hi> for the maintenance
of the Peace, rested in the Parliament, although endeavour possibly might
be used to settle the same in the sole order of the King's own person; and
therefore we find not onely the assize of Arms, but generally the substance
of the Statute at <hi>Winton,</hi> to be formerly taken up by <hi>Proclamation</hi> by
Kings, predecessors to <hi>Edward</hi> the second, who first that I can find, put
the same into force of a Law by Parliament, finding by experience that
<hi>Proclamations</hi> may declare the King's Mind, but not command the Peoples
Wills; although peradventure the thing enjoyned was of ancient use, and
little inferiour to Custom or Common Law. Such are the Distempers of
Civil Broils, that bring up <hi>Peace</hi> in the rear, as a reserve when their own
strength is wasted, rather than out of any natural inclination thereto. A
brief recollection of the Laws thus ensue:</p>
               <p>In case of Robbery or Felony committed,<note place="margin">Stat. Wint. 13 Edw. 1. cap. 1.</note> and the Delinquent
be not forth-coming or discovered, the County or Hundred shall
answer the damages.</p>
               <p>Of this, more may appear from the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
appeareth by the Law it self, to stir up the people to use all means by
pursuit with <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> and making inquisitions of the Fact with all
speed, in Townships, Hundreds, Franchises, and Counties.</p>
               <p>Persons suspected shall not be entertained or harboured by any
Inhabitant,<note place="margin">cap. 2.</note> unless he will undertake for him.</p>
               <p>Of this also formerly, both in the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws.</p>
               <p>Walled Towns shall keep their gates shut from Sun-set to Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising.

from the Feast of <hi>Ascension</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of the <hi>Watch</hi> was great: it might apprehend any Passenger
and stay him all night; and if he be a suspected person, he is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Sheriff;</hi> and if an escape be made, the party is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
with <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry.</hi> These two last Chapters were in effect in <hi>Henry</hi>

                  <hi>High-way</hi> herein intended, are such as are from one Market-Town to
another; and in such were always preserved the publick peace or safety,
for the maintenance of Commerce, and freedom of Traffick: which is, of
such publick concernment, that it hath been of very ancient institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:64112:105"/>
Every man between the age of fifteen years and forty,<note place="margin">cap. 5.</note> shall
maintain Arms in his house, according to the ancient Assize, for
the preserving of the Peace.</p>
               <p>This Chapter brings into consideration the second thing propounded,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>means</hi> of preserving of the <hi>Peace,</hi> which are two; First, by <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Arms:</hi> 2. By <hi>certifying Defaults.</hi> In the first is to be considered
the <hi>persons</hi> that are to be assessed: 2. The <hi>Arms:</hi> 3. The <hi>end.</hi> The <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
to be assessed to Arms, are indefinitely set down, and comprehend all
sorts, as wel bond as free, and others; for such are the expressions in
the Commission of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. But by the Assize of <hi>Henry</hi> the
second,<note place="margin">36 Hen. 3. M. Paris. post adversaria. Hoveden.</note> none were to be armed but <hi>Free-men,</hi> and they worth sixteen or
ten marks in Goods at the least; yet their ages are limited: by this Law
they must be between fifteen years and forty; but by the Commission in
<hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, all between fifteen and sixty years of age were to
be armed. King <hi>John arrayed</hi> all sorts, <hi>free, bond,</hi> and all others that
have <hi>Arms,</hi> or ought to have, or can carry Arms: and it seems by what
hath been formerly noted,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1213.</note> that those that were younger than their Tenure
would bear them out, were accepted into service, if they would offer
themselves; but by these courses they, though under one and twenty
years of age, were not onely accepted, but compelled to War. Under this
Title,<note place="margin">Hoveded. Hen. 2. M. Paris addit.</note> we may also touch upon the persons that were the instruments to
<hi>array</hi> these men, or rather to arm them; and these were Justices <hi>itinerant,</hi>
or one or more Commissioners, such as the King found most meet of the
service. And unto these were Commissions with instructions sent; and
sometimes Writs were directed onely to the Sheriffs, to take with them
twelve Knights of the County,<note place="margin">M. Paris post adversaria.</note> and to go into every Hundred, and call
before them all such persons as by the Law ought to be assessed at Arms,
and to cause them to be sworn to find and maintain Arms in such manner
as by the Law they then should be, or formerly were assessed; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the establishment of Arms were set down in those <hi>Writs,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
published by <hi>Proclamation.</hi> For Kings found all means little enough
to prevail to bring in alteration of Arms,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1253, &amp; 1256.</note> and of their service; which was
a thing not onely troublesome, but chargeable, and whereunto they could
not easily prevail to bring the <hi>Free-men</hi> to consent. And therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the endeavours of Kings in such cases, did not onely meet <hi>dilatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
but also <hi>deletionem,</hi> as the Historian's words are, until the way was
found out to declare an establishment by Parliament,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1253.</note> by this Statute made
at <hi>Winton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the nature of the establishment, we are to consider, that the
people of <hi>England</hi> were distinguished according to their Tenures, into
such as held by <hi>Knight-service,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. 58.</note> and such as held by <hi>Socage;</hi> and that none
but those being <hi>Free-holders,</hi> could be charged to find Arms, according as
by the Laws of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour may appear. The establishment
of Arms for the <hi>Knights,</hi> were established by their <hi>Tenures</hi> in certainty,
and therefore no need was either of Assessment or Oath to tie them to find
such Arms; but all the difficulty was, for such as were not bound by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Tenure</hi> than as free-born Subjects, all of whom do owe to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
defence, and so questionless had liberty to provide themselves of such
Arms as were by common and constant use held most advantageous against
the common Enemy, and for the publick defence. And that these were
put in certainty, may appear by the Law of King <hi>William</hi> formerly noted,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64112:106"/>
and by some instances in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws anciently used;<note place="margin">Ll. Aethelst. cap. 16.</note> amongst others,
that Law of <hi>Aethelstane, That for every Plough, every man should find two
compleat Horses.</hi> And another Order of <hi>Aetheldred</hi> nigh eighty years as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
differing from it, assessed upon <hi>every eight Hides of Land, a Helmet,
and a Coat of Mail:</hi> And the Historian tells us, <hi>That a Hide is a Plough-Land,
or so much Land as one Plough can keep in till the end of one whole year.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Huntington. An. 1008. Ll. Canut. 97.</note>
And the <hi>relief</hi> of the Noble-men of all sorts and ranks, in Horses, Helmets,
Coats of Mail, Lances, Shields, and Swords; the meanest of all which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
being called <hi>Mediocris Thainus,</hi> yielding a <hi>relief</hi> equal to the Arms of
a Knight, in the times whereof we now treat, <hi>viz.</hi> one Horse, one Helmet,
one Coat of Mail, one Lance, one Shield, one Sword: all comprehended
under <hi>arma sua,</hi> as if he had a certain <hi>proper Arms.</hi> And the Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the forfeiture of Arms, do in effect affirm the thing, <hi>viz. that all
men were armed;</hi> yet probable it is, that laws were not then so often made
for the enforcing this or that particular sort of Arms, in regard that till the
<hi>Normans</hi> time this Island was troubled but seldom with any Enemies from
foreign parts, that brought any new sorts of Weapons into fashion; the
<hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi> being no other than an old Acquaintance of theirs.
Neither were the <hi>Saxons</hi> as yet tamed by any Enemy, so far as to beg a
Peace, albeit that the <hi>Danes</hi> had gotten them under. But after the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
times, the <hi>English</hi> being somewhat over-matched in War, inclined
more to Husbandry, and began to lay aside their regard of Arms; and this
occasioned the Kings to make Assessments of Arms: yet having regard
to the ancient course of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> saving that they urged the use of the
Bow more than formerly was used, and thereby taught the conquered to
conquer the Conquerours in future ages. Of these sorts of Assessments
before this Stature at <hi>Winton,</hi> I find but two; the first made by <hi>Henry</hi> the
second, and the other by <hi>Henry</hi> the third; which, together with that of this
Statute, I parallel thus together, in their own words.</p>

               <p>I have thus impaled these three, that the Reader may the better discern
how they relate each to other, and so may the better understand the
matter in the sum. And I must explain three or four words in them as
they are set down, before I can bring up the conclusion; because the
mistake of the sence of the words hath made some mistake the intent
of the thing,<note place="margin">Lipsius de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. Rom. lib. 3. Dialog. 6.</note> and forced the same to an unwarrantable issue. <hi>Lorica</hi>
signifies that piece of Armour that defends the breast, or forepart of
the body; and sometimes is made of plates of Iron, of which sort I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
those of the old <hi>Germans</hi> were, (whereof the Historian maketh
mention,<note place="margin">Tacirus.</note> 
                  <hi>paucis loricae,</hi> he saith the <hi>Germans</hi> had few Arms of defence of
their foreparts, and fewer Helmets or Head-pieces) for otherwise, if they
had Iron defences for their heads, they would not have been content with
defences made of Leather for their fore-parts,<note place="margin">Cluer. Germ. p. 339. 34.</note> as in the first rude times
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64112:107"/>
they might have been. Sometimes it is made of links of Iron, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is called a <hi>Coat of Mail;</hi> but I conceive it cannot be so meant in
the assessments of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, because that
those of the second degree are said that they ought to keep <hi>Hauberget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
or <hi>Halburgellum,</hi> or <hi>Haubertum;</hi> all which are but several dialects of
one name, and are taken for a <hi>Coat of Mail:</hi> and therefore by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of names in one and the same assessment, I do conclude that the
Armour was not of one and the same fashion. But it is evident, that
by <hi>Hauberk</hi> in the assessment of the Statute at <hi>Wint.</hi> is meant a <hi>Coat
of Mail,</hi> and is never taken for a Brest-plate or <hi>Gorget,</hi> as hath been
taken upon trust by some that build more weighty conclusions upon
that weak principle, than it is able to bear: and for the truth hereof, as
the word is a <hi>French</hi> word, so I appeal to all <hi>French</hi> Authors, and shall
not trouble the Reader with the notation of the word, or further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the meaning thereof. In the last place, as great mistake is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the word <hi>Shapell de fer,</hi> which is taken by some to betoken a <hi>Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
of Iron:</hi> For the truth whereof, the Reader may consider the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
word <hi>Capellum,</hi> or <hi>Capelletum,</hi> and he shall find that it is an <hi>Iron cap,</hi>
or an ordinary <hi>Head-piece:</hi> and in the Assize of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, it holds
the place of <hi>Cassis</hi> in the Assize of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. For the manner
of all these, let the Reader view the Sculptures of the several <hi>Norman</hi>
Kings, armed for the Charge, in the beginning of their several Reigns,
as they are represented in <hi>Speed</hi>'s History. It may also be conceived,
that there is as much mistake of that Weapon which is called <hi>Cultellum</hi>
or <hi>Cotel,</hi> whilst they translate it by the word <hi>Knife;</hi> for though it be true
that it is one signification of that word, yet it appears not onely by this
Law, that it was a Weapon for a <hi>Knight</hi> in War, but in use at <hi>Tornaments,</hi> as
by that Statute that forbids the use of a <hi>pointed Sword,</hi> or <hi>pointed Cotel,</hi>
a <hi>Battoon,</hi> or a <hi>Mace,</hi> at that sport: and therefore it may seem to be some
Weapon of greater use, either a <hi>Cotellax,</hi> or such-like Weapon; otherwise
to enjoyn the finding of a <hi>Knife</hi> to a man as an offensive Weapon against
armed men in <hi>Battle,</hi> would serve to no use at all.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the difference between the several Assizes aforesaid,
it consisteth either in the number of the several degrees or ranks of those
that are assessed: Or secondly, in the manner of their valuation: Or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the particulars of their Arms assessed upon them. As touching the
degrees in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's time, they were but Three, in regard that
he onely assessed <hi>Free-holders:</hi> and certainly that was the ancient Law,
as by the Law of the Conquerour, and other <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
may appear. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Third taking example of King <hi>John,</hi>
who was the first founder of general <hi>arrays,</hi> charged all but such as were
men of nothing; albeit, I find not that such as were of the inferiour degree,
were sworn to those Arms, but rather allowed to have them. And though
the Statute at <hi>Winchester</hi> holdeth to the same degrees in Lands, yet in the
value of Goods there is some difference, in favour of them that onely have
stock and no <hi>Free-hold.</hi> Secondly, there is some difference in the manner
of valuation of <hi>Lands</hi> with <hi>Chattels;</hi> and therein the Statute at <hi>Winton</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
the personal estates, more than <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and he more than <hi>Hen.</hi> 2.
and yet all of them pretend one rule of ancient custom; I believe they
mean, that they had it in their eye, but not in their heart: For they would
come as night to it as they could, and yet keep as far from it as they durst.
Thirdly, as touching the difference of the Arms between these three assess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it seems so small, as in this they are most of them all one. For
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64112:107"/>
wherein <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. leads, both <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. do imitate, saving that
they add the <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Sword;</hi> which questionless was to be understood
as a granted case, that the compleat Arms of a man could not be carried
and managed without a <hi>Horse,</hi> nor defended without a <hi>Sword.</hi> As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other alterations, it might be done upon good advice, as not being
deemed méet that such as were no <hi>Knights</hi> but in Estate, should be armed
in every respect like as the <hi>Knights</hi> were. And thus we have an ancient
custom of maintaining Arms by every <hi>Free man,</hi> for the defence of the
Kingdom, first made uncertain by the avarice of Kings, and negligence
of the <hi>Free-men,</hi> and brought into an arbitrary charge; at length redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a certainty, upon all sorts of Inhabitants by a Statute-Law (if so
it then were) unto which every man had yielded himself bound by his
own consent. But to what end is all this? I said it was for the defence
of the Kingdom, and so it was in the original; and yet also for the safety
of the King in order thereunto, and for the safety and maintenance of
the peace of every member of the whole body. This in one lump thus
will not down with some, who will have this assessment onely to be for
keeping of the peace against <hi>Routs</hi> and <hi>Riots,</hi> but not sufficient nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be supply for War, when <hi>Edward</hi> the First calls for it; because <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the First shall not have his power confined within the compass of a
Statute, but to be at liberty of <hi>array</hi> as he should think meet: and it is
not to be denied but the words of this Law run thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the intent
thereof is <hi>for preserving of the peace;</hi> but those general words will not
bear the power of a restrictive sence: for certainly the <hi>peace</hi> is as well
preserved by providing against <hi>War,</hi> as against <hi>Riots;</hi> and against <hi>Forrein
War,</hi> as <hi>Intestine Mutinies.</hi> And that the Statute intended the one, as
well as the other, will appear, because it was made in relation to former
precedents of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; and they speak plainly that their intent
was to strengthen the Kingdom against dangers from abroad. The
words of the Historian are clear, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Third charged all that
had 15 <hi>libratas terrae,</hi> and upwards, should undertake the Arms of
a Knight,<note place="margin">M. Paris. fol. 916.</note> 
                  <hi>ut Anglia, sicut Italia, militia roboraretur.</hi> And because he
had threats from beyond Sea,<note place="margin">M. Paris. fol. 864.</note> by the defection of the <hi>Gascoigns,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he caused Writs to issue forth throughout the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Vid. post. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaria. M. Paris.</note> that <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
pristinam consuetudinem,</hi> assessment of Arms should be <hi>secundum facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates;</hi>
and in one of the Writs published by the Historian, the express
assessment of <hi>H.</hi> 3. formerly mentioned, is particularly set down. Nor
are these <hi>Arms</hi> thus assessed, so slight as men would pretend: for the
<hi>Arms</hi> of the first Rank were the compleat Arms of a <hi>Knight,</hi> and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
equal thereunto; for those 15 <hi>libratae terrae</hi> amounted to 780 Acres
of Land, as the late publisher of <hi>Paris</hi> his History hath it: and is very
nigh the reckoning of <hi>Henry Huntington,</hi> who (as hath been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
layeth a Helmet and Coat of Mail unto eight Hides of Land, which
according to <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilburie</hi>'s account cometh to 800 Acres,<note place="margin">Cap. penult.</note> every
Hide containing one hundred Acres. These therefore were better than
Hoblers. And the succeeding Ranks found Arms also proportionable to
their Estates, as considerable as the times could find for such as were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use, and might be supplied with other Weapons as occasion served,
and as they might be of most benefit for the service.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas it's said, that the wisdom of the Parliament
might be questioned, if they intended no better provision against an
Enemy than against a Thief or Rogue; I should desire the consideration
of those men, whether are those Thieves and Rogues, in Troops or bodies,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64112:108"/>
and well armed, or are they a sort of scattered Out-laws, lightly armed
to fly away, when they have gotten the prey? If they were in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
posture, I pray what difference in point of difficulty of suppressing,
between them and so many Enemies? and if it was discretion in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to make this provision against the one, certainly these, with the
<hi>Knight-hood</hi> of the Kingdom, with as much discretion, will be sufficient
provision against the other. But if these be looked upon in the later
sence, I fear the discretion of the Parliament would have been much more
questioned in arming all men that have any ability to suppress Thieves
and Rogues, against which the ordinary <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was an ancient and approved remedy, and sufficient safe-guard. And
I would fain know of these men, whether it be for the safety of <hi>Edward</hi>
the First, or any other King, to arm the whole body of the people, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in times of jealousie, for suppressing of Thieves and Robbers, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it may be done by a guard of known men in every County, with much
more ease, and less charge to the people.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas it is endeavoured to make this Statute but a temporary
provision, and taken up for the present condition of affairs, when Thieves
and Robbers went with great strength, and in multitudes: This might
be, I grant, of some efficacy, if it had been <hi>introductio novi juris;</hi> but it
being grounded upon a former Custom, the ground of that custom (which
was <hi>defence of the Kingdom</hi>) must be the warrant of the Law; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the present inconvenience might be remedied by a present Order, and
needed not the help of a Law that should rest upon former Custom, or
provide for future generations. Nevertheless, if all be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that
this Statute is but a present Order, that the <hi>Arms</hi> therein are too slight
to resist an Enemy, and the end thereof was onely to enable the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
against Thieves and Robbers; yet could not <hi>Edward</hi> the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have any power to <hi>assess Arms</hi> at pleasure upon occasion of War,
for the defence of the Kingdom; nor is there any precedent in story that
countenanceth it, seeing <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, in their
course used the rule <hi>secundum facultates,</hi> as had been formerly observed;
and the rule foregoing tended onely to <hi>Free-men</hi> and their Lands. Nor
did King <hi>John</hi> disclaim the same, but pursued it; (and yet if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
precedent of Prerogative in story, which King <hi>John</hi> had not, that King
will be looked upon as a King of wonderment) I say, King <hi>John</hi> pursued
it when he was in the strength of his distemper, threatned by the Pope,
provoked by the <hi>French</hi> King now ready in the field, vexed by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and himself scarce himself, summons to defend himself, themselves,
and the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> all men that ought to have Arms, or may
have Arms, and such as have no Arms, and yet <hi>arma habere possint,</hi> let
them also come <hi>ad capiendum solidatas nostras;</hi> and accordingly there came
a vast number, not onely of the armed men, but of the unarmed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
who afterward were sent to their own home when victuals failed.
Hitherto therefore King <hi>John</hi> not above three years before his death, held
himself to the assessment to Arms onely of such as had Lands; and at
this time of exigency, others unarmed were summoned to take Arms
from the King with their pay, or otherwise they must fight without Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
               <p>I am now come to the last general point, which concerneth the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive
power of matters concerning the peace within this Law, touching
which the Statute enforceth this, That <hi>Constables</hi> in every Hundred and
Franchise shall have the view of Arms, and shall present defaults against
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64112:108"/>
the Statute of Justices assigned, who shall certifie the same to the King in
every Parliament, and the King shall provide remedy. Whereby it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
manifest, that hitherto no Law or Custom was made against any for
default of Arms, but onely such as held by that Tenure: and therefore
they had a shift to cause them to swear to maintain Arms, and so might
proceed upon defaults, as in case of perjury; and that the Parliament
was still loth to set any certain rule for penalty, and absolutely declined
it, and left it under a general <hi>periculo incumbente,</hi> which it is likely men
would rather eschew by obedience, than adventure upon out of a daring
spirit, unless their case was very clear, within the mercy of common
reason. And therefore such cases were left to special order of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
rather than they would deliver such a rod as <hi>determining power</hi> was,
over into any uncertain hand whatever. It is very true, that by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of some, this also hath been controverted, as if all the <hi>executive power</hi>
had been turned out of the Parliaments Order, into the <hi>directory</hi> of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the First: which thing reacheth far; for then in order thereunto,
the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom must have been under his safe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
And whether it ever entred into the conceit of that King I know
not, but somewhat like thereunto, is not obscurely urged to nourish and
suggest such a kind of notion, and so derive it unto his Successors, upon
the words of a Statute <hi>de defensione portandi armorum,</hi> the English where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I shall render out of the French as followeth:</p>
               <p>It belongeth to Vs, (viz. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.) and from Vs by Our Royal Seigniory,
to defend force of Arms, and all other force against Our peace, at all times that
We shall please; and to punish according to the Laws and Vsages of this Realm,
such as shall oppose; and to this they (viz. <hi>Lords and Commons</hi>) are bound
Vs to aid as their good Lord, always when need shall be.</p>
               <p>Two things are concurrant with this, which is the body of the Statute,
if such it be. The one is the Preface, or the occasion: And the second
is the conclusion upon the whole body of the same. The preface first
sets down the inscription or direction of the Law; not to the people, but
to the Justices of his Bench; and so it is in nature of a <hi>Writ</hi> or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sent unto his Judges. Then it sets down the occasion, which was a
debate between <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and his Lords, with a Treaty which was had
before certain persons deputed thereto: and it was accorded, that at the
next Parliament, Order shall be taken by common consent of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, that in all Parliaments, Treaties, and other
Assemblies which shall be had in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> for ever after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all men shall come thereto <hi>without force,</hi> and <hi>without arms,</hi> well and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably:
and thence it recites, that the said meeting at Parliament was had,
and that there the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and Commonalty being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to advise upon this matter; <hi>nous eiont dit,</hi> saith one Copy, and <hi>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
eions dit,</hi> saith another Copy: so as whether this was the Declaration of
the King unto the Parliament, or of the Parliament to the King, is one
doubt, and a principal one it is in such a case as this. Then the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all is, that the King commandeth these things shall be read before
the Justices in the Bench, and there enrolled; and this is dated the <hi>30th</hi>
of <hi>October</hi> in the Seventh year of his Reign, which was <hi>Ann.</hi> 1279. So
as if it were the Declaration of the King, then it implieth as if it were not
very well accepted of the Parliament; and therefore the King would
have it rest upon Record in nature of a Claim or <hi>Protestando,</hi> for saving
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64112:109"/>
the Prerogative of the Crown. But if it were the Declaration of the
Parliament, the King held it so precious a flower, that fearing it should
fade, set it in a private Garden of his own, that it might be more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nursed against the blast of Time; as if the Parliament had not assented
thereto, or (if they did) meaned not to hold it forth to the world for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times to be a constant rule, but onely by way of concession, to ease
themselves of the present difficulty, in making a Law against wearing of
Armour in ordinary civil affairs, and so referred it to the King's care to
provide against emergent breach of the peace, as an expedient for the
present inconveniences in affairs. And it will well suit with the posture
of affairs then in course: for the <hi>Welsh</hi>-Wars were now intermitted, and a
quiet of three years ensued; in the midst of which, Souldiers having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do nothing (and that is next to naught) but recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
used their wonted guise, as if they were not dressed that day that
they were not armed; nor fit for counsel, unless (as their Ancestors)
with Weapons in their hands; nor worthy of the presence of a King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other notion, than as a General in the field, and themselves as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
that are never <hi>A-la-mode</hi> but when all in Iron and Steel. I say,
to make a Law that must suddenly bind men from riding or being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
when no man thought himself safe otherwise, was in effect to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their bare necks to the next turn of the Sword of a King that they
did not over-much trust, and the less in regard he trusted not them. I
do not wonder therefore if the Parliament liked not the work, but left
it to the King to provide for the keeping off breaches of the Peace, and
promised their assistance therein.</p>
               <p>Lastly, supposing all that is or can be supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had given up the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> unto <hi>Edward</hi> the First; yet it
was not to all intents, nor did it continue: for besides the Statute of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi>
which sheweth plainly that the ordering of Armour was in the
power of the Parliament, and which in all probability was made after that
Law last before-mentioned; the Statute at <hi>Winton,</hi> made after this Law
nigh six years space, ordereth the use of the <hi>Trained bands</hi> in maintaining
the peace, and reserveth the penalties to themselves for any default com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against the said Act. And therefore, notwithstanding any thing
that yet appeareth to me out of any Law or History, the chief Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship
of War and Peace, within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> resteth hitherto
upon the Parliament next unto God; and in the King no otherwise, than
in order to the Publick, the rule whereof can be determined by no other
Judge than that which can be intended to have no other respect than the
publick good, and which is the Abridgement of the large Volume of the
Kingdom.</p>

Summary Conclusion.</head>
               <p>ANd thus have I brought the shape of <hi>English</hi> Government (rude
as it is) from the first off-spring of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> through the
rough waves of the <hi>Danish</hi> Tempests, the Rocks of <hi>Norman</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
and of the Quick-sands of Arbitrary Government under Popes
and Kings, to the Haven: much defaced it is, I confess, by the rage of time,
and yet retained the original likeness in proportion.</p>
               <p>Kings first (about the <hi>Norman</hi> times) joyning with the Lords for their
joynt interest above the ordinary pitch, had mounted each other too
high to be Lords over <hi>Free men.</hi> Then by flattering of the <hi>Free-men</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their designs, hovered above them all; but not being able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their pitch so long as the Lords held together, stooped for a party
amongst them, and soon obtained their desire. For some Lords (more
ambitious than others, and these again more popular than they) seek se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
interests. And thus Kings (aided by their party to a Supremacy
which they were never born to; and raised by them into a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above their Peers, which neither Law nor Custom ever gave them)
are of Moderators in the Council of Lords, become Moderators of those
Councils; and so they obtained all that the Lords had, but no more. For
though both they and the Lords abused their power over the <hi>Free-men</hi> by
extortion and oppression, as Lords over Tenants; yet could they never
prevail over them as free-born Subjects, to gain their consent to give their
Right, or the Law, up to the King's beck: but still the Law remained
arbiter both of King and People, and the Parliament Supream Expounder
and Judge both of it and them. For other argument hereof there will
be little need (besides what hath formerly appeared) than what we find
in <hi>Bracton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bracton, lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> cap. 16.</note> who wrote in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to this effect:
<hi>God is superiour to the King, and the Law by which he is made King, and his
Court,</hi> viz. <hi>the Earls and Barons: Earls (according to their name</hi> Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)
<hi>are the Kings Associates, and he that hath an Associate hath a Master;
and therefore if the King be unbridled, or (which is all one) without Law,
they ought to bridle him, unless they will be unbridled as the King, and then
the Commons may cry, Lo Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. This was the judgement of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Lawyer of the state of an <hi>English</hi> King, in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time.
I shall add hereto a concurrent testimony of a Lawyer also in <hi>Edward</hi> the
First's time.<note place="margin">Miror. Just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> P. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Although</hi> (saith he) <hi>the King ought to have no equal in the
Land; yet because the King nor his Commissioners (in case where the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencheth
upon the right of any of his Subjects) can be both Judge and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the King by right ought to have Companions, to hear and determine in
Parliament all Writs and plaints of wrongs done by the King, the Queen, or
their Children, and of those wrongs especially, whereof otherwise common right
cannot be had.</hi> Nor is this the opinion onely of Lawyers, but it is the
Law it self unto which the Royal assent was added,<note place="margin">Edw. 2.</note> and the same sealed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64112:110"/>
with an Oath in the solemn stipulation made by Kings at their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the people then present, in the name of the whole body: the
sum whereof is wont to be propounded to the King in this manner,<note place="margin">Remonst. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem. l. 2. An. 1642.</note> though
in a different Language.</p>
               <p>1. Will you grant and keep, and by your
Oath confirm to the people of <hi>England</hi> the
Laws and Customs to them granted by
the ancient Kings of <hi>England,</hi> your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and godly Predecessors; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the Clergie and People, by the
glorious King St. <hi>Edward</hi> your Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor?</p>
               <p>The King's Answer: <q>
                     <hi>I do them grant
and promise.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>2. Will you keep to God and the Church,
and the Clergie, and the People, Peace and
Concord sincerely according to your
power?</p>
               <p>The King's Answer: <q>
                     <hi>I will do it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>3. Do you grant to hold and keep the
Laws and rightful Customs, which the
Commonalty of your Realm shall have
chosen, and to maintain and enforce them
to the honour of God after your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</p>
               <p>The King's Answer: <q>
                     <hi>I this do grant
and promise.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In few words, the King promised to keep the Laws already made, the
peace of his Kingdom, and the Laws to be agreed upon by the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty:
the same in substance with that of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, <hi>William</hi> the
Conquerour, the <hi>Danish</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings formerly had, and in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
discourse observed. And thus is he led to the Throne in a Chain
of Gold, a serious memorial of the King's duty as he is a man, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ornament to him as a King. If then the King be under the Law
in case of direction, as by stipulation he is bound; if he be likewise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64112:110"/>
the Law in case of transgression, to be judged by his <hi>Comites,</hi> or <hi>Peers;</hi>
Hitherto certainly an English King is but <hi>Primas inter omnes,</hi> and not <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
totum;</hi> and if at any time he skipped higher, he afterwards fell low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
for it was the lot of these times to have Lords that were bent to
work the people to regard their own Liberties, in which the Lords had
first wrapped up their own Claims. Thus come the counsels of such as
have been notoriously exorbitant to be scanned; and to bring these into
frame, all run out of frame; the <hi>Barons</hi> Wars arise, and thrive according
as interests do concenter more or less: the issue is like that of a drawn
battle, wherein he that continueth last in the Field, is glad to be gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and so the Title is left to be tried upon the next advantage that shall
arise.</p>
               <p>Yet had Kings gotten one step forwards to their designe, which was,
in that they now had to deal with a divided <hi>Baronage.</hi> It was the birth
of Ambition, and it was nourished by the same milk; for those that
side with the King are become <hi>Magnificoes</hi> next to the King's person, and
the sole managers of all the great affairs of State, concurrent with their
own designes under-board. But the other Lords are in account rural,
standing further off; and looking on at a distance, are laid away as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
And as they themselves are out of the game of great men,
so grow they mindless of their interest in the great affairs: yet of these
there is diversity; for some sport themselves in their condition; others
observe the irregular motions of those above, and watch their own
time.</p>
               <p>This was the first advance of that society, which was afterwards called
the <hi>Privy Council;</hi> being a company of choice men according to the
King's bent, unto whom the consideration of all the weighty affairs of
the Kingdom is committed; but nothing can be concluded without the
King's <hi>fiat,</hi> which regularly should follow upon the premisses, according
to the major vote; but more ordinarily suiteth with that which best suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his pleasure. And now are Parliaments looked on as fatal, or at
the best but as heavy dull Debates, and inconvenient both for speed and
secrecy; which indeed are advantages for weak and unwarrantable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;
but such as are well-grounded upon truth, and strength of reason
of State, are not afraid to behold the clearest noon-day; and prevail nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by speed nor secrecy, but by the power of uncontrolled Reason fetcht
from truth it self. The <hi>Grand Council</hi> of Lords also are now no less bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome:
For though they were not able to prevail against the private
designes of an arbitrary Supremacy, yet do they hinder the progress, tell
tales to the people, and blot the names of those that are of that aspiring
humour; which once done, like that of <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> they have no other end
of their labour than their toil.</p>
               <p>Thus perished that ancient and rightly honourable <hi>Grand Council of
Lords,</hi> having first laid aside the publick, then lost unity, and lastly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
besides the extream danger of the whole body. For the sence
of State once contracted into a <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> is soon contracted into a
<hi>Cabinet-Council,</hi> and last of all into a <hi>Favourite</hi> or <hi>two;</hi> which many times
brings damage to the publick, and both themselves and Kings into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<hi>praecipices;</hi> partly for want of maturity, but principally through
the providence of God over-ruling irregular courses to the hurt of such as
walk in them.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>Clergie</hi> idle in this bustle of affairs, although not very
well employed; for it is not to be imagined but that these private prizes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64112:111"/>
plaid between the Lords, Commons, and King, laid each other open to
the aim of a forrein pretension, whilst they lay at their close guard one
against another. And this made an Ecclesiastical power to grow upon
the Civil, like the Ivy upon the Oak, from being Servants to Friends, and
thence <hi>Lords of Lords,</hi> and <hi>Kings of Kings.</hi> By the first putting forth,
it might seem to be a Spiritual Kingdom; but in the blossom, which now
is come to some lustre, it is evident to be nothing but a Temporal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
over the Consciences of men; and so, like Cuckows, laying their
Eggs in nests that are none of their own, they have their brood brought
up at the publick charge. Nevertheless, this their Monarchy was as yet
beyond their reach; it was Prelacy that they laboured for, pretending to the
Pope's use, but in order to themselves. The Cripple espyed their halting,
and made them soon tread after his pace; he is content they should be
Prelates without measure, within their several Diocesses and Provinces,
so as he may be the sole <hi>Praelatissimo</hi> beyond all comparison. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
thus had been before these times destroyed the very principles
of the Church-Government of this Kingdom, but that two things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
the work: The one, that the Papalty was a forrein power; and
the other, that as yet the Pope was entangled with the power of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
if he did not stoop thereunto. The first of these two, was the most
deadly <hi>Herb</hi> in the <hi>Pottage,</hi> and made it so unsavoury, that it could never
be digested in this Kingdom: For Kings looking upon this as an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their Prerogative, and the People also as an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their Liberties, both or one of them were ever upon the
guard, to keep out that which was without, and would be ruled neither
by Law nor Counsel. And therefore though both Kings and People,
yielded much unto the importunity of these men, and gave them many
priviledges whereby they became great, yet was their greatness depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon the Law of the Land and Vote of Parliament; and though
they had the more power, they nevertheless were not one jot the more
absolute, but still the Law kept above their top. I deny not but they in
their practice exceeded the rule often, and lifted themselves above their
rank; yet it is as well to be granted, that they could never make Law
to bind the Church-men, much less the Laity, but by conjunction of the
Grand Councils both for Church and Commonwealth-affairs; nor could
they execute any Law in case that concerned the Liberty or Propriety of
either, but in a Synodical way, or as deputed by the Parliament in that
manner. And therefore I must conclude, that in these times whereof
we treat, the principles of Church-Government, so far as warranted
by Law, were in their nature <hi>Presbyterial;</hi> that is, both in making Laws
and executing them, Bishops and Arch-bishops were never trusted with
the sole administration of them, but in and by consent of Synods, in
which the Clergy and Laity ought to have their joynt vote. And all
power more, or contrary hereto, was at the best an usurpation coloured
by practice; which was easily attained, where there was a perpetual
Moderatorship resting in the Bishop, and over all the Pope; the <hi>King,
Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in the mean while being buried in pursuit of several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
elsewhere.</p>
               <p>To make all semblable, the <hi>Free-men</hi> met with the sad influence of
these distempers, as well from the King and Lords, as the Clergy. Kings
to save their own stake from the Pope, remitted of that protection which
they owed to their Subjects, and let in upon them a floud of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and extortions from the <hi>Romish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Clergy, and so like a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64112:111"/>
little ship cast out a Barrel for the Whale to pursue, till it gets away:
But this changed no right. The Lords by their parties shattered them
asunder, and dismembred their body by intestine broils. The Clergy
more craftily making some of them free Denizons of the <hi>Roman</hi> See,
and taking them into their protection, whilst others of the <hi>Free-men</hi> at
a distance, were exposed as a prey to the continual assaults of those devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
times: All these conspired together to deface and destroy that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and goodly bond of Brotherhood, the Law of <hi>Decenners,</hi> by which
the <hi>Free-men,</hi> formerly holden together like Cement in a strong Wall,
are now left like a heap of loose stones, or so many single men, scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
escaping with their skin of Liberties, and those invaded by many
projects, and shifts in Government of State-affairs. So must I leave
them until some happy hand shall work their repair, both for time
and manner, as it shall please <hi>that great and wise Master-builder of the
World.</hi>

attained by these Ecclesiastical men; the former Treatise hath already
said what was thought needful concerning that. For the future, I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
premise this, that the ensuing times being thus blessed with a Truce,
or stricter League between the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> the errours in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
more readily do appear; the corruptions in natures of men
more frequently discover themselves; and thereby the body of the Statute-Laws
begins to swell so big, that I must be enforced to contract my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them into a narrower compass, and render the same unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
so far forth only as they shall concern the general stream of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
leaving those of privater regard unto every mans particular conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as occasion shall lead him. For whatever other men please to insist
upon, this I take for a Maxime, <hi>That though the Government of a King is
declared by his Actions; yet the Government of a Kingdom is onely manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by ancient Customs, and publick Acts of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because I have undertaken a general Survey of the Reigns of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
several Kings and Queens of this Nation, (for I shall not exceed the
issue of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) and to handle each of them apart, will leave
the Reader in a Wilderness of particulars, hard to comprehend in the
general sum; I shall therefore reduce them all into three heads, <hi>viz.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>Title,</hi> Interest of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and Interest of <hi>Religion;</hi> the last
of which swayed much the three Children of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; the
second as much in their two Ancestors, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Seventh; and the first in the three <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and three
succeeding Kings of the House of <hi>York.</hi> And because <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
and his Grand-child <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, do come under none of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
I shall consider them joyntly, as in way of <hi>Exordium</hi> to the rest,
although the course of the latter was as different from the former, as Lust
falls short of a generous Spirit.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. A sum of the several Reigns of Edward the Third, and Richard
the Second.</head>
               <p>SEveral I may well call them, because they are the most different in
their ways and ends of any two of that race that ever swayed their
Scepter; and yet the entrance of the first, gave countenance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the last. For the Scepter being cast away or lost by <hi>Edward</hi>
the Second, it was the lot of his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, a youth of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, to take it up: he knowing whose it was, and feeling it
too heavy for him, was willing enough it should return; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swayed
by Counsels drawn from reason of State, and pressed thereto by
those that resolved not to trust his Father any more, he wisely chose to
manage it himself, rather than to adventure it in another hand. But that
is not all: for as it is never seen that the Crown doth thrive after divorce
from the Scepter, but like a blasted Blossom, falls off at the next gale of
adversity; such was the issue to <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, his power once gone,
his Honour followeth soon after: he had ceased to be King, and within a
small time did cease to be <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Son, thus made compleat by his Fathers spoil, had the honour to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64112:115"/>
be the Repairer of the ruines that his Father had made; and was a Prince
which you might think by his story to be seldom at home, and by his
Laws seldom abroad. Nor can it be reconciled without wonder, that
Providence should at once bestow upon <hi>England,</hi> a courageous People,
brave Captains, wise Council, and a King that had the endowments of
them all. Otherwise it had out-reached conceit it self, that this small
Island, wasted by the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> the people beaten out of heart by all
Enemies in the time of the Father, should nevertheless, in the time of the
Son, with honour wade through so many difficulties of mighty Wars on
every side abroad, and devouring Pestilence at home; and yet lay a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of an opulent, wise, and peaceable Government for future Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Yet he had his failings and misfortunes; a great part whereof may be
attributed to infirmity of age, which in the first part of his Reign was
too little, and in the latter part too much. True it is, that Governours
of the persons of Kings may in some measure supply defects of <hi>Non-age;</hi>
but seldom where the Governours are many, and never if they be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious.
And it was this King's fate to miscarry in both; for he had in
his Youth Twelve Governours by constitution, and they, two supream
by usurpation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> till they were both consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the flame which themselves had kindled. And this disparity
wrought somewhat unsuccessfully in the King's first War: For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
of his spirit (himself being young and active) minded his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to advise him employment in a forrein War, rather than they would
adventure its motion at home, lest it might prove circular; which is most
dangerous for Government, if the Prince be not under command of
himself.</p>
               <p>This first War was with <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose power was inferiour to that
of <hi>France;</hi> the King young, and the danger nearer; and therefore though
the last affront was from <hi>France,</hi> that more fresh in memory, and more
poinant, yet the King was advised to give place, and speak fair, till he
had tried masteries with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereby secured his Rear. This he
wisely hearkned unto, and met with such a successful turn of Providence,
that like an <hi>O Yes,</hi> before a Proclamation, gives warning to <hi>Scotland</hi> that
the Wheel is turned upon them; and that there is somewhat more than
humane motion in the matter, that exasperates the English upon an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
so often crossed by Providence hitherto; and the King also (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a Souldier in hope as yet) to dare against those that had so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
foiled his Father, and also put himself already once to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
               <p>And yet there did concur a kind of necessity of second Causes; for
the King found the Crown engaged, and the minds of the <hi>Scots</hi> so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
as the <hi>English</hi>-man's case was not to live to fight, but to fight to
live; and so imbittered against one another by the fierce Wars under
the <hi>Barons,</hi> that nothing could quench the fire, but the withdrawing of
the Brands into Forreign action; like some angry spirits, that spoil their
own bodies, unless they chide or fight it out with others.</p>
               <p>In the first brunt with <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King gained nothing, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the humours of some of his great Lords; which once purged
out, he renews the War, prevails, and after ten years stir (wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a trained Souldier against the <hi>Scots</hi>) he wan the Cross, and then goes to
play his Prize in <hi>France,</hi> to compleat his Crown with the Flower-de-luce:
Which was the great work of the rest of his Reign, in which four parts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64112:116"/>
of five were victorious; the fifth and last was declining, like some Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
that win at the first, and for want of observation of the turning of
the Dice, come off losers at the end.</p>
               <p>For the King being rather satiated than satisfied with Victory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
returned home to enjoy what he had, leaving his Son, the <hi>Black
Prince,</hi> to pursue the War, and to act the Souldiers alone, who now began
to honour his Valour above his Father's. But the Tide is spent, the Prince
of Chivalry dies, the brave Commanders wasted; and the <hi>French,</hi> too
sickle to continue subject to the <hi>English</hi> longer than needs must, tack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
for another adventure, and make it plain, <hi>That</hi> France <hi>is too big to be
Garrison'd by</hi> England, <hi>and that it will cost</hi> England <hi>more to hold it than to
have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Religion was more to the purpose, than of any of his Predecessors
since the <hi>Norman</hi> times: He re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lected upon God in common events, more
ordinarily than the general stream of the <hi>Clergie</hi> did in those days.<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> He
loved, if not adored, devout men and their prayers, and yet intentively
disclaimed opinion of merits in the Creature. He saw the Pope through
and through, loved him but little, feared him less, and yet lost neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
nor power thereby.</p>
               <p>His chief policy at home, was, to be much at home, great with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and they great with him: what the Parliament did, he accounted
well done; he never questioned their power, though he was over-reached
in questioning their Wisdom. For he that shall prefer his own wisdom
above that of the Parliament, must needs think himself extreamly wise;
and so much the more to know himself to be such. But the worst of his
fate was, to live to his Winter-age, and after fifty years Reign, or more,
to die in his minority under the rule of a woman of none of the best
fame, after he had enjoyed the honour of greatest note in the <hi>Christian</hi>
world in his days.</p>
               <p>Such was not <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Rich. 2.</note> though the onely Son of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Chieftain, the <hi>Black Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> a renowned Son of a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Father; but (as a Plant transplanted into a Savage soyl) in degree and
disposition wholly degenerate, retaining a tincture of the light inconstancy
of his Mother, and the luxuriousness of his great Grandfather <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second; and running his course, he came to his end.</p>
               <p>His entrance,<note place="margin">The. lib. 4. c. 21</note> however by colour of Inheritance, yet was a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
than his Predecessors, that came in by Election; upon the desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his Father by his last Will, say some. For this man came in upon
many disadvantages, both of time and person: The times were very
troublesome, the Kingdom new wrapped up in a double War abroad,
and (which is worse) flouded with distraction at home, contracted part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his Predecessor's weaknesses in his decrepit estate, partly by a new
interest of Religion sprung up against the Papal Tyranny, from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Wickliff;</hi> all which required a very wise Man, and a brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander;
in both which the King failed.</p>
               <p>Religion now began to dawn through the foggs of <hi>Romish</hi> Usurpations
and Superstitions, aided thereto by a Schism in the Triple Crown, that
continued forty years, with much virulancy abroad, and with as bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon our Myters at home. Some of whom were called <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
others <hi>Vrbanists;</hi> and yet none of them all worthy of either of
the names, in their proper signification. The Laity, though lookers on,
yet were not quiet: For though Liberty be a hopeful thing, yet it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to them that are not a Law to themselves, especially in matter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64112:116"/>
of Opinion; for that arraigns the Rule, and lays the way open to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness.
And now that the Liberty from the Keys began to be taught
as a duty of Religion, the inferiour sort meet with Doctrines of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
upon mistake of the notion; and will acknowledge no rule, now
they must be all at liberty: And thus sprang up the insurrection of the
Servants and Bond-men against their Lords and Masters under <hi>Cade</hi> and
<hi>Straw;</hi> that might have brought the Commonwealth into a hideous <hi>Chaos,</hi>
had not the Lords and Great men betimes bestirred themselves; and the
King shewed an extraordinary spirit, or rather a kind of rage, that put it
self forth beyond the ordinary temper of his mind. Much of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was imputed to <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Doctrine;<note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. Ang.</note> for it is an ordinary thing to
proclaim all evils concurring with the very joynt of Reformation, to be
the proper fruits thereof: But I look upon it as a fruit of corruption,
that endeavours to stop the breath of Reformation in the birth. And
there is somewhat of a hidden influence from above in the thing; for it
was not onely the Cup of <hi>England</hi> to be thus troubled,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 262.</note> but <hi>France</hi> and
other places had their portion suitable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s minority rendred him unequal unto these contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
he was in his <hi>Eleventh</hi> year, when he entred the Throne; and
(which was worse) his years came on faster than his parts, but his work
posted before them all. The common help of <hi>Protectors</hi> left him yet
more unhappy; for they were prepossessed with strong engagements of
particular Interests; and so were either not wise enough, or not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for all. This brought forth a third inconvenience, the change of
<hi>Protectorship;</hi> and that change of Affairs and Interests, an uncertain good
that brings forth a certain evil; for variety of Instruments and Interests
move several ways, and though the end be one, the difference concerning
the way many times doth as much hinder the Journey, as so many blocks
in the way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Protectorship</hi> was thrice changed; the King's Uncles had the first
essay; any one of them was big enough for one Kingdom, but all of
them together were too great to make one <hi>Protector.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
would have done well alone, if he had been alone, and minded that
work alone; but he being somewhat engaged with the <hi>Wickliffists,</hi> and
so entangled with the Clergy, and other restless spirits, and drawn off
by his private aim at the Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> saw this work too much; and
so he warily withdrew himself, leaving the <hi>Directory</hi> to a Committee of
Lords: a soveraign Plaister, questionless, where the times are whole;
but not for these distractions, wherein even the Committee it self suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its share. Thus the breach is made the wider; and for a cure of all,
the Government is committed into one hand, wherein the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
acquitted himself well, for he was wise enough to observe such as the
people most honoured. And thus passed over the two first years of the
King's Reign.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the King's minority, was rather in common repute
than in true account. For the King, however young, took little more
from the <hi>Protector</hi> than he saw meet, to colour his own commands with
opinion of Regularity; and so his Will came to full strength before his
Wisdom budded. Thus lifted up, he sets himself above all interests of
Parliaments, Protectors, Counsellors, Uncles, Wise men, and Law; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them all to be rules for those below. And so long as the King's
desire is thus served, he is content to be reputed a <hi>Minor,</hi> and be as it
were under protection of others, though not under their direction; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64112:117"/>
is content to continue thus until his Two and twentieth year. Some
might think him very moderate, had he been moderate; but he forbears
suing out his <hi>Livery,</hi> so long as he may live without care, and spend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controul. For by this time the humour of his great Grandfather
budded in him; he pawned his Heart to young men of vast desires, and
some say so inordinately, as he prostituted his Chastity unto them. And
it is no wonder if the Revenues of the Crown are insufficient for such
Masters. This the people soon felt, and feared their own <hi>Free-holds:</hi>
for they are bound, saith he, not to see the Crown deflowred for want
of maintenance; it is very true, nor to see the <hi>Crown deflowred of its main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>
A Parliament therefore is called; in which divers Lords asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate,
and prepare Physick for the King's lavish humour;<note place="margin">11 Rich. 2. n 8. 13.</note> which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
wrought for Ten years after, till it had purged him of his Life,
and the Kingdom of their King.</p>
               <p>It was an Act of Parliament that gave power to Fourteen Lords and
others to regulate the profits and Revenues of the Crown, and to do
Justice to the people; this was to continue for one whole year. The
Parasites no sooner found the effect hereof to their cost, but the King
grows sick of it, and finds an Antidote to over-rule Acts of Parliament,
by Acts of <hi>Privy-Council;</hi> declares this ill-favoured Commission void,
and the Contrivers, Advisers, and Enforcers, Traytors. To make it more
Majestical, he causeth the <hi>Judges</hi> to subscribe this Order, and so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Law in repute. This foundation thus laid, he buildeth in haste
an Impeachment of these Commissioners of High Treason; and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that they would not readily stoop, himself stoops lower; for he
would put his Right to trial by Battle, which was already his own by the
judgement of the Masters of the Law: For so they may be well called,
seeing they had thus mastered it. In this the King had the worst, for he
lost his Honour and himself: God hath a care of common Right, even
amongst Idolaters. Then comes the <hi>Parliament of wonders,</hi> wherein the
<hi>Kings Party are declared Traytors,</hi> and the <hi>chief Judges with their Law jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by another Law.</hi> The King not meddled with, thinks it high time to
come out of his <hi>Minority,</hi> and assumes the Government of the Kingdom,
and himself, to himself, being now Three and twenty years of Age; old
enough to have done well, if he had cared for it. But resolving to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the way of his own will, at length it led him to his own ruine. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the present two things delayed it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Authority, Wisdom, and
Moderation of his Unkles, especially of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> now come
out of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the great affection which the King pretended to the
Queen, who had also gained a good opinion amongst the people. The
benevolent aspect of the people, not for their own advantage, but for
the publick quiet, procured many Parlies and Interviews between the
King and people, and many Laws for the upholding of the Court and
Government; although both War, Laws, Justice, and Councils, all are
faint, as all is faint in that man that hath once dismann'd himself. This
he perceives well enough, and therefore Peace he must have by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
means. The Queen dies; himself being nigh Eight and twenty
years old; takes a Creature like a Wife, but in truth a Childe of Eight
years old, and this is to get peace with <hi>France.</hi> It is no wonder if now
he hunts after unlawful game, and that being ill taken, brings all things
out of order; <hi>For abused Marrige never wants wo.</hi> Civil men are now
looked upon as severe <hi>Cato's;</hi> and his Unkles, especially the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
with a jealous eye; which accomplished his death in the conclusion.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64112:117"/>
The Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York</hi> forsake the Court, Favourites step into
their rooms. The old way of the eleventh year is re-assumed; <hi>Belknap</hi>
and others are pardoned, and made of the Cabinet. The pardon of the
Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> is adnulled, contrary to the advice of the major part; and
the Archbishop, the Earl's Brother, is banished. The Lords forsake the
wilful King; still the King's Jealousie swells. The Duke of <hi>Hertford</hi> is
banished, or rather by a hidden Providence sent out of the way for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
work. The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> dies, and with him all hope of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is gone; for he was a wise Prince, and the onely Cement that held
the Joynts of the Kingdom in correspondency: And he was ill requited,
for all his Estate is seized upon. The Duke of <hi>Hertford</hi> and his party
are looked upon by the people as Martyrs in the Common Cause, and
others as Royalists. Extremities hasten on; and Prerogative, now upon
the wing, is towering above reach. In full Parliament, down goes all
the work of the tenth and eleventh years Parliament: which had never
been, if that Parliament had continued by adjournment. The King
raiseth a power, which he calleth his <hi>Guard,</hi> of <hi>Cheshire</hi>-men; under the
terrour of this displaying Rod,<note place="margin">21 Rich. 2. cap. 9.</note> the Parliament and Kingdom are brought
to Confession. <hi>Cheshire</hi> for this service is made a Principality; and thus
goes Counties up, and Kingdoms down. The King's Conscience whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers
a sad message of dethroning; and well it might be, for he knew
he had deserved it. Against this danger he entrenches himself in an Act
of Parliament,<note place="margin">21 Rich. 2. cap. 3.</note> that made it Treason <hi>To purpose and endeavour to depose
the King, or levy War against him, or to withdraw his Homage, hereof being
attainted in Parliament.</hi> And now he thought he was well guarded by
engagement from the Parliament; but he missed the right conclusion,
for want of Logick: For if the Parliament it self shall depose him, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made a Traytor, or attaint it self, and then hath the King gained no
more than a false birth.</p>
               <p>But the King was not thus quiet, the sting of guilt still sticks within,
and for remedy he will unlaw the Law; and gets it enacted, That all
procurers of the Statute of 10 <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and the Commission
and procurers of the King's assent thereto, and hinderers of the King's
proceedings, are adjudged Traytors. All these reach onely the Branches,
the Root remains yet, and may spring again; and therefore in the last
place have at the Parliament it self. For by the same it is further declared,
<hi>That the King is the sole Master of the Propositions for matters to be treated in
Parliament, and all gainsayers are Traitors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the King may dissolve the Parliament at his pleasure, and
all gainsayers are Traitors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Parliament may not proceed against the King's Justices,
for offences by them committed in Parliament, without the King's consent; and
all gainsayers are Traitors.</hi> These and the like Aphorisms once voted
by the <hi>Cheshire</hi>-men, assented unto by the Parliament, with the Kings
<hi>Fiat,</hi> must pass for currant to the Judges; and if by them confirmed
or allowed, will in the King's opinion make it a Law for ever, That
the King in all Parliaments is <hi>Dominus fac primum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus fac to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
But the Judges remembred the Tenth year, and <hi>Belknap</hi>'s enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and so dealt warily; their opinion is thus set down: <hi>It belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Parliament to declare Treason; yet if I were a Peer, and were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
I should agree.</hi> So did <hi>Thorning</hi> under-write; and thereunto also
consented <hi>Rickill,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Clopton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the last being Chief-Justice of
the King's Bench, the first Chief-Justice of the Common-pleas, and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64112:118"/>
second another Judge of the same Bench. The sum in plainer sence is,
that if they were Peers, they would agree; but as Judges, they would
be silent. And thus the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> by the first of these four
last-mentioned conclusions attainted themselves; by the second yielded
up their Liberties; by the third their Lives; and by the last, would have
done more, or been less: And to fill up the measure of all, they assigned
over a right of Legislative power unto six Lords, and three Commons;
and yet the King, not content, superadded, that it should be Treason for
any man to endeavour to repeal any of their determinations.</p>
               <p>The Commonwealth thus underneath, the King tramples upon all at
once; for having espied the shadow of a Crown fleeting from him in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he pursues it, leaves the noble Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Farm, subject to strip and waste by mean men, and crosses the
Irish Seas with an Army. This was one of <hi>England</hi>'s Climacterical years,
under a Disease so desperate, that no hope was left but by a desperate
Cure, by sudden bleeding in the Head, and cutting off that Member that
is a principle of motion in the Body. For it was not many Moneths e're
the wind of affairs changed; the King now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> another steps into
the Throne. The noise hereof makes him return, afar off enraged;
but the nigher he comes, the cooler he grows; his Conscience revives, his
Courage decays; and leaving his Army, his Lordship, Kingdom, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
behind, as a naked man, submits himself to release all Homage and
Fealty; to resign his Crown and Dignity, his Titles and Authority; to
acknowledge himself unworthy and insufficient to reign; to swear never
to repent of his resignation: And thus, if he will have any quiet, this
wilful man must be content for the future, neither to will nor desire.
And poor <hi>England</hi> must for a time be contented with a doleful condition,
in which the King cannot rule, and the Parliament will not, and the whole
body like a Chaos capable of any form that the next daring spirit shall
brood upon it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the State of the King and Parliament, in relation of it to
him, and him to it.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A King in Parliament is like the first-born of</hi> Jacob, The excellency of
Dignity, and the excellency of Power; <hi>but alone, unstable as water.
Examples of both these we have in these two Kings,</hi> Whereof the first
was Crowned by the Parliament, and Crowned it; the latter also Crowned it,
but with Thorns; and yet the Parliament in all held on that wise way, that it
neither exceeded its own bounds, nor lost its own right.</p>
               <p>I shall enter into the consideration of particulars under these heads:
First, <hi>In relation more immediately to the interest of the King:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>To the interest of the Kingdom in general.</hi> The King, though higher
than all the people by the head, and so hath the Prerogative of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as the most worthy, yet his strength and abilities originally do
rise from beneath; otherwise, he is but like a General without an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the Title big, but airy; and many times his person subject to
so much danger, that instead of drawing the Eyes of all the people to
look upon him with admiration, they are drawn to look to him with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64112:118"/>
and in this respect he may be said to be less his <hi>own</hi> man, and
<hi>more the Kingdoms,</hi> than any of the inferiour sort. This befel in both
these Kings in a special manner; each entring upon the grand Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Kingdom, before they were able to understand the work, or
govern themselves: and therefore were under power of <hi>Protectors</hi> for
the guard of their Persons and their Education, and of the <hi>Parliament</hi> for
Counsel and Direction in Cases relating to the Kingdom. The child of
a mean man, when its Parents are dead, is <hi>Filius Amici;</hi> but a King is
<hi>Filius Populi,</hi> to be by them trained up in such manner, that he
may be <hi>Pater Populi</hi> when he is come to age. In the mean time, though
he be a King, yet his Person like a precious Jem must not out of the Ring,
but must be directed by Council, though under some kind of restraint,
and the Counsellors all the while no Offenders in such cases against the
Prerogative Royal.<note place="margin">1 E. 3. Stat. 1.</note> And therefore, though it be true that Kings grow
faster than other men, and sooner come to full age than they; yet <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, now in his sixteenth year, might not pass over Sea into <hi>France,</hi>
though it were for restoring of Peace, but by direction of the Parliament:
nor is it meet in such cases, that Kings should stand upon the Prerogative
of a <hi>Negative.</hi> Secondly, it may likewise be said, <hi>That his Family is less
his own, as he is a man, than other mens:</hi> For private Families are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the publick Law, than in relation to the publick Peace, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
after breach made; but the Families of Kings are looked upon by
all in relation to the honour and profit of the Publick; not onely because
the King's servants have, by their nigh attendance upon his person, a more
powerful influence into his actions, which may reflect a malevolent Aspect
upon the whole course of affairs, if they be not better ordered that are so
nigh him; but more especially in regard that the government and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Royal Family trencheth deep upon the Honour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Purses of the People, who are concerned to see the same accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
suitable to the State and Port which the Nation would bear forth
to the World. <hi>And therefore for the Parliament to intermeddle in the
King's Family, is not foreign nor new. Alice Piers</hi> was a Familiar, if not of
the Family of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; yet both her self, and others of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
were complained of as a grievance. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was once a
young man, and ever a young King; and what <hi>Edward</hi> the Third wanted
onely in his Youth, and in his infirm old Age, this man ever wanted: for
he that knew not how to govern himself, how much less could he govern
his Family? And if in this condition the Parliament become his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
to set a yearly Survey and Check upon his Servants and Family, in
order to the good order of the same and Kingdom, other wise men must
conclude,<note place="margin">9 Rich. 2. n. 31.</note> it did that which was just; though <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and
those of his mind,<note place="margin">11 Rich. 2. n. 23.</note> think not so. But this is not all; Kings have not onely
such as serve the outward man, but some that serve their Consciences, of
old time called <hi>Confessors;</hi> in these days without name, for fear of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
yet the thing remaineth still in some well-favoured Chaplain, and
their work is to lead the King's Conscience in dark ways, or rather into
them. Commonly he hath a devout outside, and that is the King's Idol:
but if while his eye be towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> his mind be towards the dead
Sea, the King is his; and then the blind leads the blind: Like some <hi>Ignis
fatuus,</hi> to such as know it not. No man is so well known by his company,
as Kings are by these men, and these men by their actions. Although
some have been so witty as to cheat the whole Generation of Mankind,
by entertaining holy men to be their Chaplains; themselves the mean
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64112:119"/>
time without any spark of that holy Fire: Yet this King was not so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
he had a <hi>Confessor</hi> of his own choice, and according to his own heart,
who was complained of as a grievance,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 17, 18.</note> and the Parliament removed him.
So nigh they ventured, even to invade the King's own Conscience, if it
may be called Conscience, that will acknowledge no Law but that of its
own mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the King's <hi>Revenue</hi> was under the check and controul of the
Parliament; for it befals some Princes, as other men, to be sometimes
poor in abundance, by riotous flooding treasure out in the lesser currents,
and leaving the greater channels dry. This is an insupportable evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is destructive to the very being of affairs, whether for War or
Peace. <hi>For the King's Treasure is of a mixt nature, much of it being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for publick service, as himself is a publick person.</hi> And for this cause he
hath Officers of several natures attending upon his Treasury: Some for
Land, some for Sea, some for the general Treasure of the Kingdom, some for
that of the Houshold, and some for the <hi>Privy Purse.</hi> The common end
of all being to maintain State in time of Peace, and Strength against time
of War. Because it is no easie matter to maintain the just proportions for
each of the said ends, it is the less wonder that such a brave Prince as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third should labour under want for maintenance of the Wars;
and so lavish a Spendthrift as <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, should labour under
more want to maintain his port and countenance in peace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though it be true that the publick Treasure is committed to the
King as the chief Steward of the Realm; <hi>yet it is as true, that he is but a
Steward, and that the Supreme survey of the Treasure resteth in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
who are to see that the Treasure be not irregularly wasted, to reduce
the same into order; and for that end to call the Treasurers and Receivers
to account, to see to the punishing of such as are unfaithful, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of others that are faithful. For when by extravagant courses the
Treasure is wasted, by extraordinary courses it must be supplied; which
ever is out of the Subjects Purses. And in such cases it is great reason that
they should observe which way the course lies of such Expences. If then
in such cases sometimes the Parliament hath stayed the issuing out of the
King's Revenue for some time, or otherwise viewed and examined the
same,<note place="margin">2 Rich. 2. n. 12.</note> charged it with conditions, 22. <hi>E. 3. n. 29. 14 R. 2. n.</hi> 15. limited it
to certain uses,<note place="margin">9 Rich 2. n. 4. or 41.</note> and in case of misuser, refused to levy or make payments;
the case will be without dispute,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. n. 6.</note> that the Parliament ordered the <hi>publick
Treasure</hi> as they saw most need.<note place="margin">27 E. 3. n. 8.</note> But much more, if we consider how the
greatest part of this Treasure was raised.<note place="margin">9 R. 2. n. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> not from the <hi>old Revenues</hi> of
the Crown,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. n. 16.</note> but by <hi>new Impositions,</hi> Levies, and Assessments laid upon the
People, even what <hi>they</hi> pleased, and in what manner <hi>they</hi> thought meet,
and not otherwise. <hi>Aids</hi> are lawful, if they be legally given by common
consent of Parliament. <hi>Taxes,</hi> if legally given by Parliament, are no less
lawful;<note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0</note> yet they must be collected in such manner, and by such means as
the Parliaments Order doth direct. <hi>Loans</hi> of moneys to the King may
be made by them that will; <hi>but the King must not demand them, because the
Subject hath no means to recover the debt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. n. 16.</note> This trick had been lately tryed
by <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, much money he got, and it was repayed by the
Order of the Parliament. But of all the rest, nothing shewed more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority in the publick Revenue, than the care that was had of the
<hi>Demesnes</hi> of the Crown:<note place="margin">1 E. 3 v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. 1.</note> for whereas the Expxences of Kings grew so vast,
that neither the yearly Revenue could suffice, nor Aids, Assessments; and
Taxes could satisfie, however ordinary they in these times were become;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64112:119"/>
rather than Kings would contain themselves, they would invade their own
<hi>Demesnes,</hi> by pawning, selling, and giving them away, either for love or
money: and thus was poverty treasured up against the future, both for
King and Crown. The Parliament espying this leak that was like to undo
all, applyed a speedy remedy, undoing what was done, and undoing some
by an <hi>Act of Resumption;</hi> and thereby taught Kings to look to their Honour
better for the future,<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. n. 48.</note> and People also to take heed of medling with such
ticklish matters, and to know that he that hath such in his possession, hath
them by a crack'd Title, that cannot be amended but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an <hi>English</hi> King is no <hi>Out-law;</hi> nor can he do any wrong,
though the <hi>man</hi> may. He hath a double relation, <hi>one as a King,</hi> the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Man;</hi> and the uniting of both in one person, hath cheated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man of his judgment in the case of Prerogative. He hath a double
Will, and these many times contrary, equally as in other Relations;
and in this contrariety, sometimes the King overcomes the Man, and
sometimes the Man the King: so as if any man, the King hath much
more cause to cry out, <hi>O miserable man!</hi> These divers Wills are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
led by divers Rules: One of a man, which many times reacheth
no higher than the Affections; and if the man be weak, they deserve
little better name than Lusts. The rule of a King is <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> of
these in place; and unto these in all prudentials, he must submit his
Judgment and Will, as he is a King. Nor can he do otherwise, unless he
will presume to be wiser than his Council. Suitable hereunto doth that
clause in one of the Statutes of these times conclude,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That the King
is bound by his Oath, to pass all Laws that are for the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
For were the power of Election, or determination of the point,
onely in the King, then were the <hi>Oath</hi> in vain; nor is the Parliament at
all (in case of the King's dissent) to judge of the convenience or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of Proposals made for the good of the whole body,<note place="margin">21 E. 3. n. 64.</note> according
to that power which is exercised in these times.<note place="margin">3 Rich. 2. n. 38.</note> Nor is it rational to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
here from that,<note place="margin">2 Rich. 2. n. 38.</note> if Law and Council be the Rule of a King, then the
Obedience of the People unto this King must be in order to Law and
Council, otherwise the Disobedience cannot be determined to be against
the King, but against the Man; and though against the private Will of
the Commander, yet not against the Law; nor therefore can it be said
illegal or unjust. The Parliament in these times held forth this Doctrine
plainly to the World,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. n. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is their proper work, in Cases needful, to do
right to such as are wronged by the King: his Command is no Warrant in
such Cases.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 E. 3. Vet. 1.</note> If a man be wrongfully imprisoned by him, he shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
and set at liberty by them.<note place="margin">15 E. 3. cap. 3.</note> Let his Act be never so authentical
under the Broad Seal,<note place="margin">11 Rich. 2. n. 11, 12, 15, 17.</note> it can take no man's Right away. <hi>Richard</hi> the
Second did his utmost to satisfie and quiet the tumultuous Rabble under
<hi>Cade</hi> and <hi>Straw,</hi> and granted store of Manumissions to the Bond-men
by Declaration,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 8, 12, 13.</note> and by his Letters-Patents; but not one of them good
enough to deprive any one of the meanest of the <hi>Free-men</hi> of their Rights
in those Bond-men. The priviledge of shewing mercy, and granting
pardon, hath been anciently betrusted to the King, as an Overseer of
the execution of Law; yet he hath not that Prerogative, <hi>To have mercy
on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Ever since this Nation had learned to read
the Bible, <hi>Murther</hi> hath been excepted from <hi>mercy;</hi> nor did the Law ever
allow any King that Prerogative to pardon that. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third did
not challenge any such,<note place="margin">10 E. 3. cap. 2</note> not onely bound thereto by his <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64112:120"/>
but by publick <hi>Acts of State</hi> declaring the same:<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 15.</note> yet because the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was not always sitting,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 2.</note> and Kings were ever subject to this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
to favour Servants by granting mercy to Malefactors; a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule of Inhibition is made against all pardon to be granted by the
King in case of Felony, but onely in cases allowed by advice of the
Council. It is true, that in the first times of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, he
liked not to be thus girt in his power, which he pretended was more at
liberty in his Predecessors;<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. St. 2. cap. 1.</note> possibly he meaned King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi>
the Second, who many times did what they listed: yet under his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
no Law was so shameless, as to hold forth such a power, till <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the Second's Law countenanced it.<note place="margin">11 Rich. 2. n. 3. 6.</note> But why do I call it a <hi>Law,</hi>
which is onely a <hi>Declaration</hi> by consent of the <hi>Lords,</hi> such as then were?
the <hi>Commons</hi> would never own such an Opinion:<note place="margin">21 Rich. 2. n. 35.</note> And therefore it soon
proved abortive; for within three or four years, by publick Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it is peremptorily declared, That the King's <hi>Pardon</hi> shall not
extend to <hi>Murther.</hi> So as upon the whole matter it is plain, <hi>That it is
not the King's Will, though supported by the Council of Lords, and backed
by the Opinion of the Judges, that must be a Rule for the Government of this
Kingdom; nor doth any Allegiance bind Obedience thereunto, in case where Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
or the Liberty of the People is concerned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things yet remain which Kings have claimed to be their own,
viz. <hi>Conferring Titles of Honour, and Places of Trust, and the Legislative
Power.</hi> The first is but a Feather, and not worthy of regard; yet it is
plain that these times produce many precedents of <hi>Dukes, Marquesses,</hi>
and <hi>Earls,</hi> made in Parliament; and possibly it may be apparent, that
the first motion of any such Title of Honour, did first fetch its original
thence, if not in the Field: but it is not worthy of the labour. The
second is more considerable; <hi>viz. The power of conferring Places of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Trust:</hi> This Kings have pretended unto, although in course of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
it will be thought more meet, that it belongeth rather to that
chief and grand Trust of the whole Kingdom committed to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And the practice of these times is not much discrepant, whether
we regard such as are for advice or execution. Of the first of these, are
those whom we commonly call, the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> whose advice in
course toucheth first upon the King's Person, but by reflection worketh
strong impressions upon the People, so far as the influence of the King's
power extends. And therefore it is not beyond the Sphear of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to interpose and qualifie that influence, so as it may be for the
general good of the whole Kingdom. For many times Kings are either
above or beneath themselves; and in such cases, if the Council be of
the King's suit, he is of the deeper dye, and proves more Malignant
to the People. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, growing into great opinion in the
World, his proportion exceeds his own portion, and the Peoples good
wills to boot;<note place="margin">14 E. 3. n. 55.</note> they think the fault is in the <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
is set upon it.<note place="margin">50 E. 3. n. 10.</note> So also they do in his fiftieth year, when he
grows downward.<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. n. 51</note> And the like in the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's
Reign, he being now a Youth, and therefore unstable in his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and unable to make Election. So as upon the whole matter, if the
King fall short in point of Judgment or Resolution, or inordinate in
his Affections;<note place="margin">3 Rich. 2. n. 34.</note> but more especially where they observe the major,
or more considerable part of the Council to draw towards a designe;<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 17, 18, 28.</note>
in such cases as these,<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. n. 19.</note> the Parliament, as its own duty, undertook
to settle a good Council about the King's person, that might advise him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64112:120"/>
during their recess. For the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> is never more it self, than when
it is an Epitome of the <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the Kingdom. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
such Officers as concern execution of Law and Counsel, are as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
to be enquired into: for if their motion be irregular, it is less ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
what the rule be. The Parliament therefore held it their duty to
interpose in the Election of grand Officers of the Kingdom, such as are the
<hi>Chancellors, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Justices;</hi> or to confirm or displace them, or bind
them by Oath. The Rolls of the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-sixth
years of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; and the sixth, tenth, and eleventh
years of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, do manifest this sufficiently.</p>
               <p>I have done with the Subject-matter, or work of the Parliament, in the
mutual relation of the King and it; the manner of proceeding was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
joyntly with the King, or without him; and either joyntly with the
two Houses, or severally; and either immediately by themselves, or their
Committees. As touching the first, it is evident, that in all matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
gain ariseth to the Crown from the people, by <hi>Subsidy,</hi> or otherwise,
the strength of the Grant by Act of Parliament resteth in the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and that the King's <hi>Assent</hi> is but <hi>pro forma,</hi> as touching that matter;
and therefore such Grants have been made as tended in some measure to
derogate either from the King's Wisdom, care, or fidelity; yet even these
have passed with the <hi>Royal Assent,</hi> though the full <hi>Assent</hi> or good will of
the person of the King was not correspondent thereto: as in these Cases
formerly noted, where Subsidies were given with Limitations and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and upon rendring account to the people. And it is as evident,
that where the King's person is disabled to understand,<note place="margin">37 E. 3. n. 34.</note> (as in case of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy)
there the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> can bear little weight with it;<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. n. 5.</note> but most
of all in the King's absence,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 75</note> where either the <hi>Assent</hi> is put thereto by
Commissioners, that know not the King's particular mind, or the Act is
done onely by the Houses, in nature of <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and yet these of
force to bind all parties but the King. But nothing more debased the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Assent</hi> in these times, than a trick that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third plaid in the
midst of the fullest strength of his Government. It was in time of War,
which never is time of good Husbandry and laying up, nor of sober ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in laying out, nor of equity in levying and collecting moneys for
the Nerves of War. This forward Warrier, in the heat of his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
finds his strength benummed for want of money; he leaves off,
comes home, rages against his Archbishop, to whom he had committed
the care of provision for his War; and the Archbishop as hotly falls upon
some of the Treasury in the Army on the one side, and upon others in
the Country;<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 3.</note> whose oppressions, saith he, instead of bringing in money,
made the people to give a stop thereto. A contest hereupon thus had, it
was concluded by the power of the Parliament, that such men should be
questioned,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. Eccles.</note> and that the Parliament from time to time should call all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of State to account: and thereupon ensues a calm. After the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ended, the King repeats the matter; it makes his heart sick; he
disgorgeth himself by a Proclamation, made by advice of Nobles, and
Wise men, as he saith; and tells all the World he <hi>dissembled with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and what he did was done by duress of mind, to please for the
time,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. 50.</note> and to gain his ends; which being now had, he by his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
revokes what he had done in Parliament, or endeavoured it. And
thus is <hi>England</hi> put to School to learn to dissolve three hard knots: First,
<hi>Whether a King can dissemble with his Parliament?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Whether</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64112:121"/>
                  <hi>the Third his dissembling assent makes a Law?</hi> Lastly, <hi>Whether by a
Proclamation, by advice of Nobles and Wise men, he can declare that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
with his Parliament, and therein not dissemble the Royal Assent, so as
to bring all the Laws made in any Kings time into question, at least during his
Life?</hi> However the result may be, it is evident, the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> gets no
honour hereby, and the Statute as little, that hath suffered this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all this time to pass among the number of the Statutes in Print as a
Law, whenas many Statutes that are Laws of not, are left out as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
               <p>Although in the general, the two Houses joyned in every Act <hi>Ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
yet <hi>Ad intra,</hi> and in relation one to another, they had their several
operations; the House of Commons intermedled more in the matter of
<hi>Fact,</hi> the House of Lords in matter of <hi>Right;</hi> although in either of these
there is a mutual aspect from both. In matters of <hi>Judicature,</hi> much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with the Lords, and therefore it is ordained, that, <hi>The House of Lords
shall remedy all offences contrary to the Law of</hi> Magna Charta. And in
cases where no remedy is left,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 1. 15 E. 3. c. 3, 4.</note> nor Judgement by the Law, the matter
shall be <hi>determined in Parliament, and the King shall command execution
to be done according to the Judgement of the Peers.</hi> Which Laws seem
to be but declarative of the former Law, and in the nature of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that power into Act which was formerly laid asleep; and doth
strongly imply that the ultimate act in <hi>Judicature</hi> rested with the Lords,
in relation not onely to the House of Commons, but also in relation to
the King, whose work in such cases is, not to judge above or with the
<hi>Peers,</hi> but to execute their sentence. And that carries with it a List,
whereby the power of a King may appear not to be so Supreme in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Law, as some would have it: for if his Judgement and
Conscience be bound by the Votes of the <hi>Peers</hi> in giving a Law, in
case of a particular person where the Law was not formerly known,
let others judge of the value of this <hi>Negative Vote,</hi> in giving Law to
the whole Kingdom. It is true, that this Parliament was quarrelled by
the King, and he kept it at a bay by a Proclamation that pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
as far as a Proclamation could revoke an Act of Parliament;
but it effected nothing, nor did the contest last long. Now though this
Jurisdiction thus rested in the House of Lords, in such cases, as well as
in others; yet is it not so originally in them, as to be wholly theirs,
and onely as they shall order it. For the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have
a right in the course and order of Jurisdiction, which (as the known
Law) is part of their Liberty; and in the speedy execution of Justice,
as well as they have right to have Justice done. And therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in Cases of <hi>Errour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 5.</note> and <hi>delays,</hi> the Appeal was from the inferiour
Court to the Parliament; which immediately determined the matter,
and now the trouble grew too great by the increase of pleas: For reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hereof, a kind of Committee is made, of one Bishop, two Earls,
two Barons, who by the advice of the Chancellor, Treasurer, and the
Judges, shall make good judgement in all Cases of Complaint of delay
in Judgement: which Committee is not made by Order of the Lords
alone, which they might have done, in case Jurisdiction had been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and onely shut up in their custody; but by Act of Parliament, and
joynt concurrence of the Commons with the Lords. For as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
challenge speedy Execution of Justice, as one of their Liberties:
so also to be under the Jurisdiction of such Judges, and Courts, as the
Laws (in the making whereof, themselves challenge a vote) do establish
and appoint.</p>

I will conclude this Chapter with the Constitution of the Parliament
in these times. For, the difficulties that befel between the Kings and
their people, or Houses of Parliament, wrought two sad effects, <hi>viz. A
propensity to decline calling of Parliaments so often as was used and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
and when it assembled, as great a propensity in the Members to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their attendance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walsing. An. 1315.</note> by means whereof, as the Historian tells us, the
Parliament was sometimes enforced to adjourn it self for want of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
sufficient. The first of these arose from want of good will in the
Kings; the other, from want of Courage and Zeal in the people. <hi>The
first of these was fatal and destructive to good Government:</hi> for though in
distempered Parliaments it is good to withdraw, yet in distempered
times it is necessary to meet, and gain a right understanding of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and therefore these times were so happy as to bind themselves by
publick Acts of State to re-continue the assembling of Parliaments. For
the face of the Times represented unto all, that agitations were like to
be quick, violent, and to continue for some succession of time. It is
therefore safe, if not necessary, that every eye should be open, and
Councils ready for every occasion. A Law at length is agreed upon,
that <hi>A Parliament shall be holden once every year,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. E. 3. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>or more, if need be</hi>
But in Thirty years the power of this Law is wasted out of mind, and
the evil reviving,<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 10.</note> revives also the Statute; and yet they had Thirteen
or Fourteen Parliaments in Thirty years space, and not above Three,
or but once Four years distance of time between any Two of them in
Succession. This was the sence of the Members of the Houses in their
meeting; but at home, they had homely conceits; and it is found no
less difficult to bring them to the meeting, than to continue the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
according to the Law; being either loath to adventure their
thoughts into the troublesome affairs of the Publick, or their persons
to expence and hazard. But the publick must be served; and therefore
an Act of Parliament is made,<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That all such Members as decline their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
at the Parliament, after Summons made, shall be amerced, and the
Sheriffs likewise that shall neglect return of Summons.</hi> And the Statute
implyeth that it was no introduction of a new Law, but a reviving of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Law now or lately disused, or a Custom now out of custom. And
to take away all objection in point of charges and expences, another Law
was made to establish the Assessments,<note place="margin">12 Rich. 2. c. 12.</note> and levying of their wages, upon
the Lands that anciently were chargeable therewith, in whose hands so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the same shall come.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude with this, That the Parliament, though, like a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it sometimes covers the goodly feature and proportion of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
body, yet it keeps the same warm, and as a Shield is first in
all dangers, and meets with many a knock which the body feels not; this
is their work and reward. It is true, that in the wearing it is felt heavy;
but it is the easier born, if it be duly considered, that it is better to be so
cloathed, than to be naked.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Privy-Council, and Condition of the Lords.</head>
               <p>THe latter must make way for the former; for according to their
personal esteem in their own Countries, such is their Authority at
the Board in joynt Councils. And it was one point of happiness in a sad
time of War, that all men looked one way. The Lords were much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the Field, and could do much with <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who was
a brave Leader; and more with the people, who had been so long time
used to the rough Trade of Souldiery, that they loved not to be at home
about matters of Husbandry, wherein they had so little experience. And
having so fair a Garland in their eye as <hi>France,</hi> it is no wonder if dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
designs seemed meaner, or more dangerous. Thus did God do <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
a good turn, although it was made for the present thereby, neither
so rich or populous as it might have been in a time of Peace. This
<hi>French</hi> heat wasted many a tumultuous Spirit, and ennobled the Fame of
the King and Lords; not onely abroad, but won them much Honour
and Repute of those that remained at home; and so by congregating
Homogeneals, and severing Heterogeneals, rendred the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
more Univocal; which tended much to the setling of the Joynts of
this distracted Nation. A timely birth hereof, doubtless, was the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
entry of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second upon the Throne, and quiet sitting
there; whilst as yet he was but a Child, the Princes of the bloud many;
and they of generous, active, and daring Spirits: yet do we not meet with
a whisper in story of any turbulent or aspiring humour in them or the
people, during those tenderer times of that King's Reign. But after that
he came to know more in himself than was to be found; and to outreach
his abilities, having some of the Lords ready at his Elbow to help him,
these changed the King's course, although the general part of that noble
Band kept still their Array; and retaining the body of the people in due
composure, thereby declared themselves to be the King's Friends, though
the others were <hi>Richard</hi>'s Favourites; so as he was fain to stoop to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and submit to be a King, that would have otherwise been more
or less. And thus the Lords were become Supporters to the Crown,
Studds to the Throne, and a Reserve to the People, against the violent
motions of an unbridled mind in their King; who seeing them so united,
and endeavouring to break them into parties to obtain his desire, lost
both it and himself. It is a degree of cleanly modesty, to impute the
miscarriages of unruly Kings, to their Council. <hi>For however during their
minority, Counsellors are more rightly Officers of State; yet when Kings will
be their own men, their Counsellors are no other than the breath of the King's
own breast;</hi> and by which a King may be more truly discerned, than any
man by his Bosom-friends. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was a man of a publick
Spirit, and had a Council suitable to his aim. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, a man
that desired what him pleased, would have what he desired; and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
he had that served him in all. For God answers the desires of mens
hearts in Judgement as well as in Mercy; and a sore Judgement it is
both to King and People, when the corrupt desires of the King are bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by a flattering Council.</p>
               <p>It must be granted, that the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of Kings hath been an old
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64112:122"/>
Ginn of State, that at a sudden lift could do much to the furthering of
the present estate of publick Affairs. Nevertheless, through the Riot of
Kings, their designes generally tended to make more work for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than to dispatch; to do much, rather than well; like works for
sale, rather than for Master-piece; and sometimes to undermine, yea, to
out-face the Parliament it self, like some unruly Servants that will put
away their own Masters. Nor can it otherwise be expected, unless the
King's <hi>elected ones</hi> be turned into the Parliaments Committee; or that
constant annual Inquisition by Parliament be made into their actions:
for occasional inquiries breed ill blood, though no attainder be; nor are
they easily undertaken, whereas constancy in such cases makes the worst
to be resolved but into a matter of common course.</p>
               <p>The natural and original power of the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> is very obscure,
because there are several degrees of them that occasionally have been
used, all of whom may deserve the name of <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> in regard
of the Parliament, which is the most <hi>publick Council</hi> of all the rest,
and always hath a general interest in all Causes in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The first of these, is that which was called <hi>The Grand Council of the King,</hi>
which, as I think, was not the House of Lords, who are called by Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and were onely to attend during the Parliament; but a body made
up of them, and other wise men of his own Retinue: And of this, it
seems,<note place="margin">16 Edw. 3. Memb. 5. in Dors.</note> there was a constant body framed, that were sworn to that service;
for some in these times were sworn both of the <hi>Grand Council</hi> and the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Council,</hi>
and so entred upon Record.</p>
               <p>The second of these Councils was also a great Council, and probably
greater than the other; but this was called onely upon occasion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of all sorts, like a Parliament, yet was none. An example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have in the Ordinances concerning the Staple, which at the first
were made by the King, Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Lords, and Great men
of the Kingdom, one out of every County, City, and Burrough, called
together, for that end; their results were but as in point of trial for six
Moneths space,<note place="margin">27 E. 3. stat. 2. 28 E. 3. c. 13.</note> and then were turned into Statute-law by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These two are <hi>Magna Concilia,</hi> yet without power, further than
as for advice; because they had no ancient foundation, nor constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.
Another Council remaineth more private than the other, of
more continual use, though not so legally founded; and this is called the
King's <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> not taking up a whole House, but onely a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or a Table; signifying rather communication of Advice, than power
of Judicature, which more properly is in <hi>Banco.</hi> And yet the power of
this grew as <hi>virile</hi> and <hi>Royal,</hi> as it would acknowledge no <hi>Peer</hi> but the
Parliament, and usurped the <hi>representative</hi> of it, as that had been of
the whole Kingdom. The ambition thereof hath ever been great, and
in this most notoriously evident, that as it had swallowed up the <hi>Grand
Council</hi> of Lords, it seldom can endure the mention of a Parliament, but
when Kings or Affairs are too rugged for their own touch. The Platform
of their power you may behold in this their Oath.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That well and lawfully they shall counsel the King accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their best care and power,<note place="margin">Mag. Chart. Vet.</note> and keep well and lawfully
his Counsels.</item>
                  <item>2. That none of them shall accuse each other of any thing
which he had spoken in Council.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64112:123"/>
3. And that their lawful Power, Aid, and Counsel, they shall
with their utmost diligence apply to the King's Rights.</item>
                  <item>4. And the Crown to guard, and maintain, save, and to keep
off from it, where they can without doing wrong.</item>
                  <item>5. And where they shall know of the things belonging to the
Crown, or the Rights of the King, to be concealed, intruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or substracted, they shall reveal the same to the King.</item>
                  <item>6. And they shall enlarge the Crown, so far as lawfully they
may, and shall not accounsel the King in decreasing the Rights of
the Crown, so far as they lawfully may.</item>
                  <item>7. And they shall let for no Man (neither for love nor hate,
nor for peace nor strife) to do their utmost (as far as they can,
or do understand) unto every man, in every Estate, Right, and
Reason and in Judgement; and doing right shall spare none, neither
for Riches nor Poverty.</item>
                  <item>8. And shall take of no Man without the King's leave, unless
Meat or Drink in their Journey.</item>
                  <item>9. And if they be bound by Oath formerly taken, so as they
cannot perform this without breaking that, they shall inform the
King, and hereafter shall take no such Oaths without the King's
consent first had.</item>
               </list>
               <p>All which in a shorter sum, sounds in effect, that they must be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Counsellors to the King's Person, and also to his Crown; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the true Rights, but to enlarge them; yet all must be done lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And Secondly, that they shall do right in Judgement, to take no Fees,
nor any other Oath in prejudice of this.</p>
               <p>The first of these concern the publick onely at a distance: and yet the
point of encreasing and diminishing of the Crown in the sixth Section
is captious, and may sound as if there is a legal enlarging of the Crown,
whereof he that takes the Oath is to judge. A matter which onely and
properly concerns the Parliament to order and determine, or else farewel
all liberty of the people of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second concerneth immediately the King in his politick capacity,
but trencheth upon all Laws of the Kingdom, in the executive power;
and all the motions in the whole Kingdom, either of Peace or War, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the Rear, either immediately, or mediately, are under this
notion interested into the transaction of the Privy-Council, to debate
and determine the King's Judgement therein, unless it will determine
alone. And how easie a thing it is for such as have power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the Action by the Law, to slip into the determining of a Law
upon the Action, and so to rule by Proclamation, experience taught suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
times sufficiently. Nevertheless, in these times Parliaments were
every moment upon the wing, and kept this Noble Band in awe, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them into their Cognizance, placing and displacing some or all of
them, directing and binding them by Oath, as they saw occasion; of
which the Records are full and plentiful. I say, these times thus consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64112:123"/>
added yet further encouragement to them, by giving them powers
by Statute-Law, over and beyond what by ancient Custom they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>The King, and Council of Lords, had anciently a power of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that hath been in the first Part of this Discourse already observed;
yet it is very probable, that it was not any select company of Lords, but
the whole Association. For it is granted by all, that they had originally
a principal hand in the Jurisdiction; and it is hard to conceive how any
private number should catch such a power, if not by usurpation. But
the manner of acquiring is less materal; the principal consideration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
upon the quality of this Jurisdiction. For it is evident that much
difference hath been, both concerning the place and manner of exercising
this Authority. In general, it must be granted, that all Pleas <hi>Coram Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi>
were grounded upon Writs first purchased, and returnable either in
<hi>Banco,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 Ass. pl. 52.</note> or in <hi>Camera,</hi> or in <hi>Cancellaria.</hi> And no difference at all will be
concerning the Jurisdiction in <hi>Banco;</hi> for that was by the course of the
Common-Law, and the people held it one of their Liberties to have one
known course of Law, for determining matters of right and wrong. As
touching these Pleas, which were holden by Writs returnable in <hi>Camera,</hi>
they were properly said to be <hi>Coram Rege &amp; Concilio,</hi> whose meeting was
in the Council-chamber, in those days called the Star-chamber. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
returns of Writs in the Star-chamber do not we find, but such as were
in <hi>Camera;</hi> nor Prohibitions from thence, but under the notion of the
King's Council; and this <hi>Camera,</hi> as I said, was the place of the joynt
meeting of the Council,<note place="margin">41 E. 3. Rot. Claus. 16 Rich. 2. Memb. 11. in Dors.</note> as well of those of the Chancery and Benches,
as of those that attended upon matters of State. Now the influence of
Society in point of Judicature, principally aspected upon some Pleas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crown: although even these also properly were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in the <hi>King Bench.</hi> Nor can I observe any rule to bound the
powers of these two Judicatories, but this, that the <hi>Council-Table</hi> would
pick and chuse, and prohibit the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> as they pleased; and to that
end would order Originals out of the Chancery, as they thought most
meet.<note place="margin">Fleta, li. 2. cap. 34.</note> For it is observed by <hi>Fleta,</hi> that the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> hath no juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of it self, but by special Warrant; that is to say, by <hi>Original Writs</hi>
returned thither. Nevertheless, it may seem that such Crimes as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to common honesty, or the publick profit or peace, in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
way than ordinary, and therefore may be called <hi>Crimina laesi
Regni,</hi> or against the State; these, I say, might more properly belong
to the sublime Judicature of the <hi>Council-Table;</hi> as knowing better how
far the publick State was interested, or endamaged in such Cases, than the
other Judges that were experienced onely in ordinary matters of a more
private concernment.</p>
               <p>To recite the particular Cases upon record, concerning <hi>racing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
Forgeries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">38 E. 3. Rot. Pat. Ps. 1. Memb. 13. 39. E. 3. Ps. 1. M. 13. 12 E. 3. Rot. claus. Memb. 8. in Dors. 2 Rich. 2. Rot. Pat. Ps. 1. 12 Rich. 2. cap. 12. 43. Ass. Pl. 38.</note> and other crimes of <hi>Falshood, Conspiracies, Combinations,</hi>
to abate and level the <hi>prices</hi> of Commodities, <hi>Riots,</hi> and such-like, will
be supersluous. In all which, and others of that Cognizance, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
exceeded not Fine and Imprisonment, or Ransom. Neither yet
were the <hi>Common pleas</hi> so rural, but the <hi>Council Table</hi> could relish them
also, and digest them well enough; and therefore did not stick to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the Courts of Common-Law, under colour of a strange maxime;
<hi>That it is neither just nor honest for a man to be sued at the Common-Law, for
a matter depending before the King and his Council:</hi> No, though the Court
of Common-law had the precedency. And therefore, although the right
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64112:124"/>
of <hi>Tythes</hi> being depending at the Common-Law,<note place="margin">Co Inst. 4. c. 5. 22 Ass. pl. 75.</note> the Archbishop in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Jurisdiction, sueth before the <hi>Kings Council;</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
at the Law are thereby stayed. And no wonder; for the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table</hi>
challenged to hold the ballance of all Courts of Law within
their own Order: and so if any doubt concerning the Jurisdiction depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the <hi>Council-Table</hi> gave the word,<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. 12. Tit. Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and all stooped thereto. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of the Subject-matter; the manner follows: a new form of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is taken up, that the Common-Law and ancient Custom never knew;
and which grew so noisom to the people, that complaints are made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as of common grievance, and remedies are thereto applied by the
Laws of these times.<note place="margin">5 E. 3. c. 9.</note> For whereas by the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> nothing could
be done in Judgement, but according to the Laws of the Land; and in
affirmance thereof, a Law was made in these times, that no Accusation,
nor Attachment, nor forejudging of Life or Member, nor seisure of
Lands, Tenements, Goods or Chattels, should be against the form of
the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> and Law of the Land: This course of affairs grew
so stale, that amongst other innovations, a trick of a new kind of Trial
is brought forth, by suggestions upon <hi>Articles</hi> exhibited against any man
before the <hi>Council-Table;</hi> and thereupon issued forth <hi>Attachments</hi> against
the party complained of; by means whereof, and other courses, (for
they could also sequester) much vexation arose unto the people. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
upon complaints multiplied, a remedial Law is made; whereby it
is Enacted,<note place="margin">37 E. 3. c. 17.</note> That all such suggestions made, shall be carried to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
Treasurer, and the King's Grand Council; and the Informer shall
find Surety to prosecute with effect; and to incur the like penalty inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Defendant, if the Plaintiff's proofs be not compleat: and then
the Process of Law shall issue forth, and the Defendant shall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against the form of the <hi>Great Charter;</hi> that is, he shall not be taken
until first the fault appear upon Record, by <hi>Presentment,</hi> or by <hi>due Process,</hi>
or by <hi>original Writ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 4, 5. 42 E. 3. c. 3 &amp; 4.</note> according to the ancient Law of the Kingdom. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therefore the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> had no power to hold any Pleas at all,
or else no power of Trial. The first of these was concluded in open
Parliament;<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. n. 87</note> and the second as good as so: for if the first, then the second
will come on undeniably. But suppose all this be given up, yet was this
Liberty to hold Pleas so qualified, that the person could not be touched,
till the thing did appear by Inquisition, and then in a legal way. Such
proceeding was had upon suggestion made against the City of <hi>London,</hi> in
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time:<note place="margin">Fabian Vit. Hen. 3. Anno 1141.</note> for one of the Judges was first sent into the
City to find the suggestion by a Jury; and then the Lord Mayor appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before the Lords, and traversed the matter, and in a manner <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
or rather demanded to be tried according to the custom of the City.
And the like course do we find observed in our <hi>Law-Reports</hi> of these
times,<note place="margin">43 Ass. pl. 38.</note> in a Case concerning the price of Wool, by a false Report. The
foot of the whole account will be this; That the work of Judicature of
the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> in these times in cases of Crimes, was to receive <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
and award Inquisitions; and after return in nature of a Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
to Recover, Traverse, and to order Trial at the Common-Law;
and upon Verdict returned,<note place="margin">43 Ass. pl. 38.</note> to Fine and Ransom. In other Cases either
of Right or Equity in matters of private property, they were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
either by Judges of the <hi>Bench,</hi> or <hi>Chancery,</hi> although possibly the
suit was <hi>Coram Concilio,</hi> for that all the said Judges were of the <hi>King's
Council.</hi> And yet, as I dare not affirm, so I cannot deny, but it might
also be possible that some matters, especially these of a greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64112:124"/>
either in their own nature, or in regard of the persons whom
they concerned, were determined by the major Vote of the <hi>whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
in a prudential, or rather arbitrary way. But this was, <hi>Invita Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi>
and used so rarely, as the path is grown out of view; saving some

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Chancery.</head>
               <p>IT is the birth of the King's power in Judicature, and may deserve the
name of the first-born. For though it had no better Title in these
later times than <hi>Officium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mirror. cap. 4. Sect. 2. Fleta, lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> because amongst other of the King's Escripts, it
formed <hi>Writs remedial,</hi> for such as had received wrong; yet even by
that work, it was in repute for so much skill in the Law of the Land,
that by the consent of all, it was as well able to advise a remedy, as to
advise the Complainants where to have it. And yet it had one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
further, that it was an <hi>Office of remembrance</hi> to the King, (who is a
person of great trust in the Law, and gave such credit to all acts done
before him) as being entred into the <hi>remembrance,</hi> became of the highest
nature of <hi>Record,</hi> against which no <hi>Plea</hi> did lie. Amongst these, matters
of debt and contract coming into the account, this <hi>Office</hi> taking notice of
the Record, took cognizance of the thing, and for the executing thereof:
and thus in these, and such-like Cases, granted <hi>Judicial Writs,</hi> and so
found out a way of Judicature, to as many Causes as the State would
trust it with.<note place="margin">Fleta, lib. 2. c. 13. Sect. 8.</note> And because it pretended cognizance onely of matters of
<hi>Record</hi> before them, they found out a way of examining of Witnesses by
Commission, and returning their Depositions in writing; which being
become a <hi>Record</hi> before them, they gave their Sentence upon the whole
matter, without the ancient ordinary Trial <hi>per pares.</hi> It becomes a kind
of <hi>peculiar,</hi> exempting it self from the ordinary course in manner of
Trial, and from the ordinary rules of Law, in giving of Sentence; and
as a Back-door for the King's Arbitry, in case of Judicature in matters
of <hi>Common-pleas;</hi> as the <hi>Council-Table</hi> was in <hi>Crown-pleas.</hi> They both
are looked upon with a very pleasing eye of Majesty, which loves not to
be strait-laced; yet all is embattelled under the Colours of <hi>Equity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Conveniency,</hi> and <hi>Conscience;</hi> like a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> that is bred under the
wings of the <hi>publick,</hi> but feeds it self upon it.</p>
               <p>That this had attained the Title of a <hi>Court</hi> so anciently as in King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>'s
time (as the Honourable Reporter noteth) I much question,<note place="margin">Instit. 4. c. 8. fol. 78.</note> by the
Title that <hi>Fleta</hi> gives it in later times; nor, under his favour, will that
Testimony cited out of the History of <hi>Ely</hi> warrant it, but upon a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ground of misplacing the note of distinction. For I take the words
to be thus translated: <hi>King</hi> Etheldred <hi>determined and granted, that the
Church of</hi> Fly <hi>should for ever in the King's Court hold the dignity of the
Chancery, and not hold the dignity of the King's Court of Chancery.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
it is clear that these times brought it to that condition, that it
might well carry that name, if formerly it had not: For it grew very
fast both in honour and power; and this not by Usurpation, (though it
did exceed) but by express donation from the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64112:125"/>
Yet is this power much darkned in the limits and extent thereof, chiefly
in regard that the <hi>Chancellor</hi> is betrusted with many things, whereof there
is no evidence for the <hi>Chancery</hi> to claim any cognizance. For he was in
these times a person of many interests and relations, being one of the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
in the Star-Chamber, of the King's Council, chief in the Chancery,
most commonly a Clergy-man, and therewith Legate <hi>à Latere;</hi> and in
these several Relations might act directly, and yet in several Courts. And
therefore, though he had power with others, to punish neglects of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Statutes of <hi>Wines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 12. 9 E. 3. cap. 1. 14 E. 3. c. 5.</note> by Act of Parliament; and also of the
Statute concernign <hi>Victual,</hi> and to determine matters of controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
parties in Cases depending before the Parliament, and in some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that concern the King's Revenue; yet cannot these be said to be the
proper work belonging to the cognizance of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> but to the
<hi>Chancellor</hi> by special Commission in another Relation. Albeit, I cannot
deny but the Court it self had cognizance in matters of as strange a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Viz. To punish disturbances of Merchants in their Trade,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 E. 3. c. 26. 36 E. 3. c. 9. &amp; cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>to see to the
executing of the Statutes of Purveyors,</hi> and <hi>to remedy grievances contrary
to other Statutes:</hi> Which general words let in a wild liberty to that Court
to intermeddle in Laws which were never intended for their touch; <hi>to
punish Nusances according to discretion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 12. 27 E. 3. c 24.</note> 
                  <hi>to give remedy to Merchants upon
the Statute of Staple;</hi> so that it is clear enough the Parliament intended it
should be a Court, and gave their Seal to their power of Judicature.
Nor, as it seemeth, was this any regret to the Courts of Common-Law,
but as a thing taken for granted. For the Reports tell us, That if the
King grants Tythes, arising from without the bounds of any Parish, the
Patentee shall sue in the <hi>Chancery</hi> by <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> and shall there proceed
to Issue or Demurrer; and then to the Common-Law; where upon Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
if the Defendant make default,<note place="margin">22 Ass. pl. 25.</note> the Plaintiff shall have Judgement
and Execution. And if the Heir be in <hi>Ward</hi> to the King, the Mother
shall sue and recover her <hi>Dower</hi> in the <hi>Chancery.</hi> And they tell us,<note place="margin">Bro. scire fac. 154. 24 E. 3. 73.</note> that
it had power to prohibit Spiritual Courts, and Courts of Common-Law,
yea, to over-rule or reverse Judgements: and yet the Common-Law held
it's ground when it was concerned: for neither were all suits there by
Bill,<note place="margin">43 Ass. pl. 32 24 E. 3. pl. 35. 39 E. 3. fo. 14. 21 E. 3. fo. 47.</note> as in cases of Equity, nor determined according to such rules; nor
did the power of Judicature rest in the breast of one Chancellor, but in
him joyntly with other Council of the King, which were also learned
Judges of the Law. For the Report informeth that <hi>Edward</hi> the Second
had granted a Rent in Tail to the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who dying, his Son un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
age, and <hi>Ward</hi> to the King, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third seised, amongst other
Lands, the Rent, and granted it to Sir <hi>John Molins:</hi> Upon Petition, the
King refers the matter to the Arch-bishop, and others of the Council, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to them the Chancellor. A <hi>Scire Facias</hi> goes forth to Sir <hi>John Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins;</hi>
he upon appearance pleaded to the jurisdiction, as a case belonging
to the Common-law; but it would not be allowed, because it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the King's Charter.</p>
               <p>And whereas it was objected, that the reference was to the Archbishop
and others, and therefore the cause ought not to be determined in the
<hi>Chancery;</hi> it was resolved that it did properly belong to the <hi>Chancery,</hi>
by the Law: And in the argument of the case, it appears clearly that
the King's Council there,<note place="margin">43 Ass. pl. 35.</note> were learned in the Law. And the same is
yet more evident by the Title of Bills in those days exhibited in the
<hi>Chancery,</hi> which was directed to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and the Rule given <hi>Per tout les Justices.</hi> Which I rather note, for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64112:125"/>
shortness of the form of Bills in those days, far different from these
times, wherein the substance of the complaint, however small in it
self, is oftentimes blown out into so great a bubble, that it breaks to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
And the Statutes formerly mentioned do assert the same thing, as
touching the <hi>King's Council.</hi> For though they speak of the Council or
<hi>Chancery</hi> in the English Tongue, yet in the original the words are, <hi>Conceil
en Chancery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus touched upon the matters under the Judicatory of the
<hi>Chancery,</hi> and Judges in the same: In the next place, the manner of
proceedings comes to consideration. For it seems they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
very irregular; and that contrary to the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> upon
a bare suggestion in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> the party complained of was impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and no proceedings made thereupon. For remedy whereof, it was
ordained, That upon suggestions so made, the Complainant was to find
Sureties to pursue the Suggestions; and that the Process of Law should
issue forth against the party without imprisoning him; and that if the
Suggestions were not proved true, the Complainant should incur the
like penalty that the Defendant should have done, in case he had been
found Guilty.<note place="margin">37 E. 3. c. 17.</note> But afterwards this later Clause was altered by another
Statute, because it was full of uncertainty; and it was ordained, that
in such case the Complainant shall be imprisoned,<note place="margin">38 E. 3. c. 9.</note> until he shall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Defendant of his Damages: and furthermore, shall make Fine
and Ransom to the King. But because that the Defendant many times
held his advantage,<note place="margin">17 Rich. 2. c. 6.</note> even to extremity, this course lasted not long;
but a new Law was made, which put the power of awarding Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in such cases into the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> to do according to his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And thus the <hi>Chancery</hi> obtained power to award Damages, which
they never had formely;<note place="margin">43 Ass. pl. 32.</note> and the <hi>Chancellour</hi> a Precedency both in the
<hi>Chancery,</hi> and of the Council in the Court of <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> and in
many cases in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> By the first he had a power in matters
of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> by the last, in matters <hi>Mei</hi> and <hi>Regis;</hi> and by the
other, in matters <hi>Mei</hi> and <hi>Regni.</hi> A considerable man certainly he was
in the motions of Government; but how much more, if he be made
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Cardinal,</hi> and Legate <hi>à Latere;</hi> or Arch-bishop,
Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and Legate <hi>à Latere;</hi> as these days had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times seen? Extraordinary advancements bestowed upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
brings Honour to the Throne; but if they be not men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Worth and Uprightness, they make the Scepter stoop, by stirring
up envy in the Nobility, and indignation from the people. For sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is it seen, <hi>that Advancements are fed from the Crown, though they be
bred from thence; but either maintained by new supplies from the peoples
Purses, or the ruine or decay of some Officers more ancient than themselves,
or both.</hi> And such was the condition of the <hi>Chancellour;</hi> he sucked fat
from beneath, and Bloud and Spirits from the Grand <hi>Chief Justiciar</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> and so reduced that Honourable Potentate unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Chief Justice</hi> of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> leaving scarcely unto him
the Name or Title of <hi>Lord.</hi> One thing more remaineth, touching the
election or nomination of this Great man. At the first, he was no better
than a <hi>Register,</hi> or the King's <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> or <hi>Secretary,</hi> having also
the Honour to advise the King in such matters as came within the circuit
of the Writings in his custody; and questionless, <hi>Eo usque,</hi> it is suitable to
all the reason in the World, that he should be of the King's sole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and Election. But when it befals, that instead of advising the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64112:126"/>
King, his word is taken to be the Rule, and a Judicatory power put upon
that; and unto this is superadded that honourable trust of keeping and
governing the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of the Kingdom, with the continual growing
power occasionally conferred upon him by the Parliament: He is now
become no more the King's <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> but the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and Supream <hi>Officer of State.</hi> And it seems but reasonable that
he should hold his place by <hi>publick Election,</hi> as well as the <hi>Grand Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar</hi>
(whose Plumes he borrowed) and other <hi>Grand Officers</hi> of State did
before him. For he that will have his Servant to work for another, must
give the other that Honour of Electing him thereto; nor was this laid
aside nor forgotten by these times, but a claim was put in for the <hi>Election</hi>
or allowance of this principal Officer amongst others;<note place="margin">15 E. 3. n. 10. 15.</note> the Parliament
obtaining a Judgement in the case by the King's Confession; and so the
thing is left to the judgement of future ages,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 3. 10 Rich. 2. n. 16. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. Whether a King that

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Admirals Courts.</head>
               <p>THis is a third Court that maintained the King's Judicatory power,
in a different way from that which is commonly called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law;
and by many is therefore supposed to advance the King's
Prerogative, but upon mistaken grounds. It is very true, that the
way is different from the common Road, both in it's original, and in
the course of proceedings; nor could it otherwise be, considering the
condition of the Nations, and the people of the same, interested in
common Traffique. The people thus interested, as much differed
from the other sort of <hi>Dry men</hi> (if they may be so called) as Sea from
Land, and are in nature but as <hi>March-men</hi> of several Nations, that must
concentre in some third way for the maintenance of Commerce for
peace-sake, and to the end that no Nation may be under any other
Law than its own. The condition of the Nations in the times when
civilized Government began to settle amongst them, was to be under
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who having setled one Law in the general
grounds throughout all Nations, made the Sea likewise to serve under
one rule, which should float up and down with it, that men might know
upon what terms they held their own, wheresoever they went; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what terms to part with it for their best advantage. In its original there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
this Law may be called <hi>Imperial,</hi> and likewise in the Process, because
it was directed in one way of Trial, and by one Law, which had its first
birth from the Imperial power; and probably it had not been for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
benefit of <hi>Europe</hi> to have been otherwise, at other time, or by other
directories formed. Nevertheless, this became no Gem of Prerogative
to the <hi>English</hi> Crown; for if <hi>England</hi> did comply with forrein Natives
for its own benefit (it being an Island full of the Sea, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Road from the most parts of <hi>Europe</hi> that border upon the Sea, and
of delight in Merchandise) it is but suitable to its self: and it did so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as it saved the main Stake, by voluntary entertaining those Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being imposed upon by Imperial power. For the <hi>Saxons</hi> came into this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64112:126"/>
Kingdom a free people, and so (for ought yet appeareth to me) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
to this day: I say, that in those first times, they did take into
the consideration of Parliament the regulating of the fluctuating moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Sea-laws: nor were they then, or after, properly imposed by the
King's Edict. For though it were granted, that <hi>Richard</hi> the First re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Sea-Laws in the Isle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> yet that the same should be
done without advice of Parliament in his return from the <hi>Holy land,</hi> is
to me a Riddle, considering what Histories do hold forth concerning his
return through <hi>Germany;</hi> nor can that be good evidence to entitle Kings
of <hi>England</hi> to a power to make and alter Laws according to their private
pleasure and interest. Nor doth that Record mentioned in the <hi>Institutes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instit. 4. cap. 22. fol. 142. &amp; 144.</note>
warrant any such matter, but rather on the contrary groundeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
upon Laws, Statutes, Franchises, and Customs, established; and
that this Establishment was by the King and the Council.</p>
               <p>This Law was of a double nature, according to the Law of the Land;
one part concerning the <hi>pleas of the Crown,</hi> and the other between <hi>party
and party;</hi> for properly the King's Authority in the Admiralty is but an
Authority of Judicature, according to Laws established, which both
for process and sentence are different from the Common-Law, as much
as the two Elements do differ, yet not different in the power that made
them. I shall leave the particulars to be enquired into, by them that
shall mind it elsewhere, and only touch so much as shall reflect upon
the main Government. This power was executed by Deputies diversly,
according as the times and opportunities were, for War or Peace, and
either <hi>transitu</hi> or <hi>portu.</hi> What was done in time of War, or whilst
the Ship is out of the <hi>English</hi> Seas, comes not to our purpose; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall not meddle with that, further than this, that in the first
times Kings were wont to divide the work of Judicature and of War
into several hands. The power of War and Peace they committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men of approved Courage and Skill in that service; and therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
not to the men of highest rank, who had neither Mind nor
Skill for a work of such labour, dyet and danger. This power passed
under divers names; sometimes by grant of the <hi>custody</hi> of the <hi>Sea-coasts,</hi>
sometimes of the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>Sea coasts,</hi> sometimes by being made <hi>Captain
of the Sea-men</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Admiral</hi> of the Ships. It
was a great power, and had been much greater, but that it suffered a
<hi>double diminution;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>time,</hi> for three or four years commonly
made an end of the command of one man, and at the best it was,<note place="margin">Gloss. fol. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>quam
diu Regi placuerit:</hi> the <hi>other diminution</hi> was in <hi>circuit</hi> of the power, for
all the Maritine Coasts were not ordinarily under the power of one man,
but of many; each having his proper precinct upon the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>North,
East</hi> or <hi>Western</hi> shores; and under the Title of <hi>Admiral</hi> in the times of
<hi>Edward</hi> the First, and forwards, who brought that Title from the <hi>Holy
Land.</hi> Nevertheless, about the end of the times whereof we now
Treat, the custody of the whole Sea began to settle in one hand, under
the Title of <hi>Admiral</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Seas; and the place was conferred
upon men of the greatest rank, and so continued ever afterward. The
power of Jurisdiction or Judicature all this while remained distinct, and
it seems was setled in part in the power of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Justices.</hi> For
by the Law the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Justices</hi> had cognizance of matters between
the <hi>high water</hi> and the <hi>low water mark;</hi> and what was done <hi>Super altum
mare,</hi> was within the directory of the <hi>Admiral;</hi> these were but few
things, and of small consideration: the principal of them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64112:127"/>
War or Peace, and those only within the <hi>English</hi> Seas. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third had beaten both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> at Sea,
the people grew much more towards the Sea, and became so famous,
that the greatest Lords thought the Regiment of Sea-affairs worthy of
the best of their Rank, and were pleased with the Title of <hi>Admiral,</hi> whilst
they left the work to others; and so the <hi>Admiral</hi> became a person of more
honour and less work than he had been formerly. The greatness of the
honour of this place thus growing, soon also began to contract greatness
of power beyond what it had formerly; and this was principally in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Jurisdiction. For not contented with the power of a <hi>chief Justice</hi>
of War and Peace within the Seas, which was his proper dominion, the
<hi>Lord Admiral</hi> gained the same within the <hi>low water mark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">15 Rich. 2. c. 3. Dier. 15, &amp; 16. El. mic. pl. 2. 8 E. 3. Coron. 199.</note> and in the <hi>main
streams</hi> below the next Bridge to the Sea, and in all places where <hi>Ridels</hi>
were set; and yet these places were within the body of the County. Nor
did he endeavour less to gain in matters of distributive Justice: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had a legal Jurisdiction in things done upon the Sea, so far as
to defend, order, determine, and cause restitution to be made, in cases of
damage done unjustly; yet was it no less difficult to keep this power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its own bounds, than the watry Element upon which it sloated; but it
made continual waves upon the <hi>Franchise</hi> of the Land; and for this
cause, no sooner had these great men savoured of the Honour and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that Dignity, but comes a Statute to restrain their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Cognizance of Cases, only unto such matters as are done
upon the <hi>main Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. c. 5</note> as formerly was wont to be. And within two years
after, that Act of Parliament is backed by another Act to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">15 Rich. 2. c. 5</note>
in more full expressions, saving that for Man-slaughter, the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals</hi>
power extended even to the <hi>high water-mark,</hi> and into the <hi>main
streams.</hi> And this leadeth on the next consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the
subject matter of this Jurisdiction and Authority. I shall not enter into
the depth of particulars, but shall reduce all to the two heads of <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Admiral</hi> is, as I formerly said, a <hi>Justice of Peace</hi> at Sea,
maintaining the <hi>Peace</hi> by power, and restoring the <hi>Peace</hi> by setting an
Order unto matters of Difference, as well between Foraigners, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>English</hi> and Foraigners; as may appear by that Plea in the
fourth Institutes formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That point of <hi>Justice</hi> principally concerneth matters of
Contract, and Complaints for breach of Contract; of these the <hi>Admiral</hi> is
the Judge, to determine according to Law and Custom. Now as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
unto both these, he hath Authority of command over Sea-men,
and Ships that belong to the State, and over all Sea-men and Ships in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the service of the State, to arrest and order them for the great voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of the King and Realm,<note place="margin">25 Rich. 2. c. 3</note> and during the said voyage; but this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do without express Order, because the determining of a <hi>voyage Royal,</hi>
is not wholly in his power.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Lord <hi>Admiral</hi> hath power, not only over the Sea-men
serving in the Ships of State, but over all other Sea-men, to arrest
them for the service of the State; and if any of them run away
without leave from the <hi>Admiral,</hi>

power by enquiry to make a Record thereof, and certifie the same to the
Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who shall cause them to be apprehended and
imprisoned. By all which, and divers other Laws, not only the power of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64112:127"/>
Admiral is declared, but the original from whence it is derived, namely
from the <hi>Legislative power</hi> of the Parliament, and not from the <hi>single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of the King, or any other Council whatsoever. But enough hath been
already said of these Courts of State, in their particular precincts. One
general interest befalls them all: That as they are led by a Law much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Courts of Common-Law, so are they thereby the more
endeared to Kings, as being subservient to their Prerogative, no less than
the Common-Law is to the peoples liberty. In which condition being
looked upon as Corrivals, this principal Maxime of Government will
thence arise, That the bounds of these several Laws are so to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that not the least gap of intrenchment be laid open each to other;
lest the Fence once broken, Prerogative or Liberty should become bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and bring in Confusion instead of Law.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Church-mens Interest.</head>
               <p>BUt the Church-mens interest was yet more Tart, standing in need of
no less allay, than that of the King's Authority, for that the King
is no less concerned therein, than the people; and the rather, because it
was now grown to that pitch, that it is become the Darling of Kings;
and continually henceforth courted by them; either to gain them from
the <hi>Papal Jurisdiction,</hi> to be more engaged to the Crown; or by their
means to gain the Papal Jurisdiction to be more favourable and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>Prerogative Royal.</hi> The former times were tumultuous, and
the Pope is gained to joyn with the Crown to keep the people under;
though by that means, <hi>what the Crown saved to it self from the people, it
lost to</hi> Rome. Henceforth the course of Affairs grew more civil, or (if
you will) graced with a blush of Religion: and it was the policy of these
times whereof we now treat, to carry a benign Aspect to the Pope, so
far only as to slave him off from being an enemy, whilst Kings drove on
a new design to ingratiate and engage the Church men of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto it's own Crown. This they did by distinguishing the Office
or Dignity of Episcopacy, into the Ministerial and Honourable Parts;
the later they called <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and was superadded for encouragement of
the former, and to make their work more acceptaple to men for their
Hospitalities sake; for the maintenance whereof, they had large Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Advancements. And then they reduced them to a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of their Original, which, they say, is neither <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> nor
<hi>Romanum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat. 6.</note> but that their Lordships, power, and great possessions, were given
them by the Kings, and others of this Realm. And that by vertue
thereof, the Patronage and custody of the Possessions in the vacancy
ought to belong to the Kings, and other the Founders; and that unto them
the right of Election into such advancements doth belong, &amp; not unto the
Pope; nor could he gain other Title unto such power, but by usurpation,
and encroachment upon the right of others. But these great men were
not to be won by Syllogisms; Ordinarily they are begotten between
Ambition and Covetousness, nourished by Riches and Honour; and like
the Needle in the Compass, turn ever after that way. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64112:128"/>
therefore labours to win these men, heaped Honour and Priviledges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that they might see the gleanings of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to
be better than the vintage of the Tripple Crown. Doubtless, he was a
Prince that knew how to set a full value upon <hi>Church men,</hi> especially such
as were devout; and it may be, did somewhat outreach in that course:
For though he saw God in outward events, more than any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors;
and disclaiming all humane merits, reflected much upon God's
mercy, even in smaller blessings: yet we find his Letters reflect very much
upon the Prayers of his Clergy; he loved to have their Persons nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, put them into places of greatest Trust, for Honour and Power, in
Judicature; and not altogether without cause; he had thereby purchased
unto his Kingdom the name and repute of being a Kingdom of <hi>Priests.</hi>
But all this is but Personal, and may give some liking to the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents,
but not to the expectants: and therefore the Royal Favour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
so far in these times, as to bring on the Parliament to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to the Courts and Judiciary power of the Ordinaries, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law of the Kingdom, although formerly the Canons had already
long since made way thereto by practice. I shall hereof note these few
particulars ensuing.</p>
               <p>Ordinaries shall not be questioned in the King's Court for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. cap. 6.</note>
Testamentary Matters, or Matrimonial Causes, nor
other things touching Jurisdiction of Holy-Church.</p>
               <p>Things formerly bred by the Canon, nourished by continual practice,
allowed by Ordinance of Parliament, or Grant from Kings in Parliament,
are now confirmed by solemn concurrence of the whole Representative
Body of the Kingdom, <hi>to have and to hold with Warranty.</hi> And yet the
sence is not so general as the words, nor doth it seem much other, than a
Confection made for the Arch-Bishops appetite,<note place="margin">22 Ass. pl. 70. 45 E. 3. 24. Fis. consultat. 5.</note> to cure a distemper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the King: for the Civil Judge lost nothing hereby, nor
would the Crown, as may appear by a Law of equal Authority with the
former;<note place="margin">31 E. 3. cap. 4. 25 E. 3. Stat. 3. cap. 9.</note> for though an Executor or Administrator may cheat, yet it tells
us, that Ordinaries only can oppress, and extort from dead men; and
therefore in such cases doth provide remedy by enquiry, and Indictment
before the King's Justices.</p>
               <p>They shall have Cognizance of Vsury during the Delinquent's
Life,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 5.</note> and the King after the Delinquent's death.</p>
               <p>The difference ariseth from the different end; the first being to reform
the Person by <hi>Church-censures,</hi> and to urge him to restitution; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is for the King's Fine or Forfeiture. For as touching the Usurer's
estate,<note place="margin">Miror. Just. cap. 5. Sect. 1. 51 H. 3. petit. cleri. Artic. 16. 50 E. 3. n. 158. 6 Rich. 2. n. 57 14 Rich. 2. n. 24.</note> the offence was in the nature of Felony, forfeiting both Lands and
Goods to the King, after the Delinquent's death: And it seemeth the
manner was to Indict the Delinquent during his life; and that stuck to
him as a deadly Arrow in his side, till he died. Nor did it lie in the power
of the Ordinary, by Ecclesiastical censure, so to reform the Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ender, as to
clear him to the King, unless the party offending made his peace with the
King by Composition.<note place="margin">Instit. 3. c. 70. 6 E. 3. coram Rege, Rot. 130 Porff.</note> And thus the Law continued, for ought appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to me, till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64112:128"/>
They shall have Cognizance of avoidance of Benefices of
Right:<note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 8. pro clero.</note> They shall certifie Bigamy; and Bastardy had beyond
the Sea;<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 2. 15 E. 3. Stat. 2. 9 Rich. 2. c. 4.</note> and whether a Prior be perpetual, or Dative.</p>
               <p>The first of these concerning <hi>avoidance of Churches,</hi> it seemeth was
somewhat doubtful in point of practice, for that the Civil Judge used
to determine all manner of <hi>avoidances,</hi> as well in Fact, as of Right; but
by this Statute they are restrained only unto avoidances in Fact, so as
after this Statute it is holden, that <hi>avoidances</hi> by death shall be tryed
by the Countrey; but if the <hi>avoidance</hi> be by Deprivation, Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Creation,<note place="margin">Bro. quar. imp. 85.</note> or otherwise, it shall be tryed by the Ordinary: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by common intendment he is more <hi>conusant</hi> of the thing, than
Countrey-people. But as touching the point of <hi>Bigamy,</hi> the matter is
more doubtful, in regard that commonly the Marriage of a second
Wife, or Widow, is a matter in Fact, done in the face of the people;
and of which they take notice, especially where the life of man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
which rather requireth the Judgment of his <hi>Peers,</hi> than where
the outward maintenance only is engaged. Nevertheless, because the
main point is, whether the party be a <hi>Clerk</hi> or not, and the same ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rested upon the Certificate of the <hi>Ordinary:</hi> It is by this Law again
allowed to him to try and certifie this point of <hi>Bigamy</hi> also, although the
Statute of <hi>Bigamists</hi> might seem to Entitle the Civil Magistrate thereto,<note place="margin">8 E. 3. cap. 8.</note>
as the Law was holden to be before this Statute was made. In the next
place, although it cannot be denyed but the Trial of <hi>Bastardy</hi> beyond
the Sea might as well lie in the cognizance of the Lay-Magistrate, as in
that of the Ecclesiastical; yet seeing the Clergy had already attained the
cognizance of the thing, the place proved but a matter of circumstance;
especially they having the advantage of the Civil Magistrate in this, in
regard that the Ecclesiastical persons beyond the Sea, had also obtained
the cognizance of that matter amongst themselves, their Testimony or
Certificate would come with more credit to the Clergy in this Kingdom,
than to the Magistrate, whose cognizance in such cases they did disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Lastly, concerning <hi>Priories,</hi> whereas some were <hi>presentative,</hi> and filled
by Induction from the <hi>Ordinary;</hi> and others were <hi>Donative,</hi> having their
<hi>Priors</hi> meerly at the will of the <hi>Abbot,</hi> to be placed and displaced as he
thought most expedient: If then the point in issue depends upon this
knot, this Law referreth the Trial unto the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> who by common
presumption best knows whether any Institution and Induction had passed
his Registry and Seal, or not. And thus, though a kind of Judicial power
seemeth to be carried along herewith, yet is all in a ministerial and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
way unto the Civil Magistrate; and nevertheless, with such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and authority, that the main hinge of the Judicatory, in such cases,
depends upon the dash of their pen.</p>
               <p>No Bishop,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 1.</note> nor Arch-Bishop, shall be Impeached before the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, without the Kings express Warrant.</p>
               <p>The former particulars concerned matter of Authority; this and others
ensuing, concern matter of immunity, which, or most of which were
formerly for a long time within the fancy of the Canon, but never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64112:129"/>
came to the height of Parliamentary approbation or Authority till now,
that it comes in as a <hi>peace-offering</hi> to pacifie the quarrel between the Arch-Bishop
<hi>Stratford</hi> and the King. For he being engaged in the <hi>French</hi>
Wars, so resolved to continue; and therefore to maintain distempers at
home, he held neither Honourable nor safe.</p>
               <p>Their Temporalties shall not be wasted, during the vacancy:
Nor shall they be seized,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 2.</note> but by Judgment of the Court.</p>
               <p>The first of these was an ancient Law, grounded upon great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
although dulled by time, and by covetousness of the needy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
next to laid aside, if not quite put out of countenance. So as a
new Law must be made to revive it, and to abolish that corrupt custom
or practice of depredating those possessions given to a <hi>holy use</hi> in common
supposal, contrary to the trust by them undertaken, and the use still
continuing. But the second Branch is in nature of a Law of Restraint
set upon the Common-Law: for the persons of these Spiritualized men
were of so airy a constitution, as they could not be holden by hands made
out of the Clay, such as the rude Laity were; and therefore the Civil
Magistrate, upon all occasions used to lay hold upon that, whereof there
was some feeling, which were called <hi>Temporalities,</hi> and thereby drew
them to appearance at the <hi>Lay-Courts;</hi> for however Spiritual the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
were, they would not easily part with their <hi>Lay-Fees.</hi> But now by
this Law, the times are so attenuated, that the very <hi>Temporalities</hi> are made
so Spiritual, as not to be medled with by the <hi>Lay</hi>-Magistrate, unless up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
judgment first obtained against them. And suitably thereunto, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
twelve years following, another Law was made more punctual, That
their <hi>Temporalties</hi> should not be seized upon for contempts,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 6.</note> but that
their <hi>persons</hi> should be seized: yet within twenty years after that, this
Law begins to be out of countenance, and the Opinions of the Judges
began to grow bold upon the ancient rule, that their <hi>Temporalities</hi> were
Temporal, though their <hi>persons</hi> were Spiritual; and that it was more
dangerous to imprison the person of a Clergy-man, than to attach his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.
And therefore they held,<note place="margin">44 E. 3. fol. 35, 36. Per Thorpe. 7 H. 4. fol. 41. Per Gascoign.</note> That if the <hi>Ordinary</hi> remove not the
Incumbent when the King's Writ commands him so to do, his <hi>Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
should be seized. And if the <hi>Ordinary</hi> should certifie one to be a <hi>Clerk</hi>
which is none, the like course is to be taken.</p>
               <p>They shall depute the next and most lawful Friends of the
Intestate to administer his Goods.<note place="margin">3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> E. 3. c. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Statute at <hi>Westminster</hi> the second, having given formerly a kind
of allowance that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> should be Administrator to the <hi>Intestate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">West. 2. c. 19.</note>
so far as to answer the <hi>Intestate</hi>'s Debts, lent him thereby an opportunity
to possess himself of the whole, to all intents and purposes. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
observed by the Parliament, by this Law they made way for Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
to fall through the hands of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> into the Lap of
Administrators made by the Authority of the Parliament; but of the
<hi>Ordinaries</hi> nomination, according to the Authority hereby to him given.
These Administrators thus made, had a greater power than ever the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
had, or could give. For though the <hi>Ordinary</hi> by the Statute at
<hi>Westminster</hi> was bound to pay the Debts of the Testator, yet could he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64112:129"/>
never bring Action, as the Administrator to all intents by this Law is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to do. And though it be true that the Administrator is by this
Law ordered to account to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> yet doth not that entitle the
<hi>Ordinary</hi> to any interest in the personal Estate; but only gives him a bare
Authority to take the <hi>account,</hi> without any compulsory power by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
censures to enforce him thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is such an <hi>account</hi> as is no Evidence in any Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
And lastly, if upon the foot of the <hi>account,</hi> any arrere remained,
or surplusage of Estate; the <hi>Ordinary</hi> could neither recover, nor order
the same; because by the Law anciently, the next friends had the sole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
therein: and being by this Statute made Administrators, the whole
power of ordering the Estate is vested in them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this Statute was made in favour, and for the ease of the
<hi>Ordinary,</hi> if they would please so to take it, for they could get no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by executing the Administration in their own persons, if they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Administer according to the Law.</p>
               <p>The persons of the Clergy are priviledged from Arrests,<note place="margin">5 E. 3. cap. 5.</note> during
the Holy Actions of the Officiating.</p>
               <p>This was plotted since <hi>Anselm</hi>'s time; he and his Successors endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Constitution and Canon, continually to mind the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
thereof, but could never nurse it up to the degree of a Law till
now; they gained the advantages of the times, growing into a more
tender apprehension of Devotion than formerly.<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. c. 15</note> The penalty of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
this Law is left in general, and therefore did the less scare; but
within three years after, it was confirmed with a certain penalty of Fine
and Imprisonment, as to the King's suit; and damages to the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and the Priviledge was enlarged, for, and during their continuance
in the <hi>Consecrated ground,</hi> in order to such services, and not upon Fraud or
Collusion to avoid Arrests. But by neither of these Laws was the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
(although contrary to them) made void, as touching the Process.</p>
               <p>The Goods of the Clergy are discharged from Purveyance,<note place="margin">14 E 3. Stat. 3 cap. 1.</note> and
their Houses from Quarter.</p>
               <p>The latter of these was an Encroachment upon the greater Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
For under the Title of <hi>Hospitality,</hi> which the Prelates were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to by their great Possessions and Revenues conferred upon them to
that end, Kings used to quarter Messengers to and from <hi>Scotland;</hi> the
King's Horses, Dogs, and Hawks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the point of <hi>Purveyance</hi> was
an ancient Prerogative belonging to Kings; and by no Custom were the
goods of any man discharged therefrom, till it was by Act of grace first
confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> the First,<note place="margin">West. 1. cap. 1. Stat. de prisis.</note> and afterwards by grant of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second; yet by reason of the rudeness of the times, did not those Acts
prevail to that settlement that was promised, till now <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
renewed the Law. Nevertheless, could not this Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third perfect that work, because it was but a bare command till <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second made a remedial Law,<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. c. 3.</note> giving thereby the Clergy that were
wronged a right of Action of Trespass against the <hi>Purveyors,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
treble damages; whereas formerly they were liable only to a Fine
to the King, which many times was as soon pardoned as asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64112:130"/>
These condescensions might have wedded the <hi>English</hi> Clergy to the
<hi>English</hi> Crown, but that it was coy, and expected further gratuities. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they beheld their old Step-dame <hi>Rome</hi> now in its full Splendor and
Power, and deeply interested in the sway of affairs in this Kingdom:
and above all the rest, the nigh affinity between the Prelate and the Pope
was such, that they sucked one Milk, breathed one Air, and like the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Twins, lived in each other. The latter of these was not discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those dim-sighted times, and therefore they could do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the dissolution of that knot, but left it to future times, who found
no other way than to cut it asunder. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
espyed the first, felt the inconvenience thereof, and applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such remedy as they found most ready at hand. All things that
are subject to time, are also subject to change; which comes commonly
slower upon Governments that are less Ecclesiastical: for Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer in a growing condition, than in their complete estate; like a
<hi>Christian,</hi> that seldom endures long after his full ripeness. Thus in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it is hitherto above a thousand years since the Gospel came to the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and well-nigh a thousand years since the Pope set his foot amongst
us; ever approaching nigher the Throne, and ascending thereunto; but
finding it full of a King that would not remove, he sits down in his Lap;
a heavy burthen questionless he was, considering his claim of <hi>Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
his <hi>provisions, pensions, exemptions, impositions,</hi> and such like oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and therefore it is no wonder if the King feeling the incumbrance,
gives a lift at the Popes power, by stoping the current of Money from
<hi>England, Rome</hi>-wards. To this end, the Statute made at <hi>Carlisle</hi> is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
whereby the Clergy are inhibited from conveying Treasure beyond
the Seas:<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 6. 5 E. 3. c. 3.</note> but the Pope knew how to ride, and will not so easily forgo
his saddle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle had made many a fair flight in <hi>England,</hi> and had not
yet fully gorged himself; he grants ten thousand Marks yearly out of
Taxes laid upon the Church-livings in <hi>England</hi> unto two <hi>Cardinals,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which did, nor by the Canon could live in <hi>England;</hi> the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rership
of <hi>York</hi> also to another <hi>Cardinal,</hi> after that the King had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same elsewhere. He proceeds also further to invade the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rights of the Crown, by making an Election of the B. of <hi>Norwich,</hi>
and causing him to be invested <hi>Rege renitente.</hi> The King spent eight
years in the recovery of his right, and was deluded in the conclusion: he
now sees it bootless to stand always upon his defence, and receives affron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;
he resolves therefore to enter the lists, and maketh seizure of the Deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>York,</hi> which formerly by usurpation the Pope had conferred upon a
Cardinal;<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 10. E. 3. Arch. Reg. 18 E. 3. tit. 38. Fox. 388. 25 E. 3. Stat. 5. cap. 22. Fox. Sect. 1.</note> and of all Church-livings given by the Pope to aliens. Then
a Law is made more sharp than those in the eighteenth year, wherein
<hi>Provisors</hi> of Abbies and Priories are made liable to a <hi>Proemuniri,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visors</hi>
of other Ecclesiastical Livings and Dignities (whereby the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the rightful Patron is disturbed) to be fined and imprisoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the fine and damages to the party wronged be paid. And all such as
draw men to plead out of <hi>England,</hi> in cases that belong to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the <hi>Kings Court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 E. 3. c. 1.</note> and all obtainers of <hi>provisions</hi> in the Court at
<hi>Rome,</hi> these were also subject to a <hi>Proemuniri.</hi> For whilst these things
were thus in action, the Pope bestirred himself notably with <hi>Citations,
Excommunications, Interdictions,</hi> and such other birds of prey, not only
against mean men, but Judges, Bishops, and the King's Council; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

Yet as these Bull-drivers or Summoners to the Romish Court,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. Eccles. 247.</note> were no
late upstarts, so were not these times the first that took them to task: for
before the Statutes of <hi>Proemuniri,</hi> we find provision was made against <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visors,</hi>
and that some Statute did precede those in Print, which punished a
disturber of the King's Incumbent by a Bull from <hi>Rome,</hi> with perpetual
Imprisonment, or at the King's will. Besides, the party wronged was

sequitur.</hi> And before that time also, bringers of <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> were
imprisoned; although in all these cases aforesaid, the liberty of the Persons,
both of Lords and Prelates, was saved. And thus all the while King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third kept the Field,<note place="margin">38 E. 3. c. 1.</note> he gave the Pope cuff for cuff; but reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himself to take his ease, he waxing wanton, waxed weak, and more
slowly pursued the vindication of his own Right, and his Subjects Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Laws are laid aside, and <hi>Rome</hi> had further day given to plead,
and in the mean time Execution is staid: the double mind is double dyed,
and advantage is soon espyed; above sixty Church-livings more are sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
catched and given to the Favourites at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 51. E. 3. tit. 35.</note> The Parliament rings
herewith, yet the King delays the remedy; and in this Eddy of affairs <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third dies, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second takes up the place, who
had wit enough to observe what concerned his own interest, and courage
enough to pursue it: but neither wit nor courage to over-rule his Lusts,
which in the conclusion over-ruled all rule, and brought himself to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
He found the people at his entrance into the Throne irritated
with the Pope's oppressions, and vexed at his Grandfather's desidiousness;
his spirit is also stirred within him, and himself thereby pressed to tread
in his Grandfather's former ways, and to out-run him in his latter. He
made the penalty of <hi>Proemuniri</hi> to extend to all Farmers,<note place="margin">3 Rich. 2. c. 3.</note> or others, in
nature of Bailiffs, that held any Church maintenance to the use of any
Alien;<note place="margin">7 Rich. 2. c. 13. 12 Rich. 2. c. 15.</note> and unto all Aliens that are Purchasors of such <hi>Provisions</hi> to any
use; and unto all <hi>Lieges,</hi> that shall in like manner purchase such <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as touching such as shall accept such <hi>Provisions,</hi> he ordained Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their Persons,<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. Stat. cap. 21.</note> and Forfeiture of their Estate. Notwithstanding
all this, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-leech would not so give over. The King grew
into displeasure with his Subjects, and they with him, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they see the Pope still on horseback, and fear that the <hi>English</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
their own Country-men, if not Friends and Abettors, yet are bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
faint and feigned Enemies to the Pope's Cause. Nor was it without
cause that their fear was such: for as the Pope had two hands to receive,
so they had two hearts, making shew of forming blows at the Pope,
but then always at a distance, or when without the Pope's Guard; and
thus the Laws begin to stammer, and cannot speak so plain <hi>English</hi> as
they were wont. The people hereat offended, resolve to put the Clergie
into the Van, and to try their mettle to the full.</p>
               <p>At the last parliament that <hi>Richard</hi> the Second did hold, both the
Lords Temporal and Spiritual are opposed one by one.<note place="margin">16 Rich. 2. c. 5.</note> The Lords
Temporal (like themselves) resolve and enter their Resolutions to
defend the Right of the Crown in the Cases of <hi>Provisors;</hi> although e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
amongst these great men, all were not equally resolute; for Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Brian</hi> had purchased the Pope's Excommunication against some
that had committed Burglary,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> and he was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi>
for his labour. But the Prelates answer was ambiguous, and with modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64112:131"/>
which was all one to cry (as men use to say) <hi>Craven:</hi> yet
was the Statute made peremptory, according to what was formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.
And though the Prelates cautionary way of proceeding might
be a principal reason why the Pope's power held so long in <hi>England,</hi> in an
usurping way; yet Kings also much conduced, thereto, by seeking too
much their personal ease above the honour of their place; and the Pope's
blessings, and opinion of his favour, more than their own good, or the
peoples Liberty: for there was no other balm for a distracted mind,
than that which dropped from the Pope's Lips. In like manner, <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second being already, at least in purpose, estranged from his people,
sought to get friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> to hold by the <hi>Spiritual Sword,</hi> what he
was in danger to lose by laying aside the <hi>Sword of Justice,</hi> which is the
surest Tenure for Kings to hold by. And though the Popedom was now
under a <hi>Schism</hi> between two Popes,<note place="margin">2 Rich. 2. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Vrban,</hi> yet he was so far
won for <hi>Vrban,</hi> that he not onely engaged himself, and the Parliament,
to determine his Election, and uphold the same; but also, <hi>Ex abundante,</hi>
did by Implication allow to him an Indefinite power to grant <hi>provisions;</hi>
and so at once he lost the Die, and gained a Stake, that like a bubble look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fair, but soon vanished away.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, these two Comrades, whilst they were togather, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make the most of each other that they could; and therefore
though the Popedom liked not the King, yet the Pope had his love so
far, as he could deny himself; for he had already denied his Kingdom.
And (if the Articles exhibited against the King by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth be
true) the Pope had his Faith also:<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>72.</note> For (that he might be rid of his
reputed Enemy, Archbishop <hi>Arundel</hi>) he trusted the Pope with that
Complement of making <hi>Walden</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Arundel</hi>'s
stead; which the Pope took so kindly, as he made it a Precedent for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visors
for the future. Nor did the King stick in this one Singular, but
made it his custom in passing of Laws (especially such as the King was
most devoted unto) to put more confidence in the Pope's <hi>Amen,</hi> than in
all the prayers of his <hi>Commons,</hi> with his own <hi>Soit fait</hi> to boot. The sum
then will be, that the Prize was now well begun concerning the Pope's
power in <hi>England. Edward</hi> the Third made a fair blow, and drew bloud:
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second seconded him, but both retired. The former left the
Pope to lick himself whole; the later gave him a salve, and yet it proved
a Gangrene in the conclusion.</p>
               <p>The second means used to bring down the power of the Pope in this
Nation, was to abate the power or height of the <hi>English</hi> Clergie. For
though the times were not so clear as to espy the root of a Pope in Prelacy,
yet experience had taught them that they were so nigh engaged that they
would not part. And therefore, first, they let these men know that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
was no <hi>essential Member to the Government of the Kingdom;</hi> but as there
was a Government established before that rank was known, so there may
be the like when it is gone: For <hi>Edward</hi> the Third being troubled with a
quarrel between the two Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> concerning
Superiority in bearing the Cross, and the important affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> so
urging, summoned a Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> which was fain to be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and adjourned for want of appearance, and more effectual Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
issued forth. But at the day of <hi>adjournment</hi> none of the Clergy of the
Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> would be there; and upon this occasion the
Parliament was not onely interrupted in their proceedings, but an
ill Precedent was made, for men to be bold with the King's Summons,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64112:131"/>
in such Cases as liked not them; and thereupon a Statute was made to
enforce Obedience upon Citizens and Burgesses,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. Stat. 3. cap. 6.</note> and such Ecclesiasticks
as held <hi>per Baroniam.</hi> Nevertheless, when the matters concerning <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
began to come upon the Stage, which was within two years after
that Law was made, the Clergy found that matter too warm for them,
and either did not obey the Summons, or come to the Parliament; or if
they came, kept aloof; or if not so, would not <hi>Vote;</hi> or if that, yet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Tongues so, as nothing was certainly to be gathered, but their
doubtful or rather double mind. These Prelates thus discovered, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
depended no more upon them, further than they saw meet.
At six or seven Parliaments <hi>determined matters without their Advice;</hi> and
such matters as crossed the principles of these men, and therefore in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
way might require their Sence above all the rest, had they not
been prepossessed with prejudice, and been parties in the matter. Nor
did <hi>Edward</hi> the Third ever after hold their presence at so high Repute at
such Meetings; and therefore summoned them, or so many of them, as
he thought meet for the occasion, sometimes more, sometimes fewer;
and at a Parliament in his forty and seventh year, he summoned only four
Bishops, and five Abbots. And thus the matter in fact passed in these
times, albeit the <hi>Clergie</hi> still made their claim of <hi>Vote,</hi> and desired the
same to be entred upon Record.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>tells all the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 23. Co.</note> 
                  <hi>that they hold
themselves compleat without the Clergie, and to all intents and purposes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to conclude matters concerning the Church, without their Concurrence.</hi>
Thus began the <hi>Mewing</hi> time of Prelacy, and the principal Feather of
their wings to fall away, having now flourished in <hi>England</hi> nigh eight
hundred years. And had future Ages pursued the flight as it was begun,
these Lordings might have beaten the air, without making any speedy
way, or great work, saving the noise.</p>
               <p>A third step yet was made further, in order to the reducing of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Popedom in <hi>England,</hi> but which stumbled most immediately
upon the greatness of the Prelates. For it was the condition of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
powers, besides their height of Calling, to be set in high places, so as
their Title was from Heaven; but their Possessions were from Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they gained Lordship, Authority, and power, by way of Appendix to
their Spiritual Dignities. This addition however it might please them,
yet for a long time before now, it had been occasion of such murmure and
grudge in the <hi>Commons</hi> against the <hi>Clergie,</hi> as though it advanced the
<hi>Clergie</hi> for the present, yet it treasured up a back-reckoning for these men,
and made them liable to the displeasure of the <hi>Laity,</hi> by seizure of their
great places: whenas otherwise their Ecclesiastical Dignities had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their reach And of this, these times begin now to speak louder
than ever,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Rot. Palm. 22. n. 15.</note> not only by complaints made in Parliament by the people, but
also by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament to the King, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had been now long, and too long governed by the Clergie, to the dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Crown; and therefore prayed, that the principal Offices of the
Kingdom might henceforth be executed by the Laity.</hi> And thus the stir
arose between the Lords Temporal and Spiritual, each prevailing or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ground, as they had occasion to lay the way open for them. The
Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> being still upon the upper ground, that as little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Popes Curse, as the Clergie loved him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64112:132"/>
But the worst, or rather the best, is yet behind: outward power, and
Honourable places, are but under-setters, or props to this Gourd of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
that might prove no less prejudicial by creeping upon the ground,
than by perking upward. For so long as Errour abideth in the <hi>Commons,</hi>
Truth can have little security amongst <hi>Princes;</hi> although it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
but it is a good sign of a clear morning, when the Sun-rising glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
upon the top of the Mountains. God gives Commission therefore
to a Worm, to smite this Gourd in the Root; and so at once both Prelate
and Pope do wither by undermining. This was <hi>Wickliff,</hi> that had the
double honour of Learning in <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine Mysteries.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of which had for many years passed obscurely, as it were in a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
amongst the meaner sort, who had no Endowments to hold it forth
amongst the throng of Learned or great men of the world.</p>
               <p>And though the news thereof did sound much of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Themes unmeet to be propounded to an Age scarce civilized: yet
because divers of them were more immediately reflecting upon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of the Church, wherein all the greater sort of the Church-men
were much concerned, but the Pope above all the rest; the access of all,
the matter was made thereby more easie to the consideration of the
great Lords and Princes in the Kingdom, who out of principles of State,
were more deeply engaged against the Pope, than others of their Rank
formerly had been. Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant</hi> led the way in this Act, and had
a party amongst the Nobility, that had never read the Canon-Law.</p>
               <p>These held forth <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his Learning to the world; and <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third himself favoured it well enough, but in his old Age desiting
his ease, was contented to look on, whilst his Lords Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
played their prize; yet giving his <hi>plaudite</hi> rather to his Son, than
his Spiritual Fathers, as if led by principles of Nature, rather than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
This was the blossoming part of the <hi>Wickliffists;</hi> but the principal
strength was from beneath, where the roots spread and fastned excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
especially in the South and Eastern parts of this Kingdom. <hi>To
tell of the Vsurpations of the Clergie, the Idolatry of their costly Worship,
the vanity of their Curses, &amp;c.</hi> was exceeding welcome news to an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
multitude; especially where these things were rightly understood.
The issue soon manifested it self to the world; no Parliament passed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reflections at <hi>Prelates, Rome,</hi> or some such thing; and not only the
persons and practices of these men, but even their Laws and Canons were
begun to be had in contempt,<note place="margin">51 E. 3. n. 46, 47.</note> and their <hi>Missives</hi> slighted. And thus these
men pretending patronage, both from Right drawn from Heaven, and
derived from men, fail in their Evidence, unless the people do still believe
more than they are able to understand.</p>
               <p>No marvel if <hi>Rome</hi> be now rowzed, and that sort of men that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, become now red and fiery Dragons,
taking up a new course of establishing their power by persecution. This
was a way of power indeed; but it is a touchy thing to have to do with
fire, lest it gets too high. It is therefore holden a point of discretion by
the Prelates, not to meddle with the Lords or the common people; the
former were too great, the latter too many; the one sort would not hear,
the other would not understand: the Teachers therefore being the <hi>Velites,</hi>
at them they give fire. <hi>Wickliff</hi> their Leader comes on bravely, and
notwithstanding they all made at him, he routs them, and in despite of
them all comes off fairly,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> and dies in his bed by the course of nature.
Then an Ordinance is levelled at the rest of the Teachers: this was made
of an old Canon, the nature whereof was to this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64112:132"/>
That upon complaint of the Bishop,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. Stat. 2. c. 5.</note> the King's Writ shall be
granted to apprehend Preachers of Heresies, Errours, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Slander, tending to Discord and Dissention between the
States of this Realm, with their Factors and Abettors; and to
imprison them till they be acquitted according to the Law of the
Church.</p>
               <p>This Law (for such it yet appears) gives occasion to consider of these
particulars, <hi>viz. The Crime, the Delinquents, the manner of Inquisition, and
the Penalty.</hi> For the first, (not to trouble my way with Debate about
the right of liberty of preaching) the matter in fact was, that men did
publickly Preach without Authority, matters of <hi>Theology,</hi> tending (as it
is said) to <hi>sow discord and discention;</hi> so as they are under consideration
and censure of the Church-men and Canon-Law, in one regard; and of the
Laws of the Kingdom and Civil Magistrate as disturbers of the peace, on
the other side. And thus the Subjects Liberty is cast into a mysterious,
cloudy, and doubtful posture, by matters of Opinion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the persons <hi>Delinquent</hi> are also left to an indefinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
for they are not only Preachers in publick, which might be
an Order of Men within the Church-cognizance, as things then stood, in
regard it was permitted to the Church to Authorize men to Preach; but
also their <hi>Factors</hi> and <hi>Abettors,</hi> words that might comprehend any other
person whatsoever, according to the passion or discretion of the Church-men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of this Inquisition must be <hi>according to the Canon,</hi>
and then the people are at the Church mens mercy, to return complaints
against whom they please, upon such grounds as they shall think meet.
The persons that must make this Inquisition by this Law, are the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
or any one of them; and for ought appears, the same might be done
<hi>by Pope, Council General, National, Provincial, Diocesan, or their Delegates,
according to the Canon:</hi> although the last precedent that I met with, was
executed by a <hi>Grand Council</hi> of Lords and Prelates, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second. But now the <hi>Clergie</hi> finding the <hi>Laity</hi> began to swell against
the <hi>Canon,</hi> they thought it high time to get the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> to joyn in
the work, to be as their Hands to apprehend, and Goalers to hold in custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
such as they should complain of, without any other Legal Conviction.
Although hereby they not only disclaimed the exercising of their own
power of Imprisoning, which they by the <hi>Canon</hi> formerly claimed to
have in such cases, but also acknowledged to receive their power Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
in such cases from the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus was this Ordinance levelled, as I said, but the shot fell short; for
this Law attained no further perfection than a meer shape, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of by the Parliament, within few months after its first noise;<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. Artic. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>That
it was made and published without the Commons consent or knowledge, and
that the nature thereof was directly contrary to the Liberties of the people,
and therefore they prayed that it might be repealed;</hi> and the same was done
accordingly; although the times have been such as would not suffer the
same to come into the publick Book of Statutes in print. But whether
Statute, or no Statute, they tell the King plainly, <hi>That they will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be bound or justified by the Prelates, than they or their Ancestors were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64112:133"/>
anciently used to be;</hi> and besides that, they thought somewhat more,
which they laid up against future times; nor was it long ere they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it. For a Subsidy being offered to the King by the Laity, under a
<hi>Proviso, That the Clergie would grant a Tenth;</hi> the Clergie took this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
of the Commons in snuff, and protested that the <hi>Laity</hi> should
not charge them. The Commons hereat begin to bid battle to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties
of the Clergie, and had not the King been a fast Friend in good
earnest unto the Clergie, the Laity had won the Field. Thus were these
times like the motion of the Ballance unto the Church-men, sometimes
up, sometimes down; getting somewhat which they formerly had not;
with less assurance in what they had.</p>

            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII. Concerning Trade.</head>
               <p>KINGS hitherto had lived upon the main stock, improving the same
to the utmost penny; few of them laid up for the future, much
less endeavoured to advance the principal for their Successors.</p>
               <p>There had now been Ten Kings of this Nation since the Conquest, all
of them spending what they had, or could get from the people, in the
maintenance of their Patrimony, or their own Lusts; if any over-plus
was either gained by, or saved from the game, their Executors might be
the better for it, their Heirs were not. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had a new
game to play, he must gain his right by his Sword, or he must lose it: his
Spirit was too big to sit still and bear blows; and yet pre-advising himself
about the poverty of the people, and that their patience would be spent
soon after their supplies, if they continually saw much going out, and
nothing coming in; he had a rule upon his private expences, a good gloss
upon the publick, and a platform for the augmenting of the Treasure of
the Kingdom, as well for the benefit of the people as of the Crown. In
order to the first, it is considerable, that the Royal Family was great and
numerous above all his Predecessors; that besides the King and Queen,
who were of a gallant and accomplisht deportment, they had a Son, a
Prince of as great renown as ever Prince had, and he also a Family suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his generosity; that they had other Children, every one like their
Father both for War and Peace; and that for the maintenance of all
these, the expences must be in reason larger than formerly they were wont
to be. Nevertheless, because <hi>purveyance</hi> for the King had already swelled
so big, that all other oppressions seemed to be swallowed up into that
one,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 4. 14 E. 3. c. 19. 34 E. 3. cap. 2. 36 E. 3. c. 2, 5, 6.</note> the King to moderate the rigor thereof made nigh twenty Statutes,
first excluding all servants at wages, and Horses and Dogs which were put
to board with the Sheriffs; then reducing the purveyance only to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of himself, his Wife and Children, then to the Families of himself,
the Queen, and Prince; and in the levy hereof, some mens Estates were
absolutely priviledged,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 1. 24 E. 3. c. 6. &amp; 15.</note> and some kind of Goods, as Sheep before shearing,
and Trees about the dwelling house. Nor is the setling of the manner less
considerable. It must be levyed by Authority in writing under the Seal;
and it must not be taken against the owners will,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 4. 14 E. 3. c. 19. 36 E. 3. c. 3. 4 E. 3. cap. 3. 28 E. 3. c. 12.</note> or upon malice; nor
must be spared for reward; the price must be the same with the true
Market-price, the measure according to the common measure stricked, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64112:133"/>
the payment must be immediately, if the price be under Twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
if above, it must be made in a quarter of a year; and no man must
charge more carriage than is necessary.<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 2.</note> And thus was this wild Ivy of
<hi>Purveyance,</hi> that like some kinds of Plants spreads over all, by rooting
up and cutting down, brought into some kind of fashion; that if it did
no good, it might do the less hurt unto the people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Although it be true that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was a King of
many Taxes above all his Predecessors, yet cannot this be imputed as a
blot to the honour of the Law, or Liberty of the people; for the King
was not so unwise, as either to desire it without evident cause, or to spend
it in secret, or upon his own private interests; nor so weak and irresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as not to employ himself and his Souldiers to the utmost to bring
to pass his pretentions; nor so unhappy, as to fail of the desirable issue
of what he took in hand. So as though the people parted with much
money, yet the Kingdom gained much honour and renown, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a terrour to their Neighbours, enjoyed what they had in fuller secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and so were no loosers by the bargain in the conclusion. Secondly,
although they parted with much, yet nothing to <hi>Prerogative,</hi> but in a
Parliamentary way; and so it was not <hi>taken,</hi> but <hi>given.</hi> Thirdly, though
the <hi>Taxes</hi> were frequent, yet but light: for frequent light <hi>Taxes</hi> steal
insensibly without regret; and as they grow into matters of course, so
they meet with acceptance of course. Two things made them of light
account. First, they were not <hi>Taxes</hi> altogether of Money in kind, but
of Goods, such as the Sheaf and Fleece, and such-like things, whereof
the ownership is visible;<note place="margin">5 E. 3. cap. 6.</note> whereas many are supposed to have Money
which have it not, but must borrow it, or sell their goods at an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
many times to accomplish it for the payment of their <hi>Taxes.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
these <hi>Taxes</hi> are assessed by the Neighbourhood, and not upon
extremity of Survey by Commissioners, who many times are subject
to miscarry upon grounds of private Interest, or for want of due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or by making more haste than good speed.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Taxes</hi> likewise were reduced to the ancient rule, according to
the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the first. And thus did this King shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>truly Royal in demanding his Taxes upon evident grounds of State,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 11.</note>
                  <hi>levying them with a tender hand, and employing them to their right
end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that which digested all, and bred good bloud, was, in that the
people had <hi>quid pro quo, by the advance of Trade,</hi> wherein the King shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself the <hi>Cape-Merchant</hi> of the world. Certainly, mens parts in these
times were of vast reach, that could manage such Wars, settle such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and lay such a foundation of a Treasury by Trade; a thing
necessary to this Island, next unto its own being, as may appear, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of the Riches of this Nation, but in regard of the Strength
thereof, and in regard of the maintenance of the Crown; the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of which being no other than a natural effluence of the former, it
will be sufficient to touch the same in order to the thing in hand. Now
as touching that, it is evident that the riches of any Nation are supported
by the Conjuncture of three regards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the natural Commodities of the Nation may be improved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the poorer sort of people be set a work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the value of money be rightly balanced.</p>
               <p>For as on the one part, though the people be never so laborious, if the
natural Commodities of the Island be not improved by their labour, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64112:134"/>
people can never grow much richer, than barely for subsistence during
their labour; so neither can the improvement of the natural Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
inrich the Kingdom, so long as many mouths are fed upon the main
stock, and waste the same by idleness and prodigality. Nor though both
these should concur, yet cannot the Kingdom be said truely to be rich,
unless by intercourse and Traffick there be an emptying out of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
of such Commodities by way of Barter, or otherwise, for such Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Commodities whereof this Nation slandeth in most need for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of all occasions. For God hath so attempered the whole Regiment
of the earth, in such manner, that no one Nation under Heaven can
well and comfortably subsist in and by it self, but all must give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
mutual Commodity from each other: otherwise superfluity would
make any Commodity (though in it self never so precious) vile; and
little conducible to the inriching of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Now for the compassing of all these, the Wise men of these times first
took into their consideration the principal Commodities of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and because they found them impounded in the <hi>Staple,</hi> they set
all at liberty to buy and sell the same as they pleased.<note place="margin">2 E. 3. c. 9.</note> And thus began
a <hi>Free Trade</hi> of Wool throughout the Realm, and matter for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by every man that would: but this continued not long. The
people soon had <hi>Commodity</hi> enough for work; and Kings liked too well
of the restraining of that liberty in order to their own benefit; and soon
found out occasions to reconcile the reason of State with their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and at length setled the <hi>Staple</hi> in certain places in several parts of
the Kingdom.<note place="margin">27 Rich. 2. c. 3.</note> But this extended onely unto the Commodities of <hi>Wool,
Leather,</hi> and <hi>Lead;</hi> for as yet the <hi>Manufactures</hi> were not come to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the endeavour was to advance <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and principally
such of them as are made of the <hi>Staple</hi> Commodities, amongst all which
<hi>Wool</hi> had the precedency, as being the most principal and ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
of the Kingdom; and the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of Wool of long use, but
had received little encouragement before these times, for that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had been the principal flower in the <hi>Flemish</hi> Garden, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from this Nation, by the continual supply of Wool that it received
from hence, which was the principal cause of the ancient League between
the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and this Crown. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was
now too well acquainted with the <hi>Flemings</hi> affairs, by a joynt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them in the Wars of <hi>France;</hi> and therein had gained so good
an opinion amongst them, that he might adventure to change a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a Courtesie. The <hi>Staples</hi> beyond the Sea were now taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
he now inhibiteth the Importation of forein Cloaths;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> E. 3. c. 2, 3, 5.</note> and having
gained these two steps onward of his way, he represents to the <hi>Flemings</hi>
their unsetled condition by these bordering Wars with <hi>France,</hi> the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition of <hi>England,</hi> and Freedom of the people; then propounds
to them an invitation to come over into <hi>England,</hi> promiseth them share
and share like with his own people, with such other Immunities, as they
take his offer, come over, and brought their Manufacture with them,
which could never after be recalled. So as now the <hi>Wool</hi> and <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
dwell together; and, like to Man and Wife, so long as they care
for one another, both will thrive; but if they come to play their Games
apart, both will be losers in the conclusion.</p>
               <p>The third step to the advance of Trade, was the <hi>Exportation</hi> of the
Surplusage of the Staple Commodities that remained over and besides
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64112:134"/>
that proportion that should suffice for the Manufactures; to which end
it was ordered, that no Wool should be <hi>exported</hi> till it had remained at
the Staple by the space of Fifteen days.<note place="margin">31 E. 3 c. 8.</note> That time was necessary, and
longer time might have been convenient, but that the Markets beyond
the Sea could not be delayed longer time, without much damage to the
Merchant and Owner; for as much as Winter-time is no time to prepare
Wool for the Manufacture; and by over-long continuance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
upon the hand of the Merchant or Owner, both the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the Manufacture might surfeit, lie in despair, and Trade choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby. For it is a necessary preparative to Trade, to keep the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in some kind of hunger after the Staple-Commodities, so as the main
Stock be not too great to occupy, and yet to leave enough to use. But
because this Nation formerly had been, and as yet were, used too much
to <hi>forein Manufactures,</hi> the importing of which did debase the home-made
Manufactures, and discouraged that work; therefore the Law was made
to reduce the vanity of Apparel (which infected these times) to more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.</p>
               <p>Some delight in forein Commodities and Manufactures, is, doubtless,
profitable both for Trade and Shipping; so as what is Imported exceeds
not what is Exported. For too much of that, makes the Domestick
Commodity contemptible, the Nation poor, and the people want work;
because it is a noted vanity of this Nation, That they love things <hi>far
fetcht,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">43 E. 3. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and dear bought.</hi> As a cure therefore to this disease, <hi>English</hi> Cloth
by Law is enjoyned to be worn by all persons under the degree of a
Lord;<note place="margin">11 E. 3. c. 2, 3.</note> and so the former Inhibition of Importation of forein Cloaths was
strengthned thereby. And because the <hi>English</hi> Clothiers should not
take advantage hereby to raise the price of their Cloaths to their own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
pin; therefore the Law also setled a certain Price and Measure,<note place="margin">27 E. 3. c. 4.</note>
and the same before sale was to be allowed upon view:<note place="margin">7 Rich. 2. c. 9.</note> and for the
goodness of the Cloaths,<note place="margin">17 Rich. 2. c. 2.</note> and perfect working thereof,<note place="margin">50 E. 3. c. 7.</note> Laws were
likewise made against Exportation of all such as were not perfectly
made.</p>
               <p>A fourth step to the advancement of Trade, was the compelling men
to work; for when publick employment calls men forth for service in
the Field, their mindes once in commotion, or upon the Wing, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
settle any where, or stoop to the Perk again, unless upon hope of
prey or gain to be gotten thereby. Such were the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, wherein partly for that cause, and partly for the scarcity of men
left from the Sword and Pestilence, not onely Workmen were scarce and
dear, but even the <hi>Mass</hi> it self was grown stately, the private delights of
Kings and great men, and scarce vouchsafing to be seen by common gaze,
but at a great distance. The Priests had little Charity, and the Poor
had as little Money; so as <hi>no Penny, no Pater Noster.</hi> A sick and very
crazy time questionless was it, when the Clergie were stately, and the
Poor idle. The Priests Wages for this cause are now setled;<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 8.</note> and they that
would get much, must get many littles, and do much. But the greater
sore was amongst the poorer sort; either they would not serve, or at such
wages as could not consist with the price of the Cloahts,<note place="margin">23 &amp; 25 E. 3.</note> and the subsistence
of the Clothier.<note place="margin">2 Rich. 2. c. 8.</note> L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aws therefore are made to compel them to work, and
to settle their Wages; so as now it is as beneficial to them to serve the
meaner sort of Clothiers as the richer sort: for the Master must give no
more, nor the Servant take more; and thus became labour currant in all
places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64112:135"/>
A fifth means to advance Trade, was the setling of a Rule upon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation</hi>
and <hi>Importation;</hi> this wrought a double effect, <hi>viz.</hi> The enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of this Kingdom with forein Commodities, and the maintaining of
Shipping; which was and is a principal means, not onely of strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Sea-bordering Countries, especially regard being had to these three
Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Importation does bring in more profit than Exportation dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burseth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That both Exportation and Importation be made by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
belonging to this Nation, so far as may consist with the benefit of this
Nation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That Exportation be regulated to the Overplus, saving the main
Stock at home.</hi> The truth of the <hi>first</hi> will be evident from this ground;
That no Nation can be rich, that receiveth more dead Commodities from
abroad than it can spend at home, or vend into forein parts, especially
if it be vended in its proper kind, and not in Money. And therefore
the Laws provided,<note place="margin">27 E. 3.</note> that no Merchant should Export more Money than
he Importeth; and what he doth Export must be of the new stamp,
which it seemeth was inferiour in value to the old: yet the times may
prove so penurious, that this rule may be waved for a season.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> is no less beneficial; for as it is in War, so in all Trades;
the greater the number is that is employed, the more effectual the issue
will be: And therefore though it in the general be more beneficial, that
all Exportation and Importation might be by our own Shipping; yet
in regard times may be such as now they were, that the Shipping of this
Nation is more than ordinarily employed for the service of the State:
And that every Nation striveth to have the benefit of Exportation by
Vessels of their own.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, in regard the case may be such, as Importation may be at
a cheaper rate by forein Vessels, and Exportation likewise may for the
time be more prejudicial to this Nation, if done by our own Shipping,
than those of other Nations: Therefore the course must be changed,
so far forth as will stand with the occasions of the State, and common
profit of this Nation. And for these causes, and such-like, in the times
whereof we now treat,<note place="margin">27 E. 3.</note> the Laws often varied. Sometimes no Staple-Commodity
must be Exported in <hi>English</hi> bottoms;<note place="margin">43 E. 3. c. 1.</note> sometimes all must
be done by them;<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. c. 3.</note> and within a year again that liberty was restrained;<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. c. 8.</note>
and after that,<note place="margin">14 Rich. 2. c. 5.</note> liberty given to Foreiners to Export as formerly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> and last Consideration is as necessary as any of the former:
for if Trade be maintained out of the main Stock, the Kingdom in time
must needs be brought to penury, because it is their Magazine. And for
this cause it was provided,<note place="margin">31 E. 3. c. 8.</note> That all Wool should remain at the Staple 15
days, to the end it might be for the Kingdoms use: if any one would buy,
they must do it within that time, otherwise it might be exported.</p>
               <p>The sixth means of advancement of Trade, was the setling of the
<hi>Staple;</hi> for as it was an encouragement to the first establishing of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
that the <hi>Staples</hi> were let loose; so when the Manufactures had
taken root, the <hi>Staple</hi> especially now fixed to places within this Kingdom,
brought much more encouragement thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For preserving a full Market. For whilst the Commodity lies
scattered in all places, the Market must needs be the leaner; partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Commodity lies in obscurity, and partly because when it is known
where, yet it is not easily discovered whether it be vendible or not; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64112:135"/>
besides, small parcels are not for every man's labour, and the greater are
not for every man's money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Staples</hi> are convenient for the slating of the general price of
the Commodities, in regard the quantity of the Commodity is thereby
the more easily discovered, which commonly makes the price. And the
quantity of the Commodity thus discovered, will not onely settle the
price to it self, but also ballance the price of the Manufacture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Staple</hi> having thus discovered the quantity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
will be a ready way to settle the quantity of the main Stock
that must be preserved, and regulate Exportation as touching the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus.
But it cannot be denied that the first and principal mover of the
making of the <hi>Staple,</hi> was the benefit of the Crown: For when the
Commodity was gone beyond the Sea, it importeth not to the Subjects
in <hi>England,</hi> whether the same be sold at one place, or more, or in what
place the same be setled, until the Manufacture was grown to some sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and then the place became litigious. The benefit of Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pretended much interest in the setling thereof beyond the Sea;
but in truth it was another matter of State. For when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, it was a moveable Engine to convey the King's pleasure or
displeasure, as the King pleased; for it was a great benefit to the
Countrey or place where-ever it setled; or else it moved or stayed
according to the inclination of the People where it was, either for
War or Peace. But on the contrary, the Interest of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to interpose strongly. And for these causes the Parliament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
intermeddled in the place; and thus the Scene is altered: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is beyond the Seas, in one place or in another: sometimes
in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">43 E. 3. c. 1.</note> In <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, we find it sometimes at
<hi>Calis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 16.</note> sometimes in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time, we find
it again beyond the Seas at <hi>Middleburgh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 11.</note> thence removed to <hi>Calis;</hi>
and after into <hi>England.</hi> Where at length the people understood them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so well, that the Parliament setled the same; it being found too
burthensome for the Manufactures to travel to the Staple beyond the
Seas, for the Commodity that grew at their own doors; besides the
enhansing of the price, by reason of the Carriage, which falling also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Manufactures, must needs tend to the damage of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>This was one way indeed, and yet possibly another might have been
found. For if a Computation had been made of the main Stock, and
a Staple setled within the Kingdom for that, and the overplus expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a Staple beyond the Sea, it might have proved no less commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and more complying. It is very true, that there are many that
call for the Liberty of the people, that every man may sell his own
Commodity as he pleases; and it were well that men would consider
themselves as well in their Relations, as in their own Personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
For if every man were independent, his liberty would be in like
manner independent; but so long as any man is a Member of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
his liberty must likewise depend upon the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and if it be not good for the Nation that every man should sell
his own Commodity as he pleaseth, he may claim the liberty as a Free-man,
but not as an <hi>English</hi>-man. Nor is that liberty just, so long as his
Country hath an interest in his Commodity for its safety and welfare, as
in his own person. I do not assert the manner of buying the Staple-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
by Merchants of the Staple, to sell the same again in kind for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64112:136"/>
their private advantage. Divers limitations must concur, to save it from
an unlawful ingrossing; nor doth it appear to me that the Staplers in
these times used such course, or were other than mere Officers for the
regulating of the Staple, in nature of a Court of <hi>Piepowders</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to some Fair or Market. Nevertheless, I conjecture that it may
well be made evident from principles of State, that <hi>Marts, Markets,</hi> and
<hi>Staples</hi> of Commodities, that are of the proper Off-spring of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are as necessary to Trade, as Conduits are to places that want
Water.</p>
               <p>The seventh and last means that was set on foot in these times for the
advance of Trade, was the <hi>regulating of the Mint,</hi> and the current of
Money. This is the life and soul of Trade: for though exchange of
Commodities may do much, yet it cannot be for all, because it is not
the lot of all to have exchangeable Commodities, nor to work for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
and Victual. Now in the managing of this trick of Money, <hi>two</hi>
things are principally looked unto: <hi>First,</hi> That the Money be good and
currant. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. stat. 5. cap. 13.</note> That it should be plentiful. As touching the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
of the Money,<note place="margin">6 E. 3. c. 2. &amp; 3.</note> several Rules were made, as against <hi>embasing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
against <hi>forein Money</hi> not made currant, against <hi>counterfeit and false
Money.</hi> For according to the goodness of the Money, so will the Trade
be more or less: For the Merchant will rather lose in the price of his
Commodity in Money, than in exchange for other Commodity; because
the value thereof is less certain, and the Transportation more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the <hi>plenty</hi> of Money, that is as necessary to the
advance of the Trade, as of the goodness of it. For according to the
plenty thereof will be the plenty of the Manufactures, because Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts-men
having no Commodities but their labour, cannot work for
exchange, nor can exchange supply Rents and maintenance to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of people.<note place="margin">6 E. 3. c. 2, 3.</note> To this end therefore it is provided against melting
of Money,<note place="margin">17 Rich 2. c. 1.</note> and Exportation of Silver and Gold. And yet, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or not discourage Importation of Silver and Gold, liberty was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every man to Export so much as they did Import, provided that
what they carry away must be of the new stamp, or Minted in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
By this means <hi>Bullion</hi> came in with probability that much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
would remain in the Nation in lieu of Commodities exported;<note place="margin">27 E. 3.</note> or if
not the greater part, yet at least the <hi>Mint</hi> gained, and that was some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> for the fuller currance of the Money, the Issue was established
in several parts of this Kingdom, according to the ancient custom; and
this was advantageous both to the <hi>Mint,</hi> and to the <hi>Stock</hi> of Money in
the Kingdom.<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 6.</note> This establishment was with this difference, that though
the <hi>Mint</hi> was setled by the Parliament, yet the Exchange was left to the
Directory of the King and his Council. Because the Exchange is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
thing,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 6.</note> subject to sudden alteration in other Nations,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. stat. 5. c. 12.</note> and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that in this Country it be as suddenly ballanced with the Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>change
in other Countries, or in a short time the Nation may receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
damage. In regard whereof, and many other sudden exigencies in
Trade, it seemeth to me convenient, that a particular Council were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
for continual influence into all parts of these Dominions, to
take into consideration the <hi>quantity of the Staple-Commodities</hi> necessary
to be retained as a Stock at home, for the use of the people, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures;
and accordingly to ballance the trade of Exportation and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64112:136"/>
Importation, by opening and enlarging, or shutting and straitning the
Stream, as occasion doth require.</p>
               <p>And lastly, to watch the <hi>course of the Exchange in forein parts,</hi> and to
parallel the course thereof in this Land thereto. For otherwise the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
must necessarily suffer, so long as private men seek their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
interests onely in their course of Trade.</p>

               <p>AS Times change Manners, so do Manners change Laws. For it is the
wisdom of a State, when it cannot over-rule Occasion, to pursue and
turn it to the best issue it can. <hi>Multitude of Laws therefore are not so much a
sore to the people, as a symptome of a sore people.</hi> Yet many times Laws are said
to be many, whenas they are but one, branched into many particulars, for
the clearing of the peoples understanding, (who usually are not excellent
in distinguishing) and so become as new Plaisters made of an old Salve, for
Sores that never brake out before. Such sore times were these whereof
we now treat, wherein every touch made a Wound, and every Wound
went to the Heart, and made the Category of <hi>Treason</hi> swell to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that it became an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> beyond all rule, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sence of timorous Judges, and a touchy King. Thus were many of
the ignorant and well-meaning people in an hideous danger of the gulf
of forfeiture, before they found themselves nigh the brim.</p>
               <p>All men do agree that <hi>Treason is a wound of Majesty;</hi> but all the doubt is,
where this <hi>Majesty</hi> resteth originally, and what is that <hi>Legiance</hi> which is
due thereto, the breach whereof amounteth to so high a censure: for
some men place all <hi>Majesty</hi> in one man, whom they call an <hi>absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch:</hi>
Others, in the <hi>Great men:</hi> And others, in the <hi>People;</hi> and some
in the concurrence of the <hi>King and body of the People.</hi> And it is a wild
way to determine all in one Conclusion, whenas the same dependeth
wholly upon the constitution of the Body. Look then upon <hi>England</hi> in
the last posture, as the rigider sort of Monarchical Politicians do, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
will never be in glory, but in the <hi>concurrence of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or Convention of Estates; and so upon the whole account it will
be upon the <hi>People, whose welfare is the supream Law. Rome</hi> had <hi>Kings,
Consuls, Dictators, Decemviri,</hi> and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> long before the Orator's time;
and he saw the foundation of an Empire, or perpetual Dictatorship, in the
person of the first of the <hi>Caesars:</hi> any of all which might have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
the supremacy of <hi>Majesty</hi> above the People. And yet the often
change of Government shewed plainly that it rested upon another pin;
and the Orator in express words no less; when speaking of the <hi>Majesty</hi>
of that Government, he allotteth it not to those in chief command,
but defineth it to be <hi>magnitudo populi Romani.</hi> Afterwards, when the
pride of the Emperours was come to its full pitch in the times of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> an Historian of those times, in the Life of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. partit. Orat. Si quis maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem populi Romani minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isset, <hi>Tacit.</hi> An. 1.</note> tells
us, <hi>That he declared the bounds of Treason to be determined in Three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
instances; of Treachery against the Army; Sedition amongst the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and violating the Majesty of the People of</hi> Rome: In all which, men
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64112:137"/>
were not punishable for words, but for actions and endeavours. I do
not herein propound the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as a model
for <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>à majori</hi> may conclude, that if the proper seat of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
was in the people of <hi>Rome</hi> when Emperours were in their fullest
glory, it is no defacing of <hi>Majesty</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to seat it upon the <hi>whole
body,</hi> from whom the same is contracted in the <hi>Representative,</hi> and so
much thereof divided unto the person of the <hi>King,</hi> as any one Member
is capable of, according to the work allotted unto him. These several
seats of <hi>Majesty</hi> making also so many degrees, do also imply as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of wounding: for it is written in Nature, <hi>That the offence tending
to the immediate destruction of the whole body, is greater than that which
destroyeth any one Member onely;</hi> and when the written Law maketh it
<hi>Treason</hi> to compass the destruction of the <hi>King's Person,</hi> it leaveth it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to common sence, that it is a higher degree of <hi>Treason</hi> to compass
the destruction of the <hi>Representative;</hi> and above all, to destroy the <hi>whole
body</hi> of the <hi>people:</hi> Crimes that never entred into the conceit of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self in those more innocent times; much less saw they any cause
to mention the penalty by any written Law. Nevertheless, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sad examples had occurred within the memory of this present Age, of
the danger of the <hi>person</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Kings;</hi> and yet on the other side
they saw that in such cases of <hi>Treason</hi> the King's honour was made of
reaching Leather, and might easily be strained within the compass of a
<hi>wound</hi> of <hi>Majesty:</hi> therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, imitating <hi>Tiberius,</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the crime of <hi>wound of Majesty</hi> in the Person of the King, into certain
particular instances, out of the compass whereof the Judges of the Law
in ordinary course must not determine <hi>Treason.</hi> These concern either
the safety of the <hi>Person</hi> of the King,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. stat. 5. c. 2.</note> or of the <hi>Succession</hi> in the Royal
Throne: Or lastly, the safeguard of the publick Right by the Broad and
<hi>Privy seal,</hi> the value of <hi>Money,</hi> and by persons in matters of <hi>Judicature</hi>
judicially presiding; all of them reflecting upon the <hi>King,</hi> considered in
his <hi>politick capacity.</hi> For otherwise many crimes might have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
more fatally reflecting upon the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>natural capacity,</hi> which
nevertheless are omitted, as not worthy of so high a censure. Other
<hi>Treasons</hi> are left to the determination of the Parliament as occasion should
offer it self,<note place="margin">17 R. 2. n. 20, 21.</note> whereof divers examples of a new stamp occurred within
forty years next ensuing,<note place="margin">3 R. 2. n. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>which were of a temporary regard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 Ass. pl. 29. Stat. 11 R. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and lived and
died with the times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these two notions of <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Treason,</hi> I must adde a third, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Legiance;</hi> for it is that which maketh <hi>Majesty</hi> to be such indeed, and
lifteth it into the Throne, and whereof the highest breach makes <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
And because that which hath been already said reflecteth upon an
Opinion, or rather a knot of Opinions (for I find them not punctually
adjudged) in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case, I must a little demur to them, because as
their sence is commonly taken, it alters the fundamental nature of the
Government of this Nation from a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> to a <hi>pure Monarchy.</hi>
In handling of this Case, the honourable Reporter took leave to range in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a general discourse of <hi>Legiance,</hi> although not directly within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Case; and therein first sets down the general nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
That it is <hi>a mutual bond between an English King and his people;</hi> and then
more particularly sets forth the nature of this <hi>bond</hi> in the several duties
of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>fealty,</hi> fol. 5. <hi>a.</hi> and those also in their several <hi>properties,</hi>
viz. <hi>Natural, Absolute,</hi> fol. 7. <hi>a.</hi> due to the King <hi>omni, soli, &amp; semper,</hi> fo. 12. <hi>a.</hi>
in his <hi>natural</hi> and not <hi>publick capacity,</hi> fol. 10. <hi>a.</hi> Whereas he saith, this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64112:137"/>
bond is <hi>natural,</hi> he meaneth that it is <hi>due by birth,</hi> fol. 7. <hi>a.</hi> By <hi>absolute</hi>
(if I mistake him not) he meaneth, that it is <hi>indefinite,</hi> fol. 5. <hi>b. viz. not
circumscribed by Law,</hi> but <hi>above Law,</hi> and <hi>before Law,</hi> fol. 13. <hi>a.</hi> and <hi>that
Laws were after made to enforce the same by penalties,</hi> fol. 13. <hi>b.</hi> and therefore
he concludeth that <hi>this legiance is immutable,</hi> fol. 13. <hi>b.</hi> and fol.
14. <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having slated the point as truly as I can, both for the nature of
<hi>Legiance,</hi> and the object thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and not the <hi>People,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than in order to the safety and honour of the King's person, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in his <hi>natural capacity</hi> as he is a <hi>man:</hi> I shall in the next place exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the grounds as they are severally set down, and therein shall lead
the Reader no further than the Reporters own concessions. Not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Reader with any doubt, whether this <hi>Bond</hi> consists in <hi>obedience</hi>
onely, or in that <hi>fealty:</hi> and in all, shall ever be mindful of the honour
of that Pen with which I have to deal.</p>
               <p>First, whereas it is said, that <hi>English Legiance is natural,</hi> and grounded
upon the <hi>birth</hi> of each party within the Kings Dominions and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it needeth no debate, so as the same be taken <hi>sano sensa,</hi> viz. for a
<hi>qualified Legiance,</hi> without those sublimities of <hi>absolute, indefinite, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
&amp;c.</hi> for otherwise if such a high strain of <hi>Legiance</hi> be due from
every <hi>English man by birth;</hi> then all the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or Laws concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the people, come too late to qualifie the same, because
they cannot take away the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> fol. 14. <hi>a.</hi> And thus the party
once <hi>born English,</hi> must for ever remain <hi>absolutely obliged to the King of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
although haply he lives not two Months under his protection all
his ensuing life-time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Legiance</hi> of an <hi>English-man</hi> to his King, ariseth from that
civil Relation between the two Callings of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> and therefore
it is not a <hi>natural bond</hi> which cannot be taken away. The first is true, by
the Reporter's own concessions; <hi>Protectio trahit subjectionem, &amp; subjectio
protectionem;</hi> so he saith, <hi>fol. 5. a. fol. 9. b.</hi> and therefore though it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Magistracy in general is from Nature, as he saith, <hi>fol. 13. a.</hi> yet
of weak birth is that inference which he maketh, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>English Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
is a principle in Nature.</hi> Unless it be also admitted, that all men on
Earth that submit not to <hi>English Legiance</hi> do sin against Nature. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
then will stand thus; <hi>Magistracy</hi> is founded in <hi>Nature,</hi> therefore
<hi>Legiance</hi> also. But <hi>English Magistracy</hi> is from <hi>Civil constitution,</hi> therefore
is <hi>English Legiance</hi> of the like nature. In the next place the Reporter
saith, that before any <hi>Municipal</hi> Law was made, Kings did <hi>dare jura;</hi> and
he mounts as high for an example as the <hi>Trojans</hi> Age, by the Testimony
of <hi>Virgil.</hi> But I believe he intended not much strength in this, seeing
it is well known by any that knows the Scriptures, that there were <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal</hi>
Laws given, and that concerning the Office of a King, by <hi>Moses,</hi>
which were more ancient than those of <hi>Troy,</hi> and long before the time of
<hi>Virgil,</hi> who neither tells us in what manner those <hi>Trojan Laws</hi> were made,
though the Kings gave them: nor if all were according to the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
sence, is the testimony of a Poet (who sometimes useth his <hi>Poetica
licentia</hi>) to be taken in <hi>terminis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, the Reporter voucheth the Testimony of <hi>Fortescue, c.
12, &amp;</hi> 13. which is as absolutely opposite to the main point in hand, as any
Pen can declare: For he tells us of divers sorts of Kingdoms, some gotten by
<hi>Conquest,</hi> as those of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and <hi>Belus,</hi> &amp;c. But, saith he, <hi>There is a
Kingdom politick, which is by the association of men by consent of Law, making
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64112:138"/>
one chief, who is made for defence of Law, and of his Subjects Bodies and
Estates, and he cannot govern by any other power; and of this nature,</hi> faith
he, <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> England is, <hi>fol.</hi> 30. 31, 32. A second piece of the
foundation of this opinion of the Reporter is taken <hi>ab inani; it is a vain
thing,</hi> saith he, <hi>to prescribe Laws, but where by Legiance foregoing, people are
bound to obey.</hi> But this compared with the words of <hi>Fortescue,</hi> formerly
mentioned, falls of it self to dust; and therefore I shall not further enlarge
concerning it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reporter brings in, to help the matter, the consent of the
Law in elder times, by certain Cases vouched to that purpose; the first
concerning the <hi>Legiance of Children to Parents;</hi> which cometh not to this
case, because it is a <hi>Legiance of Nature;</hi> and this <hi>Legiance</hi> whereof we
speak, is yet under a litigious Title: And I suppose will in the conclusion
be found to rest onely upon a <hi>Civil constitution;</hi> therefore I leave that.
The second is, <hi>That a man attainted and outlawed, is nevertheless within the
King's protection; for this</hi> (saith the Reporter) <hi>is a Law of Nature, Indele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis
&amp; immutabilis, and neither Parliament nor Statue can take this power
away,</hi> fol. 13. <hi>b.</hi> 14. a. And therefore the Reporter concludes, <hi>That as
well the Legiance of the Subject, as the Protection of him by the King, are
both of them from the Law of Nature.</hi> An opinion that speaks much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
yet it seems strange, considering the Pen: for if it be a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and immutable, for the King to protect persons attainted, then must
no such person suffer; for if he be under the King's protection, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a Law of Nature, cannot be changed by any positive Law, as the
Reporter saith; nor can the King be so bound by any such Statute, but
by a <hi>non obstante</hi> be can set himself at liberty when he pleaseth: and
then the issue will be this, The King hath a natural power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the persons of Law-breakers from the power of the Law, therefore
much more their Estates; and then farewel all Law, but this of the <hi>Kings
natural Protection.</hi> I say that these are of a high strain, considering what
the Reporter speaketh elsewhere. But to pursue his instance, he saith,
<hi>That the King hath power to protect an attainted person: That if any man
kill him without warrant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 Co. fo. 88.</note> 
                  <hi>he is a Man-slayer;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Co. fo. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and yet this person attainted
hath lost the legal protection.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Co. fo. 35.</note> It is true,<note place="margin">7 Co. fo. 36.</note> yet not to all intents; for by the
Sentence of the Law, his life is bound up under the Law of that Sentence,<note place="margin">35 H. 6. 63.</note>
                  <hi>viz. That he must not suffer in other manner than the Sentence determineth,
nor before Warrant of Execution issue forth to that end.</hi> And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Sentence,</hi> yet the Law leaveth him a liberty of Purchase, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
though to the use of the Crown; and therefore in some respects
the <hi>Law</hi> protects his person so long as he lives, and the <hi>King's natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
is in vain in such cases.</p>
               <p>Lastly, suppose the King hath a power of <hi>Non ohstante,</hi> if the same be
allowed to him in a limited way by the Law, it is no Argument to prove the
<hi>King's natural power,</hi> which is driven at under <hi>natural Legiance,</hi> much
less if it cannot be made forth that the Law doth allow any such power
of <hi>Non obstante</hi> at all; but by the iniquity of the times, permitteth the
same to subsist, onely to avoid Contention, as it came into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by way of Usurpation. And thus I have onely discovered the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this first Qualification, which I shall onely leave naked, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that no man seeing it, will build at all thereupon.</p>
               <p>The second Property that cometh to be considered is, <hi>That English Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
is absolute,</hi> fol. 5. <hi>b.</hi> fol. 7. <hi>a.</hi> which is a word of a vast extent, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rather to amaze men's apprehensions than to enlighten them. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64112:138"/>
therefore the Reporter did well not to trouble himself or the Reader in
the clearing or proof thereof, but lest the point rather to be believed than
understood; nor shall I in the Negative. For God himself can have no
other <hi>Legiance</hi> from an <hi>Englishman,</hi> than <hi>absolute Legiance;</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi>
being (as other men) subject to erre, especially in this point of <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
are much rather subject thereto, being misled by such Doctrines as
these are. The Scripture determines this point,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 19.</note> and cuts the knot in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The third property of <hi>English Legiance</hi> which the Reporter insisteth
upon, is, that it is <hi>indefinite;</hi> which he explaineth to be <hi>Proprium quarto
modo,</hi> so as it is both <hi>Vniversal</hi> and <hi>Immutable, fol. 5. b. fol.</hi> 12. and <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defined by Time, Place,</hi> or <hi>Person.</hi> As touching the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi>
the Reporter enlarged not at all, therefore I shall onely leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to chew upon the point, supposing himself in the first times of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fourth, when <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was then alive; and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to which of them his <hi>Legiance</hi> had been due, considering them
both in their <hi>natural capacity,</hi> as the Reporter would have it. But as
touching the place, it is reported that <hi>English Legiance</hi> is not onely due
from an <hi>English man</hi> to an <hi>English King</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> but in all places of
the Kings Dominions, though otherwise Forem, as to the power of the
Law of <hi>England.</hi> Yea, saith the Reporter, <hi>as far as the Kings power of
protection doth extend.</hi> And yet this had not been enough, if the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be granted: For if this <hi>Legiance</hi> whereof we speak be <hi>absolute,</hi> and
<hi>omni, soli, &amp; semper,</hi> then it is due to the King from an <hi>English man ubivis
Gentium.</hi> Nevertheless, to take the Reporter in a moderate sence, it is
worth consideration, whether <hi>English Legiance</hi> in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third extended as far as the Kings power of Protection, whenas he had
the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in a Forein right to that of <hi>England.</hi> In this the
Reporter is extreamly positive, upon many grounds which he insisteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> he saith, that <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Fidelis</hi> are qualities of the mind, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be circumscribed within the predicament of <hi>Vbi;</hi> and upon this
ground he might conclude, that this <hi>Legiance</hi> is due to the King from an
<hi>English man</hi> all the world over, as well as in all the King's Dominions. But
concerning the ground, it may be denied: for though simply in it self
considered as a notion, <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Fedility</hi> are not circumscribed in place;
yet being qualities of the Soul, and that being in the Body, in relation
thereunto, it may be in the predicament of <hi>Vbi:</hi> for where-ever that
<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> is, there is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> according to its model; which
though not <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>indefinite,</hi> yet if according to the Laws of the place
wherein the man is, he is truly said to be <hi>Verus &amp; Fidelis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reporter argueth, that the King's Protection is not <hi>local,</hi>
or included within the bounds of <hi>England,</hi> therefore also is not the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance:</hi>
for, <hi>Protectio trahit Legiantiam, &amp; Legiantia Protectionem.</hi> Had
this reason been formed into a Syllogisim, it had appeared less valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for the Protection of an <hi>English King, qua talis,</hi> of an <hi>English
man,</hi> is <hi>local,</hi> and included within the bounds of the Kingdom. But
if the same King be also King of <hi>France,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and
an <hi>English man</hi> shall travel into those parts, he is still under the
same King's protection, yet not as King of <hi>England,</hi> but as King of
<hi>France,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Aquitane.</hi> Otherwise, let the party be of <hi>France,</hi> or
<hi>Aquitane,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> all is one, he must be (whether <hi>French</hi> or <hi>English</hi>)
under an <hi>unlimited absolute Protection,</hi> without regard had to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64112:139"/>
Customs or Laws of the place; yea, contrary to them, which I believe
the Reporter never intended to affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Reporter salleth upon the <hi>matter in fact,</hi> and tells us, that
the King of <hi>England</hi> did many times, <hi>De facto,</hi> grant Protections to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in places out of the <hi>English</hi> Consines; and it will not be denied. But
never was any <hi>absolute and indefinite</hi> Protection so granted: for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
extends to defence from injury, and all injury is to be expounded
and judged according to the Laws of the place. Nor do any of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
vouched by the Reporter clear, that the King of <hi>England</hi> did
grant, as King of <hi>England,</hi> Protection to any <hi>Englishman</hi> in any parts of
the King's Dominion beyond the Seas, which was not qualified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws and Customs of that place. Especially it being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that an <hi>English</hi> King may hold Dominion in Foreign parts, in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
under a Foreign King; as <hi>Edward</hi> the Third held the Dutchy of
<hi>Guien;</hi> and therefore cannot grant <hi>absolute Protection</hi> in such place, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>absolute Legiance</hi> from any person there being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Reporter saith, That the King of <hi>England</hi> hath power
to command his Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to go with him in his Wars, as well
without the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as within the same; therefore the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
of an Englishman</hi> to his King, <hi>is indefinite,</hi> and not <hi>local,</hi> or <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by place,</hi> or <hi>within the Kingdom of</hi> England. Although the first
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se be granted, yet will not the inference hold; for possibly this
may arise from the constitution of a positive Law, and not from <hi>natural</hi>
or <hi>absolute Legiance;</hi> nor doth any Authority by him cited, justifie any
such <hi>Legiance.</hi> But I cannot agree the first; for it is not true, that the
King hath any such power from his own personal interest; nor doth the
authority of former Ages warrant any such matter. For a fuller disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
whereof, I shall refer the Reader to the Eleventh Chapter ensuing,
because the <hi>whole matter concerning the Militia cometh there to be handled
in course.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To close up all the rest, the Reporter brings <hi>The Testimony of
the Judges of the Common Law, out of the Testimony of</hi> Hengham; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an Action was brought by a French woman against an English man, who
refused to answer, because the Plaintiff was a French woman, and not of the
Legiance or Faith of</hi> England. This was disallowed by the Judges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Legiance and Faith</hi> was referred to <hi>England,</hi> and not to the King.
Thereupon the Defendant averred, that the Plaintiff is not of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> nor of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the King: And upon this Plea
thus amended, the Plaintiff gave over her Action. The Reporter from
hence observeth, that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Legiance</hi> is referred to the King <hi>indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>generally,</hi> and therefore it is so due to him. The reason might
have had more force, had the Object of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
been the point in question; but neither of them coming to debate,
and <hi>Allegiance</hi> being subjected to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> to the King, I see
not what more can be concluded from hence, but that <hi>Allegiance</hi> from
an <hi>English man</hi> is due to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> to the King; which I suppose
must be intended to be in order to that <hi>Allegiance;</hi> because by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Plea <hi>England</hi> had them both, and the King was wholly left out in the
Case. Nevertheless, I rather think that the present point in controversie
will receive little light herefrom on either part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64112:139"/>
We are now come to the fourth property of <hi>English Legiance,</hi> that it is
due to the King's <hi>Natural Capacity,</hi> and not to his <hi>Politick Capacity</hi> or
due to the Office of a King, in regard of the Person of the Man, and not
to the Person in regard of the Office, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. And because this is of no
small importance, neither easily understood, nor granted: Therefore he
backeth his Opinion by many reasons.</p>
               <p>First, he saith, that the King sweareth to his Subjects in his <hi>Natural Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi>
therefore the Subjects swear to him in his <hi>Natural Capacity.</hi> This
reason was intended to be taken from Relatives, and then it should have
been thus: <hi>A King doth swear to his Subjects in their Natural Capacity,
therefore Subjects swear to a King in his Natural Capacity.</hi> But it being
otherwise, it is mistaken, and proves not the Point. Yet if we should take
the Reporter, <hi>in sano Sensu,</hi> there is no question but the Oath is made to
the <hi>Natural Capacity;</hi> yet not <hi>Terminativè,</hi> more than the <hi>Oath</hi> of the
Tenant to his Lord, which this Author pleaseth to couple with the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
dependence between King and Subject, <hi>fol. 4. b. 5. a.</hi> Nor doth the <hi>Oath</hi>
of an <hi>Englishman</hi> bind him to the Obedience of all, or any Commands,
which the King shall give in relation onely to his <hi>Natural Capacity,</hi> or in
opposition to his <hi>Politick Capacity:</hi> Nor will the Reporter himself allow
that the <hi>Politick Capacity</hi> of the King, can be separate from his <hi>Natural Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
fol.</hi> 10. And yet it is evident that a King may in his <hi>Natural Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
command that, of which his <hi>Politick Capacity</hi> cannot give Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>The second reason of this Opinion, is taken from the nature of <hi>Treason,</hi>
which saith the Reporter is committed against the <hi>Natural Person</hi> of the
King; and this is against <hi>due Legiance,</hi> according to the form of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in that Case provided. This is not <hi>demonstrative,</hi> because that
crime which is done against the <hi>Natural Person</hi> of a Man, may as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it in relation to his Place or Office; and so may <hi>Treason</hi> be plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the <hi>Natural Person</hi> of a King, as he is <hi>King:</hi> neither is there
any other difference between the murther of a <hi>King,</hi> and a private Man,
but only in regard to the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of a King, which makes the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of him <hi>Treason.</hi> For which cause all Indictments that do conclude,
<hi>Contra Legiantiae debitum,</hi> do as well also conclude <hi>Contra Coronam &amp; Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reason is this; <hi>A body politick</hi> can neither make nor take
<hi>Homage, 33. H. 8. Bro. tit. Fealty:</hi> Therefore cannot the King in his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Capacity take Legiance.</hi> The first must be granted only <hi>sub modo:</hi>
for though it cannot take <hi>Homage</hi> immediately, yet by the means of the
<hi>Natural Capacity,</hi> it may take such service. And therefore that Rule
holds only where the Body Politick is not aggregate, and not one Person
in several Capacities; for the Tenant that performs his service to his Lord,
performs the same to his Lord in his <hi>Natural Capacity,</hi> but it is in relation
to his <hi>Politick Capacity,</hi> as he is his <hi>Lord.</hi> For <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Tenant, King</hi> and
<hi>Subject,</hi> are but Notions, and neither can give nor take service; but that
Man that is Lord, or Tenant, or King, or Subject, may; even as the
power of protection is in a King, not as he is a Man, but as a King.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason is this: The King's <hi>Natural Person</hi> hath right in
the Crown by Inheritance, therefore also in the <hi>Legiance</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
This is the strength (as nigh as I can collect) of that which is set
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64112:140"/>
down as a sixth reason; but I make it the fourth: because the third, as I
conceive, is but an illustration of the second; and the fifth is upon a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of a <hi>Fides ficta;</hi> whereas that <hi>Faith</hi> of an <hi>English</hi> Subject, which
is according to Law, is the truer of the twain. But to the substance of
this fourth reason: If the first be granted, yet the Reporter cannot attain
his conclusion; for the King may in his <hi>Natural Capacity</hi> have right to
the Crown by Inheritance, and yet not right in the <hi>Legiance</hi> of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
otherwise than in the right of the Crown. As in the case of Lord
and Tenant, the Lord may inherit the Lordship in his <hi>Natural Capacity,</hi>
but the service is due to him as Lord, and not as by Inheritance in the
service in the abstract. And though it be granted, that the <hi>Legiance</hi> to
a King is of a higher strain than that of a Tenant to his Lord, <hi>fol. 4. b.</hi> 5.
<hi>a.</hi> yet doth the Reporter bring nothing to light, to prove them to be of
a different Nature in this regard.</p>
               <p>The fifth and last reason that cometh to consideration, is, from a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Parliament; for it is said, <hi>That this damnable Tenet of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to the King in his Politick Capacity, is condemned by two Parliaments:</hi>
But in truth I can find but one under that Title, that mentioneth this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and that is called <hi>Exilium Hugonis,</hi> which is sum is nothing else,
but Articles containing an enumeration of the particular offences of the
two <hi>Spencers</hi> against the State, and the Sentence thereupon. The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are, <hi>For compassing to draw the King by Rigour, to Govern according to
their Wills: for withdrawing him from hearkning to the advice of his Lords:
for hindring of Justice, and Oppression; and (as a means hereunto) they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Bill or Schedule to be published, containing, That Homage and Legiance
is due to the King, rather in relation to the Crown, than absolutely to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
because no Legiance is due to him, before the Crown be vested upon him:
That if the King do not Govern according to Law, the Lieges in such case are
bound by their Oath to the Crown, to remove him either by Law or Rigour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the substance of the Charge; and upon this exhibited in the
Lords House, the Lords, <hi>super totam materiam,</hi> banish them before their Case
is heard, or themselves had made many appearance thereto. So as to the
matter of this Schedule (which contains an Opinion suitable to the point
in hand, with some additional aggravations) the Parliament determineth
nothing at all: but as to the publishing of the same, to the intent to
gather a party, whereby they did get power to act other enormities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Charge. And in relation to those enormities, the Lords
proceeded to sentence of Banishment; all which was done in the presence
of the King, and by his <hi>disconsent,</hi> as may appear by his <hi>discontent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
as all Historians of those Affairs witness. And it is not probable that
the King would have been discontented with the proceedings of the Lords
in asserting the Prerogative of a King, in that manner of the Schedule, if
he had perceived any such thing in their purposes. Add hereunto, that
the Lords themselves justified the matter of the Schedule in their own
proceedings, all which tended to enforce the King to govern according
to their Counsels, and otherwise than suited with his good pleasure. By
force they removed <hi>Gaveston</hi> from the King's presence formerly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
the <hi>Spencers,</hi> in the same manner: So they removed the King
from his Throne, and not long after out of the World.</p>
               <p>Last of all, I shall make use of one or two Concessions, which hath
passed the Reporter's own Pen (in this discourse of his) for the maintaining,
that the <hi>Legiance</hi> of an <hi>Englishman,</hi> is Neither <hi>Natural,</hi> nor <hi>Absolute,</hi> nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64112:140"/>
                  <hi>Indefinite,</hi> nor due to the <hi>Natural Capacity,</hi> but qualified according unto
Rules.</p>
               <p>The first is this: <hi>Englishmen do owe to their Kings, Legiance according to
their Laws;</hi> therefore it is not <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Absolute,</hi> or <hi>Indefinite.</hi> The
inference is necessary: for the latter is boundless, and Natural; the former
is limited, and by civil Constitution. If any breach therefore of <hi>English</hi>
Legiance be bounded by Law, then the Legiance of an <hi>English</hi> man is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed,
and not Absolute, or Natural. The major proposition is
granted by the Reporter, who saith, that the Municipal Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
have prescribed the order and form of <hi>Legal Legiance, fol. 5. b.</hi> And
therefore if by the Common Law, the Service of the King's Tenant, as of
his Mannor, be limited, how can that consist with the absolute Legiance
formerly spoken of, which bindeth the Tenant, being the King's Subject,
to an Absolute and Indefinite Service? Or if the Statute-Laws have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Rule, according to which each Subject ought to go to War in the
King's service beyond the Sea, as the Reporter granteth, <hi>fol. 7. &amp;</hi> 8. then
cannot the Legiance be absolute to bind the Subject to go to War accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Kings own pleasure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An <hi>English</hi> King's protection of his Subjects, is not Natural,
Absolute, Indefinite, nor Originally extendeth unto them in their Natural
Capacity: therefore is not the Legiance of an <hi>English</hi> Subject to his King,
Natural, Absolute, Indefinite, nor Originally extendeth to the King, in
his Natural Capacity,</p>
               <p>The dependence of these two resteth upon the Reporters own words,
who tells us, that <hi>Protectio trahit Subjectionem, &amp; Subjectio Protectionem;</hi>
Protection draws with it Subjection, and Subjection draws with it Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so as they are <hi>Relata,</hi> and do prove mutually one anothers Nature,
<hi>fol. 5. a.</hi> And in the same Page (a few lines preceding) he shews why this
<hi>Bond</hi> between King and Subject is called <hi>Legiance,</hi> because there is a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal,
and double <hi>Bond:</hi> for as the <hi>Subject is bound</hi> in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the
<hi>King,</hi> so is the <hi>King bound</hi> to the <hi>Subject</hi> in <hi>protection:</hi> But the King is not
Naturally bound to protect the people, because this <hi>Bond</hi> begins not at his
Birth, but when the Crown settles upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Protection is not absolute, because the King must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Laws, <hi>fol. 5. a.</hi> and the Laws do not protect absolutely, any man
that is a breaker of the Laws.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This protection is not Indefinite, because it can extend no
further than his power, and his power no further than his Dominions, <hi>fol.</hi>
9. <hi>b.</hi> The like also may be instanced in continuance of time.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The King's protection extendeth not originally to the Natural
Capacity, but to the politick Capacity; therefore till a Foraigner cometh
within the King's Legiance, he cometh not within his protection: And
the usual words of a Writ of Protection shews, that the party protected,
must be in <hi>Obsequio nostro, fol. 8. a.</hi> The sum then is, that <hi>as protection of
an English King, so neither is Legiance, or Subjection of an Englishman, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Absolute, Indefinite, or terminated in the Natural Capacity of the King.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the point, and make the same more clear,
I shall instance in one Precedent that these times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
produced. The former <hi>English</hi> Kings had Title to many Territories in
<hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, had Title to all the Kingdom. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possibly not so sensible of what he had in possession, as of what he had
not; He enters <hi>France</hi> in such a way, and with that success, that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64112:141"/>
the <hi>English</hi> Nation; and more than stood with the safety of the Kingdom.
<hi>For in the union of two Kingdoms, it is dangerous for the smaller, lest it be
swallowed by the greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was foreseen by the <hi>English,</hi> who knew <hi>England</hi> did bear but a
small proportion to <hi>France,</hi> and complained of that inconvenience; and
thereupon a Law was made, that the people of <hi>England</hi> should not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the King,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. Stat. 4.</note> or his Heirs, as Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Which manifestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that an <hi>English</hi> King may put himself in such a posture, in which
<hi>Legiance</hi> is not due to him; and that this posture is not onely in Case of
Opposition, but of diversity, when he is King of another Nation, and
doth not <hi>de facto,</hi> for that Time and Place, rule an <hi>English King.</hi> Which
if so, I suppose this notion of <hi>Natural, Absolute, and Indefinite Legiance</hi> to
the King in his <hi>Natural Capacity</hi> is out of this Kingdom, if not out of the
World: and then the foot of the whole Account will be, that the <hi>Legiance
of an Englishman, is Originally according to the Laws;</hi> the sum of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comprehended in the joynt safety of the people of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THe great growth of Courts founded upon Prerogative, derogated
much in these times from the Ancient Courts, that formerly had
attained the Soveraignty over the people, and in the hearts of them all,
This was a hard lesson for them to learn, but especially of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi>

of Peace.</hi> Those of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> were now grown very common,
but less esteemed, as being by men of mean regard nominated for the most
part by the party that sued out the Commission, which for the most part
was done in behalf of those that were in danger, and meaned not to be
justified by Works, but by Grace. These escapes, though small in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,

both of the Judges of such Court, and the Causes. The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Goal-delivery likewise, grew more mean and ordinary: The chief
sort of Men in the several Counties, had formerly the power, but were
found to savour too much of Neighbourhood and Alliance. The leading
of the work therefore, is now committed to the Judges at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
and the other made onely Associates to them. But above all, the Courts of
<hi>Sheriffs, Coroners,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leets,</hi> were now grown sowr with Age, having attained
courses by common practice, differing from Oppression onely in Name;
and yet were the times so unhappy, as by these courses they had obtained
favour and respect amongst the great men, and so gained more power
from above, to abuse them below. These men loved to be Commissioners
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and having learned how to make capital offences pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary,
found-such sweetness, as they used not to be weary of their places,

in such matters of benefit, they cannot rest till they obtain more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64112:141"/>
certain settlement in their places; some for Years, others for Life, and
some for ever.</p>
               <p>The Disease thus contracted by degrees, the Cure must be accordingly:
First, the <hi>Sheriffwicks,</hi> much dismembred to please the Court-favourites,
and fill the Kings privy Purse, and all raised to the utmost peny of the
full, and beyond the just value: A Law is made to restore the several
<hi>Hundreds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 12, &amp; 15.</note> and <hi>Wapentakes,</hi> to the Sheriffs and their Counties, and all
of them are reduced to the old Rent: And it is likewise provided, that
none shall execute that place in County or Hundred, who shall not then
have sufficient Lands in that County to answer damages for injustice by
them done.<note place="margin">2 E. 3. c. 4.</note> And that no <hi>Sheriff</hi> shall serve in that place above one year;
and then not to be chosen again for that service till three years be past:<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 4.</note>
which latter clause was onely a <hi>medium</hi> taken up for the present occasion,
in regard that men of ability became very rare in these times,<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. c. 11.</note> especially
in some of the Counties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>election</hi> of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> is likewise not to be forgotten; for though
the Counties had the election of Coroners, in regard they looked that no
man should come nigh their bloud but whom they trusted;<note place="margin">28 E. 3. c. 6.</note> yet the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
came not so night their skin, nor yet so nigh their Free-holds as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
they had done, for that their power in Judicature was much
abated, and so not worthy of so high regard; yet in respect he was still
to be a Minister of Justice, and his place valuable more than formerly, it
was holden convenient that such as had the chief power of Judicature at
<hi>Westminster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 7.</note> viz. the <hi>Chancellour, Treasurer, Chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aron,</hi> and the <hi>two Chief
Justices,</hi> should nominate the man that should be their Servant; and in
the Parliament nevertheless they interposed in that Election as often as
they saw cause.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As touching <hi>Causes criminal,</hi> which more ordinarily come
within the cognizance of these Courts. They generally held the same
regard in the eye of the Law in these times, that they had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nevertheless, in two crimes these times wrought diversly, urging the
edge of the Law against the one, and abating it as to the other. The
latter of these is commonly called <hi>Petit Treason,</hi> which is a murther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the Commonwealth, in an inferiour degree, and at a further
distance, because it is destructive to that <hi>Legiance</hi> by which Families do
consist, and of whom Kingdomes are derived.</p>
               <p>In former times it extended unto the <hi>Legiance</hi> between Lord and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Miror Just. c. 2. sect. 13. 21 E. 3. fol. 17. b.</note>
and Parents and Children: But by this Law of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the <hi>Legiance</hi> onely of Man and Wife, Master and Servant,
Clerk and his <hi>Ordinary;</hi> the last of which was now lately taken up, and
might have been as well laid aside, as divers others were, but that in
these times much is to be yielded to the power of the Prelacy, who loved
to raise the power of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> to an extraordinary pitch, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
might be the more considerable.</p>
               <p>This reducing of <hi>Treason</hi> into a narrower ground, made the Regiment
of Felonies to swell. A hard thing it was in a Warring time, for men to
conceit themselves well drest, until they were compleatly armed. Some
used it for a Complement, and amongst others, honest men had as good
cause to use it, as some that were ill-affected had a bad; and of the last
sort, some did aim at private revenge, though many aimed against the
publick quiet. But however the intentions of men thus harnassed might
be different, the looks of them all are so sour, that it is hard to know a
man for Peace, from a man for War. And therefore the people were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64112:142"/>
now so greedy after Peace, as they are ready to magnifie or multiply all
postures of arm'd men into the worst fashion, being well assur'd that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way to keep themselves from the hurt of such men, is to have none of
them at all. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had more need of them than so,
and will therefore allow men to ride armed,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 2.</note> but not to Troop together,
to rob, kill, or imprison any man; and if any person did otherwise, it
should be Felony, or Trespass, but not High Treason.</p>
               <p>All this was in favour to the people, and yet it was not all; for when
Mercy groweth profuse, it becomes Cruelty. <hi>Murther</hi> is very incident
to times of War, yet is an Enemy to the Peace, of so high a nature,
that though the King's Pardon may do much, yet both King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
declare it an impardonable crime, by the Common Law, and <hi>that the
King's Prerogative shall not extend so far as to pardon the same.</hi> This Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
done to the party dead, was a mercy to them that were alive; a
means to save bloud by bloudshed; and not so much by the King's Grant,
as by his Release. One thing more in these cases of bloud the people
obtained of the King, which they had not so much by Release as by
Grant, and that was the taking away of <hi>Englishire,</hi> an ancient Badge of
the Imperial power of the <hi>Danes</hi> over the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and which had either
continued through the desidiousness of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the times of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Confessor, unto the <hi>Normans</hi> time, or by them taken up again,
and continued until these times, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was so far desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to declare his readiness to maintain the Liberties of the people, as
to be willing to restore them where they failed, and in particular took
away the manner of presentment of <hi>Englishire,</hi> blotting out the Title
and Clause concerning it,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 4</note> out of the Articles of Inquiry for the Judges
<hi>Itinerant.</hi> And thus, whether Native or Foreiner, all men are now made
in death equal, and one Law serves all alike.</p>
               <p>Next unto bloud, these times grew more sensible of <hi>Ravishments</hi> than
former times had done. For though they had determined a severe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
against so foul a crime, and made it in the nature of a Felony ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
which was enough to have scared any man from such attempts; yet
for the proof of the matter in Fact, much rested upon the will of the
Woman, which for the most part grounded upon self-respects, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
prudence, laboured to conceal that which could not be made whole
by revealing; and by after-consent, skin'd over the sore as to themselves,
which corrupted inwardly, and endangered the whole Body. To cure
which,<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. c. 6.</note> a Law is made to restrain such late connivance in the Woman,
by depriving her both of her Joynture and Inheritance,<note place="margin">5 E. 4. fol. 58.</note> which otherwise
had been saved to her by such compliance, as after-consent unto such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of the Course of Civil Justice during these times.</head>
               <p>HOwever the course of the Law concerning matters of the Crown,
passed in a troubled Wave; yet in matters of Common Pleas, it
passed in a Calm and full Channel, as the Reports in Print do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witness; nor was there any change of Principles, but onely some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64112:142"/>
tending to a clearer manifestation of the same. I will not touch
upon every particular, but onely upon two, which reflect somewhat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the publick Policy; the one touching the course of <hi>Inheritance</hi> in some
particular cases, the other touching <hi>pleading</hi> in the Courts of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
               <p>The first of these was occasioned from Conjuncture of Affairs, the
case being such, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had now gotten himself a new
Kingdom unto that of <hi>England,</hi> and must look to maintain that by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which he obtained by force; and conducing thereunto, must have
continual employment of the <hi>English</hi> in that Service, as being most trusty
to his Cause. And that it is unreasonable, that such <hi>English</hi> as had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
themselves to his Service in this Cause, and in order thereunto, had
transported themselves and their Families into those foreign parts, should
thereby lose the benefit of <hi>Lieges</hi> in the Birth-right of their Children
born in those foreign parts.<note place="margin">17 E. 3. n. 19.</note> Upon consideration had thereof, and of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
leading Opinion of the Lawyers &amp; Parliament, a Declarative Law was
made:<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That all Children born without the Kings Legiance, whose Father and
Mother, at the time of their birth, shall be under the Faith and Legiance of
the King of</hi> England, <hi>shall have the benefit of Inheritance within the same
Legiance, as other Inheritors have.</hi> These are the words of the Statute, and
do occasion a double observation; one from the matter, the other from
the manner of the Expression.</p>
               <p>The Subject <hi>matter</hi> is so delivered, not as an Introduction of a new
Law, but as a Declarative of the old, that lay more obscurely hidden, for
want of occasion to reveal it; and the substance thereof resteth onely in
this: To enable the Children of <hi>English</hi> Natives, born beyond the Seas;
not the Children of those that are of foreign birth, though within the
Kings Territories in those parts, as the Opinion hath been. Nor doth any
ancient Precedent or Case warrant the same; as might be at large mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
if it might conduce to the end of this Discourse. And for the same
cause, after this Statute, whenas the Commons would have had a general
Naturalizing of all Infants born beyond the Sea, within the Kings Segni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories;
the same would not be granted,<note place="margin">42 E. 3. c. 10.</note> otherwise than according to the
former Statute, and the Common Law.</p>
               <p>That which in the next place concerneth the manner of Expression, is
this: <hi>That a Child is said to be born out of the Kings Legiance, and yet the
Father and Mother at the same time to be of the Faith and Legiance of the
King of</hi> England. It seemeth to me, that it intendeth onely those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>English</hi> Parents, born within the Kings Territories beyond the Seas,
because the words ensuing, concerning Certification of <hi>Bastardy</hi> of such
Children, are, <hi>That the same shall be made by the Bishop of such place, upon the
Kings Writ directed to him;</hi> which could never have passed into those
places that are not of the Kings Territories: And so the Issue will be,
That the <hi>Legiance</hi> of those born in those parts, though they are <hi>Leiges</hi> to
the King, yet they are not of the <hi>Legiance</hi> of the King of <hi>England,</hi> but as
Lord of that Territory.</p>
               <p>The other matter to be observed concerning pleading in the Courts of
Civil Justice, is this: That whereas anciently, from the <hi>Normans</hi> time, till
these times,<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> the pleadings were in the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue, they shall be
henceforth in <hi>English;</hi> out of an inconvenience, I believe, rather supposed
than felt. For though some kind of knowledge of <hi>Law-terms</hi> may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64112:143"/>
thereby, yet unless that shall be professedly studied, it will breed
nothing but Notions, and they an over-weening conceit, which many
times sets men to Suits in Law to their own loss; like some weak influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Celestial Bodies, that are strong enough to stir up humours,
but not to expel them, or draw them out. However, even thus in part
is the reproach of <hi>Normandy</hi> rolled away, like that of <hi>Egypt</hi> from the
<hi>Israelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Gilgal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>WAR</hi> is ever terrible, but if just and well governed, Majesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:
the one may excite resistance and defence, but the other
conquers before blow given; because it convinceth the Judgment, and
so prevails upon the Conscience. For that heart can never be resolute
in its own defence, that is at War with its own understanding; nor can
such a heart consider such a <hi>War</hi> otherwise than as <hi>Divine,</hi> and bearing
the face of an Ordinance of God; and then how can the Issue be unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful?
It is no strange thing for Kings to miscarry in their <hi>Wars,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is rarely seen that they are under good Counsel; but if a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Counsel miscarry, we may conclude it extraordinary in the efficient
cause, and no less wonderful in the issue and end. Upon this ground it
concerneth a <hi>Christian</hi> Nation, not onely in point of honour, but of
safety and continuance, to settle fundamental Laws of War, against
time of War; as of Peace in time of Peace. Neither was <hi>England</hi>
deficient herein, saving that antient times were more obscure in the
particulars, and these days revealed them at such a time, wherein we
may say, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third approved himself not onely King of
<hi>England,</hi> but of himself, above the ordinary strain of expectation.
For being now become a famous Commander and Conquerour, having
also an Army inured to fight and overcome, and so might have given a
Law; he nevertheless received the same, submitting both it and himself
to the Directory of the Parliament in making a <hi>War</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> which
was three to one against him in very respect, but in the Title, besides the
disadvantage from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that lay continually beating upon his Rear.
The like may be observed of his <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Scotland;</hi> in both which he
evidently telleth the World, that he held it unreasonable to enter upon
the managing of an offensive <hi>Foreign War,</hi> without the concurrence of
the common consent of the People; and that not onely for the thing
it self, but also for his own Personal Engagement in the Service. For
a King, though he be the <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> yet is he so from the People; and
his Person being of that high value, is not to be exposed to every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that may provoke War, without due advice first had with the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Council;</hi> because in his Person the People adventureth as well as
himself. And in this manner were the Wars in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> concluded upon debate. In the next place, as
touching the <hi>Arrays</hi> of Men for <hi>War,</hi> I find no foot-steps of any power
which was claimed as peculiar to the King therein, and acknowledged
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64112:143"/>
by the Parliament; but many instances do I meet with in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site;
all which do plainly tell us,<note place="margin">13 E 3. n. 15 17, 18, 37, 38.</note> that the old shifts of <hi>Jurati</hi> and <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati
ad arma,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. n. 14, 15, 16, 19, 42, 53.</note> could do little either in the calling of men forth, or arming
them for the <hi>War.</hi> But in case of publick defence against Foreigners,
men were summoned upon their <hi>Legiance</hi> as anciently was used.<note place="margin">20 E. 3. n. 14.</note> And
this was by both King and Parliament fully declared, and all such Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
by writing called in and damned as dishonourable to the King.
In foreign service the course was no less regular: if the <hi>War</hi> was by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
direction of the Parliament, they likewise ordered the manner of the
raising of Souldiers, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<hi>Burrough;</hi> all which are by the express words of the Statute said to be
granted by the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it was onely upon the King's particular instigation, and not by
order or consent of the Parliament,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 5.</note> the King in such case being <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier,</hi>
all the Souldiers were in like manner; unless some particular
Law or Tenure otherwise obliged them. As touching the arming of
Souldiers, the Law was yet more certain and particular. If the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were men of Estate, they were armed according to the ancient
rule, asserted by the Statute at <hi>Winton;</hi> or otherwise were especially as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the Parliament, or by virtue of their Tenures. The first of
these is confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third in Parliament, wherein he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
that no man shall be urged to arm himself otherwise than he was
wont in the times of his Ancestors Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 E. 3. cap. 5. Stat. 2.</note> The two latter
were likewise confirmed by another Law, made in the same Kings time,
whereby it was ordained, <hi>That no Man shall be constrained to find Men of
Arms, Hoblers, nor Archers, other than those which hold by such services, if
it be not by common consent and grant made in Parliament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat. 5 cap. 8.</note> By <hi>Men of
Arms,</hi> meaning those which we now call <hi>Curiassieres,</hi> or compleat armed;
by <hi>Hoblers,</hi> meaning those now called <hi>light Horse-men.</hi> The <hi>Archers</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on Foot, and were principally armed with Bows, although they had
also Swords, or other such offensive portable Weapons.</p>
               <p>The first of these concerneth onely the arming of a man's own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the other the finding of Souldiers, and arming of them, and
both together sufficient for the safeguard of the Rights and Liberties of
the People, invaded in those times by Commissions of <hi>Array,</hi> and such
other expressions of Prerogative Royal: for as touching the arming
of a man's own person, the Statute of 1 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
is clear in the point. And though the Statute of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3.
doth not in the latter direct, as touching the finding Arms for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as is urged in his Majesty's Answer to the Declaration of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
concerning the Commission of <hi>Array, July</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fol 418.</note> 4. 1642. yet is
it therein granted, that a <hi>compleat Souldier</hi> is within the Letter of the
Statute; and seeing the person of the Souldier is not in the power
of any private person in such cases to command him to the service, it
seemeth clear to me, that the Statute must intend the arming of him
with <hi>compleat Arms,</hi> and not the armed person of the man. The
Souldiery thus <hi>arrayed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Par. Rot. 3 E. 3. n. 18.</note> they are in the next place to be called to

then the Recognizances of such as undertook the work, are estreated.
All plunder or spoil committed by the Souldiers in their <hi>Conduct,</hi>

was to be satisfied by the <hi>Conductor</hi> or Commander that received their

had formerly <hi>de facto</hi> been defrayed sometimes by the County by

any such duty, but disclaimed it, and ordained by Act of Parliament,

from the time of their departure from their several Counties. For to
this end,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 7.</note> and for the safeguard of the Realm, and for the maintenance of
the Wars of <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Gascoign,</hi> the King had supply from
<hi>Aids, Reliefs, Wardship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. Stat. 2. cap. 1.</note> and <hi>Escheats:</hi> Nor did
the Parliament grant any particular <hi>Aid</hi> by the Assessment or publick
Tax, but when they evidently saw the burthen of <hi>War</hi> to be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
as it befel in the Conquest of so great and potent a Realm as <hi>France</hi>
was. Wherein although the <hi>Taxes</hi> were many, yet so well ordered
were they, and with that compliance from the King, that the people
endured them with much patience, so long as the King lived. Lastly,
in all these Cases of <hi>Foreign Wars</hi> (for of such Cases onely these Laws
are to be understood)<note place="margin">1 E. 3. Stat. 2. cap. 5.</note> it was especially provided, <hi>That no man should be
distrained, or urged against his will, to go out of his County.</hi> But in case of
<hi>defensive War,</hi> the course was otherwise: for all men in such cases are
bound by the Law of Nature to defend their own Country from Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in order to the safety of their own Estates and Habitations. They
were <hi>arrayed,</hi> or gathered together by <hi>Commission of Array</hi> from the
King, armed according to the Laws formerly mentioned, and not by
Arbitrary order of the Commissioners. And by virtue of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
they were drawn forth and led to places where need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Sometimes to one Coast, sometimes to another, yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the Kings pleasure: for the Parliament upon occasion set rules
of Restriction,<note place="margin">13 E. 3. n. 18.</note> and generally exempted the <hi>North-parts</hi> beyond <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
from being drawn <hi>Southward,</hi> and left them as a reserve for the

the <hi>Array</hi> should be executed onely in some particular Counties,
and other times wholly exempted the County adjacent,<note place="margin">

miles of the Sea-coast. And because the King might under colour of a
defence, <hi>array</hi> the people, where no such occasion led the way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them out of their Counties,<note place="margin">1 E. 3. Stat. 2. cap. 5.</note> a Statute is made that states the Case
wherein such <hi>Array</hi> shall be; the words whereof are variously set forth
in the Books in print, whether determinatively, or carelesly, I cannot
tell; but all of them to differ in sence one from another, and from the
Truth.</p>
               <p>Some of the common Books have the words thus: <hi>None shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to go out of their Counties, unless for cause of necessity, and of sudden
coming of Strangers or Enemies into the Kingdom.</hi> Others read it thus:
<hi>But where necessity requireth, and the coming of strange Enemies into the
Kingdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fol. 422.</note> The Kings Answer to the Parliaments Declaration concerning
the <hi>Commission of Array,</hi> would read it thus: <hi>Vnless in case of Necessity,
or of sudden coming of strange Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. But the words in the Roll
are these: <hi>Et que nulls ne soient distresses d'aller hors de les Countees, si
non pur Cause de necessity, de suddaine venue des Stranges Enemies en
Reyaulme.</hi> In English thus, word for word: <hi>And that none be distrained
to go out of the Counties, if not for cause of Necessity, of sudden coming of
strange Enemies into or in the Kingdom:</hi> which words determine the point.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64112:144"/>
That none shall be by <hi>Commission of Array</hi> drawn out of their County, but
in case of <hi>necessity.</hi> And secondly, that this case of <hi>necessity,</hi> is onely <hi>the coming
of strange Enemies into or in the Kingdom;</hi> so as probably the <hi>Invasion</hi> must be
actual, before they be drawn out of their Counties, and not onely feared; and
it must be a <hi>sudden Invasion,</hi> and not of publick note, and common fame fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going;
for then the ordinary course, either of Parliament or otherwise must,
be used to call those that are bound by Statute or Tenures, or Voluntiers,
to that service, seeing every <hi>Invasion</hi> is not so fatal as to require a Commission
for a <hi>General Array.</hi> Against what hath been thus noted, the judgement
of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case lies yet in the way, who affirmeth,
<hi>that the Subjects of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fol. 7. b.</note> England <hi>are bound by their Legiance to go with the
King in his Wars, as well within the Realm, as without;</hi> and this <hi>Legiance</hi> he
telleth us, <hi>is that natural Legiance which,</hi> he saith, <hi>is absolute and indefinite,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and not local;</hi> which if not so, then were not the <hi>English</hi> bound to
go out of <hi>England;</hi> an inference that is neither necessary, nor is the
thing affirmed certain. It is not necessary, because <hi>English men</hi> may be
bound to go out of <hi>England;</hi> by vertue of their Tenures, particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
or else by special Act of Parliament, and not by vertue of that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Legiance</hi> which in truth is nowhere.</p>
               <p>Now for the maintenance of the point, the Reporter alledgeth two
Statutes affirming the thing, and common practice; and lastly, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of the Judges of the Common Law.<note place="margin">12 H. 7. c. 1. 2 E. 6. c. 2.</note> As touching the Statutes, one
in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's time, and the other in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time,
I shall speak of them in the succeeding times, when we come at them,
for they are no Warrant of the Law in these times whereof we now treat;
much less is the modern practice of these later days, a demonstration of
the Law in the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, nor of the nature of the
Law in any time, seeing that it is obvious to times, as well as particular
persons, to do and suffer things to be done which ought not so to be;
and therefore I shall for the present lay those two Considerations aside.
But as touching the Opinions of the Judges of the Common Law, two
Cases are cited in the Affirmative, which seem in the Negative; and the
rest conclude not to the point.</p>
               <p>The first of the two Cases, is the opinion of Justice <hi>Thirning</hi> in the
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">7 H. 4. Protect. 100.</note> word for word thus: <hi>A Protection lies for the
Defendant in a Writ upon the Statute of Labourers, and yet the Defendant
shall not have such matter by way of Plea,</hi> viz. <hi>That the King hath retained
him to go beyond the Sea: for the King cannot compel a man to go out of the
Kingdom;</hi> that is (as the Reporter saith) <hi>Not without Wages;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereby, that if the King shall tender <hi>Wages</hi> to any Man, he must
go whither the King shall please to send him; which is not onely destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the opinion of <hi>Thirning</hi> concerning the Plea, but also (though
granted) is destructive to the Reporter's Judgement in the main point.
For if an <hi>English man</hi> may refuse to go without <hi>Wages,</hi> then is he not
bound to go by any <hi>natural absolute Legiance,</hi> as the Reporter would
have it. And as touching the second Case, which is <hi>Bigot</hi>'s and <hi>Bohun</hi>'s
Case, it cleareth the same thing; for it was resolved, <hi>that they ought to go
but in manner and form according to the Statutes;</hi> then is not the ground in
the <hi>absolute Legiance,</hi> for that is not qualified but in the positive <hi>Statute-law,</hi>
which tieth onely in <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> and that by voluntary consent
in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Cases do neither conclude the main point, nor the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
thing that the Reporter intendeth: For he would imply to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64112:145"/>
Reader, that <hi>English men</hi> were anciently used to be <hi>imprested</hi> for the <hi>Wars</hi>
in <hi>France:</hi> and hereunto he voucheth one Authority out of ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Law in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time,<note place="margin">44 E. 4. fol. 12.</note> one Anthority in the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">12 H. 4. 7. 32 H. 6. fol. 4. 17 H. 6. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.</note> and three in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; none of
all which do speak one word concerning <hi>Impresting.</hi> And that in <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third doth imply the contrary;<note place="margin">19 H. 6. 35.</note> for the Case is, that in a <hi>Praecipe
quod reddat,</hi> a Protection was offered by the Defendant, as appointed to
go beyond the Sea with the Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and the Plaintiffs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
alledged, <hi>That the Defendant had been beyond Sea with the Duke, and
was returned.</hi> To this the Defendant's Counset answered, <hi>That the Duke
was ready to return again;</hi> and for this cause the Protection was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Yet a <hi>Quere</hi> is made upon this ground, that it might be that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
would not go over with him, nor was it proved that he would;
which sheweth plainly, the party was not <hi>imprested;</hi> for then the thing
had not been in his power to will or nill.</p>
               <p>The last instance that the Reporter produceth, is that of <hi>Forinsecum
Servitium,</hi> or <hi>Foreign Service,</hi> and that seemeth to be <hi>Knight-service</hi> to be
performed abroad. But this falleth short of the Reporter's intention in
three respects.</p>
               <p>First, Though it belongeth to the King, yet not to him onely, but to
other chief Lords;<note place="margin">Bract. li. 2. fol. 36, &amp; 37.</note> so saith <hi>Bracton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not due from every <hi>English man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, It is a <hi>Service</hi> due by vertue of <hi>Tenure,</hi> and then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
will be, That which is due by <hi>Tenure</hi> of Lands, is not due by
<hi>natural</hi> and <hi>absolute Legiance:</hi> and so this <hi>Foreign Service</hi> arising meerly
by <hi>compact</hi> and agreement between Lord and Tenant, and not by the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
duty</hi> of an <hi>English-born</hi> Subject, (which is the thing that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
drives at in all his discourse) will be so far from maintaining the
Reporters opinion, as it will evidently destroy the same.</p>
               <p>And thus the posture of this Nation in the Field remaineth regular in
the rule, whatever hath been said against it; notwithstanding that in the
very instant of Action there may be some irregularity, which no doubt
both was, and ever will be, in stormy times. Nor did it conquer the
Law: For though <hi>War</hi> may seem to be but a sickness of the State, yet
being in Truth, as the <hi>Vltimum refugium,</hi> and onely reserve unto Law, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to a retreat by opression; it is no wonder if this motion, or rather
commotion, that brings on the Law of Peace in the Rear, be still and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
subject to rule of Law, how unruly soever it self seemeth to be.
Now because <hi>Law</hi> imports execution, and that presupposes a Trial, and
it a Court; therefore did our Ancestors (amongst other Courts not
regulated by the Common Law) form a Court for the service of <hi>War,</hi>
called the <hi>Court-Marshal,</hi> or the <hi>Constables Court,</hi> according as the Office
of one or the other had the preheminence. The proceedings here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were ordered, as I said, not accordiag to the Common Law, for that
is like the Land, much distant from all other Nations; and the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Island with other Nations (as in time of Peace, so of War)
requires a rule common to all those Nations, or otherwise no Negotiation
can be maintained. And for this cause the proceedings in this Court were
ever according to the rule of the <hi>Civil Law.</hi> The work of this Court is
principally Judicial, and in some cases Ministerial.</p>
               <p>The first reflects upon cause Foreign and Domestick, and both of those
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64112:145"/>
are either Criminal, and such as concern the common Peace of the place
of <hi>War,</hi> or more civil, relating onely unto private interest. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>first</hi> of these, I suppose it is no Bull, to speak of a <hi>common Peace,</hi>
in the place of <hi>War.</hi> For a <hi>common Peace</hi> must be in each party within
it self, or otherwise no party at private variance can subsist within it self,
much less make <hi>War</hi> with the other; and therefore in order unto <hi>War,</hi>
there must be a <hi>Law of Peace,</hi> for the Trial of Offenders, and punishing
them for offences committed against the good Government of the <hi>War:</hi>
Such as are <hi>breaking of Ranks, deserting the Standard, running away from
the Colours, Mutinies, Murthers, Rapes, Plundering-private Quarrels, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to command, and such-like; all which do bear the shew of crimes
against the <hi>common Peace</hi> of the Army and the Country.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>second</hi> sort, are matters concerning <hi>Quarter,</hi> and Contracts in
order to the government of the <hi>War,</hi> saving such as are made before either
part be inrolled for the <hi>War.</hi> For if a man doth covenant to serve in the
<hi>War,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. Stat. 1. c. 20. 8 Rich. 2. n. 31</note> and keepth not his day at the first Rendezvouz, he is to be attached
by Writ at the Common Law.<note place="margin">8 Rich. 2. c. 5. Regist. fo. 191. 2.</note> Causes <hi>Domestical</hi> likewise fall under
the like division: for whatsoever cause may be <hi>Forein,</hi> may also be <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick;</hi>
because the Army is ever embodied within the Kingdom, and
must be under the Directory of the <hi>Martial law</hi> upon the first forming
thereof. Now though the particular Laws of the Army, for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, be ordinarily according to the prudence of the General,
yet certain Fundamentals have been <hi>ab Antiquo,</hi> made by Custom, and the
Parliament, against which the course of Judicature must not go. And
as the Parliament saw need,<note place="margin">50 E. 3. n. 33. n. 161. 3 R. 2. n. 27.</note> it set also particular directions; as for the
payment of <hi>Souldiers Wages</hi> for remedy of wastings and <hi>plunderings</hi> in
their own Country, and other such emergencies. But the execution of
all these Laws Originally was in the <hi>Marshal</hi> of the Army. And because
that the Army was generally dissolved, or such persons engaged in such
matters of controversie departed from the Army before the same were
concluded, therefore the <hi>Marshals Court</hi> continued, in order to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of these matters. And in continuance of time, other matters
also crowded into that Society, although sometimes under the Directory
of the <hi>Constable</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as well as at other times under the <hi>Marshal;</hi>
more particularly, that power of determining matters concerning Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niament;
a sport that like a <hi>Sarcasm</hi> tickles the fancy, but wounds the
heart; and being of as little use in a Commonwealth as of benefit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is laid aside; nor need I to speak any more concerning it. There
is one thing more somewhat like a <hi>Torniament,</hi> but that it is in good
earnest, and that is called <hi>Duel.</hi> This cometh likewise within the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of this Court, but in a Ministerial way, and as subservient to the
Common Law, in cases of Appeal and Right. Hereof needs likewise
little more than the naming, and therefore I shall leave the Reader,
that would understand the particular managing thereof, unto the
discourse compiled by the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's
time.<note place="margin">Gloss. 129.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> As touching the antiquity of this Court, though it may be
great, yet the power thereof was doubtful, and scarce taken notice of in
any publick Act of State, till about these times; whenas a complaint
was made by the Commons for the encroachment of that Court upon
the Liberty of People, and bounds of the Courts of Common Law.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64112:146"/>
Nor is it strange, that such unquiet times brought forth such Precedents;
but much more strange, that the <hi>Common Law</hi> held up its head against such
violent irruptions of <hi>War.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Peace.</head>
               <p>YOu have seen the Kingdom in Armour, now see it in Robes,
and you will say that its Majesty therein is as grave, as it was
in the other brave. It is true, the tempers are so contrary, as it may
be wondred how one and the same should be wise and willing for both:
but when God will do much, he gives much, and can make a People
as one man, like unto <hi>Caleb,</hi> fitted both for <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Besides,
the Times were now much conducing hereto. It is vain to endeavour
to allay Humours in the Body which are maintained by Agitation;
they must be purged out, or the whole will still be endangered: and
therefore, although Kings hitherto did endeavour to establish a peaceable
Government, yet being led by ill Principles of private Interests, they
laboured to little purpose. But now the Scene is altered, and one wise
moderate King, that was as wise as valiant, did more than they all. And
first set a rule upon his own desires, contenting himself with the condition
of an <hi>English</hi> King; and then upon his people, making them contented
with the condition of <hi>English men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The order herein was no less observable; for the former wrangling
Times having trained up the mindes of men in a tumultuous way
nor could they skill to pace in the steps of <hi>Peace,</hi> the King led them
into Foreign parts to spend their heat, till being either weak or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they are contented to return home, and study the happiness of
a quiet Life. These men thus ordered, the rest at home are made
more cool, like a Body after Physick, and all are now contented to
submit to Law and Magistracy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> fitting time now it was for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of Peace</hi> to come upon the Stage in their best garb. For though
the work was more ancient, yet like some loose Notes laid aside in
several places, it was not to be found, but at a distance, and after long
delay. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third sums up all into one brief, and brings
a compleat Model thereof into the World for future Ages to accomplish,
as occasion should lead the way. The course was now established to
have Justices setled in every County, there to be resident and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that Service. First, they were named <hi>Guardians,</hi> or <hi>Wardens of
the Peace;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 E. 3. c. 16.</note> but within a few Years altered their Title to <hi>Justices.</hi> First,
they were <hi>chosen</hi> out of the good and lawful men of each County:<note place="margin">1 E. 3. n. 5.</note>
After that,<note place="margin">17 E. 3. n. m.</note> they were two or three <hi>chosen</hi> out of the worthiest men, and
these were to be joyned with Lawyers.<note place="margin">1 E. 3. c. 6.</note> Then was one Lord, and three
or four in each County of the most worthy men,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 2.</note> adjoyned with <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</hi>
Afterward,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. c. 1.</note> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time, the number of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi>
in each County might attain to the number of Six, and no Steward
of any Lord to be admitted into the Commission;<note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 10.</note> but within half a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64112:146"/>
year all is at large, so be it that the choice be out of the most sufficient
<hi>Knights, Esquires,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the County. Again, within two
years,<note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 12.</note> the number in each County is set at Eight; yet in all these the
<hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Serjeants</hi> were not reckoned, so as the work then seemeth not
so much as now a days, although it was much of the same kind; and
yet it grew up into that greatness which it had by degrees. Before they
were setled by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, there were <hi>Custodes pacis,</hi> which might
be those whom we now a days call the <hi>High Constables</hi> of the Hundred,
whose work was purely Ministerial.</p>
               <p>Afterward, about the second year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Guardians</hi>
of the Peace had power of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> in matters of <hi>riding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
upon the Statute 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2 E. 3. c. 3.</note> After that, they have power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
by <hi>Indictment</hi> in certain Cases;<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 2.</note> within four years after, they have
power of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in Cases of <hi>false Jurors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 E. 3. n. 67.</note> and <hi>Maintenance:</hi>
and about ten years after that,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 2.</note> they obtained like power in matters of
<hi>Felony</hi> and <hi>Trespass.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17 R. 2. c. 10.</note> The way of <hi>Commissions</hi> in case of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
thus opened, another occasion of <hi>Commission</hi> offers it self for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminative
power, in case of offences against the Statute of <hi>Labourers;</hi>
and the Cognizance hereof is soon setled upon <hi>Commissioners</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
specially chosen for that Service;<note place="margin">25 E. 3.</note> which questionless,<note place="margin">Stat. 1. c. 7.</note> as the Times
then stood,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. c. 11.</note> was as commendable work as it was necessary. For <hi>Souldiers</hi>
were so many, that <hi>Labourers</hi> were very few; and those that once are
accustomed to Arms, think ever after meanly of the Handicraft; nor will
they ever stoop thereto, after their Spirits are once elevated by mastery
of Adventures. And secondly, those few <hi>Labourers</hi> that remained of
the Sword, Plague, and other disasters of these wasting times, understood
their advantage, and set a value upon their Labours, far above their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
apprehending that men would rather part with too much of a little,
than to let their work lie still that must bring them in all they have.
But these <hi>Commissioners</hi> lasted not long, though the work did. The <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of Peace</hi> are looked upon as meet for that service; and it is a vain
thing to multiply <hi>Commissions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">42 E. 3. c. 6.</note> where the work may be done by one, that
before this time had obtained an additional Cognizance of all Causes of
<hi>Riots, Batteries, wandering</hi> dangerous persons, and offences in <hi>Weights</hi>
and <hi>Measures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">34 E. 3. c. 5, 6.</note> and in <hi>Purveyance.</hi> To them, I say, all this work concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Labourers</hi> is also committed by the Parliament; and herewith a way
was laid open for Crimes of greatest regard under Felony, to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by Trial in the Country, according to the course of Common
Law.</p>
               <p>The issue of all which was, not onely ease to the people, but a great
escape from the rigour of the <hi>Council-Table</hi> in the Star-chamber, and the
Kings Bench at <hi>Westminster,</hi> on the one side; and also from the gripe of
the <hi>Clergie</hi> on the other; who hitherto held the Cognizance of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
in <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> to themselves. This model so pleased all
men, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, that was pleased with nothing but his own
pleasure, gave unto the <hi>Justices of Peace</hi> yet further power to execute
the Statute at <hi>Northampton</hi> against <hi>riotous ridings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 12.</note> and to settle the Wages
of <hi>Labourers</hi> and Servants, to punish unlawful <hi>Huntings</hi> by the meaner
sort of people, and <hi>regrators</hi> of Wool, <hi>false Weights</hi> in the Staple,<note place="margin">13 R. 2. c. 8. cap. 13.</note> unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wearing of <hi>Liveries,</hi> and unlawful <hi>Fishings</hi> contrary to the Statute at
<hi>Westminster</hi> 2.<note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 4.</note> Thus was the power of <hi>Justices of Peace</hi> grown to that
heighth in these and other things,<note place="margin">16 R. 2. c. 4.</note> that it undermined,<note place="margin">17 R. 2. c. 9.</note> not onely the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64112:147"/>
                  <hi>Council-Table</hi> and <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> but the Commissions of <hi>Gaol-delivery</hi>
and of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> so far forth, as their work was much less than
formerly. For Neighbours, in cases of crime, are better trusted with the
Lives and Estates of men, than Strangers; so as in all this, the people
are still the gainers.</p>
               <p>The manner of Judicature by these <hi>Justices of the Peace</hi> still remains:
nothing appears by any Statute in these times,<note place="margin">15 R. 2. c. 2.</note> that one <hi>Justice of the Peace</hi>
might do alone, but record a <hi>forcible Detainer;</hi> although questionless, in
point of present security of the <hi>Peace</hi> and good Behaviour, by the intent of
the Statutes he might do many things; but in Cases of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi>
all must be done in <hi>publick Sessions,</hi> which the <hi>Justices</hi> of the Peace had
power to hold by <hi>Commission</hi> onely, until the Thirty sixth year of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third;<note place="margin">4 E. 3. c. 1.</note> and ever after that, they held their <hi>Sessions</hi> by vertue of the
<hi>Statutes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 R. 2. c. 4.</note> and had power to determine divers things in their <hi>Sessions</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to discretion. These were remedies after the Fact; now see what
preventing Physick these times afforded.</p>
               <p>One thing that much irritated the spirits of men into discontents, was
<hi>false News,</hi> or slanderous reports, raised and spread amongst the great men.
For in these Times the Lords were of such a considerable power, as the
vexation of one Lord, proved the vexation of a multitude of the meaner
sort. And though the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 1. formerly had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against such Tales, yet it touched onely such as concerned <hi>discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and people,</hi> although by implication also it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
to extend further. But <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, willing to live in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
that he might enjoy his pleasure, would have the people know their
duties in plain words,<note place="margin">2 R. 2. c. 6.</note> and agreed to a Law, That all such as published
such <hi>false News,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 11.</note> tending to sow strife between the Great men, should be
imprisoned until the first <hi>mover</hi> was found; and if he were not found,
then the <hi>Relator</hi> should be punished by advice of the <hi>Council:</hi> So much
power was then given to the <hi>Council,</hi> whatever it was.</p>
               <p>Thus the seed was choked, or was so intended to be, though every pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was not thus suppressed. For some angers conquer all fear, and will
hold possession come what will. In the next place therefore, provision is
made against the first Actings in sorting of parties by Tokens and <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
utterly inhibiting the meaner sort of the people from giving of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries</hi>
to maintain quarrels, upon pain of Fine and Imprisonment, and the
Trial to be before the <hi>Justices of Assize;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 R. 2. c. 7.</note> which it seems was in affirmance
of former Laws, as by the Preamble of the Statute doth appear, though
the Laws themselves are not extant. About Fifteen years after, it was by
sad experience found that the Lords maintained quarrels by multitude of
<hi>Liveries;</hi> and therefore another Law was made, inhibiting the Lords to
give <hi>Liveries</hi> to any but their menial Servants:<note place="margin">16 R. 2. c. 4.</note> and it is ordered, that
the <hi>Justices of the Peace</hi> shall make enquiry of such offences, and punish
them according to their discretion.</p>
               <p>A third prevention was provided against gathering together of Parties,
after they are sorted: For the humours may so abound, as nothing will
keep them in; they must either break out into a sore, or a long sickness
of State will certainly follow. To this end therefore, the Statute made at
<hi>Northampton</hi> is again revived,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. c. 3.</note> expresly forbidding all persons to <hi>ride arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
unless in some particular cases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">7 R. 3. c. 13.</note> of executing Justice, or guarding the
person of the King,<note place="margin">20 R. 2. c. 1.</note> or his Justices, and suchlike. And if men will be so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous
as to out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dare Law by publick force, Troopings together, and
riotous Ridings, another course is taken, not by <hi>Commission of the Peace,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64112:147"/>
but rather of <hi>War,</hi> directed unto valiant persons in every County, and
they have power thereby to apprehend such Offenders, and imprison
them until the Gaol-delivery, though no Indictment be found thereof,
until the Gaol-delivery shall be. By this <hi>Commission</hi> therefore power is
given of <hi>Posse Comitatus,</hi> in nature of a <hi>Commission of Array,</hi> with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
power of fighting and destroying; so as though the King gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Power by the <hi>Commission,</hi> yet the Parliament giveth the Power
to the <hi>Commission;</hi> and be it a Commission for <hi>Peace,</hi> or <hi>War,</hi> it is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
from that power.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last prevention, was the taking away means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and supporting such Riotous ways,<note place="margin">13 R. 2. c. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. Castles and Gaols out
of the Custody of private hands, and restoring them to their Counties.</hi> For
<hi>Gaols</hi> and <hi>Castles</hi> are taken promiscuously for places of security, in times
of Peace to keep ill persons from going out, and in times of War
from getting in. Amongst these, some belonged to the King, and
were committed to such as he favoured, who commonly (in such
times of Oppression and Violence) grew too big for Justice, usurping a
<hi>Gaol delivery,</hi> and making such places of strength, many times, even to
the innocent, a Prison to keep them from the Law; but unto guilty
persons, an <hi>Asylum</hi> to defend them against the Law. And these thus
belonging to the King, were under no Law, but of <hi>Prerogative;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
other <hi>Castles</hi> of private persons were under the yoke of the <hi>Statute,</hi>
13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. For remedy of all which, the <hi>Kings Castles</hi> are once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

have the power to dispose of all places of strength, whether in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>War;</hi> and could not dispose them into a more safe and
indifferent hand than the <hi>Sheriff's,</hi> who is as well the <hi>King's Officer,</hi> as
the <hi>Kingdoms Servant;</hi> and much intrusted by the <hi>Law,</hi> in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of its own power. And thus is this Nation now prepared for a
setled <hi>Peace;</hi> a condition that is long in ripening, and soon rotten, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be well fenced and over-awed by a good Conscience. But <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the Second was neither so good, nor so happy; his Heart affected
to be high, but his Head could not bear it; he turns giddy, and runs
far wide. Those that would reduce him, he enforces into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and himself holds on his career over Hedge and Ditch into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
where under pretension of holding possession of that Kingdom, he
lost <hi>England:</hi> and whilst he plays his game in that Country, another
plays <hi>King</hi> by your leave, in this, and steps into the Throne; teaching
the King thereby this Lesson, though too late; <hi>That Non-residency is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

               <head>CHAP. XIII. A View of the Summary Courses of Henry the Fourth, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Fifth, and Henry the Sixth, in their several
Reigns.</head>
               <p>HE that played this prank, was the banished Duke of <hi>Hertford,</hi> Son
of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and by his death now become Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
by Title; and as the Times then were, it proved not hard to get
more. For in uncertain Commonwealths, it is an easie thing for a
man of opinion, that hath less than his due, to get more than he
ought. As Son of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> this Duke had the peoples good wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes:
he (a wise and a brave man, and under oppression) gained the
more upon the people, by how much they love brave men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
such as suffer wrong; especially from such persons from whom
they all found the like measure. All these concurring with the King's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
invited the Duke to adventure himself upon the influence of the
peoples favour, to gain his own right, and what more the people would
allow him; and if no more, yet his Honour is saved; he came for his own,
and attained his end.</p>
               <p>Thus then he comes over without Army, or Foreign Power, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
help, saving the advice and interest of Archbishop <hi>Arundel,</hi> who
was his Companion in suffering, Partner in the Cause, and no less wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the Clergie, than the Duke himself was to the people; and so
gained power to the Duke, though he brought none. Upon their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
the Aspects of all are benign, the Dukedom waits for him;
and in that, as in a Mirrour, he beholds the way fair and easie; yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it pities him to see the Kingdom so torn in pieces and spoiled. The
people knew him able, and hoped him willing to amend all: they offered
him their Service; which he accepts, and therewith the Crown. So hard
a thing it is for to put a stop to a Conquerour in his career.</p>
               <p>By this time was the Duke of <hi>Hertford</hi> thus become Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
and King of <hi>England,</hi> under the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, by
a design that in the proof was more easie than commendable: and
which being effected, cost more skill to make that seem fair which was
so foul, than to accomplish the thing. He therefore first heaps together
Titles, enough to have buried the clamour of Usurpation, if it
would have succeeded. Conquest was a Title freest from Dispute
whilst Power holds; but it looks better from a Foreign Enemy, than
one sworn to the <hi>English Crown;</hi> and therefore after that had served his
turn, he disclaimed it; as that which was, though meet enough to have,
yet unmeet to hold.</p>
               <p>His right by Designation from his Predecessor he glanced upon, but
durst not adventure it too deep into the peoples consideration, whose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
had formerly over-ruled the Case against King <hi>John.</hi> He then
stayed upon a concealed Title from a concealed Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
of whom they who listed might be perswaded, but few believed the
thing, nor did himself; but thence takes his slight up to a <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
or some hidden Fate that called him to the work; but even there
his Wings failed him, and so he falls flat upon the <hi>Peoples Election,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64112:148"/>
De bene esse.</hi> Some of these, or all together, might make Title enough
for a great Man that resolved to hold by hook, what he had got by
crook; and therefore trussing them up all together, he enters his claim to
the Crown, <hi>As coming from the Bloud Royal from King</hi> Henry, <hi>and through
the Right that God his Grace hath sent me; with the help of my Kin and
Friends to recover the same, which was in point to be undone for want of good
Governance, and due Justice.</hi> The extract of all is, that he was chosen by
the People and <hi>Parliament</hi> then sitting. And albeit that by the Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the <hi>Parliament</hi> might seem, in strict constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Law, to be expired, together with the Kings power who called
them together; yet did not that <hi>Parliament</hi> so apprehend the matter, but
proceeded not onely to definitive Sentence of <hi>deposing</hi> him, but declared
themselves by their Commissaries, to be the <hi>Three States,</hi> and <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi>
of the People of <hi>England;</hi> maintaining thereby their subsistency
by the consistence of the Members together, although their Chief was
for the present like a head in a Trance, till they had chosen <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth to succeed in the Throne; by this means preventing the conceit of
discontinuance in the very Bud of the Notion.</p>
               <p>Much like his entry was his continuance, a continual tide of Foreign and
Domestick War and Conspiracy, enough to exercise his great Courage;
although he was more wise than warlike, being loth to take up Arms;
(for well he knew, that a sick Title never sleeps but in a Bed of Peace)
and more loth to lay them down: For besides Victory, whereby he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Enemies in time of War, he knew how to make advantage
of them in time of Peace, to secure his Friends, to keep others in awe, to
enforce such Laws as stood with reason of State, and the present posture
of Affairs; and where Laws failed, to fill up the period with Dictates of
his own Will. And upon this account the Product was a Government
full of Ulcers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Bloudshed, without regard of persons, whether of the
<hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Order, without <hi>Legal Trial,</hi> or <hi>priviledge of Clerk.</hi> So
was Archbishop <hi>Walden</hi> dethroned, Archbishop <hi>Scroop</hi> put to death, and
Dukes were dismounted without Conviction or Imputation, saving of the
Kings displeasure. <hi>Taxes</hi> multiplied, although begotten they were upon
the Parliament, like some monstrous Births shewn to the World, to let it
know what could be done;<note place="margin">Walsing.</note> but concealed by Historians, to let it know
what may not be done. Yea, the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of Parliament invaded in
point of <hi>Election:</hi> A thing that none of his Predecessors ever exemplified
to him, nor none of his Successors ever imitated him in. Nor had he
purposed it, but that he was loth the People should know more of the
Government than needs must.</p>
               <p>To keep off Foreign Troubles, he made Peace with <hi>France</hi> for longer
time than he lived; yet was ever infested with the Sword of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in
behalf of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Queen; and with the Factions between
the Houses of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in which he had interested himself
to preserve the Foreign Neighbourhood in Parties one against another,
that himself might attend his own security at home. He would have
moved the <hi>Scots,</hi> but they were already under <hi>English</hi> Banners; nor could
he reach so far, having so many Enemies even in his own bosom. The
<hi>Welsh</hi> were big with Antiquity, and Mountains of Defence; they begin
to bethink themselves of their Antient Principality, hold the Kings Arms
at hard duty,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 12.</note> till by Laws Enacted in Parliament, they lost their Liberties
of bearing <hi>Office Ministerial,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 H. 4. cap. 26, 32. &amp; cap. 19, 20, 28, 31.</note> or of <hi>Judicature,</hi> of <hi>holding Castle,</hi> of <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
without the Kings License, yea, of <hi>Purchase;</hi> and by degrees were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64112:149"/>
brought down from the height of a <hi>Free Principality,</hi> to be starved in their
power, and inferiour to a <hi>Free People.</hi> And thus the <hi>Welsh</hi> on the one
side, the <hi>discontented Lords</hi> on the other, and <hi>Mortimar's</hi> Title in all, so
busied the King, as though he lopped off the Tops as they sprang up, yet
they sprang forth as they were lopped; nor was it the Kings lot all this
while to find out the root of All, or to strike at that.</p>
               <p>Lastly, when time had made all Troublers weary, yet he still sits upon
Torns; he was jealous of his Subjects, jealous of his Son, yea, jealous of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
it being ever the first and last of his thoughts, how to keep his Crown.
For the most part of his Reign, he was troubled with the walking Ghost
of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; ever and anon he was alive, he was here, he was
there, and so the peoples minds were always kept at random; but when
all these Spirits are conjured down, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Ghost is yet
within <hi>Henry's</hi> own breast. <hi>So ruled</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth, an unhappy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man, that durst undertake more than he would, did more than he ought,
was successful in what he did, yet never attained his end, to be sure of his
Crown, and quiet of mind.</hi> For a Plaister to this Sore, he turned somewhat
towards Religion; but shewed it more in zeal to Church-men, than in
works of Piety: and therefore may be thought to regard them rather as
his best Friends in right of Archbishop <hi>Arundel,</hi> than as in relation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Yet,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. Ang. 618.</note> as if he overlooked that, he desires their Prayers, becomes a
strict observer of superstitious Rites, is fiery zealous against the <hi>Lollards,</hi>
intends a Journey into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and War against the <hi>Infidels;</hi> the
common Physick of guilty Kings in those days. Briefly, he did will to
do any thing, but undo what he had done; and had done more, had his
Journey to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> succeeded. But (whether hastned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
by a Prophecie of the ending of his days, falls not within my Pen
to censure;) entring upon the Work he died, in the beginning of his
purposes, in the midst of his fears; never came to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and yet
yielded up his last breath in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament was then sitting, and was witness of the death of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">Henry <hi>the Fifth.</hi>
                  </note> as it had been of his entrance upon the Throne, as if
purposed to see the course of the Crown in the doubtful current between
the two Houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> and to maintain their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in directing the Scepter according to their warranty upon a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
by Act of Parliament. Yet did not all rest upon this: for the Heir
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was a Man every inch of him, and meant not to
<hi>Moot</hi> upon the <hi>point:</hi> His Father died a King, and he his Heir had the
Crown, and was resolved to hold it. A rough young man he had been
formerly, and bold enough to out-face small doubts in point of <hi>Succession;</hi>
for he could (for need) out-face common Civility it self. This might
have lien in his way; for he that cannot govern himself, can much less
govern a Kingdom. Yet a hidden providence concluded quite contrary,
and rendred him a clear Testimony of a strange change by the anointing
Oyl, like that of <hi>Saul,</hi> that forthwith had the Spirit of another man. So
though not hammered thereto by Affliction, as was <hi>Edward</hi> the First, yet
was he his parallel in Government, and superiour in Success. Being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Throne, all men thought it dangerous to abide the adventure of
the Turn of this Kings Spirit. The <hi>Clergie</hi> had but yesterday tried the
Mastery with the <hi>Laity,</hi> and gained it but by one Vote: there was no
dealing with the <hi>Clergie</hi> whilst Archbishop <hi>Arundel</hi> lived, nor with him
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64112:149"/>
whilst <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth lived, or his Merits were in memory; but now
they both are dead, the <hi>Clergie</hi> and the <hi>Laity</hi> are upon even ground.
This might make the <hi>Clergie</hi> now not over-confident: The Lords looked
on the King as a man like enough to strike him that stands next. The
wise men saw he would be doing; all men were tired with Intestine
Quarrels; and jumped in one, <hi>That he that would be in action, should act
abroad; where he might get Renown, and a Purchase big enough for his
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Kingdom yet incompetent to the King's Appetite. <hi>France</hi>
was the fairer Mark, and better Game; and though too big for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
gripe, yet the Eagle stooped, and sped himself so well, as within six
years he fastned upon the Sword and Scepter, and a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi>
and might have seized the Crown, but chose to suffer a blur to lie upon
his Title derived from <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, rather than to incur the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Arrogancy over a stooping Enemy, or to pluck the fruit from the
Tree before it was fully ripe; which in time would fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto his lap by a
better Law than that of the Sword: Otherwise it might be well concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that <hi>he that hath both Right and Power, and will not seize, disclaims.</hi>
Besides, the King was as well Inheritor to his Father's Fate as Crown: still
he had success, but the end was so far distant, that he died in the way
thereto. The brave <hi>Dauphine</hi> of <hi>France</hi> maintaining War (after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the French King had yielded up the Bucklers to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth)
till <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth died, and the <hi>English</hi> did forgo what they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
gotten in <hi>France</hi> by the Sword of that great Commander. Nor
did the <hi>English</hi> gain any thing in the conclusion of this War, but an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
windy repute of being one of the five Chief Nations of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
(if honour it be to be reputed amongst the Nations) a Conquerour
of <hi>France,</hi> the chief Leader unto the dethroning of three Popes at once,
the Election of Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and of giving a Cure to that deadly Wound
of the Popedom which had spent the bloud of two hundred thousand mens
lives lost in that Quarrel.</p>
               <p>These Foreign Engagements made the King less sollicitous of the point
of <hi>Prerogative</hi> at home; and the rather, because he knew the way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his private Enemies Arms, and his Subjects Hearts; without loss of
Honour in the one, or Reverence in the other. He loved Justice above
the rank of his Predecessors, and in some respects above himself; for he
advanced <hi>Gascoign</hi> for doing Justice, though to the King's own shame. He
liked not to intrude himself into <hi>Elections,</hi> and therefore, though requested
by the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he would not nominate a Successour to
Archbishop <hi>Arundel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> but left the whole work to them. In the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his place he was moderate, and where his Predecessors did matters
without the <hi>Lords consent;</hi> when he made his Unkle the Marquiss of
<hi>Dorset,</hi> Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and had given him a Pension to maintain that
honour,<note place="margin">Walsing.</note> he asked the <hi>Lords consent</hi> thereto. To the <hi>Clergie</hi> he was more
than just, if not indulgent; led thereto by his Father's example, as being
wrapped up in the same Interest as I conceive, rather than out of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their ways, now growing more bold upon Usurpation than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. Or it may be, that having prevailed in that work in <hi>France,</hi>
which to any rational man must needs appear above the power of the
King, and all the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> he looked upon it as more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
and himself as an instrument of Miracles. And was stirred up in
his Zeal to God, according to his understanding in those dark times, to
give the <hi>Clergie</hi> scope, and to pleasure them with their liberty of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64112:150"/>
                  <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> that began now to thunder with Fire and Terrour in such
manner,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 285.</note> that neither greatness nor multitude could withstand the dint;
as was evidenced in that Penance inflicted upon the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> and his
Lady in case of Bloud-shed in <hi>Holy Ground;</hi> and their hot pursuit of the
Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> unto a death of a new nature, for somewhat done which was
sometimes called <hi>Treason,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Heresie.</hi> And thus became
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth baptized in the Flames of the <hi>Lollards,</hi> as his Father had
sadly rendred up his spirit in the same. I say, in this he is to be looked
upon as one misled for want of light, rather than in opposition against the
light: For in his last Will, wherein men are wont to be more serious and
sincere, amongst his private regards, he forgets not to reflect upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to this purpose. <hi>We further bequeath</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the redundant
Mercy of the Most Excellent Saviour, the Faith, Hope, and Charity, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
Prosperity, and Peace of the Kings our Successours, and of our Kingdom of</hi>
England; <hi>that God for his goodness sake would protect, visit, and defend
them from Divisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s, Dissentions, and from all manner of decitfulness of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
And thus the Piety, Justice, and Moderation of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
and crowned the honour of his Courage and Greatness, with that
honourable Title of <hi>Prince of Priests:</hi> And had he been blessed with a
clearer light, he might as well under God have obtained the Title of <hi>Prince
of Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> wanting nothing that might have rendred him a precedent of
Fame.</p>
               <p>But the time is now come,<note place="margin">Henry <hi>the Sixth.</hi>
                  </note> that the Tide of <hi>England's</hi> Glory must turn,
and the sudden Conquest in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, not unlike the
<hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchy, must disgorge it self of what it had hastily devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but never could digest. Three things concurred hereunto; one
dangerous, the other two fatal to the flourishing condition of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The King is a <hi>Minor</hi> in the least degree that ever any Prince sate
on <hi>English</hi> Throne. He entred thereinto, neither knowing what he did,
nor where he was; and some say, he sate therein in his Mothers Lap: for
his Life had been more in the Womb than abroad. A sad presage of what
followed! for many men think that he was in a Lap all his days. Nor are
the chief men to be blamed herein: for it is a certain Truth, That it is
much better that the Election of a King should be grounded upon a rule
that is known, though it be by descent of Inheritance, than upon none at
all. For if a <hi>Child</hi> should succeed, or a <hi>Lunatick,</hi> yet where the Principle
of Government resteth upon the <hi>Representative</hi> of the people, there is the
less cause of Complaint; the Government being still the same, both for
Strength, Wisdom, and Uniformity, though it may be the Nation not so
active and brave: For a Commonwealth can admit of no <hi>Minority,</hi> though
a Monarchy by descent may.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This deficiency in Nature might have been supplied, but that
these times were unhappy in the great power of the Lords; to please
whom, the Government is parcelled out into two shares: One is made
<hi>Protector</hi> of the King's person, the other <hi>Protector</hi> of the Kingdom; too
many by one: For let their persons be never so eminent for Abilities, if
they be not as eminent for Humility and Self-command, their hearts will
soon over-rule their heads into a Faction. <hi>And therefore though the Earl
of</hi> Warwick <hi>was a wise man, and the Duke of</hi> Gloucester <hi>a wise man, yet the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64112:150"/>
Earl of</hi> Warwick <hi>with the Duke of</hi> Gloucester, <hi>were not wise.</hi> On the other
side, the <hi>Protectorship</hi> of the King's person being in the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
and that of the Realm in the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> things succeeded passing
well; for they both had one publick aim, and the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> could
comply with the Spirit of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who otherwise was not
so pliant. But after five years, the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> dying, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the King's person devolving to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who
sided with the proud Cardinal of <hi>Winchester</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and so not onely consumed the rest of the Kings <hi>Non-age</hi> in a restless
disturbance of Affairs, but also despoiled <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth of the <hi>spirit</hi> of a
King for the future, and so the Kingdom of a King. For it was not the
condition of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, to be endowed with a <hi>spirit</hi> of such height,
but might well have been led by Advice, and needed not the Earl of
<hi>Warwick's</hi> rugged Brow to over-look him; who was not content to have
the King onely attendant upon his Advice, but must likewise have him
under his Rod, to be corrected for his Faults; and that by a Commission
under the King's own Hand, and Seal, dated in the Eleventh year of the
King's Reign: and so under colour of <hi>curbing,</hi> he <hi>killed</hi> that <hi>spirit</hi> in the
King, which otherwise doubtless had both <hi>spirit</hi> and pride enough to act
himself above his due height, and could not have been so long a <hi>Child,</hi> and
so little a <hi>Man</hi> as he was.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth by Will, seemed to countenance his
Brothers; and it cannot be denied but the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was of such
noble parts, that they could hardly dilate in any work inferiour to the
Government of a Kingdom. Nevertheless, to yield much to the Will of
a diseased King in such cases, is as ill a preceden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as the making of a King
by <hi>Adoption.</hi> And it had been better for the people to have adhered to
the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> alone, than by joyning him with another, bring
into a precedent such a luxuriant Complement of State, as a <hi>Protectorship
of a Kingdom,</hi> which is of such little use to a Commonwealth, and of so
bitter Fruit to the Party, as must needs bring Repentance when it is too
late. <hi>For he that can manage the Protectorship of a Realm, without anger of
good men, or envy of bad men, is fitting to live onely with Angels, and too good
for the World.</hi> Nor did the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> meet with better measure
how wise soever he was, and truly devoted to the good of the Realm.
For after four and twenty years Government, so wisely and faithfully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by him, that Justice it self could not touch his person; unjustice
did, and he received this reward from his Nephew <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, that
he died in the dark, because the Cause durst not endure the light.</p>
               <p>Now is <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth perswaded that he is of full Age, he had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
his Guardian the Duke of <hi>Gloucester;</hi> but forgetting to sue out his
<hi>Livery,</hi> he betakes himself from the Grace of God, into the warm Sun,
(as the Proverb is) changing the Advice of a faithful experienced wise
Counsellour, for the Government of an Imperious <hi>Woman,</hi> his Queen:
who allowed him no more of a King, than the very Name; and that also
she abused, to out-face the World. And after she had removed the Duke
of <hi>Gloucester</hi> out of the way, undertook the sway of the Kingdom in her
own person, being a Foreigner, neither knowing nor caring for other Law
than the <hi>Will</hi> of a <hi>Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Glory of the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> goes down, and now a Star
of the House of <hi>York</hi> appears in the rising, and the people look to it. The
Queen hereat becomes a Souldier, and begins the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> between the
two Houses, wherein (her <hi>English</hi> party growing wise and weary) she

four years; after which, the clamour of ill Government revives, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
therewith a claim to the Crown by the House of <hi>York</hi> is avouched.
Thereupon the Wars grew hot for about four years more; and then an
ebb of as long Quiet ensues. The Tide at last returns, and in two years
War,<note place="margin">Comin. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> ends the Quarrel, with the death of Fourscore Princes of the Bloud-Royal,
and of this good man, but unhappy King.</p>
               <p>Unhappy King, I say, that to purchase his Kingdoms Freedom from a
Foreign War, sold himself to a <hi>Woman,</hi> and yet lost his Bargain, and left it
to Observation, <hi>That a Conscientious man that marries for by-regards, never
thrives.</hi> For <hi>France</hi> espied their advantage; they had maintained War with
<hi>England</hi> from the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, with various success. The
Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> being Regent for the <hi>English;</hi> for the space of fourteen
years mightily sustained the fainting condition of the <hi>English</hi> Affairs in
those parts; and having crowned his Master <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth in <hi>Paris,</hi> in
the ninth year died; leaving behind him an honourable Witness, even
from his Enemies: <hi>That he was a brave Commander, a true Patriot, and a
faithful Servant to his Lord and Brother</hi> Henry <hi>the Fifth, and to his Son</hi>
Henry <hi>the Sixth.</hi> But now the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> is dead; and though
<hi>France</hi> had concluded a Peace with the <hi>English,</hi> yet they could not forget
the smart of their Rod, but concluded their Peace upon a Marriage to be
had with a Woman of their own bloud and interest. And what they could
not effect by Arms in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r own Field, they did upon <hi>English</hi> ground by a
<hi>Feminine</hi> Spirit, which they sent over into <hi>England</hi> to be their Queen;
and in one Civil War (shedding more <hi>English</hi> bloud by the <hi>English</hi>
Sword, than they could formerly do by all the men of <hi>France</hi>) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon <hi>England</hi> to the full,<note place="margin">Comin. lib. 3. cap. 8.</note> at the <hi>English-mens</hi> own charge. For
what the <hi>English</hi> gain by the Sword, is commonly lost by Discourse.</p>
               <p>A Kingdom is never more befooled, than in the Marriage of their
King: if the Lady be great, she is good enough, though as <hi>Jezabel,</hi> she
will neither reverence her Husband, obey her Lord and King, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
his people. And thus was this Kingdom scourged by a Marriage,
for the sin of the wise men, that (building upon a false Foundation) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
the King in the breach of Contract with the Earl of <hi>Arminiack</hi>'s
Daughter. And thus the King also, for that hearkning to such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
murthered the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> that had been to him a Father;
yielded up his Power to his Queen, (a masterless and proud woman,
that made him like a broken Idol without use) suffered a Recovery of
his Crown and Scepter in the Parliament from his own Issue, to the
Line of <hi>York;</hi> then renewing the War (at his Queens beck) lost what
he had left of his Kingdom, Country, and Liberty; and (like the King
that forgot the kindness of <hi>Jehojada</hi>) lost his Life by the hand of his
Servant.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Parliament during the Reigns of these Kings.</head>
               <p>THe Interest of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is never more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
than when Kings want <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Age.</hi> The first of these was
the Case of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth immediately; but of them all, in relation to
the pretended Law of the Crown: but <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth had the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of both; whereof in its due place.</p>
               <p>The pretended Law of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> is to hold by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
with power to dispose of the same, in such manner, by such means,
and unto such persons as the King shall please. To this, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
divers Kings had put in their claims, by devising their Crown in
their last Will: but the success must be attributed to some power under
God, that must be the Executor when all is done; and which must in
cases of Debate concerning Succession, determine the matter by a Law
best known to the Judge himself.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike hereunto, is the Case of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who like
a Bud putting up in the place of a fading Leaf, dismounts his Predecessor:
First, from the peoples regard, and after from his Throne; which being
empty, sometimes he pretended the resignation of his Predecessor to him,
other whiles an obscure Title by descent; his Conscience telling him all
the while, that it was the Sword that wrought the work. But when he
comes to plead his Title to Foreign Princes by <hi>protestation,</hi> laying aside the
mention of them all, he justifies upon the <hi>unanimous consent</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the people, in his own onely person. And so before all the
World, confessed the Authority and Power of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
in disposing of the Crown in special Cases, as a sufficient Bar unto any
pretended Right that might arise from the House of <hi>Mortimar.</hi> And yet
because he never walks safely that hath an Enemy pursuing him still
within reach, he bethinks himself not sure enough, unless his next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
follow the dance upon the same foot: To this end an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
leads the Tune, whereby the Crown is granted or confirmed to
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth for life, and entailed upon his Sons, <hi>Thomas, John,</hi> and
<hi>Humphrey,</hi> by a Petition presented 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">7 H. 4. cap. 2.</note> to save his own stake, brought his Posterity
into the like capacity with himself,<note place="margin">8 H. 4. n. 38.</note> that they must be Kings, or not subsist
in the World, if the House of <hi>York</hi> prevails. And so he becomes secured
against the House of <hi>York</hi> treading on his heels, unless the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> shall eat their own word. However, for the present the House of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> hath the Crown entailed, and the Inheritance is left <hi>in the Clouds,</hi>
to be revealed in due time.<note place="margin">39 H. 6. n. 18.</note> For though this was the first precedent of
this kind, yet was it not the last wherein the Parliament exercised a Power
by Grant or Confirmation, to direct the Law and Course of the Crown as
they pleased.</p>
               <p>The due consideration hereof, will make the things that follow less
strange. For the Parliament, according to occasion, as the <hi>Supream

               </p>
               <p>Now if such as these things were thus done, not by one Parliament, which
possibly might be overswayed by Factions, but by the course of a <hi>Series</hi> of
Parliaments, that mightily laboured against Faction, and unworthy ends
and aims; that man who shall determine the same to be unjust or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
should himself first be determined to be very just, and exceeding
wise. Nor was the <hi>Parliament</hi> partial in all this; but being in a way of
Reformation, it set upon the work of reforming it self.</p>
               <p>Some that are very zealous in the point of Arbitrary and Absolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Kings in this Nation, and in all other, amongst other grounds
rest upon this one, That an <hi>English</hi> King hath power to call Parliaments,
and dissolve them; to make and unmake Members as he shall please. I
do easily grant, that Kings have many Occasions and Opportunities to
beguile their People; yet can they do nothing as Kings, but what of right
they ought to do. <hi>They may call Parliaments, but neither as often or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as they please, if the Statue-Laws of this Realm might take place.</hi> Nor
if they could, is that power necessarily and absolutely arising from Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;
seeing it is well known that such power is betrusted by the
Superiour States in other Nations, to the <hi>Inferiour,</hi> who dayly attend on
publick Affairs; and therefore can discern when the general Conventions
are most necessary. As touching the dissolving of Parliaments against
the wills of the Houses, it is true that sad precedents have been of later
times in that kind; and so for want of due attendance, Parliaments have
been enforced to adjourn, to prevent a worse inconvenience: but these
are infirmities better buried in silence, than produced as Arguments
of power; seeing it is evident that Kings themselves were no greater
gainers thereby, than an angry man is by his passions. It is true al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o,
that Kings may make <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi> that may send their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
to the Parliament; and thus the King may make as many as he
will, (as the Pope did with the Bishops in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) yet
cannot he unmake them when he pleases, nor take the Members from the
Parliament, without attainder and forfeiture, according to the known
Law. Neither can all these Instances prove, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
have the sole and supreme power over the Parliament: Nor did the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in these times allow of any such Authority, and therefore procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the reforming of themselves by themselves, in many particulars, as
the Statutes do hold forth.</p>
               <p>And first in the point of <hi>Elections,</hi> (for an errour in that, is like an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the first Concoction,<note place="margin">7 H. 4. c. 15.</note> that spoils the whole Nutriment) they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
that the Election of Knights shall be at the next County-Court
after the Writ delivered to the Sheriff.<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64112:152"/>
That in full Court, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
shall be made of the day and place of the Parliament. That the
Suters duly summoned, and others there present, shall then proceed to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
notwithstanding any Prayer or Commandment to the contrary. That
the names of the persons elected (whether present or absent they be) shall be
returned by Indenture between the Sheriff and the Elizors; and that a Clause
to that end shall be added to the Writ of Summons.</p>
               <p>This was enough to make the <hi>Sheriff</hi> understand,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. c. 1.</note> but not to obey,<note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 7.</note> till
a penalty of <hi>one hundred pound</hi> is by other Laws imposed upon him,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 15.</note> and a
<hi>years imprisonment without Baibor Mainprise,</hi> besides <hi>damages for false return</hi>
in such cases; and the party so unduly returned, fined, and deprived of
all the Wages for his service. Thus the manner of <hi>Election</hi> is reduced;
but the persons are more considerable: for hitherto any man of <hi>English</hi>
bloud promiscuously had right to give or receive a Vote, although his
Residency were over the wide World.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">1 Hen. 5. c. 1.</note> reduced these also
(whether they were such as did chuse,<note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 7.</note> or were chosen) unto their proper
Counties, or else rendred them uncapable to vote or serve for any County.
And the like Order was made for the Burroughs, <hi>That no person must
serve for any City or Burrough,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23 Hen. 6. c. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>nor give vote in Electing such as shall serve
for that Town, unless they be both free, and resiants within that City or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough:</hi>
A Law no less wholsom than seasonable. For the times of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth had taught men to know by experience, That a King that hath
Souldiers scattered over the Kingdom, can easily sway the County-courts,
and make Parliaments for their own Tooth. Yet this was not enough;
for all <hi>Elizors,</hi> though of the meanest sort, yet are still able to do as much
hurt with their Vote, as those of the best sort, both for wisdom and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
mind, can do good by theirs. This made <hi>Elections</hi> much subject to
parties and confusions, and rendred the Parliament much less conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>A remedy hereunto is provided, in the minority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>viz.
That no man should give his Vote in Elections in the County,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>unless he hath
forty shillings yearly in free Lands or Tenements; and this is to be testified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath of the party.</hi> And more plainly it is orderded, (within two years
after) that each <hi>Elizor</hi> shall have Frank-Tenement of that value within the
same County. And thus the <hi>Free-men</hi> yielded up their liberty of <hi>Election</hi>
to the <hi>Free-holders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10 Hen. 6. c. 2.</note> possibly not knowing what they did; nevertheless,
the Parliament well knew what they did: this change was no less good
than great.</p>
               <p>For <hi>first,</hi> These times were no times for any great measure of Civility:
The Preface of the Statute shews, <hi>That the meanest held himself as good a
man, as the greatest in the Country;</hi> and this tended to Parties, Tumults,
and Bloudshed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where the Multitude prevail, the meaner sort are upon the
upper hand; and these (generally ignorant) cannot judge of persons nor
times, but being for the most part led by Faction or Affection, rather than
by right Understanding, make their <hi>Elections;</hi> and thereby the general
Council of this Nation, less generous and noble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no less equity in the change, than policy: For what
can be more reasonable, than that those men onely should have their
<hi>Votes</hi> in <hi>Election</hi> of the Common-Council of the Kindom, whose Estates
are chargeable with the publick <hi>Taxes</hi> and Assessments, and with the <hi>Wages</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64112:153"/>
of those persons that are chosen for the publick Service. But above all
the rest, this advancing of the <hi>Free-holders</hi> in this manner of <hi>Election,</hi> was
beneficial to the <hi>Free-men</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> although perchance they considered
not thereof; and this will more clearly appear, in the consideration of
these three particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It abated the power of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>great Men,</hi> who held the
inferiour sort at their Devotion, and much of what they had by their
Vote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It rendred the Body of the <hi>People</hi> more brave; for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
of the <hi>Free-holder</hi> above the <hi>Free-man,</hi> raiseth the spirit of the
meaner sort to publick regards, and (under a kind of Ambition) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
unto the degree of a <hi>Free-holder,</hi> that they may be somewhat in the
Commonwealth. And thus leaving the meanest rank sifted to the very
bran, they become less considerable, and more subject to the Coercive
power, whilst in the mean time the <hi>Free-holder,</hi> now advanced unto the
degree of a <hi>Yeoman,</hi> becomes no less careful to maintain correspondency
with the Laws, than he was industrious in the attaining of his degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But this means now the Law makes a separation of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Cloistered</hi> people, from this service, wherein they might
serve particular ends much, but <hi>Rome</hi> much more. For nothing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
but that these <hi>dead persons</hi> in Law, were nevertheless <hi>Free-men</hi> in
Fact, and lost not the liberty of their Birth-right by entring into Religion,
to become thereby either <hi>Bond,</hi> or no <hi>Free Members</hi> of the people of
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 15.</note> As a binding Plaister above the rest; <hi>First,</hi> a Negative Law is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
made, that the persons elected in the County, must not be of the degree
of a <hi>Yeoman,</hi> but of the most noted <hi>Knights, Esquires,</hi> or <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the
County; which tacitly implies, that it was too common to advance those
of the meaner sort. Whether by reason of the former wasting times,
<hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Esquires</hi> were grown scant in number, or (by reason of their
rudeness) in account; or it may be the <hi>Yeomanry</hi> grew now to feel their
strength, and meant not to be further Underlings to the great Men, than
they are to their Feathers, to wear them no longer than they will make
them brave. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the person thus agreed upon, his Entertainment
must be accordingly;<note place="margin">23 H. 5. c. 11.</note> and therefore the manner of taxing in full Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and levying the rate of Wages for their maintenance, is reformed and
settled. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> their persons are put under the protection of the
Law in an especial manner; for as their work is full of reflection, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they had met with many sad influences for their labour.<note place="margin">11 H. 6. c. 11.</note> And
therefore a penal Law is made, against force to be made upon the persons
of those Workmen of State, either in their going to that Service, or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereupon; making such Delinquents liable to Fine and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and double damages. And thus however the times were full of
Confusions, yet a foundation was laid of a more uniform Government in
future times, than <hi>England</hi> hitherto had seen.</p>

power of a King;<note place="margin">Rot. Pat. 24 E. 1. m. 4.</note> as it was with <hi>John Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereunto by <hi>Edward</hi> the First, who had not onely power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but to grant; and this power extended both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And <hi>Peter Gaveston</hi> (though a Foreigner) had the like power given
him by <hi>Edward</hi> the Second over <hi>England,</hi> to the reproach of the <hi>English</hi>
Nobility;<note place="margin">Rot. Pat. 1. E. 2. m. 2.</note> which also they revenged afterward. Sometimes these <hi>Vice-gerents</hi>
are called <hi>Lieutenants;</hi> which seemeth to confer onely the King's
power in the <hi>Militia,</hi> as a <hi>Lieutenant general</hi> in an Army. And thus <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the Second made <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> to oppose the entry of the Duke of <hi>Hertford</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
called <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth) into <hi>England,</hi> during the King's absence
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And in the mean while the other part of the <hi>Royalty</hi> which
concerned the Revenues of the Crown, was betrusted to the Earl of <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Bush,</hi> Sir <hi>James Baggot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi> unto whom
(men say) <hi>The King put his Kingdom to farm.</hi> But more ordinarily the
Kings power was delegated unto one, under both the Titles of <hi>Lord Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
of the Kingdom, and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> within the same; such was the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and of <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rot. Pat. 4. E. 2. Ps. 1 m. 18.</note>
and of <hi>Audomar de Valentia</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrooke;</hi> all of them at several
times so constituted by <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, as by the Patent-Rolls ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.
So likewise did <hi>Edward</hi> the Third make his Brother <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Eltham</hi> twice, and the Black Prince thrice, and <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi>
and his Brother <hi>Thomas,</hi> each of them once, in the several passages of

which, see the Patent-Rolls of those years. And <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth
gave likewise the same Title and Authority to the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> upon
the King's Voyage into <hi>France;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7 H. 5. m. 23.</note> and afterward that Duke being sent over
to second the King in the <hi>French</hi> Wars, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> obtained
the same power and place. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth added a further Title
of <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Defender</hi> of the Kingdom and Church of <hi>England;</hi> this
was first given to the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Hen. 6. p. 2. m. 3.</note> and afterwards he being made
<hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> it was conferred upon the Duke of <hi>Gloucester:</hi> And
towards the latter time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,<note place="margin">32 H. 6. m. 7.</note> it was granted by him to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64112:154"/>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York.</hi> This Title carried along with it a power different
from that of a King, onely in honour; and the person so adorned, may be
said to <hi>sway the Scepter,</hi> but not to <hi>wear the Crown.</hi> And therefore in the
<hi>minority</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, whenas the Government was ordered by the
Parliament, and to that end a <hi>Protector</hi> was made, and he well guarded
with a Privy Council, and they provided with Instructions; one of them
was, <hi>That in all matters not to be transacted ordinarily but by the King's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
consent, the Privy Council should advise with the Protector:</hi> But this is
not so needful, in regard that it concerneth the power of executing of
Laws, which by right of the liberty of the Subject, is the known duty of
the <hi>Scepter,</hi> in whose hands soever it is holden. And therefore I shall
pass to the <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> wherein it is evident that the <hi>Protector</hi>'s power
was no whit inferiour to the King's power. For <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Protector, Ex
Officio,</hi> by advice of the Council, did summon Parliaments by Writs, even
as the Kings themselves, under their own <hi>Test;</hi> and if they did not bear
the <hi>Royal Assent,</hi> yet did they direct the same, and received Petitions in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to them directed as to Kings, and every way supplied the room of
a King, in order to the perfecting, publishing, and enforcing of Law to
Execution. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Parliaments holden by <hi>Protectors,</hi> and Laws
therein made, are no whit inferiour to those by the King, whether for
Honour or Power. And therefore if a Parliament be holden by the <hi>Lord
Warden,</hi> and sitting the Parliament the King in person shall arrive, and be
there present, neither is the Parliament interrupted thereby, nor the
power thereof changed at all; though the power and place of the <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denship</hi>
of the Kingdom doth utterly vanish by the personal access of the
King: because in all places where the King is subservient to the Kingdom or
the Commonwealth, the <hi>Lord Warden</hi> in his absence is conservient unto
him, being in his stead, and not under him; for the very place supposeth
him as not, because not present.</p>
               <p>And this was by a Law declaratively published at such time as <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth was <hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>France;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 H. 5. c. 1.</note> and therefore by common presumption,
was likely to have much occasion of residence in that Kingdom; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it
holdeth in equal force with all other Laws of the highest size: which is
the rather to be noted, because it is (though under a <hi>Protector</hi>) obligatory
to the King, and makes his personal presence no more considerable than
the presence of his shadow: For the King spent three whole years in the
<hi>French</hi> Wars, and during that time never saw <hi>England;</hi> where neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
in that interim, three Parliaments had been holden, one by the Duke
of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and two by the Duke of <hi>Gloucester;</hi> in the last of which this
Law was made. And in truth, if we look upon this Title of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<hi>Guardianship</hi> in its bare Lineaments, without lights and shadows, it
will appear little better than a Crown of Feathers, worn onely for bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and in nothing adding to the real ability of the governing part of
this Nation: Neither were the persons of these <hi>Magnificoes</hi> so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
nor did the Nation expect any such matter from them. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the First was a wise King, and yet in his absence chose <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second to hold that place, he being then not above fourteen years of age.
Afterwards <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's Queen, and the Lords of her party, were
wise enough in their way, and yet they chose <hi>Edward</hi> the Third to be
their <hi>Custos Regni,</hi> then not fourteen years old; his Father in the mean
time being neither absent from the Kingdom, nor deposed, but onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
from acting in the administration of the Government.<note place="margin">Rot. Pat. 5 E. 3. p. 1. m. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third follows the same example; he first makes his Brother <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Eltham
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64112:154"/>
Custos Regni;</hi> and this he did at two several times; once, when he was but
Eleven years old; afterwards, when he was about Fourteen. Then he
made his Son, the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> upon several occasions, three times <hi>Lord-Warden</hi>
of the Kingdom; once, he being about Nine years old; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when he was Eleven years old; and once, when about Fourteen years
old. Lastly, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third appointed his Son <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
unto this place of <hi>Custos Regni,</hi> when as he was scarce Eight years
old; all which will appear upon the comparing their Ages with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Rolls of 25 <hi>E. 1. &amp; 3, 5, 12, 14, 26. 19 E.</hi> 3. If therefore the
work of a <hi>Custos Regni</hi> be such as may be as well done by the Infants of
Kings, as by the wisest Counsellor, or most valiant man, it is, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
manifest, that the place is of little other use to this Commonwealth,
than to serve as an attire to a comely person, to make it seem more fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is in fashion; nor doth it advance the value of a King one grain
above what his Personal endowments do deserve.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the Title and Power; the next consideration will be, of
the original Fountain from whence it is derived; wherein the Precedents
are clear and plain, that ordinarily they are the next and immediate Off-spring
of Kings, if they be present <hi>within the four Seas,</hi> to be by them
enabled by Letters-Patents or Commission. But whether present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the Parliament when it sate did ever peruse their Authority; and
if it saw need, changed, enlarged, or abridged both it and them. Thus
was the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> made <hi>Lord Warden</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fifth, (he being then in <hi>France</hi>) in the room of the Duke of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
The like also in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's time, when as the King was young: for
then the Parliament made the Duke of <hi>Bedford Lord Warden,</hi> and added
unto that Title the Title of <hi>Protector.</hi> Afterward, at the Duke's going
over into <hi>France,</hi> they committed that service to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi>
(if I forget not the nature of the Roll) during the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi>'s
absence, and with a <hi>Salvo</hi> of his right. Not unlike hereunto was the
course that was taken by the Parliament in these sullen later times of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; whereof more hereafter in the next Paragraph.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The limitation of this high power and Title, is different accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the occasion; for the <hi>Guardianship</hi> of the Kingdom by common
intendment, is to endure no longer than the King is absent from the Helm,
either by voluntary deserting the work, or employment in Foreign parts,
though united they be under the Government of the same King, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this Nation, such as are these parts of <hi>France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then under the English Fee. This is apparent from the nature of
the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth formerly mentioned: for if there was
need to provide by that Statute that the Kings arrival and personal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
should not dissolve the Parliament assembled by the authority of
the <hi>Custos Regni,</hi> then doth it imply, that the personal presence of the
King, by and upon his arrival, had otherwise determined the Parliament,
and that Authority whereby it sate. But the Precedents are more clear,
all of them generally running in these or the like words, <hi>In absentia Regis,</hi>
or <hi>Quamdiu Rex fuerit in partibus transmarinis.</hi> It is also to be granted,
that the King's will is many times subjoyned thereunto, as if it were in
him to displace them, and place others in his absence: yet do I find no
Precedent of any such nature, without the concurrence of the Lords or
Parliament; and yet that the Parliament hath ordered such things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his consent. For when <hi>Richard</hi> the First, passing to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi>
had left the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> to execute that place during his absence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64112:155"/>
parts; the Lords finding the Bishop unfaithful in his Charge, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him both from that place and Kingdom, and made the King's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>John, Lord Warden</hi> in his stead.</p>
               <p>But in the Case of the <hi>Protectorship,</hi> which supposeth disability in the
person of the King, the same by common intendment is to continue du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the King's disability; and therefore in the Case of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,
it was determined,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. n. 2.</note> that the <hi>Protectorship</hi> doth <hi>Ipso facto</hi> cease at the King's
Coronation; because thereby the King is supposed able to govern: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in later times it hath not so been holden. For Kings have been
capable of that Ceremony, assoon as of the Title; and yet commonly
are supposed to be under the rule of necessity of <hi>Protectorship,</hi> till they be
Fourteen years of age, or (as the Case may be) longer. For although
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was once thought ripe when he was eight years old, yet
in the issue he proved scarce ripe for the Crown at his two and twentieth
year. Nevertheless, the <hi>default of Age</hi> is not the onely incapacity of
Kings; they have infirmities as other men, yea more dangerous than any
other man; which though an unpleasant Tune it be to harp upon, yet it
is a Theam that Nations sometimes are enforced to ruminate upon, when
God will give them Kings in his Wrath, and give those also over to their
own lusts in his Anger. In such cases therefore this Nation sometimes
have fled to the refuge of a Protector; and seldom it is that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
for how long. When <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was above Thirty years
old, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was made <hi>Protector,</hi> and <hi>Defender of the Realm,</hi>
and of the <hi>Church.</hi> It was done (if the Record saith true) by the King
himself, <hi>Authoritate Parliamenti.</hi> It was further provided by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that though this was to continue <hi>Quamdiu Regi placuerit,</hi> yet the
Duke should hold that place till the Kings Son <hi>Edward</hi> should come to
years of discretion, and shall declare that he will take that place upon
himself.</p>
               <p>The ground hereof is said to be,<note place="margin">Rot. Par. 32. H. 6. m. 7.</note> that the King was <hi>Gravi infirmitate
detentus;</hi> which could not be intended of any bodily distemper: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth any such thing appear by any Author or Record. Nor if such
had been, yet had it been an irrational thing in the Parliament to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the same upon the Princes discretion, and acceptance of the Charge
upon himself. It seemeth therefore, that it was <hi>Gravis infirmitas Animi,</hi>
and that this way of the Parliament tended to a tacite sliding him out of
the Government of the Kingdom, by a moderate expression of a general
incapacity in his person.</p>
               <p>The Conclusion of all that hath been said concerning this Title, is
double: One, that both the <hi>Custos Regni,</hi> and <hi>Protector,</hi> are not subsistent,
but consistent with that of a King, because it supposes a King under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That they tend to teach the people a necessity of having
<hi>one Chief,</hi> although it may, in truth, seem to be but a trick of State; like
some pretty carved <hi>Cherubims</hi> in the Roof of a Building, that do seem
to bear it up, whenas, in truth, it is the Pillars that support both it and
them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Concerning the Privy-Council.</head>
               <p>NAtions do meet with their Exigences, as well as persons; and in such
condition, resolutions taken up by sudden conceit, are many times
more effectual than more mature deliberations; which require more time
in composing, are more slow in conclusion, let slip opportunities, and fall
short of expectation in the end. Such are the ways of debate in the
<hi>Grand Representative</hi> of the Kingdom. Add hereunto, that in putting
the Laws in execution, greater discretion is required than can enter into
the head of any one man, and greater speed than can stand with debate
amongst many. And therefore it is beyond all doubt, that the <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Council</hi> are no less necessary in their degree, than the <hi>Assembly of
the Estates</hi> of this Nation in their Grand Convention.</p>
               <p>Yet with this Caveat, that one Genius may move in both; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the motions of Government must needs be inconstant, inconsistent,
and like that of an Hypocrite, one way abroad, another way at home; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfortable to it self, nor confiding to others. And therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
these Privateer-Councils, by any proportion of Reason, be better
constituted, than by the <hi>Representative</hi> it self, that it may be a Creature
made in its own Image, one and the same with the Image of the
maker.</p>
               <p>This was the wisdom and the practice of these times,<note place="margin">5 H. 4. n. 57. 8, n. 31. 11 n. 44.</note> more ordinarily
than in the former: for the Parliament was no less jealous of the power
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">2 H. 6. n. 15, 16</note> than of the infirmities of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; nor
more assured in the <hi>aims</hi> of any of them all,<note place="margin">31 H. 6. n. 31.</note> than themselves were in
in their own <hi>Title</hi> to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Neither was this sufficient: for the Parliament looked upon themselves
as a body that sometimes must retire to rest; and upon the <hi>Privy Council,</hi>
as Watch-men subject to change; and therefore they not onely give them
instructions,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. n. 8, 1, 2, 14, 26.</note> but engage them unto observance. Their instructions were
sometimes occasional, but some more general; of which I shall instance
onely in two, which were to be of everlasting regard. First, <hi>That they
should hold no pleas before them,</hi> that is to say, at the Council-Table, or
at the Privy Council; nor before any of them, unless as Judges in the
Chancery,<note place="margin">8 H. 4. n. 7, 6.</note> Exchequer, or Benches at <hi>Westminster;</hi> so as whatsoever mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarriages
were had by the <hi>Privy Council</hi> in Cases of Judicature in the
Star-chamber formerly, are now reduced. The second rule was this,
That no dispatches should be made at the Council-Table of any matters
there agitated,<note place="margin">5 H. 4. n. 37.</note> but by general consent. Unity gives life to Action,<note place="margin">8 H. 4. n. 73.</note> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
therewith both Authority and Power; and, when all is done, must
derive its original from without, and in all good ends from above. And
therefore, as a Seal to all the rest, it was wisely done by the Parliament
to draw the mindes of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> together, and to present them
joyntly before God, by an <hi>Oath,</hi> obliging themselves to a solemn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
observance of their instructions,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. n. 14, 39.</note> and to perievere therein. For the
unchangeable God can onely stamp a lasting Image upon the mind, and
bind the same, that is so subject to change, to an unchangeable Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the people may be made as happy for continuance, as for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64112:156"/>
The <hi>Privy Council</hi> thus setled, dressed, and girt, becomes of high
esteem, both for Trust and honourable Employment in great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The <hi>Mint</hi> is the very Liver of the Nation, and was wont to be the
chief care of the Parliament it self in all the dimensions thereof. Now the
<hi>Mint</hi> is two ways considered, <hi>viz.</hi> either in the value of the Metal and
Money, or in the Coinage.</p>
               <p>The first of these, and things most immediately concurring therewith,
the Parliament still retains to its own immediate Survey; such as are the
inhibiting of exportation of Gold and Silver, and of melting of Coyn
into Plate or Bullion; the regulating of the current of Foreign Coyn,
the reducing of money, both Foreign and Domestick, imbased by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfacture,
Clipping, Washing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the regulating of Allay of Gold and
Silver; the regulating Exchange, and such like: concerning all which,
the Reader may please to peruse the Statutes 2 <hi>H. 4. cap. 5, 6, 11, 13.
4 H. 4. cap. 16. 3 H. 5. Stat, 1. &amp; 4. cap. 6. &amp; 9. cap.</hi> 11. and 2 <hi>H. 6.
cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The second Consideration touching the <hi>Mint,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 H. 6. c. 1.</note> concerned the election and
government of the Officers,<note place="margin">9 H. 5. c. 6.</note> touching the <hi>Mint</hi> and Exchange, or the
places where they shall be holden; which, with some other matters of
inferiour nature, were left to the Order of the Privy Council, either with
the King, or alone, in case of the King's absence or disability.</p>
               <p>A second power given to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> was in point of <hi>Trade</hi> and
Merchandize: Formerly they had somewhat to do therein, but still the
Parliament set out their bounds. In <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had liberty of <hi>Trade</hi> in some Commodities by way of Exportation,
but the <hi>Privy Council</hi> might restrain them upon inconvenience to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Now the same is confirmed;<note place="margin">17 R. 2. c. 7.</note> and though it concerned Corn onely,
yet it was a Precedent that led the way to a much larger power in the
<hi>Trade</hi> of the Staple Commodities of this Island,<note place="margin">4 H. 6. c. 5.</note> to enlarge or straiten it
as they though meet. And so they became in a fair way to have a
principal power over the Revenues and Riches of this Nation. But this
lasted not long;<note place="margin">15 H. 6. c. 2.</note> for within ten years these Licenses of Transportation
cost the Merchant so much,<note place="margin">20 H. 6. c. 6.</note> as he could make little gains of all his
care and pains; and therefore a rule is set to a general allowance of all
Transportation of Corn, till the price of Wheat came to a Noble, and
Barley at Three shillings,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 5.</note> and no longer. This being first made Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
was afterwards made Perpetual; and so gave a restraint unto the
power of the King and Council. But where no positive restraint was
made by any Statute, the King and Council seemed to have the sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
left unto them, to open and shut the passes of <hi>Trade</hi> as they pleased.
For whereas the Commodity of <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheese</hi> was made <hi>Staple,</hi> the
King and Council had power to stop the sale thereof;<note place="margin">18 H 6. c. 3.</note> notwithstanding
that the Law gave full liberty to the Subjects to bring all their <hi>Staple</hi>-Commodities
to the <hi>Staple.</hi> Nevertheless, this power in the King is
not primitive, but derived from the Parliament; for they had power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Kings Licenses and Restraints in such cases, as by the several Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
do appear.</p>
               <p>A third power given to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> was a power of <hi>Summons</hi> and
Process against Delinquents in cases of Riots, Extortions, Oppressions,
and grievous Offences.<note place="margin">31 H. 6. c. 2.</note> The Summons to be by Privy-Seal, the Process,
Proclamations; and for Non-appearance, Forfeiture, if the Delinquent
be of the degree of a Lord; if of inferiour rank, then a Fine or Out-lawry.
At the first view, the Statute hath an ill favoured Aspect, as if
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64112:156"/>
it raised up a new Court of Judicature; but the time is to be considered
with the occasion; for it was made for the securing of the peace in a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
time. And besides, the Law carrieth along with it two restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which puts the right of Cognizance in the <hi>Privy Council</hi> to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>First, It saveth the Jurisdiction of other Courts, and provideth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>That no matter determinable by the Law of this Realm, shall be by this
Act determined in other form than after the course of the same Law in the
Kings Court, having determination of the same:</hi> which implieth, that some
kinds of Riots and Extortions are of so high a nature, that though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
in the Kings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Court, yet are they to be determined before the
Lords.</p>
               <p>In the next place this Law provideth, <hi>That such offences as are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
by the Law of the Realm,</hi> that is by Jury, <hi>shall still be so tried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">13 H. 4. c. 7.</note> If Conviction be upon Confession, or by Certificate, in case
where (by reason of parties and partakings) Inquisition by Jury cannot
be had, there the Lords shall immediately determine the same.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If the Certificate be traversed, then the same shall be tried in
the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>But there is another Restriction that undoeth all in effect in point of
right; because what this Law setleth therein, it setleth but for seven
years, and leaveth the <hi>Privy Council</hi> to the limits of the Common Law
for the future. In the mean time, the <hi>Privy Council</hi> may be thought ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
and very high, both by this Law, and the greatness of the Lords.
Kings Unkles, and Kings Brothers, are Subjects indeed, but of so high a
degree, that if a little goodness of nature, or publick spirit shine in them,
they soon become the Objects of admiration from the Vulgar, and gain
more from them by their vicinity, than the King can do at a distance.
For the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by the fair demeanour of popular great men,
are soon won out of their very Cloaths; and are never more in danger to
part with their Liberties, than when the Heaven is fair above their heads,
and the Nobility serve the King, and flatter them. Nevertheless, as I said,
the season must also be considered of this power thus by this Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted:
for what the Lords gained not by their popularity, the Queen
did with her power; who now, mindful of her contemned beauty, and
opposition from the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> against her Marriage, removes him
out of the way, gets the reins of Government into her hand, and like a
Woman drives on in full career.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and other Lords, not liking this gallop, endeavour
to stop her pace; but are all over-born, the Duke taken prisoner; and
doubtless had pledged the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> but that the Heir apparent
of the House of <hi>York</hi> steps in to rescue. And new troubles arise in <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coign;</hi>
to put an end to which, the Queens party gains, and takes the Duke
of <hi>York's</hi> word for his good behaviour; gets this Law to pass, expecting
hereby, if not a full settlement at home, yet at least a respit to prevent
dangers from abroad during the present exigency. And thus upon the
whole matter the Lords and <hi>Privy Council</hi> are mounted up by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to their own mischief.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Clergie, and Church-Government, during these times.</head>
               <p>IT was no new thing in the World, for Princes of a wounded Title to
go to the Church-men for a Plaister; and they are ready enough to
sing a <hi>Requiem,</hi> so as they may be the gainers. The Princes therefore of
the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had offended against common sence, if they had
not done the like themselves, being not onely guilty in their <hi>Title,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by a secret Providence drawn into one interest together with the
Church-men to support each other. For <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Arundel</hi> meeting together under one condition of Banishment,
become Consorts in sufferings, and Consorts in honour: for Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in trouble is nourished in prosperity, by remembrance of mutual
kindnesses in a necessitous estate; which commonly are the more hearty,
and more sensible, by how much other contentments are more scant. But
the Archbishop had yet a further advantage upon the Heart of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth; though he was no man of power, yet he was of great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
exceedingly beloved of the <hi>English</hi> Clergie, and the more for his
Banishment-sake. Now whatsoever he is, or hath, is the Kings, and the
King is his; the sweet influence of the Archbishop and the Clergie enters
into his very Soul; they are his dearly beloved <hi>for the great natural love</hi>
(as he says to the World) <hi>they bear to him:</hi> what he could he got, what
he got he gave to the Church. Thus the Family of <hi>Lancaster</hi> becoming a
mighty support unto the Clergie, Roman as it was, they also became as
stout maintainers of the crackt Title of that younger House. So was
fulfilled the old Prophecie of the Oyl given to <hi>Henry</hi> the First Duke of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> wherewith <hi>Henry the Fourth was anointed, That Kings anointed
with that Oyl, should be the Champions of the Church.</hi> Now for the more
particular clearing of this, we are to consider the Church absolutely, or
in relation to the Political Government of the people. Concerning the
latter, many things did befal that were of a different piece to the rest, in
regard that the Lords for the most part were for the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and they for
themselves; but the <hi>Commons</hi> began to be so well savoured with <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi>'s
way, that they begin to bid defiance at the <hi>Clergies</hi> self-ends and aims:
and because they could not reach their Heads, they drive home blows at
their Legs.</p>
               <p>A Parliament is called; and because the King had heard somewhat,
feared that the people were more learned than was meet for his purpose,
and that the Parliament should be too wise; he therefore will have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
wherein the people should have no more Religion than to believe;
nor Learning, than to understand his Sence; nor Wisdom, than to take
heed of a Negative Vote. But it befel otherwise: for though it was
called the <hi>Lack-learning</hi> Parliament, yet had it skill enough to discern the
<hi>Clergies</hi> inside, and Resolution enough to enter a second claim against
the <hi>Clergies</hi> Temporalties; and taught the King a Lesson, <hi>That the least
understanding Parliaments are not the best for his purpose.</hi> For though the
wisest Parliaments have the strongest sight, and can see further than the
King would have them, yet they have also so much wisdom as to look
to their own skins, and commonly are not so venturous as to tell all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64112:157"/>
the world what they know, or to act too much of that which they do
understand. But this Parliament, whether wise or unwise, spake loud
of the <hi>Clergies</hi> superfluous Riches; and the Kings wants are parallel'd
therewith; and that the Church-men may well spare enough to
maintain Fifteen Earls, Fifteen hundred Knights, Six thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Esquires, and one hundred Hospitals more than were in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>This was a strong temptation to a needy and couragious Prince;
but the Archbishop was at his Elbow. The King tells the <hi>Commons</hi> that
the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Cells were in his Predecessor's time seized under
this colour, yet the Crown was not the richer thereby; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
rather to add to, than diminish any thing from, the maintenance
of the <hi>Clergie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, as the King said, he did, though he made bold with the Keys of
St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for he could distinguish between his own <hi>Clergie</hi> and the
<hi>Roman.</hi> The people are herewith put to silence, yet harbour sad conceits
of the <hi>Clergie</hi> against a future time; which like a hidden fire, are not
onely preserved, but encreased by continual occasions; and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
from the zeal of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> now growing fiery hot against
the <hi>Lollards.</hi> For that not onely the people, but the Nobles, yea, some of
the Royal Bloud, were not altogether estranged from this new old way;
whether it was sucked from their Grandfather Duke <hi>John,</hi> or from a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
strain, of which that House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had much experience, I
determine not. These were the Dukes of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Gloucester. Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
was first at the helm of affairs at home, whilst the King acted the
Souldiers part in <hi>France,</hi> as ill conceited of by the Clergie, as they slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him. At a Convocation once assembled against the <hi>Lollards,</hi> the
Duke sent unto their Assembly his Dwarf, as a great <hi>Lollard,</hi> though he
was a little man; and he returned as he went, even as Catholick as any
of them all; <hi>Non tam despectus à Clero, quam ipse Clerum despiciens atque
eludens.</hi> This,<note place="margin">Antiq. 278.</note> and some other sleights, the <hi>Clergie</hi> liked not; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
find a way to send him into <hi>France,</hi> to be a reserve to his Brother:
And in his room steps forth <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> that was no
less cool for the <hi>Roman</hi> way than he. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth was not more
hearty in <hi>Romes</hi> behalf: for although he was loth to interrupt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
abroad with contests at home; yet he liked not of advancements
from <hi>Rome;</hi> insomuch, as perceiving the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> to aspire to a
Cardinals Hat, he said, <hi>That he would as well lay aside his own Crown, as allow
the Bishop to take the Hat.</hi> Nor was he much trusted by the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who
were willing he should rather engage in the <hi>Wars</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> than
mind the Proposals of the <hi>Commons</hi> concerning the Clergies Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties;
which also was renewed in the Parliament in his days. Above
all, as the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> House loved to look to its own; so especially in
relation to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were the more jealous, by how much it preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon them for its favour done to their House. And therefore <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth, the most obliged of all the rest, looked to the <hi>Provisors</hi>
more strictly than his Predecessors had; and not onely confirmed all
the Statutes concerning the same already made,<note place="margin">9 H. 4. c. 8.</note> but had also provided
against <hi>Provisors</hi> of any annual Office,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. c. 3, 4.</note> or Profit, or of <hi>Bulls</hi> of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
from payment of Tythes,<note place="margin">7 H. 4. c. 7, 8.</note> or from Obedience Regular or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and made them all punishable within the Statute.<note place="margin">5 H. 5. c. 4.</note> And further,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64112:158"/>
made all Licenses and Pardons contrary thereto (granted by the King)
void against the Incumbent; and gave damages to the Incumbent in such
vexations: for the former Laws had saved the right to the true patron both
against Pope and King.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>English</hi> Kings were Servants to the Church of <hi>England</hi>
at the charges of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst the Popedome being now under a wasting
and devouring Schism, was unable to help it self; and so continued until
the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, at which time the Clergie of <hi>England</hi> got
it self under the power and shadow of a <hi>Protector,</hi> a kind of Creature
made up by a Pope and a King. This was the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> so
great a man, both for Birth, parts of Nature, Riches, Spirit, and Place, as
none before him ever had the like: For he was both Cardinal, Legate, and
Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and had gotten to his aid the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi>
to be Lord Treasurer of <hi>England.</hi> Now comes the matter concerning
<hi>Provisors</hi> once more to be revived.</p>
               <p>First, More craftily by colloguing with the Nobility, who now had
the sway in the Kings <hi>Minority;</hi> but they would none. An answer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the King, that <hi>he was too young to make alterations in matters of so
high concernment;</hi> yet he promised moderation. The <hi>Clergie</hi> are put to
silence herewith, and so continue till the King was six years elder; and then,
with Money in one hand, and a Petition in the other, they renew their
suit, but in a more subtile way: For they would not pretend <hi>Rome,</hi> but
the <hi>English</hi> Churches Liberties; they would not move against the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Praemuniri,</hi> but to have them explained; it was not much they
complained of,<note place="margin">16 Rich. 2. c. 5. Antiq. Brit.</note> for it was but that one word <hi>Otherwhere,</hi> which, say they, the
Judges of the Common Law expound too largely, not onely against the
Jurisdiction of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> but against the Jurisdiction of the <hi>English</hi>
Prelacy, which they never intended in the passing of those Laws. Their
Clonclusion therefore is a Prayer, <hi>That the King will please to allow the
Jurisdiction of their Ecclesiastical Courts, and that Prohibitions in such Cases
may be stopped.</hi> But the King, either perceiving that the Authority of
<hi>English</hi> Prelacy was wholly dependant on the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acted
either under the shadow <hi>Legatine,</hi> or at the best sought an Independent
power of their own: Or else the King doubting that the calling of one
word of that Statute into question that had continued so long, might
endanger the whole Law into uncertainty, declined the matter, saving
in the moderation of Prohibitions. Thus the <hi>English Clergie</hi> are put
to a retreat from their Reserve at <hi>Rome:</hi> all which they now well saw,
yet it was hard to wean them. The Cardinal of <hi>Winchester</hi> was a
great man, and loth to lay down his power; but his own Tribe grew
weary of him and his power. For the greater some Church-men are,
unless they be better than men, the inferiour and better Church-men
are worse than men. At length therefore the Cardinal is <hi>Vnlegated,</hi>
and that power conferred upon the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> a man
formerly well approved, but by this very influence from <hi>Rome</hi> rendred
suspected, Which he perceiving, protested against the exercise of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
<hi>Legatine</hi> without the Kings allowance, and so mannerly crept
into the Chair.</p>
               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Kings and Clergie having thus attained the right discerning
of each other, begin to take up a new way of policy; which was to hold
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64112:158"/>
nothing of the Popedom, but the Form of Worship and Discipline; but
as touching <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> they held it a high point of wisdom, either to
fetch it nigh at home, or to be silent in the matter; having now found a
main difference between the <hi>Popes Will,</hi> and the <hi>Church-Law;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as formerly the Convocation and Parliament joyned in excluding
of Foreigners from Church-livings,<note place="margin">Holl.</note> under the notion of <hi>Intelligencers to
Enemies abroad:</hi> So neither now will they allow any <hi>provisions</hi> for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
men;</hi> and upon this ground, the Dean and Chapter of <hi>York</hi> refused
to admit the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to the See of <hi>York,</hi> although assigned he
was thereto by Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and he the darling of Nations, being by
joynt consent advanced to the Triple Crown, that had been formerly
tripled amongst three Popes, and troubled all <hi>Europe.</hi> And whereas
during the <hi>Tripapalty</hi> much money had been levyed here in <hi>England,</hi> to
serve for the recovery of the Popedom to one of <hi>English</hi> interest; now
by joynt consent the same is seized upon and stopped, as fewel from the fire,
and spent by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth in the recovery of a Kingdom in <hi>France,</hi>
that should have been employed in recovery of a Popedom at <hi>Rome.</hi>
These things concurred to give a wound to the Popedom, that was never
cured to this day.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the <hi>English</hi> Clergie was no loser by all this, but gained
in the whole sum. For as it made them more depending on the Crown,
so it made the Crown more fast to them, from which they had received
more real immunities and power, than the Pope ever did, or was able to
give them; and might expect to receive many more. What personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
these three Kings shewed them, hath been already touched. <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth added one favour, which made all the rest more considerable.
Hitherto they had used to meet in Convocation as upon the interest of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and little notice was taken of them; now the Nation owns them,
and in some respects their work; and it is granted, <hi>That the Clerks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
called by the Kings Writ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 H. 6. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and their Menial Servants, shall have such
priviledge in coming, carrying, and going, as the Members of the Parliament
have.</hi> So as though they be not Members, yet they are as Members, if
they assemble by the <hi>Kings Writ,</hi> and not onely by the power of the
<hi>Legate</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Inst. <hi>c.</hi> 74.</note> The antiquity of this Court is great, yet not
so great as hath been supposed; nor is it that Court of the Ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Church Gemot,</hi> mentioned in the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, as not
onely the works thereof, therein set down, do sufficiently declare; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it is evident, that in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's days, the Grand Councils of
this Kingdom were joyntly mixed both of <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi> Nor could
the Clergie shut the Laity from their Councils, till about the times of
<hi>Richard</hi> the First, or King <hi>John.</hi> From which time forward, the <hi>Laity</hi> were
so far from protecting of them, that (till these times now in hand) all
their care was to keep them from violating the Liberty of the people.
That they were many times notwithstanding called together by the
<hi>Kings Writ</hi> before these times,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Will. Pry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </note> hath also been cleared by another Pen.
That their work at such times was to advise concerning such matters as
should be propounded to them by the King in Parliament, their Summons
do shew; the particulars whereof, for the most part, concerned supplies
of Money from the Church-men. And yet sometimes matters of great
moment were debated therein. As in a <hi>Convocation</hi> summoned by <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth in his ninth year, the preheminence of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> above
the Council of <hi>Bazil</hi> was debated; and as much as they could, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64112:159"/>
the same. The credit of their decisions in former time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
was not much amongst the people; because the men were looked
upon with an evil eye. Now that the Parliament seemeth to own them in
their way, and to protect them; their determinations are somewhat.
The Church-men espy their opportunity, and whilst the benevolent influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the State is in its first heat, they improve it in this manner. The times
were now come about wherein light began to spring forth, conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bestir
itself, and men to study the Scriptures. This was imputed to the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and carelesness of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> who suffered the minds of young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
to luxuriate into Errours of Divinity, for want of putting them on to
other Learning, and gave no encouragement to studies of humane Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by preferring those that were deserving.<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> The <hi>Convocation</hi> taking this
into consideration, do decree, That no person should exercise any jurisdiction
in any <hi>Office,</hi> as <hi>Vicar-general, Commissary,</hi> or <hi>Official,</hi> or otherwise, unless
he shall have first in the University have taken <hi>Degrees</hi> in the <hi>Civil</hi> or
<hi>Canon Law.</hi> A shrewd trick this was to stop the growth of the study of
Divinity, and <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s way: and to imbellish mens minds with a kind
of Learning that may gain them preferment, or at least an opinion of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
beyond the common strain, and dangerous to be meddled with.
Like some Gallants that wear Swords as Badges of Honour, and to bid
men beware, because they possibly may strike, though in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they may be very Cowards. And no less mischievously intended
was this against the rugged <hi>Common-Law,</hi> a Rule so nigh allied to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-way,
as it favoureth Liberty; and so far estranged from the way of
the Civil and Canon-Law, as there is no hope of accommodation till
Christ and Anti-Christ have fought the field.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to the State, now as it is
absolutely considered, in regard of the several degrees of persons therein.
Although these three Kings were much endeared to the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, yet
the difference between the <hi>Laity</hi> and them growing high, the King's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
care is now, to keep an even hand between them both: for he that
will back two Horses at once, must keep them even, or put his joynts to
the adventure. First, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth granteth, <hi>That no more shall be
paid to</hi> Rome <hi>for the first-fruits of Archbishops and Bishops, than hath been
anciently used.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 Hen. 4. c. 1.</note> The occasion hereof was, <hi>to prevent the horrible mischief,
and damnable custom of</hi> Rome; for such are the very words of that Statute,
unto which the Clergy gave their Vote, if not the first Vote: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
certainly did neither believe, nor honour that infallible Chair as their
own Mother; nor did they bear her Yoke, further, than their own benefit
and reason of State did require. For though the immediate benefit of
this Law did descend upon the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> yet it also much concerned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
both of the honour and benefit of the Nation, that the Clergy
should not be at the Pope's pleasure to tax and assess as he thought
good.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Hen. 5. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth added unto the <hi>Prelacy</hi> some kind of increase
both of Honour and Power, <hi>viz.</hi> to visit <hi>Hospitals</hi> that were not of the
King's own foundation, and to reform abuses there: for the Patrons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had no power to punish, or will or care to reform them. And thus
upon the point, although they lost a Right, yet they gained ease.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Hen. 5. c. 8.</note> The same King confirmed by a Statute unto Ordinaries, the
cognizance of Accounts of <hi>Executors</hi> for their <hi>Testators</hi> Estates; which
formerly was granted by the Canon-Law, but they wanted power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute,
and a Right to have and receive. In all these the <hi>Clergie</hi> or Prelacy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64112:159"/>
were the immediate gainers. In as many other things the people were
made gainers, and yet the <hi>Clergie</hi> were no losers, otherwise than (like
the Kite) of that prey which was none of their own.</p>
               <p>First, They refused formerly to grant Copies of <hi>Libels,</hi> either thereby
to hinder the course of Prohibitions, or to make the Copies the moredear,
and Money more cheap with them. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, finding this a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the people, passeth a Law, That all Ordinaries shall grant the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of Libels</hi> at such time as by Law they are grantable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the <hi>probate of Wills</hi> had anciently belonged to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
by the Canon-Law,<note place="margin">2 H. 5. Stat. 2. cap. 1.</note> and formerly also confirmed to them by the
Parliament; so it also <hi>regulated and settled the Fees for such Service.</hi>
But the Clergy having been ever under the noutriture of their Mother
<hi>Rome,</hi> that loved to exceed, they likewise accounted it their liberty to take
what they could get. But the nigher they come to engage with Kings in
their Government according to Law, the more reformed they grow. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third had settled their Fees, but they would not hold
to the rule. Now the Law is doubled by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, with a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of treble damages against Delinquents. Furthermore, the very Priests
could not contain their <hi>Pater-Nosters, Requiems, Masses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 H. 5. Stat. 2. c. 8.</note> and such Wares
they had engrossed, and set thereof what price they pleased. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
was risen to that height, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third undertook to set a
rate upon those Commodities: but that also would not hold long; <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fifth he sets a certain stipend somewhat more than <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third had done,<note place="margin">2 H. 5. Stat. 2. c. 2.</note> and yet less than the Priests had formerly.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Some Laws were made, wherein the Commonwealth gained,
and the Church were losers. First, Whereas the Church-men formerly
held all holy things proper and peculiar to their own Cognizance, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>such as concerned the Worship of God; the Parliament now began to
be bold with that, and never asked leave.</hi> It had now for a long time,
even since the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, been the unhappy condition of this Church
of <hi>England</hi> amongst others, to decay continually in Piety and right De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
but through the light that now revived, and God's goodness,
it in these times came to pass, that the people did entertain some sense of
their duty towards God more than formerly, and <hi>begin to quarrel the
abuses done to the Lords day in the manner of the keeping thereof. London</hi>
hath the honour for beginning this Reformation by an Act of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Council.<note place="margin">27 H. 6. c. 5.</note> The Parliament within seven years after that engage
the whole Kingdom in that service (though therewith also are adjoyned
other <hi>holy Feasts</hi> then holden) and all <hi>Fairs</hi> and <hi>Markets</hi> are enjoyned
to cease on that day, under pain of forfeiture of Goods exposed to sale;
excepting Victual, and excepting the four Sundays in Harvest. And
thus though places had their Consecration allowed by the Parliament,
and immunity from trading in Fairs and Markets by the space of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty years before this time; yet that time which God by his
own Law had reserved to his own self, never came under regard to be
allowed till now; <hi>and yet not by the motion of the Clergie, nor by their
furtherance.</hi> For by their thrusting in the <hi>Holy days,</hi> they made them
equal with the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and in Harvest-time superiour, by preserving
them in force, whenas the <hi>Lords days</hi> were set aside. So God had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of these men, but the Pope more. Secondly, As the Church-men
lost in the former, so the Prelacy in this that follows.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prelates</hi> had long since obtained the Trial of <hi>Bastardy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
could strain themselves so far, as to put the case of Inheritance into
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64112:160"/>
danger, where the point otherwise was clear enough. And this grew
to that height, that it endangered the disinheriting of the Heirs of the

                     </gap> H. 6. c. 11.</note> It is therefore now provided, that before the Ordinary in
such Cases proceeded to Trial, Proclamations shall be made in Chancery,
to summon all pretenders of Interests or Titles to come before the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to make their Allegations; and all Trials of Bastardy otherwise
made, shall be void; so as whatever the Canon did, the Parliament
would not trust to the Ordinaries Summons, nor allow of their power
in any other manner than the Parliament thought meet. One thing
more remaineth, wherein the true Church of Christ seemed to lose, and
yet gained; and the <hi>Clergie,</hi> joyning with the King, seemed to gain, and
yet lost: this was the point of Worship which had long stumbled the
minds of the people; and was now grown to that strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an Act of Parliament can keep it under. This opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Worship was at the first so young, that it was not yet baptized
with any proper name, but called, <hi>Opinion contrary to the Church-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
or Catholick Faith.</hi> And against this the Clergie now stormed
more than ever formerly; because it was grown to such a height, as if
it meaned to over-top theirs. To this end they procured an Act to
pass,</p>
               <p>That all Preachers,<note place="margin">

               <p>And that Preachers without, License of the Diocesan, should be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Concerning which Law, I shall first shew what change in the Laws of
this Kingdom was endeavoured, and what was really effected.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> E. 3. c. 3.</note> It is an undeniable ground. <hi>That no Freeman can be put to answer
before any Judge, but upon presentment, or other matter of Record forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by due Process of Law.</hi> And yet it had been ruled, that strong
presumption, and complaint of credit after it is entred, is sufficient
Record to ground proceedings in this Case, to attach the party to
Answer.<note place="margin">10 H. 7. fol. 17.</note> But by this Law a Trial is introduced, that neither resleth
upon any peremptory Accusation, or proof of Witness, but meerly
upon Inquisition, upon the Oath and Conscience of the party suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which in the latter days hath been called the <hi>Trial upon the Oath
Ex Officio.</hi> For such was the Trial allowed by the Canon in these times;
as appears in the Constitutions of <hi>Otho,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Otho de Jur. Jur. Calumn.</note> and the Decrees of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Boniface;</hi> by whom it was endeavoured to be obtruded upon
the <hi>Laity,</hi> about the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, or <hi>Edward</hi> the First: but
even the <hi>Clergie</hi> then withstood it, as <hi>Lindwood</hi> confesseth. And <hi>Otho</hi>
in his very Constitution doth hold this forth by that clause of his,<note place="margin">Lind. de Jure Juran. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante
obtenta consuetudine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seconly, This Law doth endeavour to introduce a new Judge, with a
power to Fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Imprison according to discretion; and a Prison allowed
to him as his own peculiar, and yet the Writ <hi>De cautione admittenda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> still
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64112:160"/>
held its power, to regulate that discretion as formerly it had done; which
by the way may render the power of this Law suspicious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Clergie</hi> are not content to have the Estates and Liberties
of the bodies of the people at their discretion; but they must also have
their Lives. <hi>Although no Freeman's life could by the Fundamental Laws
of this Kingdom come to question, but by the Judgement of his Peers;</hi> nor
could the Clergie by their own Canons <hi>interesse sanguini,</hi> viz. <hi>They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
put any man to death:</hi> but by this Law they may send any man to
death by a Sentence as sure as death, <hi>Tradatur potestati seculari:</hi> And such
a death, not as the Civil Magistrate is wont to execute, by a speedy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Soul from the Body, by loss of Blood, stop of Breath, or such
like; but the <hi>Clergie</hi> must have Bloud, Flesh, Bones, and Life and all,
even the edge of non entity it self, or they are not satisfied: and thus the
Writ <hi>De comburendo Hoeretico</hi> entred into the World. True it is, that
some sparks of this fire are found in former times; and <hi>Bracton</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon such a Law, in case of a Clerk convict for Apostacy; <hi>Primo
degradetur, &amp; post per manum Laicalem Comburatur;</hi> which was indeed
the Canon, and that by his own Confession; for it is grounded upon one,
<hi>Secundum quod accidit,</hi> in the Synod at <hi>Oxford</hi> under Archbishop <hi>Becket.</hi>
But that Case concerneth a Clerk, who by his profession hath put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the Law of the Canon; and it was onely in case of <hi>Apostacy,</hi>
himself being turned <hi>Jew;</hi> and this also done upon a sudden pang of
zeal and power of an Archbishop that would know no <hi>Peer.</hi> Nor do
we find any second to this Precedent by the space of Two hundred
years next ensuing:<note place="margin">Lind. lib. 5. de Apostat.</note> neither doth the Decree of Archbishop <hi>Peckham,</hi>
who was not long after <hi>Becket,</hi> treating about <hi>Apostacy</hi> in <hi>Lay-men,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any other punishment, than that they are to be reclaimed <hi>Per cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suras
Ecclesiasticas.</hi> Nor yet that of Archbishop <hi>Arundel,</hi> amongst
the Constitutions at <hi>Oxford,</hi> not long before this Statute; who treating
about the crime of <hi>Heresie,</hi> lays the penalty upon forfeiture of Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with a <hi>Praesertim,</hi> as if it were the grand punishment.<note place="margin">Lind. lib. 5. de Heret. fol. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And <hi>Linwood</hi>
in his Gloss upon that place, setting down the Censures against <hi>Heresie,
Hodie sunt</hi> (saith he) <hi>damnandi ad mortem;</hi> as if it were otherwise, but
as yesterday.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the next endeavour is to bring the cognizance of all, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court,</hi> without further <hi>Appeal;</hi> for so the words
concerning Conviction of <hi>Heresie</hi> are: <hi>Whereupon evidence shall be given
to the Diocesan of the same place, or his Ordinary in that behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These changes, I say, were endeavoured to be brought upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Kingdom; and yet the Law, for all this, suffered no
change; nor did the <hi>House of Commons</hi> (however the name is thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>English</hi> Ordinary Print) ever yield unto the passing of the same;
but in the Parliament next ensuing, complained thereof, and <hi>protested they
would not be bound by such Laws whereto the House of Commons had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their consent.</hi> And this dashed the Law quite out of countenance;
(although it holds the place still amongst the number) for within four
years after, the Clergie bring in another Bill of the same nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
though varying in some particulars;<note place="margin">8 H. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> but the same was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>All the strength therefore of this Law resteth upon the King and House
of Lords, engaged by the Clergie, (whom they trusted for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64112:161"/>
for Book-learning was with them of small account) and no less
by the King; who knew no better way to give the Clergie content, that
gave him so much, as to set the Crown upon his Head; nor to discharge
his Royal Word,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>3.</note> passed by the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmorland,</hi>
in his behalf unto the Convocation, <hi>viz. That they were sent to declare the
Kings good will to the Clergie and Church-Liberties; and that he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to defend all the Liberties of the Church by his Kingly power, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Hereticks and the Churches Enemies in such manner as the Clergie should
think meet; and therefore desired their daily prayers for his own and the
Kingdoms safety.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walsingham, Ypo. Neustr. 157.</note> And yet for all this, the people were not of this mind;
no small part of the Kingdom being overspread with these opinions.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth comes <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and he also makes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
essay; the former opinions, then known onely by the general names
of <hi>Heresie,</hi> are now baptized by the new name of <hi>Lollardry,</hi> and grown
so overspreading, that all the troubles of these times are still imputed to
them. It was indeed the Devils old and common trick, thus to inrage
earthly powers against these men; although he be hereby but an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the hand of the chief Builder, that in laying a sure Foundation,
doth as well ram down as raise up; for the malice of these men made
the people of God to multiply. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth also published a Law to
this same purpose.</p>
               <p>That all persons in place of Government,<note place="margin">2 H. 5. c. 7.</note> shall swear to use their diligence
to destroy all Heresies and Errors, called <hi>Lollardries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all <hi>Lollards</hi> convict by the Clergie, (left to the secular power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of Holy Church) shall forfeit their Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to their Lords: And the King to have the Year and Day, and Waste,
and all his Goods and Chattels.</p>
               <p>If the Lord be the Ordinary, the King shall have all.</p>
               <p>No forfeiture to be, till the Delinquent be dead.</p>
               <p>They shall be found by Indictment before the Justices of the Peace.</p>
               <p>This Indictment being found, shall be sent to the Ordinary with the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>The Indictment shall not be for Evidence, but onely for Information.</p>
               <p>These are the principal things contained in this Law, which by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the composure, seemeth to be of an uncertain colour, neither made
by the <hi>Clergie,</hi> nor <hi>Laity,</hi> but spoiled between them both. The intent
thereof seemeth to be principally to draw on the House of Commons to
pass the Law, under hope of gain by the forfeitures; for the penalty is
like that of Felony, though the crime be not expresly declared to be Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But the intent fell short in event.</p>
               <p>For <hi>first,</hi> The nature of the Crime is not defined, nor declared by
any Law; and therefore can no man by Indictment be found to be
such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> No penalty of death hath been by any former, or by this Law,
determined upon such as are guilty; for it is not enacted by any Law, that
such persons shall be delivered to the Secular power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Statute determining the forfeiture to be not till death;
and neither that, nor any other Law of this Kingdom determining death;
then is no forfeiture determined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though this Law taketh it for granted, that <hi>Heresie</hi> and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
belong to Ecclesiastical Cognizance, yet the same allows of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceedings than Ecclesiastical censures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64112:161"/>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> By this Law there can be no proceeding, but in case of <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(for otherwise without <hi>Record</hi> no forfeiture can be) therefore where
no <hi>Indictment</hi> is, there is no forfeiture. In all which regards, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the <hi>Clergie</hi> could by this Law neither get fat nor bloud.<note place="margin">Fox. Marturol. 589.</note> And
therefore at their Convocation, in the next year following, they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
course, and ordered that three in every Parish should make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
upon Oath of such persons as are defamed for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and
the truth so far as they can learn. Which puts me in mind of a Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I have seen by some of St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> in these times: <hi>Item,
We saine, that</hi> John Stevens <hi>is a man we cannot tell what to make of him;
and that he hath Books we know not what they are.</hi> This new course shews
plainly, that the former held not force as they intended it: So God bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the practices of the <hi>Clergie</hi> at this time also; rendring this Law <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi>

               <p>IT often befals in State-affairs, that extraordinary exigencies require ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
remedies, which having once gotten footing, are not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid aside, especially if they be expedient for Prerogative. The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Council</hi> in the Star-chamber pretends default of the Common-Law,
both in speed and severity, in Cases whereby the State is endangered:
The Chancery pretends default by the Common-Law in point of equity
and moderation. The people taken with these pretences make that Rod
more heavy, which themselves had already complained of. What the
Chancery was in times past hath been already shewed; still it is in the
growing and gaining hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 H. 4. c. 8.</note> In the <hi>Judicatory</hi> power it prevailed in relation to the <hi>Exchequer;</hi>
exercising a kind of power to survey the proceedings thereof, in cases of
Commissioners distrained to account for Commissions executed, or not
executed. For it was no easie matter to execute Commissions from the
Exchequer in those times of parties; nor were men willing with such
unwelcome occasions between Friends and Neighbours; and, it may be,
they grew weary of embroiling themselves one against another; and of
being Instruments of the violent countermotions of Princes and great
men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It gained also upon the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> which by former Laws
had Jurisdiction in all cases incident upon the great Sea. But now either
through neglect of the <hi>Admiral,</hi> or the evil of the Times, occasioning
Piracies to grow epidemical, the ill government upon the Sea became dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the State, trenching upon the Truce made between this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations.</p>
               <p>For a remedy whereof,<note place="margin">2 H. 5. c. 6.</note> first <hi>Conservators of the Truce</hi> were setled in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the publick Truce, both by Indictment at the Kings suit; and
according to the course of the Admiralty by complaint, saving matters
of death to the cognizance of the <hi>Admiral.</hi> But this was soon found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;
for Justice done in the dark is many times more respective, and

less respected;<note place="margin">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

former <hi>Conservators,</hi> who being borderers upon the Sea, for their own
peace, spared as few as they could; which had so discouraged the Seamen,
that the Kingdom had been almost utterly bereaved of its strength at
Sea. Nevertheless, all this while, these Laws were but penal, and not
remedial for the parties wronged: and therefore another Law is made
to give the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and Judges power to make restitution and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">31 H. 6. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Chancery</hi> gained upon the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by the Canon the Church-men were to be judged by their Superiours,
according to Ecclesiastical and Ordinary Jurisdiction; and the iniquity
of the times was again returned to that height, that Parents could not
enjoy their own Children, but the little ones were allured, stoln away,
and detained in Cloisters; nor did the Church-men afford remedy in
such cases:<note place="margin">4 H. 4. c. 17.</note> A Law was made, that upon complaint hereof made to the
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Provincial should be by him sent for, and punished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his discretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>Chancery</hi> encroached upon the <hi>Common Law:</hi> For whereas
the stirs between the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> began to rise, men
made their dwellings in places of security and strength; Women like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
and other persons flying thither for refuge; especially such of them
as had most to lose; these were, contrary to the Law of common hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
urged to engage their Estates unto the desires of such to whom they
had fled for refuge; and sometimes compelled to marry, before they could
gain their liberty:<note place="margin">31 H. 6. c. 9.</note> It was now provided that all such complaints should
be heard and determined by the <hi>Chancellor.</hi>
               </p>

was enlarged,<note place="margin">13 H. 4. c. 7.</note> in making of Process to compel appearance in cases of

in nature of Insurrections, Riots, and Plunder, committed by Servants
upon their Masters goods, before their Masters death, and suchlike offences
now grown common, and in need of sudden remedy.</p>
               <p>Thus as the work and power of the <hi>Chancery</hi> grew, so did the place
and person of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> grow more considerable; raised now from
being the <hi>Kings Secretary</hi> (for no better was he in former times) to be
the <hi>Kingdoms Judge;</hi> and of such trust, that although the King might
make <hi>election</hi> of his own <hi>Secretary,</hi> yet the <hi>Parliament would first know
and allow him that must be trusted with the power over the Estates of so
many of the people; And therefore did in these times both place and displace
him as they saw expedient.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Courts of Crown-Pleas, and Common Law.</head>
               <p>AS the <hi>Chancery</hi> on the one side did swell and increase, so was the
<hi>Kings-bench</hi> in an ebb: the <hi>Council-Table</hi> in the Star-Chamber on
the one side, and the <hi>Itinerant</hi>-Courts in the Country intercepted, and
drew away much to their own shares; making themselves fat, the <hi>Kings-bench</hi>
lean, and the <hi>Rural Courts</hi> for Crown-Pleas almost to starve. The
<hi>Crown-Pleas</hi> formerly had been determinable in the <hi>Kings-bench, Gaol-delivery,
Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> and many of them by Justices of the Peace,
Coroners, and Sheriff. The <hi>Gaol-delivery</hi> was afterwards united to the
Judges of Assize; and if one of them were a Clergy-man, then to the
other, and chief men of the County. This was useful for the Publick, but
not beneficial for some men; and therefore they laboured for Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
especially directed to parties that they thought would partake:
but these were found soon to be dangerous,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> soon taken away, and the
<hi>Gaol delivery</hi> restored to the Judges of Assize, as formerly. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> were sued forth upon extraordinary Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
and Offences, wherein the State was much concerned for speedy
Execution. In former times, both these and <hi>Gaol-deliveries</hi> were but
rarely had, and then granted unto some that perchance knew more of
the Case, than before-hand was meet to be known. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
amended this Errour, and ordered that no Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi>
should issue forth,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> but unto Commissioners named by the Court,
and not by the party complaining. But the <hi>Judges of Assize</hi> are now on
the growing hand, both for Honour, Use, and Power; the rather, because
their persons are of high repute in the Benches at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which are
the Master-pieces of Judicature, and their <hi>Iters</hi> are constant and ordinary.
Nevertheless, the <hi>Judges of Assize,</hi> though they have the <hi>Gaol-delivery</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to them, yet have they not that absolute power of the <hi>Kings-bench;</hi>
but are still under the rule of their Commission, which is not alterable
but Parliament; and which by it was altered by way of adding new
powers as new crimes arose, that required the eye of the State to provide.
And so the <hi>Judges of Assize</hi> by degrees grew to be the ordinary Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators
of Justice throughout the Kingdom, yet holding still forth to
them a limited power,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. c. 1.</note> to hear and determine in some Cases; but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
onely to enquire, and certifie, as in the case of <hi>false Returns</hi> by the
Sheriff of <hi>persons elected</hi> for the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And also in cases concerning
the <hi>Statutes of Labourers,</hi> and <hi>unlawful Games</hi> and <hi>Pastimes;</hi> in which case
the Certificate is to be made to the Chancellor.<note place="margin">2 H. 4. c. 21.</note> And also in cases concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Liveries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 H. 6. c. 3.</note> contrary to the Statutes wherein the Certificate is to be
made to the <hi>Kings-bench;</hi> which power in this last case, continued in that
manner by the space of thirty years;<note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 4.</note> and then by another Statute they had
the power to determine such cases before themselves.<note place="margin">4 Hen. 5. c. 7.</note> In like manner they
had power to hear and determine cases of <hi>falshood,</hi> in counterfeiting and
corrupting of Money, by washing, clipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also defaults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Sheriffs, Bayliffs, and their Officers, against the Statutes of
<hi>Forcible Entries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 9.</note> and of wearing of <hi>Liveries,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>These were signs of much confidence and trust in them; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,

               <p>
                  <hi>HEnry</hi> the Fourth, after a small rest in his Throne, though he always
sate loose, sought after the civil Peace, as the corner-stone of his
subsistence, and that by a way of Justice; which found more acceptance
with the Vulgar, than the common Education of the greater number in
these times could promise: for the worst of men cannot endure to suffer
Injustice, though themselves will do it. Now because where Kings are
reputed to be the Fountain and Life of Justice, <hi>Sheriffs</hi> may be reputed to
be the breath thereof; and by their Irregularities do render the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King as loathsome, as unsavoury breath doth the person whose
it is: Therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth chose rather to be a loser in his Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts
of the <hi>Sheriff-wicks,</hi> than to occasion the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to save their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
by oppression.<note place="margin">1 H. 4. c. 11.</note> And to this end he took away the course of farming
of <hi>Sheriff-wicks,</hi> and made the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> bare accountants for the Annual
profits;<note place="margin">4 H. 5. c. 2.</note> and as touching the casual profits, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> discharged himself
upon Oath. This was a good security to the King; but yet the People
was not herewith satisfied: For though the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> might not take to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64112:163"/>
                  <hi>Farm,</hi> yet what they had, they might let to <hi>Farm;</hi> and then wherein are
the people the better for these Laws? seeing it is all one for them, to be
oppressed by the <hi>Sheriff</hi> immediately, as by the Proxy.</p>
               <p>For preventing of this inconvenience,<note place="margin">4 H. 4. c. 5.</note> another Law is made, <hi>That the
Sheriff shall not let his Bailywick to Farm, nor be Non-resident; and to this he
must bind himself by Oath.</hi> So as now the <hi>Sheriff</hi> is double girt, and may
be fairly ridden, without danger to the King or People. But men ride
Horses for ease and pleasure; and he that must bend his mind always to
watch his Horses motion, will chuse rather to go on foot. And therefore
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth renewed the Law of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">1 H. 5. c. 4.</note> that <hi>Sheriffs</hi> shall
be but for one year; and then not to be chosen again, nor serve for three
years next following. This Order continued for the space of eight years;
within which time,<note place="margin">9 H. 5. c. 5.</note> War and Pestilence had consumed so many of the
richer sort of people, that a Dispensation is granted, that <hi>Sheriffs</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their places for four years. And it was above twenty years after,
e're the Stock was recruited again; after which time the substance of the
former Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and 1 <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth, is revived again; with a penalty upon the Sheriff, his Deputy,
or Clerk, that shall execute that place above one year. So the custom of
holding that Office ten or twelve years, by occasion of the Dispensation
for four years, was laid aside. But the Cure would never be perfect, so
long as Sheriffs held by Inheritance: for it was easie to find <hi>new Deputies,</hi>
but not to lay down old Customs; nor could it be lasting, unless the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
also had been annexed to the particular Crimes.</p>
               <p>For a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> before he is a year old, by experience formerly had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
too cunning for all these Laws;<note place="margin">4 H. 6. c. 1. 6. cap. 4. 15.</note> and therefore Laws are made also
against the ordinary corruption of these places; such as are extorting of
<hi>Fees,</hi>

such cases given to the party wronged:<note place="margin">23. cap. 10.</note> and when all is done, he is not
trusted with taking of <hi>Indictments.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 E. 3. c. ult.</note> Thus, with much ado, a <hi>Sheriff</hi> is
made a tolerable Officer; and his place by degrees so hedged in, that

                  <note place="margin">5 H. 4. c. 12.</note> Those times are happy, when Justice
waits not altogether at Court, but grows up in the Fields; and <hi>Justices
of Peace,</hi> as the Kings Arms upon the Royal Mace, are terrible onely to
the bad; and not as they are pictured before an Ale-house-door, to invite
men to transgress.</p>
               <p>The Laws for the preservation of the peace, concern either punishment
of Crimes committed, or prevention of them from being committed.
There is a succession of crimes, as of Men and Ages; because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
tells us, that <hi>the hearts of all are fashioned alike;</hi> yet it is with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
as with men, some incline to some crimes more than other;
and that is the reason that the title <hi>Treason,</hi> sometimes is set forth in Folio,
sometimes in a lesser Volume. It is evident is Story, that the violent
times of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, had raised the value of that, amongst other
offences, above measure; not long before his time, his Father had reduced
that wild notion of <hi>Treason</hi> to a certain rule, that formerly wandred in a
Wilderness of opinions. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, either to save his own
stake, or to take the people, or both, reduced it again to the Statute-rule
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">1 H 4. c. 10.</note> and made void that Statute of his Predecessors;
which had made a former Act of Parliament, and all the service thereby
done, <hi>Treason.</hi> The Dimensions of <hi>Treason</hi> thus clearly limned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
taught ill-disposed minds to keep out of the Letter, and yet to be
bold with the Scene: Counterfeit Money they durst not; yet to diminish
the same, they thought came not within the Circle; and so it became a
common grievance,<note place="margin">3 H. 5. c. 6.</note> till a Law was made, <hi>That all purposed impairing of
Money should be Treason. And so the Parliament held forth to all men, that
they had a power to declare Treason, without the bounds of the Statute of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>the Third. The like power it held forth in the time of</hi> Henry <hi>the
Sixth;</hi> for men knew that <hi>Burglary</hi> and <hi>Robbery</hi> were mortal crimes,
they would no more of that; now they devise a way to spoil, and prey
for themselves, and yet neither to rob, nor break House. To this end
they would scatter little Scrolls in writing, requiring the party that they
intended to prey upon, to leave so much money upon such a day, at such a
place;<note place="margin">8 H. 6. c. 6.</note> and this was <hi>Sub poena</hi> of burning the parties House and Goods:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64112:164"/>
which many times did ensue upon default made. <hi>This practice was at once
made Treason, to prevent the growth of such an evil.</hi> And the like was done
with <hi>Robberies</hi> and Manslaughters,<note place="margin">14 H. 6. c. 8.</note> contrary to the Kings Truce and safe-conduct.</p>
               <p>As many or more new <hi>Felonies</hi> were also now created.</p>
               <p>One was the <hi>cutting out of mens Tongues;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 H. 4. c. 4.</note> and <hi>plucking out of Eyes;</hi> a
strange cruelty! And that shewed the extream savageness of those times;
so much the more intolerable, by how much the poor tortured creature
could hardly be either Eye or Ear-Witness of the truth of his own
wrong.</p>
               <p>A second <hi>Felony</hi> was,<note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 15.</note> the customary of carrying of Wool, or Wool-fells
out of the Realm, to other places; except <hi>Calis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Felony</hi> concerneth Souldiers, which I refer over to the next
Chapter.</p>
               <p>The last was,<note place="margin">33 H. 6. c. 1.</note> Servants plundering their Masters Goods, and absenting
themselves: if upon Proclamation made, they appear not, this was also
made <hi>Felony.</hi>

so often inculcated, and new dressed, shew plainly the nature of the times.

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of the Militia during these times.</head>
               <p>THe Title of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to the Crown, was maintained prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
by his <hi>Tenures,</hi> which the Courtiers call <hi>Knight service;</hi>
but the Common people, <hi>force of Arms:</hi> And that which destroyed
many a man, was the principal means of his subsistence. Otherwise
it is clear, that his Title was stark naught; nor could he outface <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s
Title, without a naked Sword, which he used warily: for he had Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enough to keep his Sword in hand; and Friends enough to keep it
from striking at random. For coming in by the peoples favour, he was
obliged to be rather remiss than rigorous: yet his manner of coming was
by the Sword, and that occasioneth men much to debate about his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power in the <hi>Militia,</hi> as supposing that what power he had, other
Kings may <hi>De jure</hi> challenge the same. And let that be taken for granted,
though it will not necessarily follow in true reasoning: And let it also be
taken for good, <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth entred the Throne by his Sword;</hi>
yet is there not any Monument in Story or Antiquity, that favoureth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
absolute right in him over the <hi>Militia;</hi> but the current is, I think,
somewhat clear against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>De jure,</hi> could not compel men to
serve beyond the Seas, but raised them by contract; and therefore by Act
of Parliament,<note place="margin">4 H. 4. c. 13.</note> he did confirm the Statute 1 <hi>Edw. 3. Stat. 2. cap.</hi> 5. which
Statute was purposely made to that end. And the same also is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64112:165"/>
by another Statute made in these times,<note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 19.</note> whereof we now Treat;
by the words whereof appeareth, that the Souldiers for the Foreign
Service were levied by Contract between them and the Captain, who
undertook to levy them by Wage; so as none were then compelled to
enter into Service by <hi>Imprest,</hi> or absolute Command. Nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Authority amongst all those cited in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case, that doth mention
any such thing;<note place="margin">7 H. 4. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb.</hi> Protect. 100.</note> but contrarily, that Opinion of <hi>Thirning</hi> is express, <hi>That
the King cannot send men beyond Seas to Wars without Wages;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no man is bound to any such service, by any <hi>absolute Legiance,</hi> as the
Reporter would understand the point: but if he receiveth <hi>Wages</hi> thereto,
he by that Contract binds himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It seemeth also to be granted, that such as went voluntarily
in the Kings Service, ever had the Kings Pray, after they were out of their
Counties, if the King ruled by his Laws. For by the Statute formerly
mentioned, the King did likewise confirm the Statute of 18 <hi>Edw. 3. Stat.
2. cap.</hi> 7. which is express in that point; and the matter in fact also is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon the Records.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Touching the arming of those that were thus levied, as there
was a certain Law, by which all men were assessed to certain Arms, either
by the Service and Tenure of their Lands, or by Parliament; for such
as were not bound to find sufficient Arms by their Tenure, according as
is contained in the Statute 25 <hi>Edw. 3. Stat. 5. cap.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">4 H. 4.</note> So did <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth, by the Statute formerly mentioned to be made in his time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. In the argument of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s case
it is much insisted upon, to prove the <hi>Legiance</hi> of an <hi>English man</hi> to the
King, to be <hi>absolute, because he hath power to send men to War at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and he hath the onely power to make War; and if so, then hath he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power in the Militia.</hi> As touching the power of sending men to
War, hath been already spoken; but as touching the power to make War,
there is no doubt,<note place="margin">19 E. 3. f. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> but where a King hath made a <hi>League</hi> with another
King, he onely can break that League, and so make War; and that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of <hi>Brian</hi> must be agreed for good in that sence. But if a <hi>League</hi>
be made by Act of Parliament, or if the King will have War, and the
Parliament will make a League without him; no Authority doth in
such case avouch, that it is the right of the King, or that he hath a
legal power to break that <hi>League</hi> as he pleaseth. Neither in the next
place, <hi>hath the King any Right or legal Power to make War with his own
Subjects as he pleaseth, but is bound to maintain the Peace, not onely by
his Oath at his Coronatiion, but also by the Laws whereto he is bound, if he
will reign in right of an English King.</hi> For every man knoweth that
the grounds of the Statutes of wearing of <hi>Liveries,</hi> was for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the publick Peace. And <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, amongst other
provisions made against that trick,<note place="margin">1 H. 4. c. 7.</note> hath this; <hi>That the King shall give
onely his Honourable Livery to his Lords Temporal whom shall please him,
and to his Knights and Esquires menial, and to his Knights and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squires
which be of his retinue, and take of him their yearly Fee for term
of Life; and that no Yeoman shall take or wear any Livery of the King, nor
of none other Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 H. 4. c. 21.</note> And another Law was made within one year ensuing,
confirming the former, and providing that the Prince may give <hi>Liveries</hi>
to such Lords as he pleases, and to his menial Gentlemen; and that they
may wear the same, as in the Kings Case. By both which, the King and
Prince are both in one Case, as touching the power of giving <hi>Liveries;</hi>
if the one hath absolute power, then hath the other the like; if one be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64112:166"/>
under the Directory of Law in that point, then is also the other: For
it is clear, that the King is intended by the Statute to be bound from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Liveries,</hi> and the people from wearing them, otherwise than in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Cases. And then the conclusion will be, that if the King may not give
<hi>Liveries</hi> to the prejudice of the Peace, then may he much less break the
Peace at his pleasure; or levie Men, Arms, and War, when he shall think
most meet. <hi>Take then away from the King absolute power to compel men to
take up Arms otherwise than in case of Foreign Invasion, power to compel men
to go out of their Counties to War, power to charge men for maintenance of
the Wars, power to make them find Arms at his pleasure, and lastly, power to
break the Peace, or do ought that may tend thereto; and certainly the power of
the Militia that remaineth, though never so surely setled in the Kings hand, can
never bite this Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can the noise of the <hi>Commission of Array</hi> entitle the King unto
any such vast power as is pretended. For though it be granted, that
the <hi>Commission of Array</hi> was amended by the Parliament in these times;
and secondly, that being so amended, it was to serve for a Precedent or
Rule for the future: yet will it not follow, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had, or
any Successor of his hath any power of <hi>Array originally from themselves,
absolutely in themselves, or determinatively to such ends as he, or they, shall
think meet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As touching the amendment of the <hi>Commission,</hi> it was done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
complaint made by the Commons as a grievance, that such <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions</hi>
had issued forth, as had been grievous, hurtful, and dangerous:
And the King agrees to the amendments. upon advice had with the Lords,
and Judges.<note place="margin">Exact. Collec. p. 406.</note> And if it be true that the amendments were in the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
clauses (as it is granted) then it seemeth that formerly a greater
power was exercised than by Law ought to have been; and then hath
not the King an absolute power of <hi>Array;</hi> for the just power of a King
can be no grievance to the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>Commission of Array</hi> thus mended,<note place="margin">P. 407.</note> was to serve as a
rule of <hi>Array</hi> for the future; then there is a rule, beyond which, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth, and his Successors, may not go; and then it will also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the power of <hi>Array</hi> is not originally, nor absolutely, in the
King; but from, and under the Rule and Law of the Parliament: which
rule was not made by the Kings own directions,<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 406.</note> but (as we are told) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expectation, alterations were made in material parts of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi>
and the powers in execution there, whereof no complaint of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
had been made. The issue then is: If the King had an Universal
power in the <hi>Array,</hi> the Parliament likewise had a general liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any restriction to correct that power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Suppose that this power of the Parliament is executed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
by the <hi>Commission</hi> thus amended, and that thereby the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is established; yet can it not be concluded, that this power is originally
or absolutely in the King. It is not <hi>absolutely</hi> in him, because it is limited
in these particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(First.)</hi> It is not continual, because it is onely <hi>in case of eminent
danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(Secondly.) <hi>It is not general upon all occasions, but onely</hi> in cases of a
Foreign and sudden Invasion and attempts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Thirdly.)</hi> The powers are not undefined, but circumscribed. 1. <hi>To
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64112:166"/>
Array such as are armed,</hi> so as they cannot assess Arms upon such.<note place="margin">Collect. 4. 24.</note> 2. <hi>To
compel those of able Bodies and Estates to be armed; and those of able E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and not able Bodies, to arm such as are of able Bodies and not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states:</hi>
but this must be <hi>Juxta facultates,</hi> and <hi>salvo Statu.</hi> 3. Whereas
they strain themselves to make the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the
<hi>Commission of Array,</hi> to consist with the Statutes of 13 <hi>E. 1. 1 E.</hi> 3. and
25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. thereby they affirm so many more restrictions unto this power
of <hi>Array,</hi> as those Statutes are remedial in particular cases: yet do I not
agree to their Glosses, but leave them to the debate already published con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As this power was not absolutely in the Kings, so was it not
originally from themselves, because they had not the Legislative power
concerning the same; but the same was ever, and yet is, in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hereof I shall note onely three particular instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Militia</hi> is a posture that extendeth as well to Sea as Land:
That which concerneth the Sea, is the Law of <hi>Marque</hi> and <hi>Reprizal,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to such of the people of this Nation as are pillaged by Sea, by such
as have the King's Conduct, or publick Truce.<note place="margin">4 H 5. c. 7.</note> And by this Law the
party pillaged had power to recompence himself upon that man that had
pillaged him, or upon any other Subject of that Nation, in case upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
made of the Magistrate in that Nation, satisfaction be not given
him for his wrong: it was a Law made by the Parliament, whereby the
Chancellour had power to grant such Letters or Commission upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to him made.</p>
               <p>This was grounded upon the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. Charta. c. 32.</note> concerning
<hi>Free Trade,</hi> which had been prejudiced by the rigour of the <hi>Conservators
of the Truce,</hi> against the Kings Subjects; although what was by them
done, was done in their own defence. And by which means the Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were become bold to transgress, and the <hi>English</hi> fearful in their own
Charge; and many laid aside their Trade by Sea, and thereby the strength
of the Kingdom was much impaired. Nor is the equity of this Law
to be questioned; for if the Magistrate upon complaint made grants not
relief, the offence becomes publick, and the Nation chargeable, in nature
of an Accessory after the Fact, and so the next man liable to give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to seek for relief at home.</p>
               <p>The King then hath a power to grant Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> by Sea or
Land, and this power is granted by Parliament; and this power is a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
power onely in particular cases, in regard that many times these prove
in nature of the first light skirmishes of a general War.</p>
               <p>Two other instances yet remain concerning the Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Souldiers in the Army; the one concerning the Souldiers
pay, <hi>Viz. That Captains shall not abate the Souldiers Wages,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>but for their
Clothing, under peril of Fine to the King.</hi> The other concerning the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
service, <hi>That they shall not depart from their Colours without leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of their service be expired, unless in case of sickness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">cap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>or other good
cause testified and allowed by the Captain; and such as shall do otherwise, shall
suffer as Felons.</hi> Which Laws could not have holden in force, had they
not been made by Parliament, in respect that the penalties concern the
Estates and Lives of men, which are not to be invaded but by the Law of
the Land. So as both Captains and Souldiers, as touching the Legislative
power, are not under the King in his <hi>personal capacity,</hi> but under the Law
of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:64112:167"/>
Lastly, As the rule of War was under the Legislative power of the
Parliament, so was the rule of Peace: for whilst <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was
in <hi>France,</hi> which was in his Tenth year, from St. <hi>George</hi>'s day till <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
following; the <hi>Scots</hi> propound terms of Peace to the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
he being then <hi>Custos Regni;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hall. 10. H. 6.</note> which he referred to the Order of
the Parliament, by whom it was determined, and the Peace concluded,
in the absence of the King; and was holden as good and effectual by
both Kingdoms, as if the King had been personally present in his full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. A Survey of the Reigns of Edward the Fourth, Edward the
Fifth, and Richard the Third.</head>
               <p>THe Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was for the most part, in the former
parts of it, like Fire buried up in the Ashes; and in the latter
parts, breaking out into a Flame: In the heat whereof, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
after Fealty given by him to <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and Dispensation gotten
from the Pope to break his Faith, lost his life; and left his Son the <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
to pursue his Title to the Crown; which he claimed by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but more especially by Act of Parliament made upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth and his Father. This was <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fourth, who nevertheless reserved himself to the Election of the
Lords, and was by them received, and commended to the Commons
in the Field. By which means he gaining the possession, had also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to maintain the same; yet never held himself a King of
full Age, so long as <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth lived, which was the one half
of his Reign. Nor did he, though he held many Parliaments, scarce
reach higher than at reforming of Trade; which was a Theam well
pleasing to the people, next unto their Peace, which also the King care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
regarded. For although he had been a Souldier of good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and therewith successful, yet as one loath to trust too far, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the constancy of the people of his own Opinion, or the fortune
of War with his neighbouring Princes, he did much by brave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and discourse: and yet gained repute to the <hi>English</hi> for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
after the dishonourable times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth. He had much
to do with a wise King of <hi>France,</hi> that knew how to lay out three or
four calm words at any time, to save the adventure of his peoples bloud;
and make a shew of money, to purchase the peaceable holding of that
which was his onely by force, until the wind proved more fair to bring all
that continent under one head.</p>
               <p>In his Government at home, he met with many cross Gales, occasioned
principally by his own rashness, and neglect of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
friendship, which he had turned into professed enmity; and so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his own cause thereby,<note place="margin">Com. lib. 3. c. 4. &amp; 5. &amp; 6.</note> that he was once under water, his Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
of by new intail upon the Heirs of Duke <hi>Clarence;</hi> and so the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> remained constant to the House of <hi>York,</hi> though this
particular King was set aside. Nor did he in all this gain any thing but
a Wife, who though his Subject, and none of the greatest Family, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
brought any interest unto her Lord and Husband amongst Foreign
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64112:167"/>
Princes, brought nevertheless a Pearl, which was beyond all; which was,
the purchase of the Union between the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
and a peaceable succession in the Throne for a long while to come. It
must be granted, that there fell therewith an unhappy inconvenience in
the raising of a new Nobility of the Queens Kindred, of whom the ancient
Stock of Nobility thought scorn; and yet they were so considerable as to
be envied. A Wound hard to be cured, and yet easily avoided by such as
know how to deny themselves: And therefore can be no prejudice unto
that conclusion, <hi>That for an English King to marry his own Subject, is more
safe for the King, and beneficial for the Kingdom, than to marry a
Stranger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth did not long lie underneath; upon the next
fair Gale, he comes from beyond the Sea, and (like his first Predecessor
of the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) claims onely his Dutchy; which no man
could in reason deny to be his right, and therefore were the sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with him in that accoust. This was an act that in the first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
seemed modest; but when it was done, appeared too bold to
adventure it upon the Censure of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; and therefore they
were not more ready to engage, than slack to dis-engage, till they were
secure in the Kings Interest; which not long after ensued, by the death of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth. Thus <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth recovered the Crown, to
save his Dutchy. His Government was not suitable: for he came in by
the People, but endeavoured to uphold himself by Foreign Dependencies;
as if he desired to spread his Roots rather wide than deep. How ill this
Choice was, the event shewed: for Plants that root wide, may be strong
enough against an outward Storm; but they soon grow old, barren, and
rot irrecoverably from beneath. Such was the end of this mans Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
himself lived and died a King, and left Issue both Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;
the one tasted the Government, the other kissed it; but neither of
them ever enjoyed further than a bare Title. Nor was the Government
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth so secured by the Engagements of Foreigners:<note place="margin">Comin. lib. 3. c. 4.</note> for
as he sought to delude, so he was deluded, both by <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to the prejudice of all three. Towards his own people his carriage was
not so much by Law, as by Leave: for he could fetch a course out of the
old way of rule, satisfie himself, dissatisfie others, and yet never was called
to account. What was done by Entreaty, no man could blame; and
where Entreaties are countenanced by Power, no man durst contradict.
Thanks to his Fate, that had brought him upon a People tired by Wars,
scared by his success, and loth to adventure much for the House of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
in which no courage was left to adventure for it self. The greatest
errour of his way, was in the matter of <hi>Revenue;</hi> the former times had
been unhappy in respect of good Husbandry;<note place="margin">Comin. lib. 3. c. 5.</note> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth
was no man to gather heaps. His occasions conduced rather to diffuse,
and his mind generally led the way thereto; so as it is the less wonder if
he called more for accommodations, than the ordinary Treasury of the
Crown could supply. Hereto therefore he used expedients, which in his
former times were more moderate: for whilst <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth lived, he
did but borrow by <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and take Tunnage and Poundage by way
of hire.<note place="margin">12 E. 4. c. 2.</note> Afterwards, when no Star appeared (but what was enlightned
from his own Sun) he was more plain, and tried a new trick, called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</hi>
Unwelcome it was, not onely in regard of its own nature, but
much more in the end: for it was to serve the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64112:168"/>
raising a War against <hi>France</hi> in the first view,<note place="margin">Comin. lib. 4. cap. 1.</note> but in the conclusion to
serve his own Purse, both from Friends and Foes. And yet this also pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
without much controul; for when displeasure was like to ensue, he
could speak fair, and feast, and, if need was, kiss away all discontent. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his end, as stale drink, he grew sowr: For as in the first part of his
Reign he had been supplied by good-will against Law; so in his latter
times, he had gotten a trick of supply by Law against good-will. This
was by <hi>penal Laws,</hi> which are a remedy if they be used <hi>Ad terrorem;</hi> but
if strained beyond that, the Remedy proveth worse than the Disease. In
their first institution, they are forms of courtesie from the people to the
King; but in the rigorous execution of them, are trials of mastery of the
King over the people, and are usually laid up against days of reckoning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Prince and them.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>penal</hi> Laws are best contrived, that with the greatest terrour to
the Delinquent, bring the least profit to the King's Coffers. Once for all,
this King's Acts were many, his Enterprizes more, but seldom attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that end which they faced. He was a man of War, and did more
by his Fame than his Sword; was no sooner resolved in good earnest, but
he died, left a Kingdom unassured, his Children young, and many friends
in shew, but in truth very few.</p>
               <p>Now, if ever, was the Kingdom in a Trance. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth left
a Son,<note place="margin">Edw. 5. Rich. 3.</note> the <hi>Prima materia</hi> of a King, and who lived long enough to be
enrolled amongst <hi>English</hi> Kings, yet served the place no further than to
be an occasion to fill up the measure of the wickedness of the Duke of
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> and a monument of Gods displeasure against the House of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fourth; whether for that breach of Oath, or treachery against
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, or for what other cause, I cannot tell. But at the best,
this Prince was, in relation to his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than as an <hi>Overseer</hi> to an <hi>Executor,</hi> that might see and complain, but
cannot amend. For the Duke ruled, over-ruled, and mis-ruled all, under
the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth; and left no monument of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon record, till he changed both the Name and Person of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fifth to <hi>Richard</hi> the Third: his Fame had lifted him up, and might
have supported him,<note place="margin">Mercat. de Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. Imper. lib. 3.</note> had he regarded it. But as no man had more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
before he ascended the Throne, so no man ever entred and sate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with less. His proceedings were from a <hi>Protector</hi> to an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and
thence to a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> a Scourge to the whole Nation, especially the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and lastly, an instrument of Gods Revenge upon himself, a man
made up of Clay and Blood, living not loved, and dying unlamented.
The manner of his Government was strained; having once won the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
he is loth to be cast: knowing himself guilty all over, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could absolve his Fame but a Parliament; he calls it, courts it, and
where his Wit could not reach to apologize, he makes whole by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
takes away <hi>Benevolences;</hi> he is ready to let them have their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
desires,<note place="margin">1 R. 3. c. 2.</note> what can they have more? He promiseth good behaviour
for the future; which he might the better do, because he had already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his ends. Thus in one Parliament (for he could hold no more)
he gave such content, as, even to wonderment, he could assoon find an
Army in the field to fight for him, as the most meritorious of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.
Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ill Title made him very jealous, and thereby taught his
best Friends to keep at a distance; after which time few escaped that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64112:168"/>
came within his reach; and so he served God's Judgement against his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutants,
though he understood it not. Amongst the rest, against the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his great Associate, both in the Butchery of the
two young Princes, and usurpation of the Royal Scepter. He lived till
he had laid the Foundation of better times in the person of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
and then received his reward. But an ill Conscience must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
fed, or it will eat up its own womb.</p>
               <p>The Kings mind being delivered from fear of the Sons of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth, now dead, torments himself with thoughts of his Daughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live:
ashamed he is of Butchery of a Girl; he chuseth a conceit of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardizing
the Children of <hi>Elizabeth Gray,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Rich. 3. c. 15.</note> that calleth her self Queen of
<hi>England;</hi> but this proved too hard to concoct. Soon after that, he goes
a contrary way: The Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray</hi> is now undoubted Wife of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and her eldest Daughter as undoubted Heir to the
Crown. And so the King will now be contented to adventure himself
into an incestuous Marriage with her, if his own Queen were not in the
way, onely to secure the Peace of the Kingdom; which he, good King,
was bound in Conscience to maintain, though with the peril of his own
Soul; and in this zeal of Conscience, his Queen soon went out of the
way, and so Love is made to the young Lady. But <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of
<hi>Richmond</hi> was there before; and the Lady warily declined the choice, till
the golden Apple was won, which was not long after accomplished;
the King losing both the Lady, his Crown, and own Life together, put
an end to much wickedness, and had the end thereof in <hi>Bosworth-Field.</hi>

               <p>THe seasons now in Tract were of short continuance; lives passed
away more speedily than years; and it may seem useless to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what is the nature of the Government in such a time, whenas the
greatest work was to maintain Life and Soul together; and when all is
done, little else is done. For though the Title of the House of <hi>York</hi> was
never so clear against that of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> yet it had been so long darkned
with a continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uccession of Kings of the <hi>Red Rose,</hi> that either by their
Merit had gained a Throne in the peoples Hearts, or by their Facility
had yielded their Throne up to the peoples will, as it proved not easie
to convince them that liked well their present Lot, and were doubtful of
change; or to make them tender of the right of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their own quiet. Above Threescore years now had <hi>England</hi> made
trial of the Government of the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> Princes, and thereof about
Thirty years experience had they of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; they saw he was
a gentle Price. On the other side, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, newly sprung
up out of a Root watered with blood, himself also a man for the
Field.</p>
               <p>This might well put the minds of the people to a stand, what to think
of this Man, whose Nature and ends are so doubtful, and brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to commend him to the good wills of the people, but his bare
Title; which the common sort usually judge of, according as they see
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64112:169"/>
it prosper more or less. Add hereunto, that Divine Providence did not so
clearly, nor suddenly, determine his secret purpose concerning this change,
by any constant success to either part; by means whereof, the one half
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Reign was spent, while as yet <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth
was in view, and the minds of men left unassured, neither trusting much
to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, nor he to them. And after that <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth
was gone out of the way, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth could not readily change
his posture; used Arguments of force and power, and for the most part,
looked like a man in Arms, with his hand on his Sword, ready to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the next man that stands in his way.</p>
               <p>Thus are the people partly driven,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> and partly drawn, into an Oath of
Allegiance unto <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, under peril of Attainder; and the
Parliament assured unto him once more. For immediately upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth beyond Sea, after Ten years of his Reign,
the Parliament (never staying for the issue of Providence) declared
the Throne void of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth King. The
Judges likewise of the Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi> determined the same thing,
as may appear by the Law-Reports of those times in Print: wherein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attachments
were often granted by them upon discontinuance of Process
by this Demise of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. And thus <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth is once
more King for six Months, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>April,</hi> at which time the
Ballance turns; <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth returns, gets into the Throne; <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth is again Dethroned; all things are as they were, and all confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Act of Parliament. For that Body is ever wise enough to side
with Power, rather than to spend much time upon fruitless Orders and
Votes that will pierce no Armour; and therefore, like the times, must
needs be subject to fits of distemper at the coming in of every Tide; and
did build, and pull down, enact, and disenact, turn and return the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Crown from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and back again; and in conclusion,
for some time did do little but undo. Nor can they be justly censured
herein; for Councils of men are not ordained to hinder divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or over-rule Fate; but to foresee, and close with Occasions, in the
most advantageous way for the publick good; and when both Winds
and Currents are uncertain, to ride at flote, till they can discern the most
commodious Haven to Winter in. To impute therefore fault unto the
Parliament in such Cases, for want of Uniformity, and Immutability of
Councils, is somewhat like the Notion that Batchelors conceit of Wives;
they would have, but they do not know what other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>an Idea of their
own fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be enquired which course prevailed, in order either to the
Kings Royalty, or the peoples Liberty, I shall answer, Neither of these:
but the House of <hi>York</hi> prevailed to hold the Crown, and might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
the Authority thereof, had they not fall'n out amongst themselves
for the spoil; and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was not altogether disposed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
The success that he had in the Field, and his Souldiery, made him
look big like a King of the greater size; but Kings sleep not securely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Pillows. When the <hi>Militia</hi> is on Horseback, it is as ready to be a
Guard upon the King, as for him; and when it is most sober, not so
easily governed as a Commonwealth. And therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth,
now in Arms, though he found it a hard Notion to maintain the peoples
Liberty where no man is free from the Souldier, yet he enclined thereto.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64112:169"/>
We read of a multitude of <hi>Taxations</hi> of all sorts; and of <hi>Benevolences,</hi>
the worst of all those sorts. For Souldiers must have money; or if not,
they will have it: but the King would not force things so far as his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
could reach; he will have Money, but it shall be by order of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He might have pretended much upon the <hi>Commission of Array;</hi>
yet did it not,<note place="margin">12 E. 4. n. 8.</note> but chose rather to be Lord of the Seas. And because it
was too great a Farm for his private Purse, he prays aid of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the way of <hi>Tumage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 E. 4. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>which was in demand nine
years before the Parliament granted it.</hi> And when it was <hi>granted, it was
with such restrictions, that it is evident the King preferred the right of the
Parliament therein, above his private honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Titles of Honour</hi> are but windy Notions; and every one
knows what claim is made by Kings, to have the sole interest in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the same. This <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth neglected so far,<note place="margin">17 E. 4. n. 10. 16.</note> as he intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the Parliament, both in the conferring of them, and resuming the
same.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The course of Trade</hi> was now more especially looked to, not by
the King and Privy Council, but by the Parliament. And because it
was much decayed, partly by reason of the ill government thereof, and
partly by the excessive lavishness of these times, many Laws are made
for remedy of both.<note place="margin">3 E. 4. c. 1.</note> And first, the <hi>Staple</hi> was setled sometimes at
<hi>Calis</hi> alone, sometimes at it and <hi>Middleborough;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 E. 4. c. 2.</note> and by this means, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
gained Trade from both Nations;<note place="margin">14 E. 4. c. 3, 5.</note> but the principal thanks is to be
given to the interest between the King and the House of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Then
course is taken for the bringing of the <hi>Staple.</hi> Commodities onely to those
places,<note place="margin">3 E. 4. c. 1.</note> and the return to be made in Money, and not Commodity by
exchange. Then for the well making of <hi>Staple</hi>-Manufactures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
Importation of Foreign Manufactures of such kinds.<note place="margin">1 R. 3. c. 12.</note> Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
transporting of <hi>English Coyn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 E. 4. c. 1, 2, 3.</note> and importing of Foreign Coyn,<note place="margin">17 E. 4. cap. 1.</note> other
than Bullion.</p>
               <p>And as touching the second grievance, it seems, gallantry or vanity of
<hi>Apparel</hi> was a sore Disease of these times, which were become times of
Fashions, and wherein the King led the way by his own example. For
he desired to be brave; and that he might be more brave,<note place="margin">3 E. 4. c. 5.</note> he passed
Laws that the people should be less brave,<note place="margin">22 E. 4. c. 1.</note> assessing a sort of Apparel for
every degree, and therein stooped so low,<note place="margin">17 E. 4. c. 1.</note> as to define the fashions of their
very shoes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Parliament retained their ancient right of reducing the
course of <hi>Judicature.</hi> For whereas <hi>Sheriffs</hi> had hitherto holden their course of
Trial of the moaner sort of Felonies, and Trespasses, and Offences, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
onely by Imprisonment, or Fines and Amerciaments; whereby
mens Estates did lie under the continual pillage of these covetous and
extorting Officers:<note place="margin">1 E. 4. c. 2.</note> It was established by the Parliament, that these men
should have for the future, only power of enquiry, and to certifie at the
next Sessions, and there the Trial to be; and Fines and Amerciaments to
be set, Taxed, and Estreated unto the Exechequer, and from thence to
be levied, and thereof the Sheriff give account. This was a great secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the peoples Estates, but gave them not a full remedy: For though
the Trial was now more fair, yet these Officers were Judges of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and had still power upon suspicion to imprison their persons, and seize
their Estates, under colour to save them for the King, in case Conviction
followed.</p>
               <p>For remedy hereof,<note place="margin">1 R. 3. c. 3.</note> the <hi>Justices of the Peace</hi> have now power given
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64112:170"/>
them to Bail, in Case of light suspicion; and it is further declared, <hi>that
no mans Estate shall be first seized, till Conviction and Attainder first be
had.</hi> And because <hi>Escheators</hi> grew no less burthensome in their way,
it was therefore ordered, that no man shall be allowed in such Office, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he hath Lands to the value of Twenty pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> and that he

               <head>CHAP. XXV. The condition of the Clergie.</head>
               <p>IF any gains were had in these uncertain times, the Church-men might
seem to have them; having now this advantage, that the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was distracted with uncertain interests of the Succession of the Crown:
And themselves onely united under the Popedom, now freed from all
Schism; and the Popedom managed by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, who had the
hap to be accounted more virtuous than any of his Predecessors had been,
and to have all the <hi>Christian Princes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naucler.</note> wholly at his devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And lastly,</hi> Both the Clergie and the Kings were now joyntly engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the rising power of Religion, then called Heresie; in order whereunto,
the Clergie leading the way, had the applause of them that followed, upon an
implicite Faith, that whatsoever was done, was exceeding well done.</p>
               <p>Nor was it wisdom for Kings that sate loose in their Thrones, to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the good Opinions of so considerable a party towards them. And
therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in his first entrance, granted to the <hi>Clergie,</hi>
that which could never be by them obtained from any of the foregoing
Kings,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 294.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. Free liberty of Process in all Cases Ecclesiastical, and in Tythes
of Wood above twenty years growth; and in case they were troubled upon the
Statutes of Provisors, they should have their remedy in the Chancery against
those Judges, and their Proceedings in such Cases there to be cancelled.</hi> This
was done by Charter,<note place="margin">9 H. 6. fol. 56. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Pasion.</note> and was sufficient to shew what the desire of the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> and the intention of the King was, <hi>Viz. At once to favour the
Church, and under colour of favour done to the Clergie, to cancel both Common
and Statute-Laws of the Kingdom, by the power of the Chancellor's Decree:
Nevertheless, all this was but the King's breath; the policy changed never a
whit the more.</hi> For the Common Law held on its course, not onely in
Cases depending before the Holy Chair, but also even before the Bishop
of the Diocess at home;<note place="margin">5 E. 4. fol. 6.</note> so as neither the King was concluded from his
Suit,<note place="margin">9 E. 4. fol. 3.</note> nor the party endamaged from his Action by any such Charter.
And so far were the Judges of the Common Law from being bound by
the <hi>Chancery</hi> in such Cases,<note place="margin">7 E. 4. fol. 2. Per Littleton.</note> that they professed they would not delay to
grant the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 E. 4. fol. 37.</note> to deliver any Prisoner by Decree of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
in any Case triable at the Common Law. Much less did the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
favour these men so far, as to give them any countenance in any
way of gain upon themselves; but rather made bold with what the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64112:170"/>
Church-men in former times challenged as their own; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
whereas formerly it had inhibited Fairs and Markets upon the
Lord's Day, Now it inhibited the sale of Boots, Shoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon that
day, though done never so privately; which they did at the first onely
within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and three miles thereof. I suppose it was
made onely by way of Trial, it being dangerous in such times to give a
stop to all <hi>England</hi> at once; otherwise it might be wondered, why God's
Honour should be better regarded in <hi>London</hi> than in all the Realm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
Of this encroachment we find no complaint made by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
another touched them to the quick, although it befel onely the
Arch-bishoprick of <hi>York,</hi> that hitherto held ordinary Jurisdiction over
all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as being their Provincial. Now it is disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them all; and they are backed therein by their King, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of great inconvenience to his Bishops in their so far Travels; but
in truth, not unlike to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> though he pretended it was too much
for them, yet he thought it unsafe for himself that his Bishops should owe
Canonical obedience to the Subject of another Prince; and upon this
ground prevailed with Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth to make the Divorce, and
left it to future Ages to try the validity thereof, if they would.</p>
               <p>This is all that I shall observe of the Government of these three Kings,
whose Reigns in the whole, exceeded not Twenty six years; and their
compleat power therein, not much above half so many.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. A short sum of the Reigns of Henry the Seventh, and Henry
the Eighth.</head>
               <p>THe course of <hi>English</hi> policie hitherto wandring in the different Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
springing from the double head of Monarchie and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie;
and in them likewise often tossed up and down, partly by the
blasts of windy Titles and pretensions, and partly by the raging Tides
from the <hi>Roman</hi> See, now begin to come to anchor within view of Shore.
Happy <hi>England,</hi> if the same prove good Harbourage for a fainting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
Two Kings now undertake the Steerage; the work of the first,
was to still the Winds, the other the Seas, and so to bring the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
safe home. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh hapned upon a good preparative for
this work, in that he delivered the Kingdom from a Tyrant, whose ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
and bloody way was so odious to the people, that it set a foil
upon his Successor's Government, and made his Wisdom, Valour, and
Justice appear greater than possibly it was. His Valour made way for
the other two; he had enough thereof to serve a wise man in case of
extremity: at other times he made more use of his Majesty than Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
being confident that the people knew not where to mend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but would be at his Devotion, so long as he was better than his
Predecessor, though he cared not how little. His Wisdom was his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part, of which, upon all occasions, he made the greatest improvement
he could, without reflecting upon Conscience, or Religion, whereof he
had tasted no more than would render him a civil man; whereunto his
Education did lead the way. Thus, though his Valour brought him to
the Crown, yet it was his Wisdom that setled him in the Throne. For
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64112:171"/>
though he loved himself so well; that he was loth to pretend allowance of
any access of Foreign help to his own atchievement in his Title, or that
he was guilty in the least manner in his entry upon the Throne; yet to
keep danger far off, he provided one guard for his Person, and many for
his Title.</p>
               <p>That of his Person, he onely pretended as a ceremony of State brought
from the <hi>French</hi> Court; and yet it is strange that it went so well down
with a <hi>Free people. For that Prince that will keep Guards about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the midst of his own people, may as well double them into the pitch of an
Army, whensoever he pleases to be fearful; and so turn the Royal power of Law,
into force of Arms.</hi> But it was the <hi>French</hi> fashion, and the King's good
hope to have all taken in the best sence.</p>
               <p>His Title (setting aside the saying of <hi>Philip</hi> the Hardy, <hi>That King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
onely belong to them that can get them</hi>) would hardly endure the
touch,<note place="margin">Thevet. lib. 4. cap. 32.</note> till Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> by his Bull confirmed the Crown to him, to hold
by a six-fold right, <hi>Viz. Of Inheritance, of War, of Espousals, of Election,
of Gift by Parliament,</hi> and lastly, <hi>of Pontifical Benediction;</hi> which the
King liked marvelous well; and the rather, because his Title by Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was buried up in the middle, and so made the less noise. For though it
was his best guard, yet he liked not that it should be so reputed, lest his
Title should seem rather conferred upon him, than gained by him; and
so should hold by a Woman, or at the best by the courtesie of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
if the Peoples favour should so far extend the Law in that point;
by both which he holds the honour <hi>of a compleat King diminished.</hi> His
Title by <hi>Inheritance</hi> is much disputable, if the right Heirs of <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Gaunt</hi> be enquired after: And much more that of <hi>War;</hi> for although
that brought the Possession, yet no right or Title, but by wrong; which
may indeed be plaistered over by <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; but
then he must be Tenant to the People. As touching the <hi>Pontifical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,</hi>
himself took that but as a redundancy, that might sway with
the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and do his Title no hurt. Nevertheless, what severally they
cannot do, by joynt concurrence he accounts so fully done, as if he were
a King against all the World,<note place="margin">Jovius Brit.</note> and more. Yet is he not sure enough, but
as one jealous is more tender, so is his eye ever upon his Title; there is
his guard, and regard; as if it were the outworks of his Crown, which
once lost, the Crown cannot hold out long. In this work he minded
so much his Greatness, that he lost the repute of his Goodness. Then
casting his eye upon the Government, and finding it of a mixt temper,
wherein if Royalty prevails not, Popularity will; like a good Souldier,
whilst his strength is full, he sallies upon the peoples liberties, in regard
of their persons, with such cunning conveyance, as he taught the People
to dance more often and better to the tune of Prerogative and Allegiance,
than all his Predecessors had done. Nor did the People perceive it, till
they were over their Shoes; and then they clearly saw their condition,
and that it was in vain for them to wrangle with their own acts; of which
more particularly in the next Chapter. The <hi>Legiance</hi> of persons of the
People once gained, their Estates more easily follow: And therefore though
in the former he wrought by <hi>Ambuscado,</hi> in this he may be more brave,
and charge them in the Van. Yet this he did also by degrees; first by
light skirmishes of <hi>borrowing</hi> smaller sums of money (possibly when he had
no need) and paying them again, thereby to gain credit for greater sums, of
which he intended not so sudden return. Then he charges them home
with <hi>Benevolences;</hi> (a trick gained in right of his Wife from her Father)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64112:171"/>
for he hoped that the person of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third was now become so
abominable, as his Laws would be the less regarded. But in this course
he gained nothing but Wind. Then (as <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth) he falls
upon <hi>Malevolences of Penal Laws;</hi> things made <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to scare men
to obedience, rather than to compel them; but are now executed <hi>Ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorem;</hi>
and the people find that he is but a word and a blow with them:
and thus, serving his Prerogative with Power, and his Purse with his
Prerogative, he made all serve his own turn,<note place="margin">Jovius Brit. fol. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Humanitatem omnem vincente
periculo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Field he always put his Wisdom in the Van; for as he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simonious
in expences of Money, so much rather of Bloud, if he could
prevail by Wit. Generally he was the first in Arms, to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he was more ready to fight than they. Thus he many times gained
the advantage of his Adversaries, and sometimes came off without
blows. In the Battle he did put on courage as he did his Armour, and
would dare to adventure just as far as a General should; as if he had
ever regard of his Crown, rather than of the honour of a forward Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
which nevertheless was also so dear to him, as he is seldom found
in the Rear, although his Judgement commanded in chief, rather than
his Courage. In the Throne he is much more wise, because he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it should be known. In doing Justice he is seldom suspected, unless
where himself is party; and yet then he is also so shame-faced, as he would
ever either stalk behind some Law that had a semblance to his ends, or
when he meant to step out of the way, he would put his Ministers before;
not so much that his <hi>fineness</hi> might be known, but his <hi>Royalty.</hi> For the
Lion hunts not its own prey, nor is it Regal for a King to be seen in cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of Money, though he be understood. Besides, it was needless; he
had <hi>Lords, Bishops, Judges,</hi> and other instruments of malevolent aspects,
as so many Furies, outwardly resembling men for the Commonwealth,
but working for the common mischief; like some Pictures, one way look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
right, and another way looking wrong. And thus the King comes
lawfully by what he catched, though his instruments did not; and must
be still holden for a good King, though it be his hard hap to have ill ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Take him now amongst the people, he is alike to all, yea in some
things that might seem to brush upon the King's own train; for he had
some of his suit that were not altogether of his mind, and these he would
spare to the course of Justice if need were. As it befel in the case of the
Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whom he suffered to be tried at the Kings Bench-bar, for
a Murder done upon a mean person, and by such means obtained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of a zealous <hi>Justiciar;</hi> as if Justice had been his principal vertue.
All this suited well with his main end; for he that will milk his Cattle,
must feed them well; and it encourages men to gather and lay up, when
they have Law to hold by what they have.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Religion,</hi> I touch upon in the last place, as most proper to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
for it was the last in his thought, though many times the first in the
acting. But where it stood in his way, he turned it behind him; he made
Church-men his instruments, that the matter might better relish; for
who will expect ought save well from <hi>men of Religion?</hi> and then if the
worst come, he was but misled by such, as in common reason ought to be
trusted. And it is his unhappiness to meet, with <hi>Clergy-men</hi> to serve a
turn, and a Pope to give his Benediction to all. Nor was this <hi>Gratis;</hi> for
there were as many mutual engagements between the <hi>Clergie</hi> and him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64112:172"/>
as any of his Predecessors of the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> besides. Lastly, It
may well be supposed, however wise this King seemed to be, that many
saw through him; which procured him a troublesome Reign; though
many times occasioned by his own interposing in Foreign Interests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he suffered more from others than they from him. Amongst the rest,
the Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (though a Woman she were) mated him
with Phantomes and Apparitions of dead Bodies of the House of <hi>York;</hi>
the scare whereof put the King and all his people in alarm; and striking
at idle shadows, slew one another. All which, together with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of <hi>Collections, Taxes,</hi> and other accoutrements to furnish such
employments, were enough to disturb that ease and rest that the King
aimed to enjoy; make him burthensome to his people, and both himself
and them weary of each other. And so he went down to the Grave
with but a dry Funeral; leaving no better testimonie behind him, than
that he was a cunning man, rather than a wise <hi>English</hi> King. And though
he died rich, yet is he since grown into debt to the Pen-men of his story,
that by their own excellencie have rendred him a better King than he
was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was a Conception in whom the two Bloods both of
<hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> did meet,<note place="margin">Henry 8.</note> both of them unconquered, both of them
predominant; and therefore no wonder if he was a man beyond the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
proportion of other men in stature of Body, and in qualities of
Mind not disproportionable. It is regularly true, that great Bodies move
slowly; but it holds not where much Spirit is: and it was the condition
of this Prince to have a Spirit of the largest size, that acted him into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with no less speed than mighty power. This himself understood
right well, and therefore might be haughty upon a double Title, both of
Purchase and Inheritance. Nor did he fail of expectation herein; for he
could not endure that man that would own his right in competition with
King's aims, and therefore would have his Kingdom be like his Doublet,
to keep him warm, and yet sit loose about him, that he might have el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room.
Suitable hereunto were his undertakings, invited thereunto
by the inordinate motions, or rather commotions of his neighbouring
Princes: For it was now full Sea in all Countries; and though <hi>England</hi>
was inferiour to some of them, yet the King held it dishonourable for
him not to adventure as far as the bravest of them; and in the end out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
them all. What he wanted in number, he supplied in courage;
wherein he so exceeded, that he avoided dangers rather out of Judgement
than Fear. His thoughts, Resolutions, Endeavours, and Actions, were
all the birth of Occasion, and of each other; as if he had obtained a general
Pass from Providence, with warranty against all Counter-guards what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>His Wisdom served him to espie present opportunities, rather than to
foresee them; and therefore was not so crafty as his Father in preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
occasions, yet more dexterous in giving them the rout. For he could
manage his hand and foot better than his Father, strike downright blows;
and rather than he would fail of his ends, would make one, as many times
he did.</p>
               <p>Another advantage he had of his Father: for considering the times,
he was a learned King, which made his Actions carry more Majestie,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64112:172"/>
and like a well-feathered Arrow from a strong had, drive through the
wind steadily to the mark: Whenas his Father, like a weak Archer, must
raise his compass, and crave aid of the Wind to help him to be right in the
end.</p>
               <p>It is affirmed by some, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was courteous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair;
if so, he must thank his Education: but it may be rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that upon occasion he used the art of Insinuation, which he might
learn both from the Father-side and Mother-side; but he neither pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
it much, nor did he rely upon that skill; for his resolution led
him to cut the knot that he could not untie. His Learning led him most
to Divinity, and therein shewed him light enough to see much into the
Mystery of Iniquity, which he did explain to the World passing well;
but as touching Devotion, he left that to the care of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>He was very well accommodated with Money: First, from the full
Coffers left by his Father, much whereof he spent in Pastimes and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
as he was Heir to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; and much also in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to the Pope, as he was Heir to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; in lieu of all
which, he was rewarded with a Title, <hi>Defender of the Faith;</hi> and so of
much ill gotten, was much ill spent. But a better supply he had when
<hi>Rome</hi> and he parted asunder, and the Current of the Riches of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
was stopped from running at waste, and returned into the Kings own
Treasury; and so might have died the richest Prince in the World, but
that he wanted the main Clause in the Conveyance, <hi>To have and to hold.</hi>
The Wisdom of God so ordered it; for these felicities were too great and
many for any moderate spirit to bear gently, much more for the King's
Spirit, that was ever on the Pinacle, and grown to that height, that like
an embossed Stag, none must cope with him, he must run and out-run
all; none must cross him under extream peril; no good is to be done, but by
following afar off. Nor is it a full wonder, if in this his heat he knows neither
faithful Servant, Counsellor, nor Wife, but strikes at all that stands in
his way. Nevertheless, in his cool temper, and when he was entangled
with some perplexed occasion, he could use the advantage of good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and the wits of others that were more crafty than himself. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was his good hap to have some ever nigh him that were for his turn,
and unto them committed much, that himself might be at ease to hear
good news of successful dispatches.</p>
               <p>In his youth he was served by the wise Counsellors trained up by his
Father; and he then willingly enough, for his pleasure, was contented by
their advice to serve his people for a time, that they might be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for ever. The two great Conduit-Pipes of this Treasury, which
he had from his Father, he cut off at his peoples request, as if he
loved his People above all his Riches. And after that, he laid aside
his pleasures and youthful company, to apply himself more closely to the
affairs of his Kingdom, as if he loved that above all pleasure: which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
stuck to him so long as he lived, and swayed too much in the
greatest Affairs of his Government.</p>
               <p>Thus the first heat of his course was run well, so long as the Privy
Council continued moderately poised. But no sooner began one of them
to put up beyond his place, and to bid adieu to the advice of all the rest,
but he gets the uppermost seat in the King's Head, makes a Foot-stool
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64112:173"/>
of the King's Heart, and then it is two to one that the people in such
cases must bear the greater burthen: For whoever first said it, he said
most true, <hi>That Prerogative in the hand of a King, is a Scepter of Gold;
but in the hand of a Subject, it is a Rod of Iron.</hi> The Reign of this King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, serves us with much experience of this kind; for if
the consideration of the Affairs of this Government should be divided,
the same would be double: the one under the <hi>Regiment</hi> of Cardinal
<hi>Wolsey;</hi> the other of the King, by <hi>Cromwel, Cranmer, Gardiner,</hi> and others
interchangeably. I call that of <hi>Wolsey</hi> a <hi>Regiment;</hi> for he was in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or condition of a <hi>Pro-Rex,</hi> during the Kings Juvenility. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
thus super-induced upon a Cardinal, (raised from mean degree to
be <hi>Legate à Latere,</hi> courted by Foreign Princes,<note place="margin">Thuan. lib. 1.</note> slattered by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
with Titles of Son and Cousin) made him lead a dance, that the
King (however active he was) is put to his career to hold him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
which the King perceiving, tripped up his heels, and left the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi>
the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> the <hi>Legate,</hi> and many more with him,
lying on the ground. <hi>No pride like to that of the Clergie, whose parts are
more sublime, and apprehensions clear.</hi> If God addeth not a superiour
Work to rule over all, <hi>a little honour will blow up all with powder.</hi> The
King having thus matched the Cardinal, forgot his former natural pace;
and once in a heat, could cool no more till death cooled him. He knew
by experience, that the Cardinal could over-awe the people; why should
not the King do as much? if the Lords stooped to the Cardinal, why not
much rather to the King? The Cardinal pulled down, reared up, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
square to round; why should he be less than his Subjects? Such
conceits as these soon wound up the Kings mind to that height, that it is
death to him to stoop one inch lower to more moderate advice, though
he loved their persons never so well: but all must be content with the
weight of his arm, though it were no small one; and yet in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
affairs tended to a kind of Reformation all this while.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. Of the State of the Crown.</head>
               <p>THat the Crown of <hi>England</hi> now abounded more in Flowers than
Crosses, the Face of Story doth hold forth to ordinary Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet few are satisfied, either in the true nature of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
advantages, or in the manner how they were obtained, or in the
continuance. I must therefore make a little stop upon them, because
in the true discerning of them, the discovery of the nature of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in latter days doth much depend. Hitherto the Crown came short
of absolute power over the people, upon two grounds in observation:
one relating to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> the other to the <hi>Laity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church-men were heretofore under a Foreign power, and a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Law; against which, Kings durst not deeply engage: either not
being assured of their own Title, or employed in pursuit of other game;
or being of a weak Spirit, were scared with the Thunder-bolt of the Pope's
Curse. But the Laity were under another Law, and such an one, as
by clear and unquestionable Custom, had established bounds, between
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64112:173"/>
the way of Kings, and the Rights of the People. Neither did Kings
directly invade those Borders, either led thereto by a kind of Conscience
in such of them as were morally enclined, or in others by a kind of
fear of raising up Earthquakes from beneath, which commonly do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
high Towers sooner than Winds from above. But now such
interests are laid aside, fast asleep, by two Kings: Whereof one cared not
much for <hi>Fear,</hi> and neither of them for <hi>Conscience.</hi> For <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
having leisure to study the Nature, and contemplate the Fashion
of the <hi>English</hi> Crown, dislikes the Model in some particulars. It was not
rich enough, nor well poised to his mind, which ever was, not to be poor,
but towards his latter time to be exceeding rich; as supposing that to
be the onely way to be more desirable to Friends, formidable to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and absolute over his People. And this opinion of his missed in
the main end, though it attained his immediate desire. For by mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the right way, it made a rich King, but not a rich Crown. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
more in the riches of his People, than in a rich People: And this
bred no good blood, because the People thought that the Law was not
on his side in that matter. They suffered him to visit their Purses; but
are loth it should prove customary, lest they should lose their Common
Right. They therefore chose rather to give him power by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to <hi>revoke</hi> Letters-Patents, and Grants, and make resumptions of
Offices, Fees, Annuities, and the like; that he might rather repossess his
own, than possess theirs. Many Penal Laws likewise of a limited and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
regard are made; and as Cheese after a full Dinner, they close up
all with <hi>Subsidies.</hi> For it was evident to all men, that the Royal mind of
the King served no further than to take what was given; provided that
the People would give, what else would be taken. By this means <hi>Henry</hi>
the Seventh left rich Coffers to descend to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, but the
Crown was still the same in price.</p>
               <p>In this Act of the Play, the People carry away the plaudite. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Act was the point of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> wherein both parts carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so cunningly, as it is hard to adjudge the Garland; yet it may be
thought the King observed it rather, because he offered all the play, whilst
the People did onely lie at their close guard. The whole project consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in this, to gain a more absolute <hi>Allegiance</hi> from the <hi>English</hi> to their
King. And because this is exemplified partly in War, and partly in Peace,
that part which concerneth War, will more properly fall under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the <hi>Militia:</hi> and therefore I shall refer the same to that
head, in the 32 Chapter ensuing; and will come to the second considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in relation to Peace, and therein touch upon the Kings
power in making of Laws, and of Judicature according to those Laws.
As touching the <hi>making of Laws,</hi> the ingenuity of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,
could not suffer him to make any claim thereto in any positive way; yet
his actions declare that his heart was that way. For being beset with
troubles, he could often fancy dangers, and arm himself; then call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who were wise enough to grant as readily as he asked, rather than
to be compelled thereto. So he had Laws made according to his own
Will, though he made them not.</p>
               <p>The matter of <hi>Judicature</hi> comes next; <hi>and therein he made his Judges
appear, and not himself; though they did not onely represent his person, but
his mind: so things were done according to his mind, though he did
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64112:174"/>
them not.</hi> And thus his Excellency seemed more eminent in finding and
making instruments fitting to do his work, than in doing his own work.
Nevertheless, all this was but from hand to mouth; no Fundamental
Law is altered all this while: If the Laws were made by Parliament, the
King made them not: If the Judges turned the Law to the King's ear,
the Law was still the Crown, though the King wore it. But <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth was no such man, he had not this skill of undermining, nor desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it; he was tender of the least diminution of his Honour, industrious
in finding out the occasion, and a most resolved man to remove it out of
the way, though it reached as high as the Triple Crown. A man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
many passions, but above fear. What need he care for pretences?
his Father loved Riches, he Power. When he came to traverse his
ground, he found quickly where the Church-men trespassed upon him;
and began with them, resting upon the wisdom of his Father, and the
infallibility of the Pope. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had taken to Wife <hi>Katherine</hi>
his Brothers Dowager, and continued in that condition Eighteen years
without wrinkle of Fame, till the great Success of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, the
Queens Brother, against the Pope and French, scared the King into a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of his greatness; and the Emperour's failing in courtesie to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Wolsey,</hi> the King's <hi>Achates,</hi> stirred the Cardinals spirit to revenge, for
the loss of his hopes in the Popedom. For the Cardinal finding the King's
mind to linger after another Bedfellow, by whom he might have a Son,
he made the French Embassadour his Instrument to mind the King of
his unlawful Marriage with the Queen, and to mention unto him <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet
D' Alanson</hi> a Princess of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thuan. lib. 1.</note> both in Bloud and Beauty. The
King liked the notion of Divorce, but disliked the motion concerning the
<hi>French</hi> Lady, himself being prepossessed with a fair Object at home, the
Lady <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jov. hist. fol. 31.</note> then attending upon the Queen. And thus being
moved, he entred into a scrutiny concerning the condition of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
wherein he had been formerly touched, both by the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, upon several motions made.</p>
               <p>First, Between <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and afterwards between the <hi>Dauphine</hi>
and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox. Sleidan. lib. 9.</note> afterwards Queen. Hereat the Cardinal winked all
the while, till the infallibility of the Chair of <hi>Rome</hi> came upon the Stage;
then bestirring his Wits, he lodged the Case upon Appeal thither, as he
hoped beyond all further <hi>Appeal;</hi> and so held the King there fast, till him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
might accomplish his own ends. But the Wheel once set a running,
would not stay. The King espies the Cardinal in his way, and bears him
down: Then finding the fallacy of the infallible Chair, he hearkens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
other Doctors, follows their light: and being loth to hear what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from <hi>Rome,</hi> he stopped the way to all Importation of such Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
as might be any ways prejudicial to the Prerogative Royal, with the
penalty of the loss of Land, or Liberty and Fine; the two latter being
formerly warranted by Law. The first served as a scare: for (though
it were but by Proclamation) men might justly fear that he who was
so stout against the Pope, would not stick to scourge his own Subjects
out of his way in the time of his heat.</p>
               <p>The King thus entred the Lists both against Pope and Cardinal now
under <hi>Praemuniri,</hi> (whereof he died) meets the <hi>English</hi> Clergie (thus
losing their Top-gallant) standing up in the Reer against him, and talking
at large. Nevertheless, the King stops not his career, puts them to the
rout for maintaining the <hi>power Legatine.</hi> They soon submit, crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
give a sum of Money, and perfume their Sacrifice with that sweet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64112:174"/>
Incense of <hi>Supream Head of the Church of</hi> England.<note place="margin">1531. An. Antiq. Brit.</note> This was done, not
by way of Donation, (for the Convocation had no such power) but by
way of acknowledgement, in flat opposition to the Jurisdiction of the
Pope. It became the common subject of discourse amongst all sorts,<note place="margin">Jovius. Brit. fol. 20.</note> but
of wonderment to the Pope. Yet for fear of worse,<note place="margin">Sleidan lib. 9.</note> he speaks fair; for
he was not in a posture to contest: but all would do no good. The Queen
had appealed to <hi>Rome;</hi> the Pope by <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s advice makes delays. The
Parliament espying the advantage, at once took all <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>
away,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and established all Sentences made or to be made within this
Land, notwithstanding any Act from <hi>Rome;</hi> and enjoyned the <hi>English</hi>
Clergie to administer the several Acts of publick Worship, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any Inhibition or Excommunication from any Forein pretended
Power. The grounds upon the Preamble of the Law will appear to be
Two.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>is Supream Head in rendring Justice
within the Nation in all Causes therein arising;</hi> which is more than the
Recognizance of the Clergie, two years before this Act, did hold forth.
Yet this <hi>acknowledgement is not absolute, but in opposition to Forein preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Clergie in</hi> England <hi>having power, may in matters
Spiritual determine all doubts without Forein help, and administer such
Duties as to their place do belong.</hi> Not hereby determining that the
Church-men ever had such power by Law, nor that they ought origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to have such power. They never had it; for no sooner were they
dis-joyned from the <hi>Laity</hi> in these affairs, but immediately they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and received their power from him. And, <hi>de Jure,</hi> they
cannot challenge such power, but by a positive Law, such as this Law of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which also giveth but a restrictive and limited power,
<hi>viz. In matters Testamentary, of Divorce, Matrimony, Tythes, Oblations, and
Obventions.</hi> So as if they will challenge such power, they must thank
the Parliament for it, and use the same accordingly as persons deputed
thereunto; and not in their own right, or right of their places. In all
this the King's <hi>Supremacy</hi> is but obscurely asserted, and rather by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
shewing what in reason may be holden, than by declaration of what
was; making way thereby</p>
               <p>First, Into the Opinions of men, before they were enjoyned to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
their Actions: but within Two years ensuing, or thereabout, the
Law is made <hi>positive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King shall be taken and accepted the onely Supream Head on Earth of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 1.</note> and have power to visit, correct, repress, redress, reform,
restrain, order, and amend, all such errours, heresies, abuses, offences, contempts,
and enormities, as by any manner of Spiritual Authority, or Jurisdiction, ought
or may lawfully be reformed.</p>
               <p>Which in the Preamble is said to be made to <hi>confirm what the Clergie in
their Convocation formerly had recognized.</hi> The corpse of this Act is to
secure the King's Title, the King's Power, and the King's Profit. As
touching the King's <hi>Title,</hi> it is said, <hi>that in right it did formerly belong
to him;</hi> which is to be granted by all, so far as the power is rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
But as touching the King's <hi>Profit,</hi> it cannot be said that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64112:175"/>
whole lump thereof did belong to the King, because much thereof was
not so ancient, but, <hi>De novo,</hi> raised by the Pope's extortion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the true and real profits are by particular Acts of Parliaments ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in special words devolved upon him. The nature of this power is
laid down in this Statute under a threefold expression.</p>
               <p>First, It is a <hi>visitatory,</hi> or a reforming power, which is executed by
enquiry of Offences against Laws established, and by executing such
Laws.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is an <hi>ordinary Jurisdiction;</hi> for it is such as by any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Authority may be acted against Irregularities: And thus the Title
of <hi>Supream Ordinary</hi> is confirmed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is such a power as must be regulated by Law, and in such
manner as by any Spiritual Authority may lawfully be reformed. It is
not therefore any absolute <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> for that belongs onely to the
Supream Head in Heaven. Nor is it any <hi>Legislative Power;</hi> for so the
Law should be the birth of this power, and his power could not then be
regulated by the Law: nor could every Ordinary execute such a power;
nor did <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth ever make claim to any such power, though he
loved to be much trusted.</p>
               <p>Lastly, This Power was such a Power as was gained formerly from the
King by Forein Usurpation, which must be intended <hi>De rebus licitis,</hi> and
once in possession of the Crown, or in right thereto belonging according
to the Law. For the King hath no power thereby to confer Church-livings
by Provisorship, or to carry the Keys, and turn the infallible Chair
into an infallible Throne. In brief, this power was such as the King hath
in the Commonwealth; Neither Legislative, nor Absolute in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but in order to the Unity and Peace of the Kingdom. This was
the Right of the Crown which was ever claimed, but not enjoyed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the <hi>English</hi> Scepter was able to match the <hi>Romish</hi> Keys. And
now the same being restored by Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> H. 8. c. 10. 35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> is also confirmed by
an Oath enjoyned to be taken by the people, binding them <hi>to acknowledge
the King under God supream head on earth of the Church of</hi> England,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 3.</note> Ireland,
<hi>and the Kings Dominions, in opposition to all forein Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, by a Law which bound all the people to maintain the Kings
Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland,
<hi>in Earth the supream Head,</hi> under the peril of <hi>Treason,</hi> in every one that shall
attempt to deprive the Crown of that Title.</p>
               <p>We must descend to particulars; for by this it will appear that these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Laws concerning the Kings refined Title, contained little more than
matters of Notion, otherwise than a general bar to the Popes future inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests:
And therefore the Wisdom of the State (as if nothing had been
already done) did by degrees parcel out by several Acts of Parliament the
particular interests of the Popes usurped Authority, in such manner as to
them seemed best.</p>
               <p>And first, concerning the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in Church-Government. It
cannot be denied but the Pope, <hi>De facto,</hi> had the power of a Negative vote
in all Councils; and unto that had also a binding power in making Laws,
Decrees, and Decretals out of his own breast: but this was gotten by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
he never had any right to headship of the Church, nor to any such
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64112:175"/>
Power in right of such preferment; nor was this given to the King as
Head of the Church, but with such limitation and qualifications, that it is
evident it never was in the Crown, or rightly belonging thereto.</p>
               <p>First, Nigh three years after this Recognition by the Clergy in their
Convocation,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> it is urged upon them and they pass their promise, <hi>In verbo
Sacerdotii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, It is confirmed by Act of Parliament, <hi>That they shall never
make, publish, or execute any new Canon, or Constitution Provincial, or other,
unless the Kings Assent and License be first had thereto;</hi> and the offences
against this Law, made punishable by Fine and Imprisonment: So as the
Clergy are now holden under a double Bond; one the honour of their
Priesthood, which binds their Wills and Consciences; the other the Act
of Parliament, which binds their powers, so as they now neither will nor
can start. Nevertheless, there is nothing in this Law, nor in the future
practice of this King, that doth either give or assert any power to the
King and Convocation to bind or conclude the Clergy or the People,
without an Act of Parliament concurring, and inforcing the same. And
yet what is already done, is more than any of the Kings Predecessors ever
had in their possession.</p>
               <p>A second Prerogative was a definite power in point of Doctrine and
Worship.<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 26.</note> For it is enacted, <hi>that all Determinations, Declarations, Decrees, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
Resolutions and Ordinations according to Gods Word, and Christs
Gospel, by the Kings Advice and Confirmation by Letters-patent under the
Great Seal, at any time hereafter made, and published by the Archbishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and Doctors now appointed by the King, or the whole Clergie of</hi> England,
<hi>in matters of the Christian Faith, and lawful Rites and Ceremonies of the
Same, shall be by the People fully believed and obeyed, under penalties therein
comprised: Provided that nothing be done contrary to the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of this Realm.</hi> A Law of a new birth, and not an old Law newly
revived or restored. This the present occasion, and the natural constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, do fully manifest. The occasion was the present perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity
of the people; for instead of the Statute <hi>Ex officio,</hi> which was now
taken away,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 14.</note> the <hi>Six Articles,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Six-Stringed Whip,</hi>
were gotten into power by a more legal and effectual Original. The
Parliament had heard the cries of the People concerning this; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two things to eye at once;<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 14.</note> one to provide for the Peoples Liberty,
and further security against Foreign pretensions; the other (which was
more difficult) for the liberties of the Consciences of multitudes of men
of several Opinions (which could not agree in one judgement, and by discord
might make way for the <hi>Romish</hi> party to recover its first ground.) And
finding it impossible for them to hunt both games at once, partly because
themselves were divided in opinion, and the bone once cast amongst them
might put their own co-existence to the question; and partly because the
work would be long, require much debate, and retard all other affairs of the
Commonwealth, which were now both many and weighty: In this troubled
wave, they therefore wisely determine to hold on their course in that work
which was most properly theirs, and lay before them. And as touching this
matter concerning Doctrine, they agreed in that wherein they could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<hi>viz.</hi> To refer the matter to the King and persons of skill in that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Religion; to settle the same for the present, till the Parliament had
better leisure, the people more light, and the minds of the people more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the way. Thus the Estates and Consciences of the people for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64112:176"/>
the present must endure, <hi>In deposito</hi> of the King and other persons, that a
kind of <hi>Interim</hi> might be composed, and the Church for the present
might enjoy a kind of twilight, rather than lie under continual darkness,
and by waiting for the Sun-rising, be in a better preparation thereunto.
For the words of the Statute are, That all must be done without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
respect or affection to the <hi>Papistical</hi> sort, or any other Sect or Sects
whatsoever. Unto this Agreement both parties were inclined, by divers
regards. For the <hi>Romanists,</hi> though having the possession, yet being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their strength to hold the same, if it came to the push of the Pike,
in regard that <hi>the House of Commons wanted Faith,</hi> as the Bishop of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
was pleased to say, in the House of Lords; and that liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
was then a pleasing Theme, as well as liberty of Estates, to all
the People.</p>
               <p>These men might therefore trust the King with their interests, having
had long experience of his Principles; and therefore as <hi>Supream Head,</hi>
they held him most meet to have the care of this matter: for still this
Title brings on the Van of all these Acts of Parliament. On the other
side, that party that stood for Reformation, though they began to put up
head, yet not assured of their own power, and being so exceedingly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with the <hi>six Articles,</hi> as they could not expect a worse condition,
but in probability might find a better; they therefore also cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon the King,<note place="margin">Sleidan. lib. c. Anno 1535.</note> who had already been baited by the <hi>German</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Divines, and the outcries of his own People; and possibly might
entertain some prejudice at length, at that manner of Worship, that had
its original from that Arch-enemy of his Head-ship of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> Nor did the issue fall out altogether unsuitable to these expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations:
For the King did somewhat to unsettle what was already done,
and abated in some measure the flame and heat of the Statute, although
nothing was established in the opposite thereto, but the whole rested
much upon the disposition of a King subject to change.</p>
               <p>As touching the constitution of this Law; that also shews that this was
not derived from the ancient Right of the Crown now restored, but by the
positive concession of the People in their representative, in regard it is not
absolute, but qualified and limited diversly.</p>
               <p>First, This power is given to this <hi>King,</hi> not to his Successors; for they
are left out of the Act, so as they trusted not the King, but <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, and what they did was for his own sake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They trusted the King, but he must be <hi>advised by Counsel of
men of skill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They must not respect any Sect, or those of the Papistical sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All must be according to Gods Word, and Christs Gospel.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, <hi>Nothing must be done contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm.</hi> And thus though they trusted much, yet not all, nor over-long.
For it was but a temporary Law, and during the present condition of
affairs. Nor did the King or People rest upon this Law; for within three
years following, another Law is made to confirm what was then already
done by the King;<note place="margin">34 &amp; 35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> and a larger power granted to the King, <hi>to change and
alter as to his Wisdom shall seem convenient.</hi> Thus the Kings Injunctions
already set forth were established, all opposal to them inhibited;
and the King hath a power of Lawing and Unlawing in Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to stab an Act of Parliament in matters of highest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And the reason is, the King will have it so, and who dares gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64112:176"/>
it? as <hi>Cranmer</hi> said, <hi>The King loves his Queen well, but his own opinion
better:</hi> For new things meeting with new love,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> if it be once interrupted
in the first heat, turns into a displeasure as hot as the first love. Nor had
either party great cause to boast in their gainings; for none of them all
had any security, but such as kept close to a good Conscience.</p>
               <p>All this, though much more than any of his Predecessors ever attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was nevertheless not enough till his Title was as compleat. The Pope
had fashioned him one now above twenty years old, for his service done
against <hi>Luther,</hi> and others of that way, and sent it to him as a Trophee
of the Victory; this was, <hi>Defender of the Faith;</hi> which the King then
took kindly, but laid it up till he thought he had deserved it better; and
therefore now he presents it to the Parliament;<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 3.</note> who by a Statute annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for ever now made triple, by the Royali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of that of <hi>Ireland</hi> amongst the rest.</p>
               <p>A third Prerogative concerned the Kings power in temporal matters.
And now must <hi>England</hi> look to it self; for never had <hi>English</hi> King the
like advantage over his People as this man had. His Title out-faced all
question; left rich by his Father, trained up in the highest way of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
absolute Lord of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, and of their Interest in the
People; of a vast spirit, able to match both the Emperour and <hi>French</hi>
abroad, and yet more busie at home than all his Predecessors. A King
that feared nothing but the falling of the Heavens; the People contrarily
weary of Civil Wars, enamoured with the first tastes of Peace and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
whiles as yet it was but in the blushing child-hood, over-awed by
a strange Giant, a King with a Pope in his belly; having the Temporal
Sword in his hand, the Spiritual Sword at his command. Of a merciless
savage nature, but a word and a blow, without regard even of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-Companions;
What can then the naked relation of a Subject do
with such an one? if Providence steps not in, and stops not the Lions
mouth, all will be soon swallowed up into the hungry maw of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
To set all on work, comes <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> from his Embassage
to the Emperour: sad apprehensions are scattered, that the motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
are exceeding violent and sudden; that the Emperour and <hi>French</hi>
King are fast in nothing, but in change according to occasion; that like
the Eagle they make many points before they stoop to the Prey; that
if the motions at home do wait upon debates of Parliament, things must
needs come short in execution, and the affairs of this Nation extreamly
suffer. A dangerous thing it is, that the King should be at disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
either with the <hi>Emperour</hi> or <hi>French King,</hi> for want of power in these
cases of sudden exigencies, and for some small time, during the juncture
of these important affairs, that seeing likewise at home the point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Religion is coming to the Test, the minds of men are at a gaze;
their Affections and Passions are on their Tiptoes. It is reason the King
should steer with a shorter Rudder, that this care might meet with every
turn of Providence, which otherwise might suddenly blow up the Peace
and good Government of this Nation. These and the like represented a
fair face to that which followed, and made way for the King without shame
to ask what no King before him suffered ever to enter into conceit, I mean
a <hi>Legislative power,</hi> to this effect, <hi>That Proclamations made by the greater
part of the King for the time being,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and his Council, whose names hereafter
follow, with such penalties as by them shall be thought meet, shall be of equal
force by an Act of Parliament, provided it shall not extend to the forfeiture
of Estates or Priviledges, nor to loss of Life</hi> (but in cases particularly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64112:177"/>
mentioned in the Law) <hi>Provided no Proclamation shall cross any Statute, or
lawful or laudable Custom of this Realm.</hi> All which at length comes to be
demanded by a formal Bill, with as ill-favoured a Preface as the matter
it self; which was much worse, e're it was well liked in the House of
Commons; and when all was done, proved a Bare still. Whatever it
was, it passed in manner abovesaid, neither much to the desire of the
<hi>Commons,</hi> that so much was given; nor to the good liking of the <hi>King,</hi>
that there was no more: For instead of a Legislative power, which he
grasped at for himself, he received it in common with his Council; and
so becomes engaged neither to alter nor destroy that Brotherhood, if he
intended to reap any fruit of this Law; leaving the point in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Gain or Loss was the greater. For this Law, thus made for this
King, these Counsellors, and these times and occasions, can be no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the future, unless to inform Kings that the Parliament hath a
power to give more Authority and Prerogative to Kings than they or
the Crown have by common Right; and to give it with such limitations
and qualifications as seemeth good to them.</p>
               <p>And secondly, That even <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth acknowledged that the
<hi>Legislative power</hi> was not in the Crown; nor was the Crown capable
thereof, otherwise than it was conferred by the Parliament. Onely <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Gardiner</hi> might glory in this Atchievement, having for the present
obtained much of his ends, by perswading the King that Forein Princes
estranged from him, not so much for his departure from the Pope, as for
some apprehensions they had of his departure from that way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Worship, which they apprehend every <hi>Christian</hi> ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
And therefore if he meaned to gain better correspondency amongst
these Princes, he must engage more resolvedly to the Fundamentals of
the Worship, though he shook off some slighter Ceremonies with the
<hi>Romish</hi> Supremacy; for he knew that they were willing enough with the
latter, though the other could not go down with them. Thus did Forein
Correspondency float above, whenas the Church, as then it stood, was
underneath, and gave the tincture to every Wave. And it was holden
more safe by the <hi>Romish</hi> party to trust the King (thus attempered) with
the <hi>Legislative power</hi> in the Church-matters, than the rough Parliament,
whose course steered quite wide from the <hi>Roman</hi> shore, as if they never
meant to look that way any more: though <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of State, and of the Houshold, were by the Law Judges of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in fact, as well as the King, yet in the conclusion the King onely was
of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> All this yet further appears in the penalty; for by a
<hi>Proviso</hi> it is moderated, as to all forfeitures of <hi>Life, Limb,</hi> or <hi>Estate;</hi> and
in the conclusion extended onely to <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> unless in some
cases mentioned, and excepting offences against Proclamations made by
the King or his Successors, concerning Crimes of <hi>Heresie.</hi> For it is the
first Clause of any positive Law, that ever intimated any power in the
King of such Cognizance and punishment of <hi>Heresie.</hi> Too weak a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
it is to settle a Prerogative in the King and his Successors, as <hi>Supream
Head of the Church,</hi> thus by a side-wind to carry the Keys of Life and
Death at their Girdle; and yet a better ground cannot I find for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
of divers brave Christians in those times, than this touch of a
Law glancing by. All which passing <hi>Sub silentio,</hi> and the Parliament
taking no notice thereof, made way for the Statute 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 26. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, to come more boldly upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:64112:177"/>
This was one wound to the <hi>Legislative power</hi> of the Parliament, thus
to divide the same. Another ensues, that in its consequences was no less
fatal to that power which remained; and it was wrought by some Engine
that well saw that the Disease, then so called, grew to be epidemical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the more considerable party in the Kingdom; that the Lady
<hi>Jane Seymor</hi> (now Queen) was no friend to the <hi>Romanists;</hi> that she was
now with Child; which, if a Son, (as it proved to be) was like to be
Successor in the Throne, and be of his Mothers Religion, and so undo
all, as in the issue all came so to pass. To prevent this, nevertheless, they
fancy a new conceit, that Laws made by <hi>English</hi> Kings in their <hi>minority,</hi>
are less considerately done, than being made in riper years. And so by
that one opinion, countenanced a worse; which was, that the <hi>Legislative
Power</hi> depended more upon the judgement of the King, than the debates
and results of the Parliament: a notion that would down exceeding well
with Kings, especially with such an all-sufficient Prince as <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth conceived himself to be. Upon this ground a Law is made, to
enable such of the Kings Successors, by him appointed, as shall be under
the age of Twenty and four years when Laws by him are made,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 17.</note> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
the same by Letters-patents, after such Prince shall attain the said age
of Twenty four years. Thus the Arms of the Parliament are bound
from setling any Reformation, let them intend it never so much; a Muse
is left open for the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion still to get in, when the Season
proves more fair. The Parliament was now in its <hi>minority,</hi> and gives
occasion to the Reader to bewail the infirmities of the excellencie of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth advance of Prerogative, concerned the Executive Power in
Government of the Church. This had formerly much rested in the
Prelacy, and that upon the chief <hi>Praelatissimo</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> now there is found
in <hi>England</hi> a greater Prelate than he; the Pope was already beheaded,
and his head set upon the Kings shoulders: <hi>To him it is given to nominate
all Bishops and Archbishops within his Dominions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 20.</note> by Conge d'eslire; <hi>and
that the party once elected shall swear Fealty, and then shall be consecrated
by Commission, and invested: but if upon the</hi> Conge d'eslire <hi>no Election be
certified within Twelve days, the King shall by Commission cause his own Clerk
to be consecrated and Invested.</hi> The occasion that first brought in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
was the access of <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the See at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> for though
the Headship had been already by the space of Two years translated
from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> yet the course of <hi>Episcopizing</hi> continued the
same as formerly it had been. I mean, as touching the point of <hi>Election:</hi>
For though in their Original, Bishops were meerly Donatives from the
Crown, being invested by delivery of the Ring and Pastoral Staff;<note place="margin">Rot. Par. 17 Joh. 35 E. 1. St. Carl. 25 E. 3. De provis. 13 R. 2. c. 2.</note> and
until King <hi>John</hi>'s time, the Canonical way of <hi>Election</hi> was disallowed; yet
King <hi>John</hi> by his Charter, <hi>De communi consensu Baronum,</hi> granted that they
should be <hi>eligible;</hi> which also was confirmed by divers publick Acts of
Parliament in after-times, and now by this Law last recited; and with this
way the King was contented for the space of Six years: for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
intended by the King, was not done at once, but by degrees; and
therefore though this course of <hi>Conge d'eslire</hi> was brought into use; yet
the Parliament being of Six years continuance, (a necessary thing in
times of so great change of Policy) began this course of <hi>Election,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. vit. Cranmer.</note> by
giving the King power to nominate, and allowing of the Pope power to
grant to such his <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Pall</hi> at his own will; otherwise they should be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64112:178"/>
Consecrated by Commission without his consent. And thus at the first
the Pope's Concurrence was not excluded, though his Negative was. In
this posture of affairs, comes <hi>Cranmer</hi> to be consecrated Archbishop. And
being nominated thereunto by the King, the wily Pope knowing the
Kings aim, meaned not to withstand, lest he should lose all, but granted
the <hi>Pall</hi> as readily as it was desired; so as <hi>Cranmer</hi> is thus far Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> without all exception: yet he must go one step farther,
and take the old Oath to the Pope; which the King allowed him to do,
<hi>Pro more;</hi> and which he did, <hi>renitente Conscientia,</hi> say some, and with a
<hi>Salvo,</hi> say others; and all affirm it was done <hi>Perfunctorie,</hi> like some worn
Ceremonie, or civil Complement. Nevertheless it was not so soon tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
over; the Archbishop loved not the Office, the King loved not Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership
in this matter; and it was evident to all, that no man could serve
these two Masters any longer: an agreement is soon concluded in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to exclude the Popes Power quite out of this game, <hi>and all is left
to be done by the King and his Commissioners, by the Law formerly propounded.</hi>
In all this, the <hi>Pope</hi> is loser, the <hi>English Clergie</hi> the savers; for the <hi>Pall</hi>
cost <hi>Cranmer</hi> Nine hundred Marks: And the <hi>Crown</hi> is the great gainer;
for hereby the King got the men sure to him, not onely by their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
and submission, but also by a <hi>Statute-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly by <hi>Oath,</hi> which to make sure, was treble twined; once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their first submission in, the Kings Twentie second year, when they
had been under <hi>Praemuniri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Soon after the decease of Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> Dowager, in the
Twentie sixth year; which <hi>Oath</hi> was more compleat than the former;
containing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A Renunciation of all Fealty to the Pope, or any Foreign Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Obligation to adhere to the Cause of the King and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Disavowing of the Pope, otherwise than as another Bishop or
fellow hrother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> An Engagement to observe all Laws already established against
the Pope's power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Disavowing of all appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> An Engagement to inform the King of all Messages or Bulls, sent
from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> An Engagement not to send, or be privy to the sending of any
Message to <hi>Rome</hi> for any such purpose.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Oath</hi> was that of <hi>Fealty;</hi> which anciently was due to Kings,
and now revived, to be taken by all Bishops upon their admission. And
thus the <hi>English Prelacie,</hi> having been sworn Slaves to the Papacie ever
since <hi>Becket</hi>'s time, are now preferred to a more Royal Service; and
the pursuit by Kings after their right, being laid aside by the space of
300 Years, is now renewed, and the prey seized upon by the Lion;
who found it upon a better Title, and in better condition by much,
than when at the first it was lost: For it was upon some semblance of
Reason, that the Archbishop and Clergie gained it; but being afterwards
dispossessed thereof by the Pope, and yet without any other shadow of
Title, but the power of his own gripe, for the present he is the <hi>Occupant,</hi>
and becomes Proprietor by prescription: till now the <hi>Felon</hi> being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
the stolen Goods are the Kings in <hi>Right,</hi> and by <hi>Remitter;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Parliament by the Statute adding their Conveyance, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
the same by an unquestionable Title. Nevertheless their service
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64112:178"/>
is no less servile to this Crown, than it had been to the <hi>Romish</hi> Miter;
formerly they asserted the Pope's <hi>Infallibility,</hi> now the King's <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
They are now called by the King, made by the King, sent by the King,
maintained by the King; whatsoever they are, whatsoever they have, all
is the King's. He makes Bishops; he makes new Bishopricks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
or compounds the old as he pleaseth,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 9.</note> by a power given to <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth by Parliament. Which <hi>Oath</hi> was never in any Prince before or
after him, that I can find; so as the Crown had it not, but the man, and
it died with him.</p>
               <p>The King thus loaden with Power and Honour, above all his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
(if without proportionable Maintenance to support the one, and act
the other) must needs consume himself (as one in a Tympanie) by grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great. For though he was left rich by his Father's Treasure, yet his Zeal
to <hi>Rome</hi> in its now poor captivated condition under the Imperial power,
stirring up in him great undertakings abroad, (besides his own Pleasures
and Gallantry at home) exhausted that; and doubtless had starved these
his grand designs, had he not found the hidden Treasures of the Cells and
Monasteries; the sight whereof so rouzed up his Spirits, that he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
upon the purchase; though he knew difficulties enough to have
stopped his undertakings, if he had not resolved both against fear and
flattery. It was not done without deliberation; for the thing was felt
as a grievance before the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and complained of in Parliament
above a hundred and forty years ago, and divers times since; but Kings
either understood not, or believed not, or durst not give remedy, or had
much else to do. But now the King is beyond all his Predecessors; he
knows much, dares do more, and is at leisure. He will go as far as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
or <hi>French</hi> King, and beyond them also; but would not try maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with either, for they were all Cocks of the game.</p>
               <p>The first occasion that discovered the work feasible, was a president
made by Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> whose power was enough to dissolve some pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Cells, and no opposition made. The King might well expect the
work would be as lawful for him, and not much more difficult; or if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Storms ensued, the people that had so long complained, and felt the
burthen of these excrescences of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> would soon find out a way to
calm them: the King need do no more than speak, and the people will do.
This opened the door; but that which brought the King in, was the hold
the Pope had in this Kingdom by these Cloistered people, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
dead in Law, and dead to all Law but the <hi>Canon.</hi> And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the King's Ancestors had possessed themselves of the Cells, in the
hands of Foreigners, in times of War; and now a deadly feud is stirred
between <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and the Pope their holy Father. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cannot expect to thrive, whenas their Father is cast out of doors;
and so all must out together. Yet the manner is observable, they must
not be cast out, but must go out: the inferiour and greater part are <hi>dead
persons,</hi> have learnt obedience; they can neither bark nor bite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may sleep; and what is done, must be done with such of them as
are alive. Upon a Visitation, these are brought under the <hi>Test,</hi> and found
in such a condition, that they had better give way, and voluntarily surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than abide the Trial. Once more the smallest are picked out,<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 27.</note> whilst
the greater stand by and wonder; but either do not foresee, or (in despair
of altering the King's Resolution) do nothing but expect the sad hour,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64112:179"/>
which within Four years comes upon them all,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 13.</note> every one of them chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to surrender, and expect the King's Mercie for maintenance
during life, than adventure against the dint of his Justice and Power, and
so lose all; for they were ill befriended amongst all sorts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Thus came the personal Estate and Stock of these Houses to the
Kings immediate Treasury, and their yearly maintenance to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Crown. Which might have advanced the same well-nigh to
the value of Two hundred thousand pounds yearly, but that the King
intended to let the people enjoy the fat as well as he, that they might be
mutually engaged to maintain hold of the Prey that they had joyntly
gotten. Out of all which nevertheless the Crown had a small rent, or
service annual,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 23.</note> for the acknowledgement of their Tenure; besides the
First-fruits of Spiritual Dignities, and the Tenths; both which he formerly
had already obtained.</p>
               <p>The first whereof was but casual, and occasional in the payment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
onely at the entrance of the party into his Promotion; and which
was gained by the Pope from <hi>Edward</hi> the First;<note place="margin">Fox Mart. fol. 322.</note> although at his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Carlisle,</hi> in his Thirty fourth year, he withstood the same. This
was above Three hundred and twenty thousand pounds in the whole
sum. The latter was Annual, and amounted to above Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds. And thus the Popes Usurpations are turned into duties
to the Crown; but were much lessened, in regard that these Cells
and Monasteries were accounted amongst these Ecclesiastical Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which by their dissolution fell off in that account. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
the advancement that might by a parcimonious King have been
made of the fall of this Cedar, was such, that the Crown might have
been rendred of it self absolute and all-sufficient. But <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth was not thus minded; the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> were gotten into
a high pitch; Princes generally over-active; <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to none of them; what comes in, goes out; and he is a rare example
of that divine Proverb, <hi>As Riches increase, so do the Mouths of them that
eat;</hi> he still stands in need of his peoples Love, Purses, and Power. So
Divine <hi>Providence orders the matter,</hi> that Kings can never attain further
end of their undertakings without the aid of the people than their
labour, lest they should be too big to be Christians, and the people too
mean.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. Of the condition of the Parliament in these Times.</head>
               <p>THey are no good Expositors, that consider their Text by piece-meal
onely; nor they good Historians, that will tell you the bare Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Action, without the <hi>Series</hi> of Occasion. Such as these will speak
much of the actions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, what advancement he brought
to the Crown; and make a compleat Monarchy, wherein the King may
act what he resolveth, resolve what he pleaseth, and please what he
lusteth; whenas in truth the thing is nothing so: For though many
of his actions, in relation to particular persons, cannot be justified by
any Law: so in truth did they never proceed from any Law, but meerly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64112:179"/>
from the passion or will of the man, and connivance of the people, who
could bear that from this King, that their Ancestors would never endure
under any other. And yet in all the grand concernments of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Law kept still upon the top; nor did the King enter into any
competition therewith, or lead the way thereunto, other than by especial
allowance of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>For <hi>first,</hi> It is evident, though the King was Supream Head of the
Church; yet this was not like the head of a mad man, led by phancy,
without the Law of reason, or reason of Law; But it was defined, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed,
and formed thereby, with Qualifications and Limitations, as
hath been already expressed in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seondly,</hi> It is no less clear, that the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> rested in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and not in the King, when he was in his greatest height. For
as <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> he had no such power in Church-matters; or if
he had such a right, it was taken away by the Acts of Parliament. Nay,
when the Pope was yet possessed of this <hi>Headship,</hi> the Parliament did
determine the manner of the Worship of God,<note place="margin">4 Edw. 4.</note> in some particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
as in the keeping of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth, to the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> did provide for the observing thereof;
and to the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> it was taken away by a Statute in the time
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">15 H. 8. c. 9.</note> if the words of either Statute may be believed.
But more especially, after that this <hi>Headship</hi> was translated to the King,
the Parliament provided, that the Canons should be examined and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the King,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> and Thirty two persons, one part of the Clergie,
the other of the Temporalty, chosen by the King. And those that
shall be assented unto, and confirmed by the King, and the Thirty two
persons, or the Major-part of them, shall be obeyed, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the residue shall be void: <hi>Provided nothing shall be done against the
Kings Prerogative, or the Laws and Customs of this Realm.</hi> So as the King
had much, but he had not all;<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 15. 35 H. 8. c. 16.</note> and what he had, the Parliament gave
him by a Law, that was executory all the days of <hi>Henry</hi> Eighth, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
continuances; and was not any power devolved to the Crown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Title of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> nor by vertue of the Act of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it; but by the continual influence from the Parliament upon the
Crown, as well before that Act as after, derived upon it. The <hi>King</hi> hath
then this right of <hi>Law making,</hi> but it is with the Thirty two he hath it,
but not his <hi>Successors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> he hath it but by a derivative power from the Parliament,
and a Committee for that service. And in a word, <hi>he hath the Power, but
the Parliament hath still the Law of that Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Priviledge of the Parliament hitherto, concerneth onely
Laws concerning Church-Government. In the next place cometh to be
considered the Legislative power in point of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> which doubtless
issueth from the same principle of Power with the former. For if the
Church (which as a pillar and ground holdeth for the Truth) be the
<hi>company of professing Believers;</hi> then ought it not to seem strange, if these
in their representative do intermiddle with this Power, or rather duty.
And for the matter in fact, neither did the King challenge this Power, nor
did the Parliament make any difficulty of Conscience in executing the
same; and yet there were many Learned and Conscientious men of that
number.</p>
               <p>They therefore, as touching the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> proceed in the same way with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64112:180"/>
that formerly mentioned concerning the Discipline: And a Committee
also is by them made of the King and Learned men, to set down rules for
Faith and Obedience,<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 26.</note> and for the order of the publick Worship of God,
according to the Word of God. And these rules are confirmed by a
Statute, so as the King hath a power in the point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but it is a
derivative power; it is a limited power to himself, and not to his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
and to himself, and others joyned with him.</p>
               <p>And lastly, nothing must be done contrary to the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Parliament hath not onely a right to grant and limit
this power unto others, but also to execute the same immediately by its
self. And therefore before they granted this power to this <hi>Committee,</hi>
(whereas formerly the Pope usurped the power to be the <hi>Omega</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
of all Councils) the Parliament intercepted that to their own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
in flat opposition to the infallibility of the <hi>Roman Chair,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 H. 8. c. 14.</note> so far
as to <hi>disherize</hi> some Opinions, which by the sentence of that infallible
mouth, had been marked with that black brand of <hi>Heresie.</hi> And what
they did before this Act of Delegation to the King, and other Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
for this work,<note place="margin">34 H. 8. c. 1.</note> they did afterwards, as not concluding their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by any thing that they had so done; as may appear, by their Censure
of the <hi>Translation</hi> of the Bible made by <hi>Tindall:</hi> By their establishing
another <hi>Translation:</hi> By their ordering and appointing what persons
might read the same:<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 3.</note> By their qualifying the <hi>fix Articles;</hi> and the like.
The Parliament then hath a power which they may grant, and yet grant
nothing away; they may limit this power in others as they will, and yet
not conclude themselves. And the King by accepting this limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
must disclaim both the Original and absolute Right, and cannot claim
the same by right of <hi>Headship</hi> or Supremacie. This was one great Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
which the Parliament had from the ruines of <hi>Rome,</hi> not by way of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation,
but <hi>re-seizure:</hi> For their possession was ancient; and though
they had been dispossest, yet that possession was ever under a continual
claim, and so the right was saved.</p>
               <p>A second, that was no less fatal unto that See, was the loss of all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over Ecclesiastical persons in this Kingdom. For whereas the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had doubly rooted it self in this Nation, one way by the <hi>Regulars,</hi>
the other by the <hi>Seculars;</hi> the Parliament by the dissolutions of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> consumed one to ashes; and by breaking the <hi>fealty</hi> between
the other and the Pope, parted the other root and the stock asunder: and
thence ensued the down fall of this tall Cedar in this Nation; and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie
now left alone, must fawn elsewhere, or lie along; a posture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that rank of men can never thrive. Up again they peep, and espying
a King that loved to towre aloft, they suddenly catch hold, promising
their help to maintain his flight; and so are carried up, and like a Cloud
born between Heaven and Earth, making the <hi>Commons</hi> beholding to them
for the Kings Sunshine, and the King for their interests in the people, and
for his superlative advancement above them all. Now though the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Prelates may think their Orb above the Winds, yet were they herein
deceived. The <hi>Parliament</hi> had power in their <hi>Election,</hi> before the Pope
usurped that to himself: now that they are discharged, Kings are posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them by <hi>Conge d'eslire;</hi> but it is not by way of restitution: For
Kings were never absolutely possessed of any such power, but as <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi>
of Parliament, and by delegation and concession from them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must render an account to them, and abide their judgement when
they are thereto called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64112:180"/>
Thirdly, The Parliament had the disposing and ordering of all the
Church-Revenues, as the Laws concerning <hi>Monasteries, Sanctuaries, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries,
First fruits, Tenths, Annates,</hi> and suchlike, sufficiently manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Parliament had the power of granting <hi>Licenses, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations,</hi>
and <hi>Faculties;</hi> setting a Rule thereunto, as in case of <hi>Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</hi>
and delegating the power to Committees;<note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 13. 25 H. 8. c. 16. 28 H. 8. c. 13.</note> whereof see more in
the Chapter following, concerning ordinary Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Parliament reserved the Cognizance of all Appeals for
final Sentence unto themselves, and disposed of all the steps thereunto, as
unto them seemed most convenient. For though it be true, in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had the definitive Sentence,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 12.</note> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cases the Convocation; yet was this but by a temporary Law, and
this also granted to them by the Parliament; which took it away from
the Pope, and never interested the Crown therein, but made the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
and the Convocation their immediate <hi>Delegates</hi> so long as they
saw good. Afterwards, when they had done their work, <hi>viz.</hi> The deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the <hi>Appeal</hi> and Divorce of Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> and some other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the same hand that gave that power, took it away, and gave it (not
to the King or Crown) but to <hi>Delegates</hi> from the Parliament from time
to time to be nominated by the King; and may as well alter the same,
and settle the power elsewhere, when they please. And therefore after
the <hi>Appeal</hi> of the Dowager thus determined, and the Sentence definitive
thus setled upon <hi>Delegates;</hi> the Parliament nevertheless determined the
other Causes of the Marriages of the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi>
of <hi>Cleve,</hi> the jurisdiction of the Crown never intermedling therein. So as
upon the whole, it must be acknowledged, that however the King was
<hi>Supreme Head of causes Ecclesiastical,</hi> yet had he not the definitive sentence
in <hi>Appeal,</hi> nor <hi>absolute Supremacy,</hi> but that the same was left to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, what attempts the Parliament had met with;
partly from the designs of some great men that sought their own ends,
and partly from the endeavours of these Kings that sought their own
height and greatness above their peoples good, hath been already related:
and the utmost issue had been truly stated, <hi>viz. That the gains have come to
the Kings persons, and not to their Crown; and that therein they have put their
Seal to the Law, and made their submission to the Parliament, as touching
both their persons and power.</hi> Add hereunto, that however <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth aimed much at himself in his ends, in two other main interests
that most nighly concerned him; yet the chief gain came to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The once concerned his own <hi>Wife,</hi> which however so nighly related to
him, as next to his own person, and under the determination of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Law of God; yet was so cast upon their Sentence, as if he durst
adventure his own Soul at their direction.</p>
               <p>The other concerned the <hi>Crown,</hi> to which he ought relation above his
own person; which he laid down at the feet of the Parliament, seeking to
their power to fulfil his own pleasure. The Ball is tossed up and down,
sometimes amongst the issue between the King and the Lady <hi>Anne Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 22.</note>
another while amongst the issue between him and the Lady <hi>Jane
Seymor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 27.</note> or such as the King should nominate by Letters-Patents or last
Will. After that, to the Ladies <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to perform condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
declared by the King's Letters-Patents,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> or his last Will. The King
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64112:181"/>
then is trusted, but he hath his trust from the Parliament; the Crown is
intail'd, (as it hath been ever since <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time) but it is
done by Parliament. The reversion is in <hi>the Clouds,</hi> but the <hi>right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi>
much more. The Conclusion of all is this, The Parliament by
serving these Kings turns, turned their turns into their own.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of the power of the Clergie in their Convocation.</head>
               <p>THe Convocation of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> like some froward Children, loves
not new dressing, though it be a gainer thereby. Before the Pope
and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth were faln asunder, their masters, their minds, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r
work, all was double; their Councils uncertain, their Conclusions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow
in Production, and sleight in their Fruit and Consequence; sometimes
displeasing to the Pope, sometimes to the King, generally to themselves.
Who naturally lingering after their own interests, were compelled to feed
that bodie that breathed in them, rather than that wherein themselves
breathed; and so like hunted Squirrels, from bough to bough, were ever
well tired, yet hardly escaped with their own Skins in the conclusion.
Now <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth tenders them better conditions, both for ease and
Honour, and more suitable to their own Interest; yet they are loath to
accept, because they had been <hi>Slaves by Prescription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Formerly, they were troubled with multiplicity of <hi>Summons,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from the King, sometimes from the Pope, sometimes from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,
and always over dripped by a Forein power, that they could
propound nothing for the good of the Souls of themselves or others, but
must be blasted from without; their labours lost, their undertakings vain,
and themselves, in the conclusion, sit down choaked in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and Desires. Now they are at no man's call but the King's,
and that by <hi>Writ; Provincial,</hi> and <hi>Legate à Latere,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> must meddle no
more.</p>
               <p>Formerly, it is taken for granted, that Kings have no Vote in matters
Ecclesiastical, though themselves be interested therein; and therefore if
he will accept of a <hi>Disme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">21 E. 4. fol. 46.</note> he must accept it <hi>Statu quo,</hi> it is granted; nor
can he interpose his <hi>Dissent;</hi> nor do they much care for his <hi>consent:</hi> But
whether the King be concerned or not concerned, what they conclude
they must maintain, <hi>Vi &amp; Clavibus,</hi> although in right his Prerogative is
above theirs. Now by the Statute, the Kings Vote is asserted, and a
Negative Vote restored, and himself made as well <hi>Head</hi> of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as the Church.<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 15.</note> Nothing can pass there without his concurrence,
nor come to the consideration of the Parliament without his pleasure;
and thus the King hath a double Vote in every Church-Ordinance: One
as in the Parliament, to pass the same as an Act of Parliament, of which
I conceive the Opinion of the Honourable Judge is to be understood;
the other, as a Member of the Convocation,<note place="margin">Instit. 4 fol. 323.</note> to pass their advices to the
Parliament: and therefore he might either sit in person amongst them,
or by his Vicar, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth did by the Lord <hi>Cromwol.</hi> By the
first, the whole Kingdom was engaged: By the Second, the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely, and that as a Court onely, and not the representative of the
Clergie; because as they had a Spiritual relation, so also they had the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64112:181"/>
Common Right of <hi>Free-men,</hi> and therefore could not be bound without
the Common Consent of the <hi>Free-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As their power of Convention, and power in Vote,<note place="margin">3.</note> so their
original Right of the <hi>Law-making</hi> suffered a change. Formerly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
wholly upon a <hi>divine Right,</hi> which some setled originally in the
Pope, others in the Prelacie, and some in the Clergie. But now they
sit by a <hi>derivative power</hi> from the Act of Parliament, from which, as from
their head, they receive life and power.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They suffered some change in the very work of their <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>
for though formerly they claimed power to meddle onely with
Ecclesiastical matters, yet that notion was ambiguous, and they could
many times explicate it more largely than naturally. It is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but the matters concerning the Service and Worship of God, are of
Spiritual consideration; but that such should be so strictly deemed to
lie in the way of Church-men onely, is to bring all Spirits within the
Verge of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and to leave the Civil power to rule
onely dead Carcasses: Much less can any other thing, which by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
hath not been of Ecclesiastical Cognizance, be called Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>But to come to particulars, because generals edifie not. The <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
claimed formerly power, as originally from its self, to impose Rules
for Government upon Church-men, and Church-Officers; and upon the
Laity, so far as extended to their Service of God: And also to charge the
Estates of the Clergie; and concerning Matrimonial and Testamentarie
Causes. They claimed also a power to determine Doctrine and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
Yet <hi>de Facto,</hi> divers of these they never acted in that right wherein
they claimed to hold Cognizance.</p>
               <p>First, As touching the charging of the Estates of the <hi>Clergie.</hi> If it
was for the King's Service, they were ever summoned by the King's Writ;
yet was not their act binding immediately upon the passing of the Vote,
till the Parliament confirmed the same; and therefore the old form of
granting of <hi>Dismes,</hi> was, <hi>Per Clerum &amp; Communitatem,</hi> as by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Abbot of <hi>Waltham</hi>'s Case appears.<note place="margin">21 E. 4 fol. 45.</note> For without their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they had no power to charge any <hi>Free-man,</hi> nor to levie the same,
but by their Church-Censures, which would stand them in no stead. And
in this, the <hi>Convocation suffered</hi> no alteration, either in Right or Power, by
the change thus wrought by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As touching imposing Laws upon the <hi>Laity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 H. 6 fol. 14. Per Neuton.</note> in points of
Worship and Doctrine, it is evident, though they claimed such power,
they had it not. For when all is done, they were contented at length to
get the support of the Statute-Laws of this Kingdom, as may appear in
the particular Laws concerning the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and proceedings against
<hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ticks,</hi> setling the Popedom in the time of the great Schism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
now all Title of claim is quite taken from them, and all is left in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Legislative power of this Nation, as formerly hath been already
manifested.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As touching <hi>Matrimonial</hi> Causes, their former power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Laws concerning them, and <hi>Testamentary</hi> Causes, is now absolutely
taken away; onely concerning <hi>Matrimonial</hi> matters, they had so much
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64112:182"/>
of the Judicatory power concerning the same put upon them, as might
well serve the Kings own turn; and that was for determining the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
between himself and the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> Dowager,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c 12.</note> depending before
the Archbishop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> For the King supposed the Pope a Party, and
therefore meaned not that he should be his Judge. And thus, though the
<hi>Clergie</hi> had acknowledged the King to be their <hi>Supream Head;</hi> yet in
this he was content to acknowledge their <hi>Supremacy</hi> above him, to judge
between himself and his Queen, and in other matters concerning himself.
So as upon the whole matter, the <hi>Convocation</hi> were gainers in some
things; in other things, they were onely losers of that which was none of
their own.</p>

            <div n="30" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXX. Of the power of the Clergie in their Ordinary Jurisdiction.</head>
               <p>THose Spirits are truly degenerate, that being sensible of miserie,
cannot stir up desires of Change, although the way thereto lies
open before them: And this shews the nature of the <hi>Romish Yoke,</hi> that it
lay upon the Spirits of men, did intoxicate, and make them drunk with
their condition. Otherwise, the Usurpations, Oppressions, Extortions
and Incroachments of the Popedom upon the Bishops Sphere, and the
people under their charge, could never have provoked such complainings
amongst all sorts, in several ages from time to time. And now that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Eighth undertakes to set them free, so as they would acknowledge
his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> they all are struck dumb, till a <hi>Praemuniri</hi> taught them to
speak; and so were scared into a better condition than they would have
had, and into a more absolute Estate of Jurisdiction than they received
from their Predecessors. The Pope had now usurped a power <hi>supra-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
over all <hi>Appeals,</hi> gained the definitive Sentence to the <hi>Roman See,</hi> and
had holden this power by the space of four hundred years; and the King
finding the root of all the mischief to his Crown from abroad, springing
from that Principle, meaned not to dispute the point with the Casuists,
but by one Statute took away all <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 H 8. c. 12.</note> and determined <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi>
from the Bishops Court, in the Archbishops Court; and the <hi>Appeals</hi>
from the Archbishop's Commissarie, in the Court of Audience. So as
though in the Kings own Case, the Convocation had the last blow; yet
in matters concerning the Subjects, the Archbishop was either more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
or more willing with that trust. For though the Convocation
might have determined all, as well as the Pope; yet for dispatch sake of a
multitude of <hi>Appeals</hi> now depending at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to prevent long at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on the <hi>Convocation,</hi> that now had much to do in matters of more
publick nature, the <hi>utmost Appeal</hi> in such cases is made Provincial. This
(whether priviledge or prejudice) the Ecclesiastical Causes gained above
the Civil, whose definitive Sentences was reserved to the Parliament. And
thus is the Archbishop made Heir to the Pope, in the greatest priviledge
of a Pope; to be chief Judge on Earth in matters Ecclesiastical, within
his own Province. A trick that in my opinion much darkned the Glory
of the Kings Title of <hi>Supream Head,</hi> which the Church-men had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offered up to the honour of the Crown of this Realm. For be it so,
that the Title is in the Crown by <hi>Remitter;</hi> yet cannot the same carry
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64112:182"/>
along with it any more than a lawful power, and whether all the Pope's
former power allowed him by the Canon, or gained by Usurpation and
Custom, shall be said a lawful power, or whether the power of <hi>Review
by Appeal,</hi> shall be derived to the Crown, under the general Notion of
<hi>Supreamacy</hi> upon the Clergies submission, is to me a doubt (albeit, <hi>I must
give honour to the Judgement in Print)</hi> in regard that after the submission
of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> the matter concerning the Divorce of the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi>
Dowager,<note place="margin">Inst. 4. fol. 344.</note> came before the Pope by <hi>Appeal,</hi> and there depended, the King
himself also waiting upon that See for Justice, and a definitive Sentence
in that matter; and thereby acknowledged the Pope's power <hi>De facto:</hi>
Notwithstanding the Clergies foregoing submission; and being occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the delay at <hi>Rome,</hi> he procured this Statute concerning <hi>Appeals</hi> to
be made; whereby at one breath he took the <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> away, and
setled them as formerly hath been mentioned; all which was done two
years before the Title of <hi>Supremacy</hi> was annexed, or declared for to be to
the Crown by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as to me it appears, the power of <hi>Supream</hi> Cognizance
of <hi>Appeals,</hi> was not in actual possession of the Crown by the Clergies
submission; so was it actually vested in the Archbishop, before the Title
of <hi>Supremacy</hi> was confirmed by Act of Parliament; and so it never was
in the Crown actually possessed, much less had the Crown the same by
<hi>Remitter.</hi> For the King's turn once served by the Convocation, and the
matter of the Divorce of Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> setled, the King perceiving
the slow progress of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> the Members of the same not being
yet sufficiently tuned to the present Affairs: And moderate Archbishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> likewise foreseeing, that the <hi>Odium</hi> of these Definitive Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would be too great for him to bear; another <hi>Appeal</hi> is provided, more
for the honour of the Crown, to be from the Archbishop to <hi>Delegates,</hi>
to be appointed by the King, his Heirs and Successors; so as though their
Nomination be the Kings, yet their power is deduced immediately
from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which took the same from the Archbishop, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
it upon them.</p>
               <p>A second advantage not inferiour hereto, which the Archbishop gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of the ruines of the Popedom,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> was the power of <hi>Licenses</hi> and
<hi>Dispensations,</hi> or <hi>Faculties.</hi> In the Pope, it was a transcendent power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any rule, but what was tuned to him by the Bird in his own breast;
and was the ground of much <hi>license,</hi> or rather licentiousness in the world:
But in the Archbishop, they seem to be regulated.</p>
               <p>To be First, <hi>in Causes not repugnant to the Law of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>such as are necessary for the Honour and Security of the
King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>such as were formerly wont to be remedied at the See of</hi> Rome;
yet in truth left as much scope for the Conscience of the Archbishop to
walk in, as the Pope had in former times. A large Teather, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
priviledge than ever the Crown had; by which, although the King
himself be like <hi>Saul,</hi> higher by the Head than all the people, yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things <hi>Samuel</hi> is higher than he. The moving cause hereof is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to find out: the King had but lately married the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen;</hi> a
thing that many startled at, and the King himself not extreamly resolved
in; he would therefore have his way like that of the Zodiack, broad
enough for Planetary motion of any one that could not contain himself
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64112:183"/>
within the Ecliptick line of the Law, and so shipped over the Popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and had made a Pope instead of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
but that the man was not made for that purpose. What
the Ordinary Jurisdiction got or lost, we come in the next place to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
               <p>First, they had still their <hi>Courts</hi> and Judicatory power, but upon what
right may be doubted. Their first foundation was laid by the Civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Law, in the time of <hi>William</hi> the first <hi>Norman</hi> King; yet the
power of the Pope and Bishop growing up together, they came to hold
the power of the Keys by a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and so continued, until these
times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, wherein they have a <hi>Retrospect</hi> to the Rock,
from whence they were first hewn; and many seem to change their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and therewith therefore are in right to change the Style of their
Courts, and Title of Summons; but the times not being very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and the work of reformation but in <hi>fieri;</hi> the more exact linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
must be left to time to finish and beautifie. A greater blow
did light upon the Law of these Courts, which was left as doubtful as
the Canons; all which are now put to the question, and to this day ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
received full resolution, but were left to the Parliament to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them at leisure; and in the mean time to the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, to determine the same Lawful or Unlawful, as occasion should
require. Nevertheless, the <hi>Courts</hi> still hold on their course, according to
their old Laws and Customs, for their form of Proceedings; some say
by <hi>Prescription,</hi> yet more rightly by <hi>Permission;</hi> it being a difficult
matter to make <hi>Prescription</hi> hold against a Statute-Law. As touching
the matters within their Cognizance, the Law setled some, and unsetled
others.</p>
               <p>First, As touching <hi>Heresie,</hi> the Church-men formerly thought scorn
the <hi>Lay</hi>-Magistrate should intermeddle; but not being able to stop the
growth thereof by their Church-Censures, prayed aid of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy;
so by degrees arose the penalties of Imprisonment and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which brought the whole matter into Cognizance before the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, because <hi>no Free man might be proceeded against for loss
of Life or Liberty, but by the Laws of the Nation;</hi> and for this cause
the Civil Magistrate granted the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mag. Chart.</note> and relieved
many times the party imprisoned wrongfully,<note place="margin">Instit. 3. fol. 42.</note> or granted <hi>Prohibition</hi> as
they saw cause. And therefore it cannot be said rightly, that the sole
or supream Cognizance of this crime of <hi>Heresie</hi> belonged to the <hi>Clergie</hi>
before these times. Nor did their proceeding upon the <hi>Writ of Burning</hi>
warrant any such thing; partly because till these times the Canon-Law
was the best ground that these proceedings had, and the course therein
was not so uniform as to permit the Title of a Custom to warrant the
same: <hi>Conviction</hi> being sometimes by Jury, sometimes according to the
Canon, sometimes before the Ordinary, sometimes before the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
sometimes before the King, sometimes before special <hi>Delegates,</hi>
as the Histories of the Martyrs more particularly set forth, and no
Act of Parliament positive in the point. But the time is now
come, when nighest Reformation, that the thing is setled more
to the prejudice of Reformation than all the endeavours forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
like to the darkness of the Night, that is at the Superlative
degree when nighest break of Day. A Statute is now made, that indeed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64112:183"/>
quite blotted out the very name of the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,
<hi>De Haeretico comburendo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 14.</note> but made compleat that Statute of 5 <hi>Rich.</hi>
2. and the other of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5, both which were formerly neither good
in Law, nor effectual, otherways than by Power; and gave more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
to the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> proceedings in such Cases. For the Delinquent
might be convict before the <hi>Ordinary</hi> by Witnesses, or might be <hi>indicted</hi>
at the Common Law, and the Indictment certified to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> as
Evidence. Yet did the Parliament carve them out their work, and in
express words declared; <hi>That Opinions against the Authority and Laws of
the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>were not Heresie;</hi> and by the same reason might have
done more of that kind, but that was enough to tell all the world, that
the Parliament could define what was not <hi>Heresie,</hi> although they did not
then determine what was <hi>Heresie.</hi> And thus the judgement of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Church is called into question, in one of their Fundamentals, and the
Clergie left in a Muse concerning the rule upon which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against this crime.</p>
               <p>The Parliament, within six years after, undertakes, though somewhat
unhappily, to determine and define certain points of Controversie,
which had some relation to the Worship of God, and the publick Peace,
and declared the contrary to these determinations to be <hi>Heresie,</hi> and the
punishment to be Death and Forfeiture,<note place="margin">31 H 8. c. 15.</note> and the Trial to be before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
by Jury or Testimony of two Witnesses, or by examination in
the Ecclesiastical Court, or inquisition in the Leet, or Sessions of the
Peace. Upon the whole matter therefore the <hi>Ordinary</hi> had a particular
Power to determine <hi>Heresie;</hi> but the Parliament determined such <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
as were punishable with <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> by enumeration in the
<hi>six Articles.</hi> This was the <hi>Clergies</hi> Primer, wherein they imployed their
study, as making most for their design, and laid aside thoughts of all
other <hi>Heresies</hi> as dry notions, or old fashions laid aside, and not worthy
the setting forth to the common sale.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lesson concerning <hi>Marriage</hi> was no less difficult for the
<hi>Clergie</hi> to take out. They were put by their former Authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from abroad, and their ancient rule of the Canon-Law. With the
Kings leave they do what they do, and where they doubt they take his
<hi>Commission.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">35 H. 8. Rat. Pat. p. 15.</note> So did the Archbishop of <hi>Durham</hi> in the Case between <hi>John</hi>
and <hi>Jane Fisher:</hi> In the Kings Case, the determining part is put to the
Parliaments conclusion; and for a rule in other cases, some persons are
enabled to <hi>marry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">15 H. 8. c. 8.</note> which formerly were not, <hi>viz.</hi> Masters of the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 17.</note>
and Doctors of the Civil Law; and some forbidden Marriage, as all
Priests, by the Statute of the <hi>six Articles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 7.</note> And unto the rest concerning
degrees of Consanguinity,<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 38.</note> or Affinity, a particular enumeration is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be observed; within which <hi>Marriage</hi> is declared unlawful, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
further off are made lawful. In all which regards the Cognizance of
<hi>Matrimonial Causes</hi> is theirs onely by leave.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Residency,</hi> and Non-residency, was a Theme formerly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the Canon-Law, in which, as also in the thing it self, the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
were the onely skilful men. The rule of the Canon-law was strict
enough, considering the times, but it was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eel to the back. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
now undertakes the Cause; and though it gave, in some respects,
more liberty than the <hi>Canon,</hi> yet stood it better to its tackling, and kept
a stricter hand upon the reins, than was formerly used; and by giving a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64112:184"/>
general rule for <hi>Dispensation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 13.</note> took away all arbitrary <hi>Dispensations</hi> and
<hi>Licenses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 16.</note> which were formerly granted beyond all rule, but that of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or Gold;<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 13.</note> and made all practices contrary to the rule, damageable
to the party. Thus far concerning the matters in Cognizance; now
touching the <hi>power of the Keys. English Prelacy</hi> having laid aside the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of <hi>Rome,</hi> they put the world to a gaze, to see which way they
would go. In the innocent infancy of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> it was led by the hand by
the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and would do nothing without them; afterwards, having
gained some degree of height and strength, they entred themselves to be
Chariot-horses to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sun, till they had set all on fire. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harnest,
it is expected they should return to their former Wits; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
forgetting their ancient Yoak-fellows, the <hi>rural Presbyters,</hi> they sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the King; use his name sometimes, but more often their own;
serving him with <hi>Supremacie,</hi> as he them with authority beyond their
Sphere. They raise him above Parliament, he them above Councils;
so as they do what they list,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> let the Plebeian <hi>Presbyter</hi> will or nill; they
are the onely numeral Figures, and the other but Cyphers to make them
<hi>Omnibus numeris absoluti.</hi> Nevertheless the Canon still remains the same:
<hi>Episcopi se debent scire Presbyteros, non Dominos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Distin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 5. Esto <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. c. Ead. Dist. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus.</note> 
                  <hi>nec debent in clerum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minari;
Episcopus se sedente non permittat Presbyterum stare. Episcopi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verint
se magis consuetudine quam dispensatione Presbyteris majores.</hi> Kings
may make them <hi>Lords,</hi> but as <hi>Bishops</hi> they hold their former rank as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the Canon: as <hi>Lord s,</hi> the King never gave them the <hi>Keys;</hi> and
as <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Canon did not; yet as under the joynt Title of <hi>Lord-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
they hold themselves priviledged to get what power they can.
Two things they reach at, <hi>viz.</hi> The absolute power of Imprisonment,
and of Excommunication in all causes Ecclesiastical. The Common
Law would never yield this;<note place="margin">Instit. 3. fol. 40.</note> some Statutes in some Cases did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>First, As touching <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Heresie</hi> doth lisp some such power: of what force the same Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
is,<note place="margin">1 H. 7. c. 4.</note> hath been already observed. In case of incontinency of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
it is more directly given them by a Statute in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's
time; before which time, the Statute it self doth intimate, that an Action
did lie against them for such <hi>Imprisonment;</hi> which Law also was made use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by another in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, who gave a way to Statutes
for the punishing them at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>First, with Death, which continued for some Moneths; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found too heavy,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 14.</note> it was punished by another Law with Forfeiture
and Imprisonment.<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 10.</note> And the same King likewise gave way to a Law
for the like punishment in case of <hi>Heresie.</hi> By that Law that revoked
the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth formerly mentioned, although till Trial,
the same was bailable: And thus continued till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth.</p>
               <p>But as touching <hi>Excommunication,</hi> it was to no purpose for them to
struggle: the Common Law would never permit them to hold possession
quietly;<note place="margin">24 H. 4. c. 12.</note> but did examine their Authority, granted Prohibition, enjoyned
the Ordinary to grant Absolution where it saw cause.<note place="margin">30 E. 3. Ass. 19.</note> Nevertheless in
some cases <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth gives way to some Statutes,<note place="margin">22 E. 4. f. 29. Hil. 13. H. 7. pl. 15.</note> to allow them
this power,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 3.</note> as in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evying of Tenths. In the next place, the <hi>Prelacy</hi>
had not this Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in themselves, so as to grant it to
others; but the Parliament did dispose thereof, not onely to Bishops, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64112:184"/>
to Chancellors, Vicars general, Commissaries, being Doctors of the Law,
and not within holy Orders,<note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 17.</note> and limiting their Jurisdiction in cases con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Papal Jurisdiction; and their manner of sending their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and Citations, to draw men from their proper Diocess,<note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 9.</note> and also their
inordinate Fees in <hi>Cases Testamentary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 9.</note> The <hi>Prelates</hi> therefore might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
make great claim hereof; for generally they were still of the old stamp,
loved to have all by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and lived they cared not by what
wrong: But the <hi>Laity</hi> enclining too much to the <hi>new Religion,</hi> as then
it was termed, refused to yield one foot unto their pretentions. And so
like two Horses tied together by their Bits, they endeavour after several
courses, ever and anon kicking one at another, yet still bestrode by a
King that was joynted for the purpose; and so good a Horseman, that
neither of them could unhorse him, till Death laid him on the ground.
And thus was the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle deplumed, every Bird had its own Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the great men the Honours and Priviledges, the meaner men the
Profits; and so an end to <hi>Annates, Legatine levies, Peter-pence, Mortua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Monasteries,</hi> and all that Retinue; the vast expences by <hi>Bulls,</hi> and
<hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> to all the cares, expences, and toil in attendance on the
<hi>Roman Chair:</hi> The beginning of all the happiness of <hi>England.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. Of Judicature.</head>
               <p>THese two Kings were men of towring Spirits, liked not to see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon the Wing; in which regard it was dangerous to be
great, and more safe not to be worthy of regard. Especially in the times
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, whose motion was more eager: and there was no
coming nigh to him, but for such as were of his own train, and would
follow as fast as he would lead; and therefore generally the <hi>Commons</hi> had
more cause to praise the King for his Justice, than the Nobility had. Both
the Kings loved the air of profit passing well, (but the latter was not
so well breathed) and therefore had more to do with Courts which had
the face of Justice, but behind were for the Kings Revenue. Such were
the <hi>Court of Requests,</hi> of mean Original, mean Education, yet by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
attained to a high growth: The <hi>Court of Tenths</hi> and first-Fruits:
The <hi>Court of Surveyors:</hi> The <hi>Court of the Lord Steward of the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:</hi>
The <hi>Court of Commission</hi> before the <hi>Admiral:</hi> The <hi>Court of Wards:</hi>
The <hi>Court of the President of the North:</hi> The <hi>Prerogative Court:</hi> The
<hi>Court of Delegates:</hi> The <hi>Court of Commission of Review:</hi> Others of more
private regard: And (that which might have given the name to all the
rest) the <hi>Court of Augmentation.</hi> Besides these, there were some in <hi>Wales;</hi>
but that which concerned more the matter of Judicature, was the loss of
that grand Liberty of that Country, formerly a Province belonging to
this Nation,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 3.</note> and now by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth incorporated into the same,
and made a Member thereof, and brought under the same Fundamental
Law; a work that had now been long a doing, and from the time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third brought on to perfection by degrees.</p>
               <p>First, by annexing the Tenure of the <hi>Marches</hi> to the Crown: Then
upon occasion of their Rebellion, by loss of many of their wonted Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64112:185"/>
Afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth defaced the bounds of divers the
ancient Counties, and setled them anew, and the bounds of the <hi>Marches</hi> also,
and appointed Pleas in Courts of Judicature to be holden in the <hi>English</hi>
Tongue.</p>
               <p>And last of all, re-united them again to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, giving them
vote in Parliament,<note place="margin">Rot. Claus. 20 E. 2. M. 3.</note> as other parcel of the <hi>English</hi> Dominions had. True
it is, that from their first submission, even unto <hi>Edward</hi> the First, they
were summoned unto Parliament,<note place="margin">15 E. 2. in Dors. M. 13.</note> and had vote there; but onely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Interests of their own Country, now and henceforth they
possess one and the same vote as <hi>English men.</hi> Secondly, as Courts and
Judicatories multiplied, so some also of those that were ancient, enlarged
their Jurisdiction, especially such of them as most nighly related to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:
Amongst others the Privy Council leads the way; who now
began to have too much to do in a double capacity, one at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi>
the other at the <hi>Star Chamber:</hi> For now their power began to be
diversly considered. In their first capacity they had too much of the
affairs of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> in the latter they had too much of the
<hi>Crown-Pleas;</hi> both of them serving rather to scare men from doing
wrong than to do any man right. And therefore though some men
might seem to have some recompence, yet the greatest gain fell to the
King and his Courtiers; and thus became <hi>Majesty, or State, or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
to be more feared than beloved.</hi> What the power of the <hi>Council</hi> was
formerly, hath already been manifested, that which both these Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
in, and whereby they gained more power over the people than all
their Predecessors, was this, that other Kings stood too much upon their
own Legs; these leaned much upon the Lords, and gained the Lords to
stick close to them; and in this they had both the Kings Love, and the
Peoples Leave, who now disjoynted upon several Interests, especially that
of Religion, must be contented to let go that which they had no heart
to hold. And thus they obtained a <hi>Judicatory power</hi> over the people;
like that of great men whose censures are commonly above capacity,
and not like to that of the <hi>Peers.</hi> This was begun in <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth's
time, who taking occasion to complain of corruption and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in ordinary Trials of the Common Law, gets the people to yield to
the <hi>Council,</hi> or some of them, a power of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon Bill, or information in matters concerning <hi>Maintenance, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
Retainders, Embraceries, corruption</hi> in <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Juries, Riots,</hi>
and <hi>unlawful, Assemblies,</hi> crimes all of them of the same bloud with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which the King as much hated as the thought of his Title to the
Crown;<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> and therefore would have it feared, as much as the punishment
by such a mighty power; and a Trial of a dreadful nature could effect.
A Trial, I say, wherein both the guilty and the guiltless adventure their
whole Estates, against the edge of the arbitrary wills of great men of
unknown Interests, in an unknown way, at unknown places; having no
other assurance, how, or when to come off, but a Proclamation to tell
the people,<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 12.</note> that the King above all things delighted in Justice. A bitter
Pill this was for the people to swallow; yet it was so artificially compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that at the first taste it gave a pretty rellish, the <hi>King</hi> delights in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
the <hi>Chancellour</hi> hath his <hi>Conscience,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> brings <hi>Religion,</hi>
the <hi>Judges</hi> bring <hi>Law;</hi> so as it is probable nothing will be done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Justice, Conscience, Religion, and Law; a very fair mixture,
but that there was a Treasurer in the case. Yet the success answered not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64112:185"/>
expectation, the persons offended were many times inferiour, and their
Estates not great, the Offenders more mean, and of desperate fortunes;
for great men were too wise to try this new way, or to taste of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
Therefore within nine years the <hi>Judges of Assize</hi> are betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with all, and that Court so continued for as many years more; and
then the King marked out one crime amongst the rest for his own tooth,
belonging to the great men onely;<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 3.</note> for they are onely to commit the
crime, and to give recompence suitable to the King's Appetite. It is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of <hi>Liveries,</hi> and <hi>Retainders;</hi> a sore evil in the eyes of a jealous King,
tending to draw the inferiour sort to honour and admire, and be of the
suit of those of the greater sort; and then beware the Crown. These
therefore must be tried before the King himself and his Council, that he
may know whom he is to fear, and of whom to take heed. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is a strange power given,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 41.</note> to summon upon a meer Suspicion: To
proceed without Information: To examine the Defendant upon Oath,
and make him his own accuser: To punish according to discretion by
Fine and Imprisonment. And thus the King and his Council have gotten
a power under colour of <hi>Liveries</hi> and <hi>Retainders,</hi> to bring the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be of their Livery, or else they can suspect whom they please,
apprehend whom they suspect, put him presently to the rack of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and so into Prison, till he hath satisfied both displeasure and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and covetousness it self. Never was <hi>England</hi> before now in so low a
degree of thraldom, bound under a double knot of self-accusing, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
censure; and this out-reached, not onely in matters meerly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
tending to the common Peace, but was intruded also into matters
Ecclesiastical in order to the peace of the Church. All bound unto the
good Behaviour, both in Body and Soul, under peril of loss of all that a
man hath dear to him in this world.</p>
               <p>The plot of all this was laid by <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and was followed
by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who put that into practice. (which his Father had
in design) being led thereto by such a skilful Guide as Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi>
was, who, though of mean Birth, yet of a Spirit above a King, and equal
to the Popedom, strained the string of Prerogative to its utmost height,
and then taught the King to play thereon; which he did after his blunt
manner till his dying day. And thus though the Clergie are brought a
peg lower, and the Nobility advanced higher, yet was it the policy of
these Kings to make them all of their own Livery and Retaindership, to
keep them in an upper region, looking on the poor <hi>Commons</hi> at a distance
far below; and well it was for the <hi>Commons</hi> thus to be, till the influence
of these blazing Stars grew cooler.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of the Militia.</head>
               <p>IT may fall within the verge of Opinion, that the guilty Title of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Seventh to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> gauled his mind with jealousie,
the greatest part of his Reign. Whether it were that he had not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself so fully upon his Title by his Wife, or that as yet he feared
some unknown <hi>Plantagenet</hi> would arise and put his Crown to the question.
This made him skilful in the point of Fortification (wherein he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64112:186"/>
spent the greatest part of his Reign) not so much by force of Arms
(for he cared not much for that noise, well knowing that Peace is the
safer condition for a King that comes in by power) but principally by
way of gaining Concessions and acknowledgement from the Subjects:
a Musick that he much delighted to hear, well knowing it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
those amongst them that knew too much, and instruct them that
knew too little; and so in time he should pass for currant amongst them
all. It was no hard matter for the King to accomplish this, the greater
part of the Kindom being pre-ingaged unto his Title, and of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
depending upon him for livelihood, if he failed, they must look to
lose all. But the present occasion urged more importantly; the Title
to the Crown was already put to the question, by the pretentions of one
that named himself Duke of <hi>York:</hi> And it is now high time for the
Law to declare it self, to direct the people in such a Case. What shall
the people do where Might overcomes Right; or if days come like
those of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, wherein the Subjects should be between
Two Mill-stones, of one King in Title, and another King in possession,
for whom must they take up Arms? If for <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, then are
they Traitors to <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth: If for <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, then are they
Traitors to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. And so now, if for <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,
then they may be Traitors to the Duke of <hi>York:</hi> If for the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> then are they Traitors to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. For though the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> was said to be but a contrivance of the House of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
yet a great part, both of the great men and others, were of another
opinion; and the King himself was not very certain of his condition for
the space of six years thereby. This puts the Title of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and
that power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to the touch: at length both King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
come to one conclusion, consisting of three particulars.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That the King for the time being</hi> (whether by right or wrong)
<hi>ought to have the Subjects Allegiance;</hi> like to that of the wise Counsellor
of that brave King of <hi>Israel, Whom the Lord and his People, and all the
men of</hi> Israel <hi>chuse, his will I be.</hi> And this is not onely declared by the
express words in the Preface of the Law,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 1.</note> but also by the Kings own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
For he discharged such as aided him against <hi>Richard</hi> the Third then
King,<note place="margin">1 H. 7. c. 6.</note> by pardon by Parliament; but such as aided him being King by
declaration of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Allegiance draweth therewith ingagement for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the discharge of this Service, whereto the Subjects are
bound by Allegiance, ought not to be imputed unto them as Treason: Nor shall
any person be impeached or attained therefore. <hi>The first and the last of
these need no dispute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is more worthy of consideration, in the particular words
set down in the Statute, <hi>viz. That the Subjects are to serve their Prince
in his Wars, for the defence of him and the Land, against every Rebellion,
Power, and Might, reared against him; and with him to enter and abide in
Service in Battle.</hi> Wherein two things are to be considered, the <hi>Service,</hi>
and the time or <hi>occasion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64112:186"/>
The <hi>Service</hi> is, <hi>to serve the Prince in his Wars, and with him to enter and
abide in service in Battel:</hi> which is the less to be stood upon, because there
is a condition annexed, <hi>if the case so require;</hi> which must be determined by
some Authority, not particularly mentioned: Albeit, that whatsoever is
therein set down, is onely by way of supposal in a Preface annexed to the
Law by the King, and permitted by the <hi>Commons,</hi> that were as willing the
same should be allowed, as the King himself; both of them being weary
of Wars, and willing to admit this Conclusion, for the better security of
them both in these doubtful times. But to lay all these aside: for the Case
is not stated, till the Cause be considered; all this must be onely when
and where the <hi>King's Person and Kingdom is endangered by Rebellion, Power
or Might reared against him.</hi> So as the <hi>King's Person</hi> must be present in
the War for the defence of the Kingdom, or no man is bound by his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
to hazard his own life. And then this point of <hi>Allegiance</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
onely in defending the King in the defence of the Land, or more
particularly in defending the <hi>King's Person,</hi> he being then <hi>in the defence of
the Land;</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> him in order to the <hi>defence of the Land.</hi> So as
no man can rationally infer from hence, that the King hath an universal
power of <hi>Array</hi> when he pleases; because the King, when he pleases, may
not levy War, nor make other War than a defensive War, <hi>when the Land
is endangered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> or <hi>when need shall require;</hi> as another Statute hath it. But
who shall determine this <hi>need</hi> or <hi>danger,</hi> neither in these or any other
Laws is mentioned; either out of want of occasion, or by reason of the
tenderness of the times, wherein both Prince and People were willing to
decline the Question.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the persons</hi> that are to do this <hi>service,</hi> are to be considered
of; and although they are indefinitely set down under the word <hi>Subjects,</hi>
it may be supposed that the word is not to be taken in so large a sence, as
to comprehend all of all Ages, Sexes, Callings, and Conditions; in regard
that even by the Common-Law, some of each of these sorts are discharged
from such <hi>service.</hi> But it may seem, the King was neither satisfied with
the expressions of this first Law concerning the <hi>occasion</hi> or time of this
<hi>service;</hi> nor did he see sufficient ground, under the notion of bare <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi>
to desire more. New ways are by him found out; his <hi>Patentees</hi>
were not a few: and although few or none could ever boast much of any
cheap Purchases gained from him (for he was wont to be well paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
for his Patents, either by Money, or that which was as beneficial
to him,) yet he was resolved, that their <hi>holding</hi> should be no less advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to him, than their <hi>having.</hi> And therefore in plain words he lets
them know, that notwithstanding former consideration, upon which they
had their <hi>Patents</hi> at the first, they must fight for him,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> if they will live
upon him; and either adventure their Lives or their Benefit, chuse they
which: and if they find fault with their condition, he touches them with
the Law of their <hi>Allegiance.</hi> And thus he makes way to intimate a claim
of a more <hi>absolute Allegiance:</hi> for being to shew the Equity of the Law,
in regard of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> he tells them, <hi>That every Subject is bound by
his Allegiance, to serve and assist his Prince and Soveraign Lord, at all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
when need shall require.</hi> General words, that affirm nothing in certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet do glance shrewdly upon an absolute and universal assistance.
Then coming to drive the Nail home, it is said, that the <hi>Patentees</hi> are
bound to give their attendance upon his <hi>Royal Person,</hi> to defend the same
when he shall fortune to go in <hi>his person</hi> to Wars, for the defence of the
Realm, or against his Rebels and Enemies. (And as another Statute
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64112:187"/>
addeth) <hi>Within the same Realm, or without, and according to their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and not to depart without especial License, or until general Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dismission.</hi> In short therefore, here is a new <hi>Militia,</hi> as touching
the King's <hi>Patentees;</hi> they must attend the King's Person whither ever
the King will lead them, either within the Realm, or without; whether
against such as he will suppose to be his Enemies abroad, or if he will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
his Subjects for his Enemies at home. And this under the colour
of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> published in doubtful expressions, as if it were not meet
that <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh (that loved not to yoke himself to the Law)
should yoke his Laws under the Laws of plain Language: Or rather, that
he held it a point of Policy to publish his Laws in a doubtful stile, that
such as durst question his Laws, might have no positive Charge against
them; and such as dared not to enter into the Lists with him, might not
be bold to come nigh the breadth of them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, neither doth the glance of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in the Preface of
the former,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> nor in the body of the later Statute, any whit confirm, that
what is in them enacted,<note place="margin">1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> H. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> c. 1.</note> is done upon the ground of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> but
contrarily, whenas the first Statute cometh to the point, it startles from
the ground of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and flies to the ground of a kind of Equity or
Reason. And the second resorteth to the first as its proper ground, as
being a supplement thereunto in Cases forgotten, and so omitted; though
it may be rather thought that the King creeping up into his height by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
made the former onely as an Essay to prepare the way for the later;
like the point of the Wedge, that maketh way for the bulk and body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The truth of this Assertion will be more manifest, from the nature of
both these Laws, being limited both in regard of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>person.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>time;</hi> for both these Laws are but temporary, and to continue
onely during the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in regard the advancements
therein mentioned, as the moving Cause, are onely the advancements made
by himself. In regard of the <hi>person;</hi> for all <hi>persons</hi> that received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements
from him, are not bound thereby; namely those that come
into such Advancement by purchase for Money: Neither are Judges
and other Officers excepted persons in the said Statutes. If therefore <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
had been the ground of these Laws, it had equally bound all who
are under the Bond, and no Equity could have given a general Rule of
discharge unto such condition of men. It had likewise bound as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
and afterwards, as during this King's Reign; and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
semblance is made therein concerning <hi>Allegiance,</hi> there had been no
need of such Law, if <hi>Allegiance</hi> could have done the deed, or if the power
of <hi>Array</hi> had been of that large extent, as it hath lately been taken. In
my conceit therefore, these two Laws do hold forth-nothing that is new,
but a mind that <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh had to fill his Coffers, though his
mind would not so fill. He would have Souldiers, but they must be his
<hi>Patentees;</hi> not for any skill or valour in them above others, but he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they would compound with him for Licenses to absent, rather than
to adventure themselves; and so he might get the more Money, that
could find pay for Souldiers more and better than they were or would
be. For otherwise the <hi>Patentees</hi> might by the Statute have been allowed
to serve the King by their Deputies; which would have done the King
better service in the Wars, than themselves could have done. And for
this very purpose, much use was made of these Statutes, as well by <hi>Henry</hi>
the Seventh, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, both for <hi>Licenses</hi> and <hi>Pardons,</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in such Cases, as their Records do plentifully shew.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64112:187"/>
Secondly, Let the Claim of Kings be what they will, yet the matter in
fact shews plainly that they never had possession of what they claimed.
Both these Kings pretended a Foreign War, each of them once against one
and the same Nation, and to that end advanced to one place with their
Armies; although the one went in good earnest, the other in jest. Their
Armies were not gathered by Prerogative, but of <hi>Voluntiers:</hi> This not
onely the Records, but also the Statutes do clearly set forth. Some Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
served under Captains of their own choice; and therefore the Law
inflicteth a Penalty upon such Captains as bring not their number com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
according to their undertaking:<note place="margin">7 H. 7. c. 1.</note> other Souldiers are levied by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
by way of <hi>Imprest,</hi> which in those days were <hi>Voluntiers</hi> also, and
expecting favour from the Publick; the rather, because they devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereto, without relation to any private Captain; they willingly
therefore received <hi>Imprest</hi>-money. And of this course the State saw a
necessity, both for the better choice of men, and for the more publick
owning of the Work. For such as had been usually levied by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
were fit onely to fill up room, and make up the number; and yet
many times there was a failing in that also: and this manner of raising
the Infantry,<note place="margin">5 H. 8. c. 5.</note> was continued by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, as by the like Law in
his time may appear. As touching the levying of the Horse, although
divers Statutes were made for the maintenance of the breed of Horses,
and Persons of all degrees of ability were assessed at the finding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of a certain number of Horses; yet do none of them tell us, that
they shall find and maintain them armed compleatly for the Wars, nor
shall send them forth upon their own charge; and therefore I suppose they
were raised as formerly.<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 13.</note> These two Kings had the happiness to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the one for his shrewd cunning Head,<note place="margin">33 H. 8. c. 5.</note> the other for a resolute and
couragious Heart: And it was no hard matter to find men that loved to
ingratiate themselves, and endeavour to catch their favour, though with
the adventure of their Lives; especially if they looked after Honour and
Glory, which as a Crown, they say, pitched at the Goal of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning the <hi>Pay</hi> of the <hi>Souldier,</hi> the Law was the same as
formerly, the same was ascertained by the Statute-Law: the payment
was to be made by the Captain,<note place="margin">7 H. 7. c. 1.</note> under peril of Imprisonment, and forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Goods and Chattels;<note place="margin">3 H. 8. c. 5.</note> and the true number of the Souldiers to be
maintained and listed, under the like peril.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As touching the <hi>Souldiers service,</hi> the same course also was
taken as before; if they desert their Colours, they should be punished as
Felons, and the manner of trial to be at the Common-Law.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, For <hi>Fortifications,</hi> the power properly belongeth to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority to give order therein. For the People may not <hi>fortifie</hi>
themselves (otherwise than in their particular Houses, which are reputed
every man's <hi>Castle</hi>) because <hi>publick Forts</hi> are Enemies to the publick
Peace, unless in case of publick danger; concerning which, private persons
can make no determination. And furthermore, no <hi>Fortifications</hi> can be
made and maintained, without abridgement of the Common Liberty of
the People; either by impairing their <hi>Free-hold,</hi> or exacting their Labour,
or other Contribution; none of which ought to be done, but by publick
Law. And therefore when the Inhabitants of the County of <hi>Cornwal</hi>
were to make defence against Invasion and Piracy from the Coast of <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Britain,</hi> in regard they were a long slender County, and upon sudden
surprizals People could not so readily flock together for their joynt defence,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64112:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they obtained an Act of Parliament to give them power to fortifie the
Sea-coasts according to the direction of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and Justices of the
Peace.<note place="margin">4 H. 8. c. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Wars</hi> once begun, must be maintained at the charge of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.
If they be the <hi>Kings own Wars,</hi> he must maintain them out of
his own Treasury, till the benefit of them do prove to the common good;
and in such cases the charges have been sometimes provided before the
work, by Act of Parliament, and sometimes after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, both of them at their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times went to <hi>Boloigne</hi> with their Armies. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh with an
intent to gain profit to himself by an advantagious peace; and had his ends
therein, and was ashamed to ask aid of the people towards the charges of
that War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth went upon his own charge also with his Army, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
to the Parliament for consideration to be had of his employment
(wherein his expectation did not fail) and in his absence made Queen
<hi>Katherine</hi> General of all the Forces of <hi>England</hi> in his absence, and gave her
power, with other five Noble Personages, to take up Money upon <hi>Loan,</hi>
as occasion should require, and to give security of the same, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and raising of Forces, if need should require; as is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
set forth in the Patent-rolls of these times. Nevertheless, the War
at Sea <hi>Infra quatuor Maria,</hi> was ever reputed <hi>defensive</hi> as to the Nation,
and under the publick charge; because no War could be there, but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
must be at hand, and so the Nation in imminent danger; and
therefore the maintenance of the Navy-Royal in such cases, was from the
publick Treasury.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, if the Parliament and Common Law in all these
Cases of Levies of men for War,<note place="margin">7 H. 8. c. 2.</note> payment of Souldiers, and their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in cases of Fortifications, and of maintenance of Wars at Sea,<note place="margin">23 cap. 7.</note> and
the deportment of such as are employed therein;<note place="margin">32 cap. 14.</note> I say, if they give the
Law, and carry the Supream Directory, then certainly the Law rules in
that, which seems most lawless; and though Kings may be chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
yet they are not the chief Rulers.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="33" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. Of the Peace.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PEace</hi> and <hi>War</hi> originally depend upon the same power, because they
relate each to other, as the end to the means; and receive motion
from one and the same Fountain of Law, that ruleth both in Peace and
War. It is very true, that several Ages hitherto have been troubled with
arbitrary Exhalations; and these very times whereof we now treat, are
not altogether clear from such an air. Two Kings we have at once in
view, both of them of an elate spirit; one working more closely by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the other more openly by Command, yet neither of them preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so high as to do all, or be all in all. Peace suited more with <hi>Henry</hi>
the Seventh, than with his Son, who delighted to be accounted terrible,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64112:188"/>
rather than good; yet both of them were glad enough to be at peace at
home, and were industrious to that end, though by several means. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Seventh pretended <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> (a welcome news to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that formerly accounted nothing theirs but by the leave of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier)
and therefore sets upon the Reformation of the <hi>Sheriffs Courts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 15.</note> in
the entring of Plaints,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 16.</note> and making of <hi>Juries</hi> suitable to that present time,
wherein men of Estates were very scarce, and much of the Riches of the
Nation evaporated into the Wars both Civil and Foreign. Although the
continuance of that order concerning <hi>Juries</hi> in the succeeding times of
opulency, hath brought these Courts into contempt, and made way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
for the Kings Courts to swell in Glory, and to advance <hi>Prerogative</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he reforms <hi>Goals,</hi> as well in their number as their use. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Civil Wars, every small party of men that could get a strong
place, made the same not onely a <hi>Castle,</hi> but a <hi>Goal,</hi> and usually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
and ransomed at their own pleasure.<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 10.</note> For remedy whereof,
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh restores all <hi>Goals</hi> to the Sheriffs, saving such as hold
by Inheritance; and gives power to two Justices of the Peace,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 3.</note> one being
of the <hi>Quorum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> to take Bail in cases bailable, and Recognizances of the
Peace, to be certified at the next Sessions or <hi>Goal-delivery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, both Kings concur in providing against such disorders, as more
immediately did trench upon the publick Peace, and reached at the Crown
it self, by labouring to prevent by severe punishing; and lastly, by regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the proceedings of Judicature in such cases.</p>
               <p>These disorders were two; inordinate wearing of <hi>Liveries,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Assemblies:</hi> The <hi>first being in nature of unlawful assembly of minds
and spirits of men; the second, of their bodies and persons.</hi> Both these had
formerly been provided against; but the Judges of the Common Law,
unto whose Cognizance these Crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were holden, did restrain their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
to the rule of the Common Law, then thought to be too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
and mean for disorders that did flie at so high a pitch; and therefore
they are reduced before a higher Tribunal, as matter of State, as hath
been already mentioned.<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> The severity of punishment consisted not so
much in aggravating the Pain,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 14.</note> as the Crime; matters of injury being
made <hi>Felonies,</hi> and those <hi>Treasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Crime of <hi>Treason,</hi> at first it concerned matters acted against the
Nation; afterwards it reached to matters acted against the King; now
it reacheth even to the very thoughts and imaginations of the heart;
not onely of bodily harm to the King,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 13.</note> but of the Queen, or their Heirs
apparent, or tending to deprive them of their Title of Name of Royal
Estate.<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 13.</note> This Crime was formerly made but Felony by <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
and then onely extended to such offence committed by one of the
Kings Houshold against the Person of the King, or a Lord, or any of
the Council, Steward, Treasurer, or Controller; so as the Person of the
Queen was not then in the case, and yet then newly Crowned, and at
that instant bearing in her Womb the Royal Seed, which was then the
onely earnest of the stability and glory of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore it is
a subject of wonderment, unless it were out of extremity of Jealousie,
lest he should seem to make too great account of her Title, and thereby
disparage his own. And then is it a piece of wit, but not without weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64112:189"/>
for he that is jealous of the slightings of other men, shews himself
unresolved in his own pretensions. Now <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth not onely
raised the price, but added to the thing; and not onely putteth the Queen,
but the Prince or Heir apparent into the Case, making the same <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
So as it implieth, that <hi>English Allegiance</hi> tieth the Subject, not
onely to the safety of the Person of the King, but also to the Queen and
Heir apparent; otherwise the offence is made and declared <hi>Treason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Election of the Object is to be considered: for whether
the one or other Statute be observed, it will appear, that although the
King was the next object expressed, yet a further was intended; and that
the Crime is not intended, in regard of his <hi>natural Capacity</hi> as a man, but
of his <hi>politick Capacity,</hi> and in relation to the Common good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And this is evident, not onely from the several Prefaces of the
Laws, but also from the manner of <hi>Election,</hi> whereby the Title of Heir
apparent is taken up, and not the Eldest Son or Daughter, or these, and
not the other Children, all which are equally dearly beloved in natural
regard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though at the Common Law <hi>Treason</hi> be properly a Crime
against <hi>Allegiance,</hi> yet as in Cases of Felony crimes may be by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
made as <hi>Treason,</hi> which at the Common Law are not against the
<hi>Legiance</hi> of an <hi>English</hi> man; for this remaineth ever one and the same:
but one and the same fact may be made <hi>Treason,</hi> and unmade, by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-law,
as befel this Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by a Law within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years after; like as also in former times, one and the same fact hath
many times received the like measure.<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 18.</note> Other <hi>Treasons</hi> besides these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned, were by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth created; as Marriage with
any of the Kings Sisters, Daughters or Aunts of the Father's side, or the
Daughters of his Brethren or Sisters, without consent first had of the
King:<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 18.</note> Counterfeiting currant Money, not of the Kings Coynage, was
likewise made <hi>Treason</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who was well seen in that
Mystery or Money-trade:<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 2.</note> and the like also became of Counterfeitures of
the Kings Privy Signet and Sign Manual.</p>
               <p>And lastly,<note place="margin">22 H. 7. c. 9.</note> that horrid trick of <hi>Poysoning</hi> was reduced to this Catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
rather that the Penalty might be more terrible in the Death (which
was by boyling) than for any Tincture in the Nature of the Crime, or
in any Forfeiture of Estate.</p>
               <p>The policy of these times thus irritated against <hi>Treason,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">33 H. 8. c. 8.</note> had proved
very irregular, if the same had not been as rigid in cases of <hi>Felony.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
new ones of that kind are also dubbed; amongst which <hi>Conjuration</hi>
or <hi>Witchcraft</hi> comes first; an old <hi>Felony</hi> in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, but since
had gotten its <hi>Clergie,</hi> now well-nigh for the space of Five hundred years,
and they it; so as it never walked abroad amongst the <hi>Laity,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the favour of the Cloistered people; nor ever came before the Civil
Power, till now <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth brought it forth into its own ancient
and proper Regiment. Other crimes, being those of the season, are made
into the same degree:<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 2.</note> Such as were taking of Women into Captivity;<note place="margin">1 H. 7. c. 1.</note>
unlawful Huntings with disguises;<note place="margin">22 H. 8. c. 11.</note> malicious breaking of the Dikes and
Banks in <hi>Marshland;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 7.</note> Servants embezzelling their Masters Goods to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64112:189"/>
value of Forty shillings or upward, which (besides that of <hi>Heresie,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
formerly) though of a new stamp, yet of so good a constitution,
that they remain unto this day under the same brand.</p>
               <p>But let the Laws be never so severe, if they have not free liberty to
walk at large, they are soon ghostless; and therefore these two Kings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specally
the later, gained that Honour above their Predecessors, that they
gave the Law a free and full scope over all persons but themselves and
their Assignees, and in all places. First, concerning places, every one
knows the Notion, but few considered the extent of <hi>Sanctuary ground</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> that could <hi>sanctifie</hi> any crime or criminal person in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that though the eye of Justice could see, yet the hand of Justice
could never reach them, till <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth plundred them of all their
<hi>Sanctity,</hi> and made all places common. So as no <hi>Treason</hi> could hide it self,
but where the Act of Parliament did appoint,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 13.</note> and turned their names
from <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> to priviledged places.<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 19.</note> The <hi>sanctity</hi> of the person was
yet more mischievous and hard to be reformed;<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 12.</note> it had been often attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
before these times, with little success. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh gained some
ground herein beyond his Ancestors; the Delinquent might have his
<hi>Clergie</hi> once, but not the second time, (though he fled to the <hi>horns of
the Altar</hi>) and was ever after known by a brand in the hand.<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 13.</note> Thus far
did <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh go, and would have done more, even as far as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those in <hi>Holy Orders.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth coming on, in point of
<hi>Treason,</hi> made all persons common,<note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 1.</note> without respect of their Orders or
Profession. Death makes an equal end of all.<note place="margin">4 H. 8. c. 12.</note> In cases of Murther, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
Burning of Houses; Felonies done in holy Ground, High-way, or
Dwelling-house; refusal of Trial;<note place="margin">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> H. 8. c. 3.</note> peremptory challenge of above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Pannel; Servants embezzelling their Masters Goods in value
Forty shillings, or upwards; in all these Cases no Clergie could be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but to persons in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 1.</note> and those also to be perpetually impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the Ordinaries Prison. And yet this exception held not long in
force, but these men also were equally wrapped up in the same course, to
have their <hi>Clergie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 3.</note> and indure the brand even as other men.</p>
               <p>Two difficulties yet remain, which hindred the execution of the
Laws against <hi>Treason.</hi> One, concerning the <hi>Place;</hi> the other, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Place</hi> many times of the plotting and beginning of the <hi>Treason</hi>
befalleth to be without the walk of the Kings Writ; in which Case by
the Common Law it cannot be inquired or tried: or it may be, that the
men of the place be generally disaffected, and then no hope of finding
out the matter.<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 15.</note> In such Cases therefore it is provided, that be the crime
wheresoever the Delinquent will,<note place="margin">33 H. 8. c. 22.</note> it shall nevertheless be inquired, and
tried where the King will.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of the Delinquent also many times changed its condition;
it might be sober at the time of the Delinquency, and afterwards upon
discovery prove <hi>Lunatick,</hi> and thereby avoid the Trial; this, whether in
jest or earnest,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 2.</note> by a Statute is made all one; and it is ordained, <hi>That in
case the Fact be confessed by the Delinquent before the Lords of the Council,
at such time as the party accused was of sound mind, and the same be atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
under the hands of four of those Lords, the same shall be a good ground
to proceed to inquisition before Commissioners; and the same being found, to try
the Delinquent without answer or appearance, saving unto Barons their Trial
by their Peers.</hi> And thus however in their Fits, the Will of the <hi>Persons</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64112:190"/>
of these Kings was too hardy for the Kings to manage according to rule,
yet the Law still in Title kept the Saddle, held the Reins, and remaineth
the chief Arbitrator unto every man.</p>

            <div n="34" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Of the general Government of Edward the Sixth, Queen Mary,
and Queen Elizabeth.</head>
               <p>WE are at length come within sight of the shore, where finding the
Currents various and swift, and the Waves rough, I shall first
make my course through them severally, and then shall bring up the
general Account of the Reigns of One King and Three Governours.</p>
               <p>The King was a Youth of about Ten years old, yet was older than he
seemed by Eleven years; for he had all the Ammunition of a wise King,
and in one respect, beyond all his Predecessors, that made him King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>By the Grace of God.</hi> He was the onely Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth;
yet that was not all his Title, he being the first President in the point of
a young Son, and two elder Daughters by several venters; the eldest of
whom was now thirty years old, able enough to settle the Government
of a distracted Nation; and the Son so young, as by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was disabled to settle any Government at all, till he should pass
the Fifteenth year of his Reign. But the thing was setled in the life-time
of his Father, whose last Will, though it speak the choce, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made the Election, and declared it. The condition of this King's
Person was every way tender;<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 5.</note> born and sustained by extraordinary
means;<note place="margin">35 H. 7. c. 1.</note> which could never make his days many, or Reign long. His
spirit was soft and tractable, a dangerous temper in an ill air; but being
fixed by a higher principle than nature yielded him, and the same beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with excellent endowments of Nature, and Arts, and Tongues, he
out-went all the Kings in his time of the Christian world. His Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
provided Apparel and Victual to this Nation, but he Education; and
thereby fitted it to overcome a fiery Trial, which soon followed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>The Model of his Government was as tender as himself, scarce indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to see his Funeral; ready for every change, subject to tumults and
Rebellions; an old trick that ever attends the beginning of Reformation,
like the Wind the Sun-rising. The diversity of Interests in the Great
men, especially in point of Religion, for the most part first set these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
motion; for some of them had been so long maintained by the <hi>Romish</hi>
Law, that they could never endure the Gospel: and yet the different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
in matters of State made the greater noise. All was under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
fitly composed to the Kings mind, but ill matched with rugged,
humorous, aspiring minds; whereof one that should have been the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
great Friend, became his fatal Enemy; and though he were his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to prejudice his Interest, pawned his own blood. The other, which
was the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> had his will, but missed his end: for
having removed the Protector out of the way, and gotten the chief pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
about the King, yet could he not hold long what he had gotten; for
the King himself, after Sixteen months decaying, went into another
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64112:190"/>
world, and left the Duke to stand or fall before some other Power; which
came to pass upon the entry of the next Successor.</p>
               <p>The greatest trouble of his Government arose from the prosecution of
a design of his Grandfather, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, for the uniting of the
two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by marriage, and setling an endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Peace within this Isle: and unto this Work all were Aiders in both
Nations, but the Enemies of both. But God's ways are not as Man's; it
is a rare Example, to find out one Marriage that did ever thrive to this
end. <hi>England</hi> meaned well, in proffering Love; but the Wooing was ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favouredly
carried on, by so much Bloud.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As the Government was now tender, so was it carried with
much compliance with the People: which ever gives occasion to such of
them that are irregular, to be more; and such as are well governed, to
be less; because, though pleasing it be, yet it is with less awe and spirit:
which renders their obedience, at the best, but careless and idle; unless
such as are very consciencious be the more careful over their own ways, by
how much their Superiours are the less.</p>
               <p>NOT thus was Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Q. <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </note> but (like a <hi>Spaniard</hi>) she over-ruled
all Relations and Engagements by Design: she was about Forty
years old, and yet unmarried, when she came to the Throne; it may
seem she wanted a mind to that course of life, from natural abstinency, or
was loath to adventure her Feature (which was not excellent) to the
Censure of any Prince of as high degree as she held her self to be;<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. 1. lib. 13.</note> or
her value was not known: so as to persons of meaner Interests, she might
seem too much above; and to those of greater, too much beneath. Or
possibly her Father was loath to let the world know her Title to the
Crown, till needs must; or to raise up a Title for another man, so long as
he had hope of a Son of his own to succeed him; and yet had formerly
designed her for a Wife to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. 1. lib. 1.</note> and afterwards to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine
of <hi>France.</hi> Or it may be her self had set a command of her self,
not to change her Estate, till she saw the course of the Crown either to
or fro. However, the time is now come, that she must marry,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
her Womanhood upon an uncertain and troublesome state of
Affairs. She liked the Lord <hi>Courtnee</hi> above the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> but
feared he would not design with her. She held him not unmeet for her
degree: for she feared he was good enough for her Sister, that then also
had the Title of a Kingdom waiting so nigh her person, as she was an
Object of Hope to her Friends, and Fear to her Enemies. And yet Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> married the Prince of <hi>Spain:</hi> It may be it ran in the Bloud, to
marry into their own Bloud; or rather, she was thereto led by <hi>reason of
State,</hi> partly to enable her with greater security in the resetling of her
Kingdom in the Popish Religion, wherein she knew she had to do with
a People not easie to be reduced, where Conscience pretended Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and partly to assure her Dominion against the Out-works of the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi> designs. And so she yielded up the Supremacy of her
Person to the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> but (thanks to the Nobility) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Kingdom was reserved to her own use: for it was once
in her purpose to have given up all to the man, rather than to miss of the
man. And yet their condition was not much comfortable to either:
The Peoples dislike of the Match sounded so loud abroad, that when the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64112:191"/>
Prince was to come over, the Emperour his Father demanded fifty Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for his Sons safety during his abode in this Land; which was also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
When he was come over, the <hi>English</hi> fear the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tyranny;
and the <hi>Spanish,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bodin. Rep. lib. 6.</note> the old <hi>Saxon</hi> entertainment of the <hi>Danes.</hi> So both
lie at their close guards; as after some time the King and Queen did no
less: for the Queen was either never earnest in her affection, or now
much less; finding his Body diseased, and his Mind lingering after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
game. On the other side, the King not finding that content in
her Person (especially after her supposed Conception) that he expected,
looked to his own Interest apart from hers, and thereby taught her to do
the like. And this she thought cost <hi>England</hi> the loss of <hi>Callis,</hi> and he
<hi>Spain</hi> the loss of many advantages that might have been obtained, and
was expected from this Conjunction. Thus by the several Interests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>King Regnant</hi> and the <hi>Queen Regent,</hi> the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
became like a Knot dissolving, neither fast nor loose.</p>
               <p>Towards the People she might well be reserved, if not rigid: for she
knew her entry was not very acceptable, though accepted; and that her
Design was contrary to her Engagements: and therefore it was vain to
think to please her self, and pleasure them. Nor did she much busie her
thoughts therewith: that abominated trick of <hi>Impost upon Merchandize</hi> she
brought into fashion, which had by many publick Acts been damned for
the space of two hundred years. This was done without either shame or
fear:<note place="margin">C. 2. Instit. fol. 61.</note> for if the People turned head, she knew she had a good reserve from
<hi>Spain;</hi> and the People might very well consider of that, though for her
part she desired not much to improve that Foreign Interest; because she
might well see that <hi>Spain</hi> designed to keep <hi>England</hi> so far beneath, that
<hi>France</hi> might not get above: And that <hi>Philip</hi> neither loved the double
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> no, nor the Triple Crown at <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwise than in
order to that of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This distance between her and her King, wrought her to a more nigh
dependency upon her Council and <hi>English</hi> Nobility; and so became less
discerned in her Government; although questionless she did much, and
wanted not Wisdom or Courage to have done more, but that she was not
wholly her own Woman. All men do agree that she was devout in her
kind of Profession, and therein as deeply engaged as her Brother <hi>Edward</hi>
had been in his; though it may be he out of tenderness of Conscience,
but she out of a <hi>Spanish</hi> kind of gravity, that endures not change: and
whereunto she was well aided by her <hi>Clergie,</hi> who were her beloved for
her Mothers sake; and now also so much the more sowre, by how much
the nigher to the bottom. It is the less wonder therefore, if the Zeal of
these times burnt into a flame, that at length consumed even those that
kindled it. In one thing more, above all the rest, she acted the part of her
<hi>Sex,</hi> rather than that of her <hi>Place;</hi> and the same contrary to the advice of
her Ghostly Fathers, and all Rules of Policy, and the Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her King and self upon Marriage; which was the engaging of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the War at St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> against the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
League formerly made. Nevertheless, the Issue was but suitable: for
though the <hi>English</hi> obtained their part of the Honour of that day, yet in
the consequence they lost <hi>Callis,</hi> the last foot that the <hi>English</hi> had in <hi>France;</hi>
henceforth <hi>England</hi> must be content with a bare Title. As this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
so was it also reserved by the Queen, to make the world believe
that she died for grief therefore as a Mother of her Country; although her
bodily Disease, contracted by a Conception, wherein she beguiled both
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64112:191"/>
her self and the world, concurred thereto. In sum, <hi>the worst that can be
said of her, is this, That she was ill-principled; and the best, That she acted
according to her Principles:</hi> And so lived an uncomfortable Life, shaped a
bloudy Reign, and had but a dim Conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Night was now spent, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Q. Elizab.</note> like the Morning-Star,
rising into the Throne, sent forth the benignant Influence of both her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,
and many ways excelled them both. She was begotten in a
heat against <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein also she was born and trained up by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
and Brother <hi>Edward</hi>'s Order; and saw enough in her Sisters course, to
confirm her therein: for Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was not very Catholick in her
Throne, though she was in her Oratory. Nevertheless, Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s
course hereunto was very strange, and might seem in outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to lead her quite wide: for her youth was under a continual yoke;
her Mother dead whiles she was at the breast; her Father owning her no
further than as his Child born of a rebellious woman, never intending her
for the Crown, so long as any hope was left of any other. With her
age the Yoke grew more heavy; her Brother <hi>Edward</hi> being but of the
half-bloud, except in point of Religion, might respect her at a distance
beyond his Mothers Family. But this lasted not long; her Sister <hi>Mary</hi>
comes next, of a stranger bloud to her than her Brother was; looking
ever back upon her as one too nigh her heel, and more ready to tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Train than support it. The difference in Religion between them
two, added yet further Leven; and this occasioned from her Sister to
her, many sowre reflections, bitter words, harsh usage, concluding with
Imprisonment, and not without danger of Death. All which Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>
saw well, made the less noise in Religion, walked warily, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with patience to endure the brunt: For she might perceive by her
Father's Will, that her way to the Crown, if ever she arrived at the end,
must be through a Field of Bloud; and though she knew her change of
Religion might make the way more plain, yet God kept her in a patient
waiting, until the set time was come. Thus passing over her Minority
with little experience of youthful Pleasures, she had the happiness to have
the less sense of youthful Lusts; which meeting with natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the larger size, rendred her the goodliest Mirrour of a Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
that ever the Sun shone upon; God adding thereto both Honour and
Continuance, above all that ever sate in that Throne. Her entrance was
with more joy to others than her self; for she kept her pace as treading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Thorns, and was still somewhat reserved, even in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
though she was known to be devout. She had observed, that the
hasty pace, both of her Brother and Sister, brought early Troubles, before
either of them were well setled in their Throne. And therefore whereas
her Sister first set up the Mass, and then endeavoured to settle it by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
she contrarily first caused the point to be debated, and thereby gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
liking to lay it aside. It is true, the Moderatorship in that Dispute,
was imposed upon a <hi>Lay-man</hi> (as their term is) but his work being to hold
the Disputants to order in debate, and not to determine the point in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
(which thing was left to the Auditory) might therefore more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
be done by him, than censured by an Historian, that shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to judge them all.</p>
               <p>The first step thus made, one made way for another, till the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
levened. Her proceedings against Opposers were with much leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
rather overlooking, than looking on; and such as stood more directly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64112:192"/>
in her Path, she would rather set aside than trample down; and be fair
to all (without respect to difference of Religion) that would be fair to
her.<note place="margin">Forcat. de Gal. imp. l. 7.</note> Much of her happiness depended upon Election of her Council,
more in observing their advice; that whether she did rule, or were ruled,
or did rule by being ruled, might deserve some consideration. This she
did, to give satisfaction to such as took prejudice at her Sex, rather than
out of any sense of imbecility in her own Intellectuals: for therein she
equalled the best of her Predecessors, and in learned Endowments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them all. Generally she was of a publick mind, if not popular;
she loved to be seen of the People, and yet kept her distance. Her Sex
taught her to use her Tongue much,<note place="margin">Quint, lib. 1. cap. ult.</note> and her Education to use it well
and wisely: That, with a reserved Carriage, was her Scepter, winning
thereby Applause from the inferiour sort, and Awe from the greater. A
wise man that was an Eye-witness of many of her Actions, and of those
that succeeded her, many times hath said, <hi>That a Courtier might make a
better Meal of one good Look from her, than of a Gift from some other King.</hi>
Another Felicity she had beyond others of her place; <hi>She loved not to be
tied, but would be knit unto her People.</hi> To them she committed her
confidence under God, and they to her their chiefest Treasure on Earth,
<hi>viz.</hi> Their hearts to her Parliament, which was the most considerable
Party that she had to deal with. She could personate Majesty equal to
any Emperour; and advise, commend, yea, and chide if she saw occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And yet ever had a trick to come off with a kind Conclusion,
without blur of Honour. So as of thirteen Parliaments called during
her Reign, not one became abortive by unkindness; and yet not any one
of them passed without <hi>Subsidy</hi> granted by the People, but one wherein
none was desired. And sometimes the <hi>Aid</hi> was so liberal, that she refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the one half,<note place="margin">Bodin. rep. l. 6.</note> and thanked the People for the remnant; a Courtesie
that rang loud abroad, to the shame of other Princes. She would often
mention her <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and yet not hold her self wise enough, either to
interrupt the Judges in their way, nor the Bishops in theirs: Albeit, she
spared not also, as she saw occasion, to check the best of them for their
Irregularities. She had no Beloved, yet entertained Favourites at a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
rate, and in better order, than Kings use to do. For she had a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
within her power beyond the reach of them all, and Passion also
soon at command, or rather sometimes beyond command; yet if calmly
taken, it ever proved good for that Party (that suffered) in the conclusion.</p>
               <p>However, her love she held under her own power, and therein excelled
her Forefathers. She had the Precedent of her Sister (that adventured
upon a Prince for her Bed, and missed what she expected, and lost what
she had) and thereby learned to call into question the possibility for her to
gain the private Contentments of a married Life, and therewith maintain
her publick Interest in the Kingdom; and therefore resolved rather to
sit alone, than to sit below; and to refuse the help of any Consort, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to part with any one jot of her Interest in the People. So she
remained above the People and her self, and thereby enjoyed both. But
Custom in Government growing, together with Infirmities of Age,
made her <hi>Regency</hi> taste somewhat stale and spiritless, and gave occasion
to mens minds to wander after the next Successor. Before she had been
nine years Queen, this scrutiny was once begun; but it received a fair
answer of delay, because it was then taken as done in love: now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
hereof, according to her age, are more fad; she thinks them
weary of her, and thereupon she is weary of her self and them. She sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64112:192"/>
she can no longer give them content; the Lords have the power,
they will not be ruled: and such like dark thoughts working upon an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
body, weakned with other infirmities, wasted her spirits, and hastned
a conclusion unto a weary life, her self not unwilling herewith, and her
Courtiers less; who expecting more from Successors than they find, lived
to dis-desire and unwish their former choice, by late repentance. Thus
making the ending of her days, she renewing of her Reign in the hearts of
all that observed her alive, or consider her (now dead) in the written Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
of her Fame.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. Of the Supreme Power during these Times.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> but erewhile monstrous in the two former
Kings times for Greatness, now suffers as great a diminution, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-shadowed
by <hi>Infancy, Womanhood,</hi> and <hi>Coverture;</hi> and gives the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
breath to beware for the future, <hi>Ne potentes si nocere velint non possent.</hi>
Nevertheless, the loss was onely of the Hydropical humour, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
came forth more clearly like it self. In the point of <hi>Infancy,
Edward</hi> the Sixth bears it forth, being the seventh President of Infancy
ruling under Protectorship since the <hi>Norman</hi> times; yet beyond all the
rest in managing his Supremacy in Church-matters, which none of them
all did ever engage upon before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>English</hi> Prerogative and Supremacy, are Notions of a sublime nature,
and commonly looked upon as the Holy Mount at the delivery of the
Law, at a great distance, for fear of death or undoing; and yet it is such a
thing as a child may handle without hurt done either to the Estates, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or Consciences of any man; because it is presupposed he does nothing
but what the Law first dictates by his Council unto him. There is then
no <hi>Infancy</hi> in the Crown, though in the Person, because the wisdom of the
Crown is not intended to rest in one Person, but in the Counsels of many,
who are equally wise, whether the Person of the King be old or young.
And the Statutes made by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 17.</note> by which this King had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by his Letters-patents, after the age of 24 years, to adnul any Act of
Parliament made by him before that time, was not grounded either upon
Principles of Law, or general Reason of State; but upon some particular
circumstances of the state of the Affairs, as then they stood: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is this power limited onely to such Heirs or Assignees of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, to whom the Crown shall come by his appointment. Nor did it
ever thrive to that desired end whereto it was intended: for upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, the Councils changed,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. c. 12.</note> and the Parliament took
this Statute away, as scandalous to the Fundamental Government of
the Nation, and instead of the power of Adnulling, allowed of the power
of Repealing; yet so, as until such time of <hi>Repeal,</hi> the said Statutes, and
all Acts thereupon done, shall for ever be deemed warrantable and good.
This was too much, but that the Times were yet in <hi>Equilibrio,</hi> and
men were loath to part with their Interests, which they did hang upon
that Power of Reserve, unto the King's Letters-patents. Yet in that
the Power is limited, not onely in regard of the manner and time, but of
the persons, and also of the Statutes that are to be repealed: it is sufficient
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64112:193"/>
to vindicate the nature of this Prerogative (if such it were) to be no
ways inherent, but acquired by Concession. But as touching the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
Power, they would not trust it in the least manner to any other
King.</p>
               <p>The Parliament had crowned Proclamations at the instance of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> H. 8. c. 8.</note> with that Royal Title of Laws, in manner as formerly hath
been noted. Now all Interests, both of the <hi>Popish,</hi> and of the <hi>reformed</hi>
parties of this Nation, are against it; the former, because they saw the King's
present way to be against them; and both it and the latter, because the thing
it self was abominable unto the Liberties of the people, and therefore it is
soon taken away by <hi>Repeal,</hi> and the Legislative Power is wholly re-assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to themselves,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. c. 12.</note> as formerly. For though in matters Ecclesiastical,
the Power of the Crown might seem to be more pre-eminent in regard
of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 E. 6. c. 22.</note> and some particular powers in making Bishops by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
without <hi>Conge d'eslire;</hi> yet did the Parliament neither yield or
acknowledge any <hi>Legislative power</hi> to be in the Crown thereby, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
on in that way of the thirty and two Commissioners formerly
agreed upon by them, in the time of the King's Father. Thus the King,
though an Infant, was a gainer,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; 4 E. 6. c. 11.</note> and the Crown nevertheless still the
same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Crown that may be worn by an Infant, may much
rather be worn by a Woman, whose natural endowments do far exceed the
other, and are not inferiour unto the most of men. Of this we have
two Examples in these times, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
professions in matters of Religion, and liable to exceptions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their Sex, by men of the counter-profession on both sides; yet
both upheld the Honour of the Crown, though therein the one more
especially, being neither ingaged in the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause, nor in the Estate
of Marriage, as the other was. This was Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in person
a Woman, but in mind endowed with all the perfections of a man: she
could not endure to abate one hairs breadth of her State; and yet upon
the sole regard of her Sex, she submitted her Title of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> to a
more moderate name of <hi>Supream Governour,</hi> whereas her Father would
be called <hi>Supream Head;</hi> as if it were not onely hazardous, but hideous
for a Woman to be Supream Head of the Church.<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 1.</note> And for this cause
would she not receive that Statute made by her Father, and continued by
her Brother <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and repealed by her Sister Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
Nevertheless such as she was,<note place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 1.</note> she had all such Jurisdictions, Priviledges,
Superiorities, and Pre-eminencies, Spiritual or Ecclesiastical, as by any
Ecclesiastical Power or Authority formerly had been, or might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
exercised for visitation of the Ecclesiastical State and Persons, and
for Reformation, Order, and Correction of the same, and all manner of
Errours, Heresies, Schisms, Abuses, Offences, Contempts, and Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
She had therefore neither absolute Empire, nor absolute Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
over the Churches; neither power to make, declare, alter, or repeal
any Law; neither did she ever exercise any such power but onely by Act
of Parliament.<note place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 3.</note> She had a Power over Ceremonies in the Worship of
God, which was given her by the Parliament to execute by advice, and
therefore was limited; as also was all the remainder of her Power in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
Ecclesiastical. For she could do nothing in her own person,
but by Commission; and these Commissioners must be Natives and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizons,
not Foreigners; and the same to be but in certain Cases, and with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64112:193"/>
certain Process.<note place="margin">13 Eliz. c. 12.</note> Some Cases of Ecclesiastical Cognizance were referred
to Trial at the Common Law,<note place="margin">23 Eliz. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Such as concerned the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in cases of Forfeiture and Imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Neither had the Queen, nor her Commissioners, nor Bishops,
absolute power over the <hi>Church-Censures;</hi> no Censure was regarded but
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> and that no further than in order to the Writ <hi>De Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato
capiendo;</hi> and in all Cases the same was to be regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Statute in that case provided,<note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 23.</note> or by the Common Law in
case of Action. In all which we find no Jurisdiction in Cases Ecclesiastical,
that is absolutely setled in the Crown. In matters Temporal the thing is
yet more clear; she never altered, continued, repealed, nor explained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Law, otherwise than by Act of Parliament, whereof there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Examples in the Statutes of her Reign; and what she did by
her Judges, was ever under Correction. A Woman she was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could be no Judge, much less in the Cases of difference concerning
her self and her Crown.<note place="margin">18 Eliz. c. 8.</note> A Queen she was, and might make Judges, but
she must go according to the Law: new Judicatories she could make
none; nor judicially make, declare, alter, or determine the power of any
Court or Judge in case of difficulty, but by her Parliament. As in the
cases concerning the power of the Lord-Keeper, the powers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of <hi>Sewers</hi> and charitable uses, the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 18.</note> and
the County-Courts, in the several Statutes concerning the same,<note place="margin">13 Eliz. c. 9.</note> may
more fully appear.<note place="margin">39 Eliz. c. 6.</note> And which is yet of a meaner size, her Power exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to redress any inconvenience in process of Errour or Delay in
Courts of Law,<note place="margin">18 Eliz. c. 12.</note> nor to remedy Errours in Judgement,<note place="margin">43 Eliz. c. 4.</note> Fines, Recoveries,
Attainders, or other matters of Record or Trial, whereof the Statutes
of her time are full, and also the opinions and judgements of the Judges
of the Common Law concurring therewith. I mention not the power
of Life and Member, which without all contradiction hath ever been
under the protection of the known Law. So as upon the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it will be evident, that this Queen had no absolute Pre-eminence
in all cases, but either in contradiction to Foreign power, or the power
of any particular person, and not in opposition to the joynt interest of
the Representative of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> comes next, although a Woman as well as she, yea, her
elder Sister and Predecessor, yet came short of her in the point of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
by a double submission, both unto the Law of a Husband, and
of a Foreign power in Cases Ecclesiastical; although the same was with
such qualifications, as it was much more in Title and pretence than in
reality; and so in the conclusion, neither approved her self to be good
Wife, good Catholick, nor good Queen. She could be no good Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was too great for her Husband within the Realm, and resolved
not to be without. A Catholick she was, but the worst that ever held
her place: her Father appeared what he was, spake plain <hi>English,</hi> and
was easily discerned. But she told the Pope a fair Tale of disclaiming
Supremacy, and reconciling her Kingdom; yet none of her Predecessors
did go beyond her in irregularity of her proceedings. Before ever she
called Parliament, she setled the great work of Reformation, or rather
Deformation in the Worship of God, by single Proclamation; and not
onely took away the Partition-wall of Doctrine by the like power, but
gave way and power to Persecution thereupon to arise, before any

                  </gap> in their Process that Clause of <hi>Regia Autoritate fulcitus</hi>
yet even these Instructions had no other Authority than her own. And
nevertheless, she still inforced the Execution of all matters concerning the
publick Worship of God, and Government of the Church, when as yet
the Pope had no admittance unto his ancient claim. It is very true, that
the Pope long ere now had made a fair offer, and the Queen had lent her
ear; but her Train was too great to move as fast as was pretended; so as
no meeting could be had till the Queens Marriage with <hi>Spain</hi> was past;
and such as were disaffected, found it was bootless to stop the Current
of two such mighty Streams of Power now joyned into one: and so
that unclean spirit returned seven times worse than when he went out,
and took <hi>Seisin,</hi> meerly upon Repeal of the Laws made by <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, in the Negative, without farther Grant or Livery. For though
an express Embassage was sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to perform the solemnity of
the submission; yet the Pope died before the arrival of the Embassie, and
the solemnity failing, left the Title of the Crown much blemished, yet
was it not wholly defaced. For if the Statutes in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, did but confirm the possession, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the repealing of those Statutes took away no Right from the
Crown, nor gave legal possession to the Pope, that had formerly neither
Possession nor Right; but left him to his <hi>Remitter,</hi> as in his ancient
right, or rather in his ancient wrong. Yet right or wrong, <hi>de facto,</hi> he
both did win and wear the Keys so long as the Queen lived, and so far as
she pleased: for her devotion would not allow of absolute obedience
in that kind, nor all for Gospel that the Pope said or did; but by her
self and Council, executed the powers of Supremacy of Jurisdiction in
Church-matters, not onely in pursuance of the Papal Authority, but in
crossing the same where the Popes way crossed her opinion; as in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the War between her Husband and <hi>France,</hi> and the Power <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
of Cardinal <hi>Pool;</hi> her condemning of Doctrines and Books to be
Heretical by Proclamation, establishing both Prayers and <hi>Dirges,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orders of publick Worship; whereof more fully in the publick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of those times, and the Queens Injunctions upon occasion of the
death of Pope <hi>Julio,</hi> is to be seen.</p>
               <p>Lastly, she was no good <hi>Queen,</hi> not onely because she gave up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Liberties in Ecclesiastical matters to the Foreign Jurisdiction of <hi>Rome,</hi>
but undertook too much therein by far upon her own account; and in
Civil affairs, though <hi>de jure</hi> she was not inferiour to any of her Progenitors,
yet she would have it declared by the Parliament; as if the consideration
of her Sex or Birth,<note place="margin">2 Marl. Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 2. c. 1.</note> had made some hesitation in her mind; and when she
had made all clear, she commending her self thereby to the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi>
with her self, indangered likewise that trust of the Nation which she had
received, and cast such a shadow upon her own Supremacy, as in many
things it is hard to be discerned.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in her whole course uneven; sometimes appearing like the eldest
Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, at other times like a Fee-covert, led by
the will of her Lord aud Husband, that wanting Supremacy himself, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her thereby beneath her self.</p>
               <p>For first, she married by Act of Parliament, as if she were not at her
own disposing; professing as much in her speech to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> upon the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64112:194"/>
                  <hi>Kentish</hi> Rebellion. So a difference was made between the two Sisters;
the Marriage of the one being by advice of Parliament, and the abstinence
of the other against the same. Nor is the same altogether irrational: for
by the one, the Government of the Nation is endangered; and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
otherwise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by her Marriage she became doubly married; one way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to her Person unto her King, the other relating to her Trust unto
her Council: For where a Foreign mighty King is so nigh the Helm, it
is dangerous to trust the same to his Wife, without the joynt concurrence
of the Lords. The matter in fact declared no less: for many times she
had steered quite wide, had not the Lords been more stiff to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
than she.</p>
               <p>The first year of her Marriage was Honey-moon with her; she thought
nothing too dear for the King, and that her self was but meanly married,
unless her Husband were as compleat a King in her Nation, as any of her
Predecessors; although contrarily, the higher he was advanced, the meaner
she became.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by her Marriage she adventured her Title of Supremacy of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
For <hi>Philip,</hi> as King, had the Honour, Stile, and Kingly name,
and so had the precedency. He had to do also with the Jurisdiction: for
by the Articles of the Marriage, he was to aid the Queen in her Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Kingdom, and maintenance of the Laws; Writs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
passed under his name. He also sate in Parliament, voted therein,
and joyned in the <hi>Royal Assent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, joyned in the publication and execution of all Laws. To him
also was <hi>Allegiance</hi> due; and therefore the Crime of <hi>Treason</hi> was equally
against his, as the Queens Crown and Dignity, saving that it was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be as against him onely during the time of Coverture. And yet
had the Queen left Issue by him,<note place="margin">1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mary, cap. 10.</note> it would have been a hard adventure for
the Lawyers to have given their Opinion in that case, seeing the King had
been <hi>Guardian</hi> to his Children during their <hi>Minority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the whole power and jurisdiction resting in them both joyntly,
could not enable them to make or dissolve Courts at will,<note place="margin">1 Mar. Sess. 2. cap. 11. &amp;c. 5. &amp; 7. &amp;c. 12.</note> nor conclude Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Directions in cases of Plea and Conveyance, nor Process concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same. I shall sum up all in this one conclusion: If neither of these
three had an absolute <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> either in matters concerning the
Church or Commonwealth; if no absolute Jurisdiction, in case either of Life,
Member, or Estate: If they neither can create, unite, or alter any Court, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerning the Trial and determining the Estates of the People, or
their own Revenue: If not alter or make any new Process in the Courts
of Law: If not order common Assurances of Lands or Estates;</p>
               <p>And lastly, if they have no power in determining the <hi>last Appeal</hi> and
definitive Sentence in matters of Controversie, but all must rest upon the
Sentence by Parliament, there must certainly be found out a further sense
of that grand Title of <hi>Supremacy of Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and Authority,</hi> than by the common Vogue hath been made.
The Title of <hi>Supremacy</hi> was first formed in the behalf of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth's Claim in matters Ecclesiastical; which by the Statute is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under these words of power:<note place="margin">29 H. 8. c. 1. 5 Eliz. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>To visit, correct, repress, redress Offences and
Enormities.</hi> This Power, and no other, did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> claim: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the words of the Statute in her own time. But in the framing of the
<hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> in her time, not onely in Causes <hi>Ecclesiastical, but Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi>
(which never came within the Statutes and publick Acts in <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64112:195"/>
the Seventh's time) are inserted; and if any thing more was intended,
it must come under the word <hi>Things,</hi> which also was inserted in the said
Oath; and yet if the words of the Statute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> formerly
mentioned be credited, the word <hi>Things</hi> ought to comprehend no more
than the word <hi>Causes,</hi> and then the power of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the
Commonwealth will be comprehended in these words of Supremacy;
to <hi>visit, correct, repress, redress Offences</hi> and <hi>Enormities:</hi> for the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in the Church and Commonwealth, is the same in Measure; and
what more than this, I cannot understand out of any publick Act of this
Nation. Now in regard <hi>Offences</hi> and <hi>Enormities</hi> are properly against
Laws, the power <hi>to visit</hi> and <hi>correct,</hi> must also be regulated according to
Laws, either of War, or Peace: Nor do these five words, <hi>Jurisdiction,
Power, Superiority, Pre-eminence,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> contain any more <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
or other sence; for two of them speak onely the Rank or Degree of
the Queen in Government, <hi>viz. Superiority</hi> and <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> belongeth
onely to her, and not to any other Foreign Power. And two other
words do note her Right and Title thereto, by <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>
committed to her. And the other word denotes the thing wherein she
hath <hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>Power, viz.</hi> in <hi>Jurisdiction:</hi> the nature of which
word, <hi>Vlpian</hi> (speaking of the nature of a mixt Government) explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thus: <hi>Quando servata dictione juris judiciorum fit animadversio.</hi> So
as this <hi>Supreme Authority in Jurisdiction,</hi> is no other than <hi>Supreme Power to
visit, correct, redress Offences,</hi> or determine matters in doubt, by deputing fit
persons to that end and purpose according to the Law; and this is all the
<hi>Supremacy</hi> that appeareth to me, belonging to the Crown in these times.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. Of the Power of the Parliament during these times.</head>
               <p>WHen the Throne is full of a King, and he is as full of opinion of
his own sufficiency and power, a Parliament is looked upon as
an old fashion out of fashion, and serves for little other than for present
shift, when Kings have run themselves over Head and Ears. A Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that those of that high degree are extremely subject unto; but
where the Crown is too heavy for the wearer, by reason of infirmity,
the Parliament is looked upon as the chief Supporters in the maintaining
both the Honour and Power of that Authority, that otherwise would
fall under contempt. A Work that must be done with a curious touch,
and a clear hand; or they must look for the like Censure to that of a
King to a great Lord that crowned him: <hi>My Lord, I like your work very
well, but you have left the print of your fingers upon my Crown.</hi> Such was
the condition of these times, wherein a Child and two Women are the
chief; but ever under the correction and direction of the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
in matters of common concernment. Two things declare the point;
the course of the <hi>Title</hi> of the Crown, and the Order of the <hi>powers</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Title</hi> ever had a Law, which was at the Helm, although diversly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
Kings ever loved the Rule of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and therefore usually
strained their Pedegree hard to make both ends meet, though in truth
they were guilty oftentimes to themselves, that they were not within the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64112:195"/>
degrees.<note place="margin">Bodin. rep. l. 6.</note> The People ever loved the Title of <hi>Election;</hi> and though ever
they joyned it to the Royal bloud, and many times to the <hi>right Heir,</hi> to
make the same pass more currant without interruption of the first love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and their Princes; yet more often had they Kings that could
not boast much of their Birthright in their first entry into their Throne. Of
three and twenty Kings from the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, four of the former had
no Title by <hi>Inheritance;</hi> the two <hi>Williams, Henry</hi> the First, and King
<hi>Steven.</hi> Two others, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the Second and <hi>Richard</hi> the first, had
right of <hi>Birth,</hi> yet came in by <hi>Compact.</hi> The Seventh, which was King
<hi>John,</hi> had no Title but <hi>Election.</hi> The Eighth, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the Third, came
in a <hi>Child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and contrary to Compact between the Nobility and the <hi>French
Lewis.</hi> The Ninth and Tenth succeeded as by unquestionable Title of
<hi>Descent,</hi> yet the Nobles were pre-engaged. The Eleventh, which was
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in his entry <hi>eldest Son,</hi> but not Heir, for his Father
was alive: but his Successour was his Heir: It is true, there were other
Children of <hi>Edward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Third alive, that were more worthy of the
Crown; but they were too many to agree in any but a <hi>Child,</hi> that might
be ruled by themselves. Three next of the ensuing Kings, were of a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
line. Their two Successours, <hi>viz. Edward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fifth, were of the Line; yet <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth came in by
<hi>disseisin,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth by <hi>permission. Richard</hi> the Third, and
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nth, were <hi>collateral</hi> to one another, and to the right
Bloud. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, though when he was King might claim
from his Mother, yet came in as <hi>Heir</hi> to his Father. And if <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth was right Heir to the House of <hi>York</hi> by his Grandmother, yet
cannot the Crown be said to descend upon the two Sisters, neither as
<hi>Heirs</hi> to him, nor <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, nor to one another,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 7. 1 Mar. Sess. 2. cap. 1.</note> so long as the
Statute of their <hi>Illegitimation</hi> remained; which, as touching Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
was till three months after her entry upon the Throne; and as touching
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for ever: for that <hi>Virago</hi> provided for her self, not by
way of <hi>Repeal</hi> (as her Sister had done) but more tenderly regarding
the Honour of her Father and the Parliament, than to mention their
blemishes in Government, by doing and undoing. She over-looked that
Act of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and the Notion of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and contented
her self with her Title by the Statute made by her Father in his Thirty
fifth year;<note place="margin">35 H. 8. cap.</note> which to her was a meer purchase; and was not ashamed to
declare to all the world, that she did <hi>have</hi> and <hi>hold</hi> thereby, <hi>and that it
was High Treason for any Subject to deny that the course of the Crown of</hi>
England <hi>is to be ordered by Act of Parliament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Eliz. c. 1.</note> And this power did the
Parliament exercise, not onely in ordering the course of the Crown to
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but during the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
so far as to disinherit and disable any person who should pretend
Right to the Crown, in opposition to the Right of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
And upon this point onely, did the whole proceedings against <hi>Mary</hi>
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> depend; who claimed to be,<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. 1. lib. 20.</note> and doubtless was <hi>Heir</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, after the determination of his Right Line; and yet
she was put to death for pretending <hi>Right by the Common Law,</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> True it is, that this Doctrine doth not
down well with those that do pretend to Prerogative, aided (as they say)
by the Act of Recognition made to King <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jac. cap. 1.</note> and the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Allegiance; which do make much parly concerning Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Heirs. Nevertheless it is as true, that the Act of <hi>Recognition</hi>
made no Law for the future; nor doth the same cross the Statute
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64112:196"/>
of 13 <hi>Eliz. Nor doth it take away the power of the Parliament from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
the course of the Common Law for after-Ages. Nor do the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
and Allegiance hold forth any such Obligation unto Heirs, otherwise
than as supposing them to be Successors, and in that relation onely.</hi> And
therefore was no such <hi>Allegiance</hi> due to <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> until they were actually possessed of the Crown;
as may appear by the Oath formed by the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
touching their Succession.<note place="margin">35 11. 8. cap. 1.</note> Nor did the Law suppose any <hi>Treason</hi> could
be acted against the Heirs of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> until those Heirs were actually possessed of the Crown, and
so were Kings and Queens;<note place="margin">1 Eliz. 6. c. 12. 5 &amp; 6 E. 6. cap. 11. 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 10. 1 Eliz. cap. 6. 1 Eliz. cap 3.</note> as by express words in the several Statutes
do appear. Nor did the <hi>Recognition</hi> by the Parliament made to Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declare any engagement of the People to assist and defend
her, and the Heirs of her Body, otherwise than with this Limitation,
<hi>Being Kings and Queens of this Realm;</hi> as by the Statute in that behalf
made, doth appear.</p>
               <p>And lastly, (had those <hi>Oaths</hi> been otherwise understood) the Crown
had by the virtue of them been pre-engaged, so as it could never have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or King <hi>James,</hi> but must have
remained to the Heirs of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the same power that the Parliament exercised in ordering
the course of <hi>Succession</hi> in the Crown, they exercised likewise in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
and distributing the Powers and Priviledges belonging to the
same: for these times were full of Novelties. The Crown had formerly
sitted a Childs head more than once, but it never tried to fit a Womans
head since the <hi>Saxons</hi> times, till now that it must make trial of two.
<hi>France</hi> might afford us a trick of the <hi>Salique Law,</hi> if it might find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
And the unsetled state of the People, especially in matter of
Religion, might require the wisest man living to sit at the Helm, and
yet himself not sufficient to steer a right course to the Harbour. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
the Parliament having the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth to lead
the way, chose rather to pursue a Rule than to make one, and soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the point, <hi>viz. That the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>with all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
thereof, equally belong to a Woman in possession, as to a Man or Child.</hi>
A bold Adventure I say it was,<note place="margin">1 Mar. Parl. cap. 1.</note> but that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was a bold
Leader; and yet the bolder it was, if the consequence be considered. For
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as a <hi>Woman,</hi> brought in one new Precedent, but in her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>
a worse: for she aimed not onely at a Foreign Bloud, but at a Prince
in Power and Majesty exceeding her own; and thereby seeking advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both to her self and her Realm, endangered both. The matter was
long in debate between the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and now had busied their
Wits about ten years; at length a Supremacy is formed suitable to the
Lord and Husband of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sleidan.</note> that could not be content to be one
inch lower than her self. <hi>Philip</hi> had the name of a King, and Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and in many cases, not without the Allegiance of the <hi>English.</hi> Their
offences against his person,<note place="margin">1 Ph. &amp; Mar. Parl. 2. c. 10.</note> equally <hi>Treason</hi> with those against the Queens
own person; and Indictments run, <hi>Contra pacem, &amp; Coronam D. Regis &amp;
Reginae.</hi> That in some cases he participated in the Regal Power, may
appear,<note place="margin">2 Ph. &amp; Mar. Parl. 2. c. 1.</note> in that by the Articles he was to aid the Queen in the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi>
of the Kingdom; he joyned with the Queen in the <hi>Royal Assent,</hi>
and in Commission, Letters patents, and in Writs of Summons of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as others; yet in the words the Crown is reserved onely
to the Queen, and she must Reign as sole Queen. Now if the King had
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64112:196"/>
broken this Agreement, either the Parliament must over-rule the whole,
or all that is done must be undone, and <hi>England</hi> must bear the burthen.
A Queen <hi>Regent</hi> is doubtless a dangerous condition for <hi>England,</hi> above that
of an <hi>Infant</hi>-King, unless she be married onely to her people.</p>
               <p>This was observed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who therefore kept her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married;
nor did the people otherwise desire her Marriage, than in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Posterity. Few of them liking any one of their own Nation so
well, as to prefer him so highly above themselves; and fewer any Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
This was soon espied by Foreign Princes; and the Queen her self
perceiving that she was like to receive prejudice hereby in her interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, signified by her Embassadors,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bodin</hi> de Rep. lib. 6.</note> that she never meaned to
stoop so low as to match with any of her Subjects; but intended to make
her choice of some Foreign Prince, who neither by Power or Riches should
be able to prejudice the interest of any of her Neighbouring Princes. A
pretty Complement this was, to gain expectation from those abroad, and
better correspondency thereunto. Upon this ground divers Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
hopes of more interest than by trial they could find. And the
Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> began a Treaty, which seemingly was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her; but her Proposals were such, as silenced all those of the <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Interest for ever after, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Romish Religion should never be admitted into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That no man that she married should ever wear the Title of King.</item>
                  <item>3. That no Foreigner should ever intermeddle in the Rule and Government
of the Church or Commonwealth, nor in the Ministry of the Church.</item>
                  <item>4. That if he survived the Queen, he should never challenge any Title or
Interest in the Government, or any Possession in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. She would never marry any one that she might not first see.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So as either she aimed at some inferiour Prince, that durst not look so
high; or else she did but make semblance till she was nigh Forty years
old: and in all declared, that she liked not her Sister <hi>Maries</hi> choice.</p>
               <p>To these two Powers of <hi>Determining</hi> and <hi>Distributing,</hi> I shall adde a
third of <hi>Deputing,</hi> which the Parliament exercised as formerly it had
done. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had in Ecclesiastical matters exercised a power
beyond the Law, and yet by Parliament had provided positive Laws, by
which the same ought to have been ordered: these were also confirmed
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, with some Additionals.<note place="margin">3 &amp; 4 E. 6. c. 11.</note> By these, particular
Commissioners were appointed for the making of Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">1 Eliz. c 1. &amp; 1.</note>
and the King himself had a power of <hi>Episcopofactory,</hi> without <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
d'eslire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 1.</note>
They likewise limited the power of Ecclesiastical Courts,<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 2. 5 &amp; 6 E. 6. c. 1.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
their Process, reformed their Censures, even that grand Censure of
Excommunication it self.<note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 20.</note> The like, or much more may be said of their
<hi>deputing</hi> power in Civil Affairs;<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 11.</note> as well by enlarging the King's power, as
in abridging the same. For whereas some of the Successors of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, had power by vertue of his Letters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> patents, after Twenty four
years of age, to annul any Act of Parliament by them made before that
age; in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, notwithstanding the <hi>Proviso</hi> of
that Law, and although <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, was not then Twelve years
old, yet the Parliament repealed all, and restored to <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth
onely that power for the time to come; but not to any of his Successors.
And whereas <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had gained to himself and his Successors
a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> by Proclamation; the Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64112:197"/>
Sixth's time took the same quite away,<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 11.</note> and reduced Proclamations into
their former sober posture. The like may be observed of the power of
the Parliament,<note place="margin">7 Edw. 6. c. 2.</note> in ordering the Lives, Members, and Estates of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in matters criminal;<note place="margin">1 Mar. Sess. 2. c 10. &amp; 12.</note> and in making and altering Courts of Justice,
and bounding their Power,<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 7.</note> altering their Process, abridging their Terms
for Judicature,<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 10. 3 c. 28. 5 &amp; 6. c. 26.</note> reforming Errours in pleading, amending common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
and Assurance, as in passing Fines with Proclamations; their
course in County Palatine; Limitations of Prescription; fraudulent
Deeds; Recoveries by Collusion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all which the Crown had no
power, but in and by the Parliament. Many particulars more might be
added, if the matter so required; for the Statutes are more full in these
later Times than formerly, and may soon lead us beyond a just period in
so clear a matter.</p>

                  </gap> Soil of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> yet trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into the new Mould of <hi>Royalty,</hi> soon conveyed a new life, which
made the Stock still flourish, and grow into a better condition than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it had. Their <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in matters concerning their
own interest, though in outward view seeming their own, yet was
doubly disturbed from the Pope and the King; who, though many
times they opposed one another, yet evermore were both of them
in opposition to the Church, and with the greater bitterness by their own
mutual Emulations. But now the Church is come under the controle
of onely, one that joyned with it for their mutual interest, as being both
of them embarqued in one and the same ship.</p>
               <p>Two things concurred to the furtherance hereof.</p>
               <p>First, the Times were <hi>tender,</hi> and scarce able to digest the change of
Worship, now patronized by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, much less able to digest
the change of Government, if the same had been undertaken in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
way from what it was formerly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Times were also <hi>dark,</hi> and few saw the bottom of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie,</hi>
but lodged all the prejudice in the persons that managed that calling.
And certainly they had the less occasion to doubt of their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein, because <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth had the good providence of
God to lead him to make use of such men in that place, that were meek,
and holy, and themselves attempted in the fire of Persecution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more tenderly affected to others in that condition. And these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
themselves like tender nursing Fathers in their places, wrought in
the people a good opinion of their places, and that Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their sakes Yet even in those first Times of Reformation,
somewhat appeared in that very quintessence of <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> in matters
of Ceremony and Conformity, that might have taught wise men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64112:197"/>
Upon such grounds as these it went well with <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in these
first Times of Reformation, but ill with the Church in the issue. That
<hi>Prelacie</hi> was a gainer by the change in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
appeared; and that it still gained, may further appear in these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Considerations.</p>
               <p>First, Whereas formerly <hi>Bishops</hi> were regardant both to the <hi>Crown</hi> and
<hi>Presbytery</hi> (for so may the Dean and Chapter be accounted) in the
point of Election by <hi>Conge d'eslire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 E. 6. c. 2.</note> now they are made the birth of the
Kings own breath; which thing was never deduced from the ancient
Right of the Crown; (saving due honour to the air of the Preface of
the Statute) for in the best Times it never had more than a power of
<hi>Investiture:</hi> But from the necessity of the Times so corrupted, that <hi>Deans</hi>
and <hi>Chapters</hi> generally were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Spirit, and gave little hope
of good Elections by themselves. Besides, the state of Learning and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
was now at the low-water mark; so as little supply being looked
for to begin the work of Reformation from beneath, they began above;
and so it proved but a weak building for the longer time. And thus a
lesson is left to future Parliaments, <hi>That in Cases of Reformation they are
not to be strictly holden to Rules of Law or Precedent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Prelates</hi> hereby had their Authority confirmed by Act
of Parliament, and so were now built upon a Foundation, that formerly did
hang onely upon a pin of power from <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> without
<hi>Authority,</hi> is but a Dropsie that brings inevitable consumption in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
And thus the <hi>Prelacie</hi> are inabled to <hi>hold Courts</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and directed in their <hi>Process,</hi> who formerly had a good Title
to neither, in that course that they held the same.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> was defined by the Statutes, yet in
larger bounds than ever the Statute-Laws formerly noted; and in what
they claimed <hi>power,</hi> they did it not altogether upon <hi>Civil Right,</hi> but still
kept an awful regard to their Persons and Power, as under the sway of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Donation;</hi> and therefore, as in those matters to them by the Statute
allowed, they did proceed in the name and under the Seal of the King; so in
other things of <hi>Collation, Institution, Induction, Orders, Excommunication,</hi> and
such like, they proceeded in and under their own Name and Seal; and, which
was a Crown to all the rest, power is still given to the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
in cases of <hi>Faculty</hi> and <hi>Dispensation,</hi> to proceed under his own
Seal, and not the Kings, as if it were a power independent upon the
Crown, and belonging unto the man; neither by Statute nor Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but coming by some secret Influence from the very place it self.
Although in the clear sense it is no more than a power of <hi>Non obstante</hi>
in the point of obedience to the Canon-Law, which by a Statute in
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time is declared no Law. But let this pass as a Mole
in this fair face of Church-government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prelates</hi> are now become of the Vicinage, <hi>Probi &amp; legales ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines;</hi>
they have their Jurisdiction by Law established; what they
lose in breadth, they gain in height and goodness of their Foundation.
Yet their Attire looks ill-favourably in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> eye; she will have
it of the old cut again: and though Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was well seen in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
fashion, yet when he had done all, he did no more than shape a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to serve the present Interlude, neither fit to the body, nor easie
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64112:198"/>
to be worn; and therefore after four or five turns upon the Stage, it is
thrown away. Nevertheless, during the time that <hi>England</hi> was thus
dancing the <hi>Italian</hi> measure, <hi>Prelacy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> held its own Domestick
garb so well, that neither <hi>Poole</hi> (being of <hi>English</hi> bloud, not much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Crown, and then also holding the <hi>Chair Legatine,</hi> as little
inferiour to the Throne) would not impose too much, nor Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
a woman of a stout Spirit, yield farther than she liked. By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> looking no more to <hi>Rome</hi> than the power in <hi>Appeals,</hi>
and therein little more than the bare Title, played <hi>Rex</hi> all the while
with the people, under colour of <hi>Heresie</hi> and the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> which
now was again made their Rule: And thus as touching their <hi>Election</hi>
and <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> they were as before. For Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did nothing but
by single <hi>Repeal.</hi> But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being true <hi>English,</hi> both by
Father and Mother, liking not this retreat, faced about, routed the
<hi>Roman</hi> fashion out of fashion; put <hi>Prelacie</hi> to its close guard, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it upon capitulation, not onely to mercy, but favour; and so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her Vicar to exercise her Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction <hi>per saltum:</hi> For
it is hard to find by what steps they gained this pitch. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
was <hi>Supream Head</hi> by submission of the Clergie, by Resumption, and
by Act of Parliament; and as such, the power of <hi>Bishops</hi> formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <hi>Rome</hi> ceased; and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth after restored it anew,
and setled the same by several Acts of Parliament; which <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth confirmed, with divers additional Acts of further benefit to them,
as hath been already noted. But Queen <hi>Mary</hi> altered all by <hi>repeal</hi> of
the former Laws, and so left all in <hi>Remitter,</hi> as before the alteration by
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; and did neither give or grant any Jurisdiction to the
Pope. Last of all comes Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by <hi>Repeal</hi> and <hi>Resum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
possessed her self of Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical; and granted Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Bishops by <hi>Conge d'eslire,</hi> but never granted to the Bishops Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Jurisdiction by any express Act, other than permission of them
to continue in their former course; notwithstanding that the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Jurisdiction had been altered twice; and so it will be difficult
for it to hold by Prescription or Custom, or any other way than by a
kind of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> which began to be pretended, yet to this day could
never be made evident to the World. Whatever the ground was, the
thing is plain, that <hi>Prelacie</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time had this honour
allowed thereunto, that it was upholden by <hi>Election</hi> from Ecclesiastical
men, and held its Jurisdiction as from it self, and in the name of <hi>Bishop</hi>
as <hi>Ordinary;</hi> and the power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> by a <hi>saving</hi> in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-law,
and not by express <hi>Donation;</hi> notwithstanding the late Precedent
in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Rule of this <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> was no less at large; for the
Canon-Law was determined by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,
and was not revived by any Act of Parliament, by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> or Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who neither pursued the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Thirty two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
nor setled other rule, but a few Canons, which (after some
time) by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Clergie were agreed upon, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
confirmed by Act of Parliament. And so could never bind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and which in general set forth a kind of Form of Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> policy,
yet no fashion of Jurisdiction, or rule of proceedings in the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Courts; but in such cases left them to the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> which was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in their own breasts, and could be make strait or wide as they pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:64112:198"/>
Thirdly, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Censures</hi> now grew more sharp; for whereas at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
formerly they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uld do no more but <hi>imprison,</hi> or deliver over to the
<hi>Secular Power,</hi> and that onely in case of <hi>Heresie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Eliz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and yet had scarce
ground of Law for what they did; now they have an additional power,
to <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>imprison</hi> in Cases of inferiour nature, and so can reach all that
a man hath even to his skin. Nevertheless this was not annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ordinary Jurisdiction, but given by extraordinary Commission,
called the <hi>High Commission;</hi> wherein, though many others were named,
yet the Clergie and Canonists did the work; the rest being but in nature
of a reserve to them, in case they were put to the rout. The power of
these <hi>Commissioners</hi> was to execute the Queens Jurisdiction in Causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical:
so as the <hi>Bishops</hi> are doubly interested in this work; one way,
by supposed Commission <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom God, as <hi>Ordinaries</hi> within their own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
onely, and so may proceed to Excommunication or Deprivation;
the other way, by <hi>Commission</hi> from the Queen, as Members of the High
Commission, (for so many of them were such, as the Crown would
please) and so they might <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>imprison.</hi> They might and did, I say,
by their <hi>Commission,</hi> but not by the Statute that gives authority thereto,
and therefore cannot be said to be done legally.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, besides the contracted power of making Canons in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
by the power of the <hi>Royal Assent;</hi> the Queen had a power of
making Laws by their consent, in matters of the criminal part of the
Worship of God.</p>
               <p>This might be tolerable for the Life of the one Queen, who might
be presumed would (if she lived a few years) settle all things: but to
subject the Consciences of all the people to the opinion of one <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,</hi>
that might opinionate strange things; and that the Successors of
the Queen should usurp this as a Flower of the Crown, to determine what
is <hi>for Gods glory</hi> in such cases, and to be always altering and patching up
a Form, as he and his Metropolitan, or one of them alone,<note place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 2.</note> shall think
meet, is neither commendable upon any grounds of Divinity or humane
Policy.</p>
               <p>Now amidst the flourishing Estate of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> it is no wonder if the
Churches be no gainers, but like Plants spending their Natures in luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
Branches, either are over-turned by the next blast of wind, or do
wither upon the least change of Skie. That the whole ordering of the
Church-Affairs rested originally in the Parliament, no man can question,
considering whatever the Queen did, or had therein, was from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Acts of Parliament. And that the power of Excommunication
it self, notwithstanding that the Church held it by way of reservation or
<hi>saving,</hi> and not by <hi>donation</hi> from the Parliament, by any express Act; yet
was that <hi>saving</hi> with such limitations, as that it received but a lame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in comparison of what it claimed and exercised in former times. For
whereas formerly the Church-men had the Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo</hi>
at their own beck; now it will not come, but upon Articles and
certain Conditions.</p>

In other matters the Spiritual Sword must find or make their own way,
or else be quiet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church was now no less under the Chair and Throne,
than under power of the Parliament; nor is it a wonder, if it could not
thrive when it was so over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dropped: for <hi>Prelacie</hi> by the King's arms is
lifted up so high above the other Clergie, that the rest of the Clergie are
as much underlings to the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> as the Prelates are to the King. They
dare not offend the Crown, lest they should lose their <hi>Honours;</hi> nor the
inferiour Clergie them, lest they should lose their <hi>Livings</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
and so the <hi>Prelates</hi> speak the sense of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and make the
<hi>Crown</hi> their Oracle. Thus in the Church-matters the Crown is all in
all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. Of the Militia in these latter Times.</head>
               <p>IT cannot be denied, but as in the sober Government of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
there is a <hi>Supremacy</hi> of Command; so also in the rudest times of War,
and wheresoever the same is setled, there must the <hi>Militia</hi> also be.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Militia</hi> is a general notion, sufficient enough for a name or
title, but not to define the thing. I take it for nothing else but <hi>the
Government of the Commonwealth when it is in danger, or War, or in order
thereunto.</hi> It consisteth in the raising, arming, ordering, and paying of
the Souldiery. The title of the <hi>Supream Power</hi> in all this work hath
been of late put to the question, and brought us to this sad condition of
trial <hi>by Battle;</hi> and by Fighting, to find out who had the chief power to
fight. A Lesson that might have been learned from former Generations
foregoing, at a far cheaper rate, when <hi>England</hi> is well in its wits. Where
the <hi>Law of Peace</hi> is setled, there also is the <hi>Law of War;</hi> and in what
condition the Crown standeth, in relation to the <hi>Legislative power,</hi> in
time of Peace, may be seen in the foregoing Discourse. In <hi>War</hi> the King
is the peoples General by his place; yet if any impediment do befal, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by natural disabilities, or civil, to render the person incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of the Service, there is no question but the people may order
the matter as they please. With examples hereof these times are full,
wherein we have a <hi>Child,</hi> a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and a <hi>Married Woman</hi> to sway the
Work; all of them in a very unmeet condition for such a Trust; and
yet by the help they had, they managed it well enough. The power
of him as <hi>King</hi> or <hi>General</hi> in the Army, is all one; but before it is imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
as a <hi>King</hi> onely, he may do some things in order thereto, according
to the Law and Custom of the Nation; yet this falls under a double
consideration of the time and occasion. In the recess of the Parliament,
he is the first mover, and ought to move by the advice of his Council,
if occasion do provoke to Arms; but if the same befal, the Parliament
then sitting, no History or Record do mention that ever he moved but
by their concurrent advice and direction. The occasion either provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
offensive or defensive War with other Nations, or with the people
of his own Nation, in the case of Insurrection. Examples of War with
other Nations, that may be called <hi>offensive Wars,</hi> we have but two; one
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which was but in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64112:199"/>
of a War begun by his Father, and wherein the Kingdom stood
ingaged, in a case that concerned the publick good and safety, <hi>viz. The
Marriage of their King refused after promise made.</hi> The other was in the
time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> which somewhat reflected also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the publick safety, but more upon the dishonour of the same. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
none of these did either of the Supream Powers <hi>array,</hi> or raise men by
Prerogative, but onely such as were <hi>Voluntier</hi> in that work. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the people were ill principled in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, in regard
of the change of Religion, he was induced to hire Foreign aid out of
<hi>Germany.</hi> The Wars in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were in order to
the defence of this Nation, being ever under a malignant Aspect from
abroad, especially from <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Ireland, France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
Yet were these Wars served onely by <hi>Voluntiers;</hi> nor did any <hi>Commission</hi>
give power of <hi>impresting</hi> men to serve against their wills in any Expedition
made to any of those places, as the Commissions upon Record do testifie.
If any Levies of men were otherwise made, or compulsory means used for
such ends, they are to be reckoned up amongst the <hi>errata,</hi> whereof the
Parliament took no notice, in regard it saw the ends and issues of such
Reflections in Government to be successful and honourable; and that all
was done by Council, and a Woman popularly affected; and therefore
they less feared Invasion upon their Liberties. Or otherwise they are to
be imputed to the condition of those places, being Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
as the cautionary Towns in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi>
Plantations were; and so befel under another consideration of a <hi>defensive
War,</hi> in case of Invasion and common danger thereby, or by Intestine
broils; during which condition, as it is the King's duty to <hi>levy</hi> and <hi>array</hi>
men, so is it the duty of the people to be ready to assist one another in
all such exigencies, and to defend the publick Liberty. Nevertheless,
these <hi>Arrays</hi> are not left wholly at the Will of the King, but to discretion
of the Council, how far the same shall extend. For never were general
<hi>Arrays</hi> made, where but one Coast was in danger, and where no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
is in pretence, but onely Piracy or Plunder. But if the disease were
general, as in the year 88, the <hi>Array</hi> was general; and yet it was of
none, but those that were of the Trained-bands, besides such as were <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The arming of these men was also diversly; there was no
general Rule or Law for the arming of men since the time of <hi>Edward</hi>
the First to the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but the Statute at <hi>Winton;</hi> the
course of <hi>Tenures,</hi> I mean of such men as were of the <hi>Militia</hi> of this
Kingdom: So as when they were raised, they were raised in their own
Arms. But for such men as passed the Seas for Foreign Service, as they
were <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> or sent over by the Parliament, these were armed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to special contract. But Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> having gotten a safe reserve
from <hi>Spain</hi> upon all adventures, and a strong interest amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by upholding the <hi>Catholick party,</hi> made no bones to innovate in the
point of arming of the <hi>Militia,</hi> although it cost the people much more
than was imposed upon their Ancestors. The pattern hereof was taken
from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cabinet; the Queen, being loth to be inferiour to her
own Husband, in bringing as much strength to him as he to her, and
both of them willing enough to appear potent in the eyes of <hi>France,</hi>
that then stood in competition with them both. A yoke it was, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King nor Queens Will, but the Parliament put it on; and ere an
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64112:200"/>
Age expired it was cast off again. For the better understanding, see it in
this Scheme.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Lances</hi> were to be compleatly harnessed, or the one half of them.
The <hi>Corcelets</hi> furnished with Coats of Mail and Pikes; the <hi>Bows</hi> with
and Iron Cap, and a Sheaf of Arrows; the <hi>Hacquebuts</hi> with Sallets. All
which was to be over and besides such Arms as men were bound unto
by <hi>Tenure,</hi> or Covenant with the Landlord, or by vertue of the Statute
33. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 5. besides <hi>Townships</hi> which were charged with joynt-arms;
<hi>Annuities</hi> and <hi>Copy-holds</hi> were charged as Goods. If the Arms were lost
in the Service, the owner must make them good again. The defaults
were punishable with Fine by the Justices of the Peace, who had the
view, and might present them at the Sessions, to be proceeded upon as in
other cases. Here is provision enough, yet not as the Arms of the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
of the Kingdom, but as a Magazine in the hands of every particular
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64112:200"/>
man, and as his proper Goods, to be imployed for the publick Service,
either upon suddain Invasion in a defensive War, or when the Parliament
shall send them abroad. And yet it is also a rule unto the Crown against
arbitrary Assessments upon discretion, from which it cannot recede if it
mean to do right.</p>
               <p>It might now very well stand with the Justice of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to
grant <hi>Commissions of Array, Secundum formam Statutorum,</hi> and do hurt to
no man. It is true, her Commissions of Lord-<hi>Lieutenancy</hi> wanted that
limitation in words, yet they carried the sense: For if the Crown were
bound by the Law, the Lord-<hi>Lieutenants</hi> were much rather; but the
danger arose after the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For when King <hi>James</hi>
came to the Crown, under colour of pleasing the people, and easing them
of a burthen, he pleased himself more, and made the yoke upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
much more heavy in the conclusion; for where no declared Law is,
there the discretion of them that have the care lying upon them must be
the Rule. And thus came the <hi>Scotish blood</hi> to have pretensions to a
greater Prerogative than all their Predecessors had; upon this supposal,
<hi>that the Statute of Queen</hi> Mary <hi>took away all former Laws of that kind, and
then the taking away of the Statute of Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>takes away all declared
Law as to that point.</hi> But more truly it may be inferred, that if all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Laws
be taken away, then the rule of <hi>Tenures</hi> at the Common Law
must remain in force, and no other. Nevertheless, this Statute of Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> though in force for the present, was not a general rule for Arms
in all places of this Nation; for the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> were a peculiar
Jurisdiction as to this point. They stood in more constant need of
Arms than any other part of this Nation, in regard of their uncertain
condition, in relation to their neighbouring Jurisdiction; and therefore
were the Farms of these parts generally contracted for, upon a special
reservation of Arms for each particular; which being now decayed, are
again reduced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23 Eliz. c. 9.</note> to their ancient condition in the time
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>A second thing which may come under this general consideration of
arming, is, the arming of places, by making of <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Castles;</hi> which
was not in the immediate determinate will of the Crown to order as it
pleased. For though they may seem to be means of Peace and present
Safety, yet they are Symptoms of War, and in the best times are looked
upon with a jealous eye, especially such as are not bordering upon the
Coasts: Because that Prince that buildeth <hi>Castles</hi> within the Land, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to fear the Neighbourhood. This was more especially regarded in
the days of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi> for when that Marriage was to be solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
it was one of the Articles, to provide for the safety of such <hi>Forts</hi>
and <hi>Castles,</hi> as then were maintained; to the end they might be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
free from Usurpation, for the Use, Profit, Strength, and Defence of
the Realm, onely by the natural born of the same.<note place="margin">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 2.</note> And afterwards
when occasion was offered for the building of more of that nature, a
new power is given to King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 1.</note> to re-edifie or make
<hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Castles,</hi> which must be executed by Commission to the <hi>Lieges</hi>
for ten years; and onely within the Counties bordering upon <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and these particularly named in the Statute. So as the Crown had not
power to build in all cases, nor to any end they pleased. Nor to place
therein, or betrust the same to whom it would. Nor yet had <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth that absolute power, although not engaged in Foreign Interests;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64112:201"/>
as his Sister <hi>Mary</hi> was: and therefore whereas <hi>Castellanes</hi> had been made
for life by Patent,<note place="margin">2 E. 6. c. 16.</note> and so the absolute power of the Crown was barred
in the free disposal of the same during such time; the Parliament gave
the King power to remove such as were not liked, or thought not faithful
to the Publick Interest, although they gave no cause of seizure by any
disloyal act. The like also may be observed of the Ships and Ordnance;
for they also do belong to the State, as the Jewels of the Crown; and
therefore upon the Marriage of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they also are by Articles
preserved and saved, for the use, profit, strength and defence of the Realm
by the natural born of the same.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As touching the ordering of the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> the matter is not
much to be insisted upon; for little doubt is to be made, but that power
that raiseth them, also ordereth them to the same ends that they are
raised. And therefore, as the sole power of the Crown doth not the one,
so neither doth it the other, but in cases formerly mentioned. And yet
in no case, though the War be never so absolutely defensive, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
raised by the Kings own and onely power, had the King absolute
Authority, and Arbitrary power, in the ordering of them when they
are raised; but he must so behave himself to them, as to <hi>Freemen,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws made by themselves in their Representative in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And therefore are particular Laws made to that end,<note place="margin">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
levying and discharging of Souldiers, and defaults in paying of them:</hi>
as also <hi>against the Souldiers departing from their Service without License, or
wasting their Arms, and such as wilfully absent themselves from Musters;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 E. 6. c. 2. 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 3.</note> as
also <hi>for the preserving the Castles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 E. 6. c. 11. 14 Eliz. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Forts, Ships and Munition for War,
from being witholden from their due use, or from burning or destroying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, As touching the <hi>charge</hi> of the War, and pay of the Souldiers.
It is evident, that in all offensive Wars the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were paid by the
Crown, although they might be said in some manner to be in order to
the defence and safety of the Nation; nevertheless, where the same was
so apparent to the people, it was the common course in these times to have
often Parliaments, and often Subsidies, which were no less in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
satisfactory to the Crown for the Charges of the War, than Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Peoples good acceptance of the government of Affairs, and
so accepted at their hands. The particular Records will warrant all this.
For of all the Wars in these times, (that of 88 excepted) not any of them
were ever managed at the peoples charge by <hi>Contribution,</hi> but by <hi>Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
So were these times, wherein the people, looking upon the Crown as
under a kind of infirmity of Childhood or Womanhood, did therefore bear
a kind of compassionate regard thereunto, without jealousie at Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and could condescend and allow the Crown its full Grains, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more; yea, more than was meet for some other Prince to desire, or
the People to give up. And yet more happy were they, wherein the
Crown knew no interest but in dependance upon the peoples good; and so
understanding, were rightly understood.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="39" type="chapter">
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:64112:201"/>
               <head>CHAP. XXXIX. Of the Peace.</head>
               <p>IT is but little that can be said of <hi>Peace</hi> in these times, wherein so little
freedom was found from Foreign pretensions, and Intestine irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or both; and yet the people were never more resolved against the
former, nor secure against the latter, and had God to Friend in all. But
most apparently was this observable in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
whose Government took up four parts of five of these times whereof
we now treat. She was a compleat Conquerour of War and Treason,
and therein the true Inheritor of the Fate of her Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seventh, with advantage; for she out-faced all dangers by her onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
having thereof had more experience than any Princes that ever
possessed her Throne: yet she was wise enough to beware against the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
considering her condition to be the last of her Line; that the next
behind her was rather likely to trip up her heels than support her Train;
that the Pope narrowly watched every opportunity; the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the Throne being no greater than the breadth of her
onely person. It may well therefore admit of excuse, if the Statute of
the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third concerning <hi>Treasons</hi> did not give satisfaction;
although therein if she were sollicitous, her Subjects were more. Some
kinds of offences were made <hi>Treason</hi> by Statute-laws, which formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not such, because they appeared not at all; and yet in the opinion
of her people, the Queen was too slack in the making, and more slack
in the execution of them. The people had engaged themselves deeply
against the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and it was not safe for them to go back;
they go yet deeper, and without any positive Authority, leading the way,
they enter into an <hi>Association</hi> amongst themselves for the Queens safety;
and it was well liked by the Queen, because she knew it was well meant,
although by some it was mistaken. Nevertheless, to take away all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
a Law is made in pursuance thereof,<note place="margin">27 Eliz. c. 1.</note> and so the work is reduced
under an ordinary rate, <hi>though the publick danger was such, as might well have
digested an extraordinary undertaking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intend not to enter into the particulars of these <hi>Treasons</hi> of the new
stamp, because they are but temporarie, and in their ultimate reach tend
onely to the safeguard of the Queens person, in order to the intentionary
sence of the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. although not within the explicite
words of that Law. Onely this is observable, that though the times
were full of malice, yet was not all malice looked upon as fatal, nor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expression thereof <hi>Treason,</hi> or <hi>privity</hi> thereto, although the Crown it
self was not a little concerned therein; but reduced to an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
called <hi>Misprision;</hi> as if they were willing rather to construe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
for mistakings, and thereby over-look much of the Malignity
of these Times, than to make strict inquisition into every <hi>Punctilio</hi> of
offence.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>Felony,</hi> the rules were various;<note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 20.</note> some were of a new O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
as that of <hi>Gypsies;</hi> others formerly such, afterwards laid aside,
are now revived with advantage, as <hi>Conjuration,</hi> and <hi>Buggery:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 16, 17.</note> But <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzelling</hi>
by Servants of their Masters Goods, made Felony for a time
by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, is by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made perpetual. Some
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64112:202"/>
                  <hi>Felonies</hi> are made such within a certain precinct,<note place="margin">2 Eliz. c. 29.</note> as <hi>Man-stealers,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Crimes upon the <hi>Scotish</hi> Borders.<note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 10.</note> Others formerly made <hi>Felony,</hi>
are now unmade; as that concerning Prophecies: and divers formerly
protected under the refuge of <hi>Clergie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> are now barred of that reserve;
such as are those that command, counsel, or hire others to commit <hi>petty
Treason, Murder,</hi> or <hi>Robbery, 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 4. Stealers of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Geldings,</hi> or <hi>Mares, 2 E. 6. cap. 33. Robbers of Houses, Booth or Tent,
by Day or Night, 5 E. cap. 9. Pick pockets, or Cut purses, 8 Eliz. cap. 4.
And Woman stealers, 39 Eliz. cap</hi> 9. And some Crimes made <hi>Felony</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachable
onely within a certain time, and not upon a cool suit. So as
upon the whole heap of Account, the zeal of the times will appear to be
more hot, by how much iniquity appeared more hainous; and that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men waxed worse, as the times waxed better. More particulars of
this nature, and of other Offences of inferiour note, might be superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;

All which might be insisted upon, if need were, to clear out yet
further the conclusion of the whole matter; which I hasten to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,

            <div n="40" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XL. A Summary Conclusion upon the whole matter.</head>
               <p>IN the stating of this whole account, I shall first glance upon the
natural Constitution of the people of <hi>England,</hi> and then gather up
the scattered Notions into one form; because the one doth not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
illustrate the other, and shew the same to be radical, and not by any
forced inoculation.</p>
               <p>The people are of a middle temper, according to their Climate: the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Melancholy, and the <hi>Southern</hi> Choler, meeting in their general Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
doth render them ingenious and active: which nourished also under
the wings of Liberty, inspires a Courage generous, and not soon out of breath.
Active they are, and so nigh to pure act, that nothing hurts them more than
much quiet; of which they had little experience from their first transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
till the time of King <hi>James;</hi> but ever were at work either in building
(as before the <hi>Norman</hi> times) or after in repairing their ruines occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by tempestuous pretensions from <hi>Rome</hi> and Foreign Princes, or by
Earthquakes of Civil Contention about the Title between the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> or intrenchments of the Crown upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the people. But King <hi>James</hi> conquering all enmity, spake
Peace abroad, and sang Lullaby at home. Yet like a dead calm in a hot
Spring, treasured up in store sad distempers against a back-Winter. Their
ingenuity will not allow them to be excellent at the Cheat; but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
subject in that kind to take than give: and supposing others as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
as themselves, are many times in Treaties over-matched by them
whom they over-match in Arms. Upon the same account they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imperious over those beneath, nor stubborn against them above;
but can well discern both person and time. Man, Woman, or Child,
all is one with them, they will honour <hi>Majesty</hi> where ever they see it.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64112:202"/>
And of the twain, tender it more when they see it set upon infirmity:
as if they knew how to command themselves onely in order to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, they love much to be <hi>free.</hi> When they were under
awe of the Popes Curse, they bore off designs by the head and shoulders;
but afterwards, by watchfulness and foresight: and having attained a
light in Religion, that will own their Liberties, of them both they make
up one Garland not to be touched by any rude hand; but as if it were
the bird of the eye, the whole body startles forthwith; the Alarm is
soon given and taken; and whether high or low, none are spared that
stand in their way. This they do owe to the <hi>Eastern</hi> people, from whom
they fetch their Pedegree. So as the onely way to conquer them, is to
let them have their <hi>Liberties;</hi> for like some Horses, they are good for
carriage, so long as their Burthens are easie, and sit loose upon them; but
if too close girt, they will break all, or cast their load, or die. And
therefore Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gained much to the Crown by fair carriage,
good words, and cleanly conveyance; which was not soon discovered, nor
easily parted with: But <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by height of spirit and great
noise; and therefore was no sooner off the Stage, but what was gotten
by the snatch was lost by the catch, and things soon returned into their
ancient posture again.</p>
               <p>The first Government of the people before their departure out of
<hi>Germany,</hi> was in the two States of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> The <hi>Clergie</hi> came
not into pomp and power till <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, and soon came to the height
of a <hi>third State</hi> appendent to the former, and so continued till <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth's time: Then they began to decay in power, and in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> time utterly lost the same; and so they can no longer be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>State,</hi> although they still keep state.</p>
               <p>The two States of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in their Transmigration, being
then in the nature of an Army of Souldiers, had a General by their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
under whom, after they had obtained a peaceable setling, they
named him anew by the name of <hi>Konning,</hi> or the Wise man; for then
was Wisdom more necessary than Valour. But after the <hi>Clergie</hi> had
won the day, and this <hi>Konning</hi> had submitted himself and his people to
their Ghostly Father, they baptized him by a new name of <hi>Rex;</hi> and so
he is stiled in all written Monuments which we owe onely to <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks;</hi>
although the vulgar held their appellation still, which by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or rather corruption, did at length arrive into the word <hi>King;</hi> a
notion which as often changeth the sence as the Air; some making the
person all in all, others some in all, and some nothing at all but a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of State. The <hi>Clergie</hi> gave him his Title in the first sence, and are
willing he should have a power over the Estates in order to their design,
which then was to rule the King, and by him all his People; he doing
what he listeth with them, and the <hi>Clergie</hi> the like with him. The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi>
take the word in the second sence; for though they had put upon
the Commonwealth one Head, and on that one Head one Crown, yet
unto that Head did belong many Eyes, and many Brains; and nothing
being done but by the <hi>common sense,</hi> a power is left to him much like to
that of the outward Members, <hi>Executory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In time of <hi>War,</hi> how unruly soever the humours be, yet must the
Law be his rule: He cannot engage the people either to make, continue,
or determine any <hi>offensive War</hi> without their consent; nor compel them
to arm themselves, nor command them out of their Counties for <hi>War,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64112:203"/>
or impose Military charge upon them against their free consent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the known Law.</p>
               <p>In calmer times much rather, he can neither make new Laws, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the old; form new Judicatories, Writs, Process, Judgements, or new
Executions, nor inable or disable any Conveyances of Estates. He may
seem possessed of more power in Church-government, yet, <hi>De jure,</hi> can
neither make nor alter Doctrine, or Worship, or Government in the
Church: nor grant Dispensations, or Licenses Ecclesiastical; nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of Jurisdiction, other than according to the Law. And as a close
to all, by one <hi>Oath</hi> taken at the Coronation, he not onely giveth to the
people security of the Peace and good Behaviour, but beareth witness
that he oweth <hi>Allegiance</hi> both to the Law and the People; different from
that of the peoples in this, That the King's <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to the Law
that is originally from the peoples <hi>Election;</hi> but the Peoples to the King,
under a Law of their own framing.</p>
               <p>This leadeth on the consideration of a higher degree of power than
that of Kings. For though <hi>Law,</hi> as touching morality in the general,
be of heavenly Birth; yet the positive Laws arising from common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concerning the Honour, Peace, and Profit of every Nation, are
formed by humane constitution, and are therefore called <hi>Honesta,</hi> or <hi>justa,</hi>
because by common vote they are so esteemed, and not because any one
man supposeth them to be such. The words of the Summons to the
Parliament doth hold for this, <hi>Quae de communi consilio ordinari contigerint;</hi>
and the words in the Coronation-oath, <hi>Quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> do speak no
less; whether they be taken in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eter perfect-tense, or the Future-tense,
the conclusion will be the same. True it is, that in all, Kings are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as present; yet is not that valuable in the point of Council, which is
the foundation of the positive Law. For as the best things under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are subject to infirmity; so Kings either short or beyond in Age or
Wit, or possibly given over to their lusts, or sick, or absent, (in all which
the name of a King adds little more to the Law than a sound) yet all the
while the Government is maintained with as much honour and power, as
under the most wise and well-disposed King that ever blessed Throne.</p>
               <p>This is done in the <hi>Convention of States,</hi> which in the first times consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of Individuals, rather than Specificals. The great men doubtless did
many things even before they saw the <hi>English</hi> shore; that <hi>Tacitus</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
yet in the <hi>publick Convention</hi> of all, did nothing alone, till of one
House they became two. The particular time of the separation is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and the occasion more: It may be the <hi>great Lords</hi> thought the
mysteries of State too sacred to be debated before the vulgar, lest they
should grow into curiosity: Possibly also might the <hi>Commons</hi> in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
wish the <hi>great men</hi> absent, that themselves might more freely vote
without angering their great Lords. Nevertheless the <hi>Royal assent</hi> is ever
given in the joynt Convention of all. But how a double <hi>Negative</hi> should
rest in the house of <hi>Lords,</hi> one originally in themselves, the other in the
sole person of the King, (whenas in no case is any Negative found upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
but a modest waring the answer of such things as the King likes
not) is to me a mystery, if it be not cleared by Usurpation. For it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
reach, why that which is once by the Representative of the People
determined to be <hi>Honestum,</hi> should be dis-determined by one or a few,
whose Counsels are for the most part but Notionary, and grounded upon
private inconveniencies, and not upon experimentals of most publick
concernment; or that the <hi>veult,</hi> or <hi>Soit fait,</hi> which formerly held the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64112:203"/>
room onely of a <hi>Manifesto</hi> of the <hi>Regal Will</hi> to execute the Law then made
(as his Coronation-Oath to execute all Laws formerly established) should
be taken to be a determination of the <hi>justness</hi> or <hi>honesty</hi> of the thing:
When as this <hi>Royal Assent</hi> is many times given by a King that knows no
difference between good and evil, and is never competent judge in matters
that in his opinion do fall into contradiction between his own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and the benefit of the people.</p>
               <p>However unequal it may seem, yet both that and other advantages
were gained by the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> after the separation was once made,
as many of the ancient Statutes (by them onely made) do sufficiently
hold forth: which although in the general they do concern matters of
<hi>Judicature,</hi> wherein the Lords originally had the greatest share; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things also escaped the <hi>Common Vote,</hi> which in after-ages they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into their consideration again. And the condition of the people in
those times did principally conduce hereunto: For until the <hi>Norman</hi> times
were somewhat setled, the former Ages had ever been uncertain in the
changes between War and Peace, which maintained the distance between
the Lords and their Tenants, and the authority of the one over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
savouring of the more absolute command in Law. And after that
the Sword was turned into the Plough-share, the distance is established by
compact of <hi>Tenure</hi> by Service, under peril of default, although in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degree; for the <hi>Service of a Knight,</hi> as more eminent in War, so in
Peace it raised the mind to regard of publick Peace: but <hi>the service of the
Plough</hi> supporting all, is underneath all, yet still under the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Free-men</hi> equally as the <hi>Knight. Peace</hi> now had scarcely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
its minority, before it brought forth the unhappy birth of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Kings would be more absolute, and <hi>Lords</hi> more Lordly; the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
left far behind, seldom come into mention amongst the publick Acts
of State, and as useless set aside. This was the lowest ebb that ever the
<hi>Commonage</hi> of <hi>England</hi> indured, which continued till Ambition brought
on Contention amongst the <hi>great men,</hi> and thence the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Commons</hi> parting asunder; some holding for the King, who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them Liberty from their <hi>Lords;</hi> others siding with the <hi>Lords,</hi> who
promised them Liberty from the <hi>King;</hi> they became so minded of their
<hi>Liberties,</hi> that in the conclusion they come off upon better advantage for
their <hi>Liberties</hi> than either <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lords,</hi> who all were losers before their
reckoning was fully made.</p>
               <p>These Wars had by experience made the King sensible of the smart of
the <hi>Lords</hi> great interest with the people, and pointed him to the pin upon
which the same did hang; to take which away, a design is contrived to
advance the value of the <hi>Commoners,</hi> and to level the <hi>Peerage,</hi> that they
both may draw in one equal yoke the Chariot of <hi>Prerogative.</hi> The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Commons</hi> in publick Councils was of some efficacy, but not much
honour, for their meetings were tumultuary; time brought forth a cure
hereof, the flowers of the people are by <hi>election</hi> sent to be the <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and so the <hi>Lords</hi> are match'd, if not over-match'd; the people less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the <hi>Lords,</hi> and more regarding themselves. This was but a dazle,
an Eclipse ensues; for Kings having duly eyed the nature of <hi>Tenure</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> look upon it as an Out-work or Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
in their way of approach: Their next endeavour is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to gain the <hi>Knighthood</hi> of <hi>England</hi> within the compass of their
own <hi>Fee,</hi> and so by priority to have their <hi>Service,</hi> as often as need
should require, by a trick in Law, as well for their own safety in time of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64112:204"/>
War, as for their benefit in time of Peace. This was a work of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
nature, and commended to Successors to accomplish by degrees,
that the whole <hi>Knighthood</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is become no more the <hi>Lords</hi> till
the Kings be first served. And thus the power of the People is wholly
devolved into the King's Command; and the Lords must now stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
having no other foundation than the affections of the People gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by beneficence of Neighbourhood and ordinary Society, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ingratiates the inferiour rank of men to those of higher degree,
especially such of them as affect to be popular. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh found
out this Sore, and taught his Successors the way to avoid that occasion
of Jealousie, by calling up such considerable men to attend the Court,
without other Wages but fruitless hopes; or under colour of honour to
be had by Kings from the presence of such great men in their great
Trains; or of other service of special note to be done onely by men of
so high accomplishment. And by this means <hi>Lordship,</hi> once bringing
therewith both Authority and Power unto Kings, before Kings grew jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of their greatness, in these latter days is become a meer Jelly; and
neither able to serve the interest of Kings (if the people should bestir
themselves) nor their own any longer. Henceforth the <hi>Commons</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> are no mean persons, and their <hi>Representative</hi> of such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if Kings will have them to observe him, he must serve them
with their Liberties and Laws: and every one the publick good of the
people. No man's work is beneath, no man's above it; the best honour
of the Kings work is to be <hi>Nobilis servitus,</hi>

            <head>A
VINDICATION
Of the ancient way of
PARLIAMENTS
In ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe more Words, the more Faults,</hi> is a divine Maxime, that hath
put a stop to the publishing of this Second Part for some time:
but observing the ordinary humour still drawing off, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a harsher Censure upon my intentions in my First Part than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
I do proceed to fulfil my course, that if Censure will be, it may
be upon better grounds, when the whole matter is before. Herein I shall
once more mind, that I meddle not with the Theological Right of Kings,
or other Powers, but with the Civil Right in Fact now in hand.
And because some mens Pens of late have ranged into a denial of the
<hi>Commons</hi> ancient Right in the <hi>Legislative</hi> power; and others, even to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
the Right both of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> therein, resolving all such
power into that one principle of a King, <hi>Quicquid libet, lìcet,</hi> so making
the breach much wider than at the beginning; I shall intend my course
against both. As touching the <hi>Commons</hi> Right, joyntly with the <hi>Lords,</hi>
it will be the main end of the whole; but as touching the <hi>Commons</hi> Right,
in competition with the <hi>Lords,</hi> I will first endeavour to remove out of
the way what I find pulished in a late Tractate concerning that matter, and
so proceed upon the whole.</p>
            <p>The subject of that Discourse consisteth of three parts; one to prove
that the ancient Parliaments, before the thirteenth Century, consisted
onely of those whom we now call the <hi>House of Lords;</hi> the other, that
both the <hi>Legislative</hi> and <hi>Judicial</hi> Power of the Parliament rested wholly
in them. Lastly, that <hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of Parliament, or
the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> were not known nor heard of till punier times
than these. This last will be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That their several Titles of
<hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses,</hi> were not known in Parliament till of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times: Nevertheless, it will be insisted upon, that the <hi>Commons</hi> were
then there. The second will be granted but in part, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Lords</hi>
had much power in Parliament in point of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> but neither the
sole, nor whole.</p>
            <p>The first is absolutely denied, neither is the same proved by any one
instance or pregnant ground in all that Book, and therefore not clearly
demonstrated by <hi>Histories</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> beyond contradiction, as the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-page
of that Book doth hold forth to the World. First, because not
one instance in all that Book is exclusive to the <hi>Commons;</hi> and so the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64112:205"/>
whole Argument of the Discourse will conclude, <hi>Ab Authoritate Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva,</hi>
which is no Argument in humane testimony at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The greatest number of instances in that Book, are by him
supposed to concern Parliaments, or General Councils of this Nation,
holden by the <hi>Representative</hi> thereof; whereas indeed they were either
but <hi>Synodical</hi> Conventions for Church-matters, whereunto the poor <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
(he well knoweth) might not come, unless in danger of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
dint; or if they did, yet had they no other work there, than to hear,
learn, and receive Laws from the <hi>Ecclesiasticks.</hi> And the <hi>Lords</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though present, yet under no other Notion were they, than as <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
to the King, whom they could not cast out of their <hi>Council,</hi> till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
though they often endeavoured it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Author of that <hi>Tractate</hi> also well knoweth, that <hi>Kings</hi>
usually made Grants and Infeodations by advice of the <hi>Lords,</hi> without
the aid of the Parliament: And it is no less true, that Kings with the
<hi>Lords,</hi> did in their several Ages exercise ordinarily <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> in cases of
<hi>distributive</hi> Justice; especially after the <hi>Norman</hi> entrance: For the step
was easie, from being Commanders in War, to be Lords in Peace; but
hard to lay down that power at the Foot of <hi>Justice,</hi> which they had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
in the rude times of the Sword, when men labour for Life rather
than Liberty; and no less difficult to make a difference between their
deportment in commanding of Souldiers, and governing of Countrymen;
till Peace by continuance had reduced them to a little more sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nor doth it seem irrational, that private differences between Party
and Party, should be determined in a more private way, than to trouble
the whole <hi>Representative</hi> of the Kingdom with matters of so mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
If then those <hi>Councils</hi> mentioned by the Author, which concern
the King's Grants, and Infeodations, and matters of Judicature, be taken
from the rest of the Precedents, brought by him, to maintain the thing
aimed at; I suppose scarce one Stone will be left for a Foundation to such
a glorying Structure, as is pretended in the Title-page of that Book: And
yet I deny not, but where such occasions have befaln, the Parliament sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
it hath closed with them, as things taken up by the way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It may be that the Author hath also observed, that all the
Records of Antiquity passed through (if not from) the hands of the
Clergie onely; and they might think it sufficient for them to honour
their Writings with the great Titles of men of Dignity in the Church
and Commonwealth, omitting the <hi>Commons,</hi> as not worthy of mention;
and yet they might be there then present, as it will appear they were,
in some of the particular instances ensuing, to which we come now in a
more punctual consideration.</p>
            <p>The first of these, by his own words, appear to be a <hi>Church-mote,</hi> or
<hi>Synod;</hi> it was in the year 673, called by the Archbishop, who had no
more power to summon a Parliament, than the Author himself hath:
And the several Conclusions made therein, do all shew that the <hi>People</hi>
had no work there, as may appear in the several Relations thereof made
by <hi>Matthew Westminster,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> an Author that he makes
much use of, and therefore I shall be bold to make the best use of him
that I can likewise, in vindicating the truth of the point in hand: For,
whatever this <hi>Council</hi> was, it is the less material, seeing the same Author
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64112:205"/>
recites a Precedent of <hi>Aethelbert,</hi> within six years after <hi>Austin</hi>'s entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Island, which was long before this <hi>Council,</hi> which bringeth on
the Van of all the rest of the Opponents Instances; which King called a
<hi>Council,</hi> stiled, <hi>Commune Concilium tam Cleri quam Populi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 126.</note> and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the same, a Law is made upon the like occasion, <hi>Si Rex Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Convocaverit, &amp;c.</hi> In both which it is evident, that in those times
there were <hi>Councils</hi> holden by the <hi>People,</hi> as well as by the <hi>Magnates</hi> or
<hi>Optimates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next instance is in the year 694, which is of a <hi>Council</hi> holden by
the <hi>Great men,</hi> but no mention of the <hi>Commons;</hi> and this he will have to
be a Parliament, albeit, that he might have found both Abbatesses, or
Women, and Presbyters, to be Members of that Assembly, and (for default
of better) attested the Conclusions of the same, notwithstanding the
Canon, <hi>Nemo militans Deo, &amp;c.</hi> But I must also mind him, that the same
Author reciteth a <hi>Council</hi> holden by King <hi>Ina, Suasu omnium Aldermanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
&amp; Seniorum, &amp; Sapientum Regni:</hi> and it is very probable, that <hi>all
the Wise men of the Kingdom</hi> were not included within the <hi>Lordly</hi> Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The third instance can have no better success, unless he will have the
Pope to be allowed power to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or allow the Archbishop
power to do that service by the Pope's command; for by that Authority
this (whatever it be) was called, if we give credit to the Relations of
Sir <hi>Henry Spelman;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. Pag. 212.</note> who also reciteth another <hi>Council</hi> within three leaves
foregoing this, called by <hi>Withered</hi> at <hi>Barkhamstead,</hi> unto which the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
were summoned, <hi>Qui cum viris utique militaribus communi omnium as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu
has leges decrevere:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 194</note> So as it seemeth in those times <hi>Souldiers</hi> or
<hi>Knights</hi> were in the Common Councils, as well as other <hi>Great Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, he bringeth in a <hi>Council</hi> holden in the year 747,
which (if the Archbishop were then therein President,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 242. 245.</note> as it is said, in the
presence of the King) was no <hi>Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Church-mote;</hi> and all the
Conclusions in the same do testifie no less, they being every one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ecclesiastical matters.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, before this time,<note place="margin">Pag. 219.</note> the Author out of whom he citeth
this <hi>Council,</hi> mentioneth another <hi>Council</hi> holden by <hi>Ina</hi> the Saxon-King,
in the presence of the Bishops, Princes, Lords, Earls, and all the <hi>wise old
men</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the Kingdom, all of them concluding of the intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between the <hi>Brittons, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> which formerly, as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
was not allowed. And the same King by his Charter, mentioned by
the same Penman, noteth that his endowment of the Monastery of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenbury</hi>
was made, not onely in the presence of the <hi>Great Men,</hi> but, <hi>Cumpraesentia
populationis;</hi> and he saith, that <hi>Omnes confirmaverunt:</hi> which I
do not mention as a work necessary to be done by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet
such an one as was holden expedient as the case then stood.</p>
            <p>Forty years after, he meeteth with another <hi>Council,</hi> which he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be a <hi>Parliament</hi> also, but was none, unless he will allow the Pope's
Legate power to summon a <hi>Parliament.</hi> It was holden in the year 787;
and had he duly considered the return made by the Pope's Legate of the
Acts of that <hi>Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 392.</note> which is also published by the same Author, he
might have found, that the Legate saith, <hi>That they were propounded in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Council, before the King, Archbishop, and all the Bishops and Abbots of
the Kingdom, Senators, Dukes, or Captains, and People of the Land, and they
all consented to keep the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:64112:206"/>
Then he brings in a <hi>Council</hi> holden in the year 792. which he would
never have set down in the List of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> if he had considered how
improper it is to construe <hi>Provinciale tenuit Concilium,</hi> for a <hi>Parliament;</hi>
and therefore I shall need no further to trouble the Reader therewith.</p>
            <p>The two next are supposed to be but one and the same; and it is said to
be <hi>holden</hi> Anno 974, <hi>before nine Kings fifteen Bishops, twenty Dukes,</hi> &amp;c. which
for ought appears, may comprehend all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and is no
<hi>Parliament</hi> of one Nation, but a Party of some Nations, for some great
matter, no doubt, yet nothing in particular mentioned, but the solemn
laying the Foundation of the Monastery of <hi>Saint Albans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What manner of <hi>Council</hi> the next was, appeareth not, and therefore
nothing can be concluded therefrom, but that it was holden in the year
797.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Council</hi> which is next produced, and in the year 800, and is called
in great Letters, <hi>Concilium Provinciale,</hi> which he cannot Grammatically
construe to be a <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet in the Preface it is said, that there were
<hi>Viri cujuscunque dignitatis:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 321.</note> and the King in his Letters to the Pope, saith
concerning it, <hi>Visum est cunctis gentis Nostrae sapientibus;</hi> so as it seemeth
by this, and other Examples of this nature, that though the <hi>Church-motes</hi>
invented the particular conclusions, yet it was left to the <hi>Wittagenmote</hi> to
judge and conclude them.</p>
            <p>There can be no question, but the next three Precedents brought by
the Opponent were all of them <hi>Church-mates:</hi> For the first of them,
which is said to be holden in the year 816,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. Pag. 318.</note> is called a <hi>Synod,</hi> and both
Priests and Deacons were there present, which are no Members of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
consisting onely of the <hi>House of Lords;</hi> and they all of them
did <hi>Pariter tractare de necessariis &amp; utilitatibus Ecclesiarum.</hi> The second
of them is called a <hi>Synodal Council,</hi> holden <hi>Anno</hi> 822, and yet there were
then present <hi>Omnium dignitatum Optimates;</hi> which cannot be understood
onely of those of the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> because they ought all to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
present, and therefore there is no <hi>Optimacy</hi> amongst them. The
last of these three is called <hi>Synodale Conciliabulum,</hi> a <hi>petty Synod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. Pag. 334.</note> in great
Letters: and besides, there were with the Bishops and Abbots many
<hi>wise men;</hi> and in all these respects it cannot be a <hi>Parliament</hi> onely of the
<hi>great Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Council,</hi> said to be holden in the year 823, cannot also be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
properly a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but onely a Consultation between two Kings
and their <hi>Council,</hi> to prevent the invasion of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and the attests
of the Kings Chaplain and his Scribe, do shew also that they were not all
Members of the <hi>House of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Council</hi> cited by the Opponent in the next place, was holden <hi>Anno</hi>
838, being onely in nature of a <hi>Council</hi> for <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Judicature,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the validity of the King's Grant made to the Church of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
which is no proper work for a <hi>Parliament,</hi> unless it befal during the
sitting of the same.</p>
            <p>The next is but a bare title of a <hi>Council,</hi> supposed to be holden <hi>Anno</hi>
850, and not worth its room; for it neither sheweth whether any thing
was concluded, nor what the Conclusions were.</p>
            <p>The work of the next <hi>Council,</hi> alleadged to be holden <hi>Anno</hi> 851, was
to confirm the Charter of the Monastery of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and to determine
concerning affairs belonging to the <hi>Mercians;</hi> and if it had been a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
for that people, it might be worthy of enquiry how regularly
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64112:206"/>
from the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> could sit amongst them, and attest the
Conclusions therein made, as well as the proper Members of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He cometh in the next place to a <hi>Council</hi> holden in the year 855, which
is more likely to be a <hi>Parliament</hi> than most of them formerly mentioned,
if the Tithes of all <hi>England</hi> were therein given to the Church; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have set down my opinion in the former part of the Discourse. And
though it be true, that no <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> are therein mentioned,
as the Opponent observeth out of the Title; yet if the body of the Laws
be duly considered, towards the Conclusion thereof it will appear, that
there was present <hi>Fidelium infinita multitudo, qui omnes regium Chirogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum
laudaverunt, Dignitates verò sua nomina subscripserunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. Pag. 350.</note> And yet the
<hi>Wittagenmotes</hi> in these times began to be rare, being continually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the invasions of the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three next <hi>Councils,</hi> alleadged to be in the years 930, 944, 948.
were doubtless of inferiour value, as the matters therein concluded were
of inferiour regard, being such as concern the passing of the Kings Grants,
Infeodations and Confirmations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Council</hi> mentioned to be in the year 965,<note place="margin">Concil Brit. Pag. 480.</note> is supposed to be one and
the same with the next foregoing, by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman;</hi> which calls it
self a <hi>General Council,</hi> not by reason of the general confluence of the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> but because all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> did then meet.
The <hi>Primi</hi> and <hi>Primates</hi> were there; who these were, is not mentioned,
but it is evident that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was there, and that both he and
divers that are called <hi>Ministri Regis,</hi> attested the Conclusions. It will be
difficult to make out how these should be Members of the <hi>House of Lords,</hi>
and more difficult to shew a reason why in the attesting of the Acts of
these <hi>Councils,</hi> which the Opponent calls <hi>Parliaments,</hi> we find so few of
the <hi>Laity,</hi> that scarce Twelve are mentioned in any one of them, and those
to descend so low as the <hi>Ministri Regis,</hi> to make up the number.</p>
            <p>Five more of these instances remain, before the coming of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of which was in the year 975, and in a time when no <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
according to the Opponents principles,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. Pag. 490.</note> could sit; for it was an
<hi>Inter-Regnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two next were onely <hi>Synods</hi> to determine the difference between
the Regulars and the Seculars, in the King's absence, by reason that he
was under age; and they are said to be in the year 977, and 1009. But
it is not within the compass of my matter to debate their dates.</p>
            <p>The last two were Meetings or Courts for <hi>Judicature,</hi> to determine
the Crime of Treason; which every one knows is determinable by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Courts before the high Steward of Judges, and therefore not so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> as to be made an Argument of its existence. And
thus are we at an end of all the instances brought by the Opponent to
prove that <hi>Parliaments before the</hi> Norman <hi>times consisted of those whom we
now call the House of Lords.</hi> All which I shall shut up with two other
Notes taken out of the Book of <hi>Councils,</hi> published by Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of which concerneth a Grant made by <hi>Canutus,</hi> of an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to the Abbey of <hi>Bury</hi> Saint <hi>Edmunds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 534.</note> in a Council wherein were

consentientes.</hi> The other taken out of the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Laws, which tell us,
that Tythes were granted to the Church,<note place="margin">Pag. 621.</note> 
               <hi>A Rege, Baronibus, &amp; Populo.</hi>
And thus I shall leave these Testimonies to debate with one another, whilst
the Reader may judge as seemeth most equal to himself.</p>
            <p>Being thus come to the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and those ensuing; I shall more
summarily proceed with the particulars concerning them, because they
were times of Force, and can give little or no evidence against the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
rightly setled in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, which I have more particularly
insisted upon, that the Original Constitution of this Government may the
better appear. Now for the more speedy manifesting of the truth in the
particulars following, I shall pre-advise the Reader in three particulars.</p>
            <p>First, that the <hi>Church-motes</hi> grew more in Power and Honour by the
aid of the <hi>Normans</hi> Law, refusing the concurrence and personal presence
of Kings, whom at length they excluded from their <hi>Councils</hi> with all his
<hi>Nobles;</hi> and therefore it is the less wonder, if we hear but little of the
<hi>Commons</hi> joyning with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Norman</hi> way of Government grew more <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
than the <hi>Saxon,</hi> making the <hi>Lords</hi> the chief Instruments of keeping
<hi>Kings</hi> above, and <hi>People</hi> underneath; and thus we meet with much noise
of meetings between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> and little concerning the grand
meetings of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Representative</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> although
some foot-steps we find even of them also. For the <hi>Kings</hi> were mistaken
in the <hi>Lords,</hi> who meaned nothing less than to serve them with the
<hi>Peoples</hi> Liberties, together with their own, which they saw wrapped up
in the gross.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By this means the <hi>Councils</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> grew po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
not onely for advice in particular occasions, but in matters of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
and declaring of Law, ordering of Process in Courts of Pleas;
which in the first framing were the works of the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned men,</hi>
but being once setled, become part of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of every <hi>Freeman.</hi>
And it is not to be doubted but these <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> did outreach into
things too great for them to manage, and kept the <hi>Commons</hi> out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of their right, during the present heat of their ruffling condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet all this while could not take absolute possession of their <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to the remainder of the particular instances produced by
the Opponent, which I shall reduce into several <hi>Categories,</hi> for the more
clear satisfaction to the Reader, with less tediousness.</p>
            <p>First, It cannot be denied but the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> gave <hi>advice</hi> to Kings
in cases of particular emergency; nor is it incongruous to the course of
Government, even to this day; nor is it meet that the <hi>Parliament</hi> should
be troubled with every such occasion: and therefore the giving of <hi>advice</hi> to
<hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, what course he should take to settle the Laws of
<hi>England</hi> according to the instances in <hi>Councils</hi> holden <hi>An.</hi> 1060, and 1007.
and <hi>to gain favour of the great men,</hi> according to that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1106. and <hi>in
the manner of endowment of the Abbey of</hi> Battel, as in pag. 25 of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
Discourse: and <hi>what to do upon the reading of the Pope's Letter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1114. And <hi>whether the Pope's Legate should be
admitted,</hi> as in pag. 18. And <hi>how King</hi> Stephen <hi>and</hi> Henry <hi>shall come to
an Agreement,</hi> as <hi>Anno</hi> 1153. And <hi>how to execute Laws by Judges and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64112:207"/>
Justices</hi> Itinerant, as <hi>Anno</hi> 1176. And <hi>touching the manner of ingaging for
a Voyage by</hi> Croisado <hi>to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Anno</hi> 1189. And <hi>to give answer to
Embassadors of a Foreign Prince,</hi> pag. 25. And <hi>how King</hi> John <hi>shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Peace with the Pope, Anno</hi> 1213.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> Where nevertheless, <hi>Matth. Paris</hi>
saith, was <hi>Turba multa nimis.</hi> I say, all these might well be done by a
<hi>Council of Lords,</hi> and not in any posture of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> albeit that in
none of all these doth any thing appear, but that the <hi>Commons</hi> might be
present in every one, or many of them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As touching <hi>Judicature,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> had much power therein,
even in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, having better opportunities for Knowledge and
Learning, especially joyned with the <hi>Clergie,</hi> than the <hi>Commons</hi> in those
times of deep darkness, wherein even the <hi>Clergie</hi> wanted not their share,
as in the first part of the Discourse I have already observed. Whatsoever
then might be done by Judges in ordinary Courts of <hi>Judicature,</hi> is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the regard of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and therefore <hi>the Plea between
the Archbishop and</hi> Ethelstan <hi>concerning Land,</hi> instanced <hi>Anno</hi> 1070. And
<hi>between</hi> Lanfrank <hi>and</hi> Odo, <hi>Anno</hi> 1071. And <hi>between the King and</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme,
<hi>pag.</hi> 15, 16. And <hi>the determining of the Treason of</hi> John (afterwards
King) <hi>against his Lord King</hi> Richard, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. And the difference <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the title of a Barony between</hi> Mowbray <hi>and</hi> Scotvile, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. And <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of security of good behaviour by</hi> William Brawse <hi>to King</hi> John, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.
All these might well be determined onely before the <hi>Lords,</hi> and yet the
<hi>Parliament</hi> might be then sitting or not sitting; as the contrary to either
doth not appear, and therefore can these form no demonstrative ground
to prove that the <hi>Parliament</hi> consisted in those times, onely of such as we
now call the <hi>House of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third work whereby the Opponent would prove the Parliament to
consist onely of the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> is, because he findeth many things
by them concluded touching the <hi>solemnization,</hi> and the setling of
the <hi>Succession of Kings;</hi> both which, he saith, were done by the <hi>Lords in
Parliament,</hi> or those of that House; and I shall crave leave to conclude
the contrary: For neither is the <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Solemnization</hi> of such Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
a proper work of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to the Opponents prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
nor can they prove such Conventions wherein they were to be,
<hi>Parliaments.</hi> Not the <hi>Election</hi> of Kings, for then may a <hi>Parliament</hi> be
without a <hi>King;</hi> and therefore that instance concerning <hi>William Rufus,
pag.</hi> 16 will fail, or the Opponents Principles, who will have no <hi>Parliament</hi>
without a <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like may also be said of the instance concerning King <hi>Steven,
pag.</hi> 18. Much less can the <hi>Solemnization</hi> of the Election by Coronation
be a proper work for the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Nevertheless, the Opponent doth
well know that both the <hi>Election</hi> of a King, and the <hi>Solemnization</hi> of
such Election by Coronation, are Spiritless motions without the presence
of the <hi>people;</hi> and therefore though his instance, pag. 17, concerning the
<hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the First by the Bishops and Princes, may seem to be
restrictive as to them, yet it is not such in fact; if <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> may
be believed, who telleth us, that in the <hi>Conventus omnium</hi> was <hi>Clerus</hi> and
<hi>Populus universus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> and might have been noted by the Opponent out of
that Learned Antiquary so often by him cited, if he had pleased to take
notice of such matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:64112:208"/>
A Fourth sort of Instances concerneth <hi>matters Ecclesiastical,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Canons;</hi> and hereof enough hath been already said, that such
Work was absolutely challenged by the <hi>Church-motes</hi> as their proper
Work; and therefore the Instance, pag. 16, 17. of the <hi>Council</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi>
the First's time, and the <hi>Canons</hi> made by the Bishops there; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called by <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and instanced by the
Opponent, pag. 19. I say, both these do fail in the Conclusion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, as touching the most proper Work of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is
the <hi>making of Laws concerning the Liberties and Benefit of the people;</hi>
the Opponent produceth not one instance concerning the same, which
doth not conclude contrary to the Proposal; for as touching those two
instances in his Thirteenth page, <hi>Anno</hi> 1060, they concern not the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Laws,</hi> but the reviving of such as had been disused formerly;
which might well enough be done by a private <hi>Council.</hi> But as to that
in his Fifteenth page, of the Law made by the Conquerour concerning
<hi>Remigius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> although it be true, that we find not the
particular Titles of <hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yet besides the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of Archbishops, Bishops, and Princes, we find the <hi>Common Council;</hi>
for so the words are, <hi>Communi Concilio, &amp; Concilio Archiepiscoporum, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscoporum,
Abatum, &amp; omnium Principum;</hi> although the Opponent would
seem to wave these words, <hi>Et Concilio,</hi> by putting them in a small Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and the rest in Great Letters,<note place="margin">Tit. Honour, pag. 709.</note> that the Readers eyes might be sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with them, and overlook the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the instance of the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Clarindon,</hi> in his Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
page, which he citeth out of <hi>Matthew Paris, Matthew Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> although he pleaseth to mention the several ranks of
<hi>Great Men,</hi> and those in black Letters of a greater size; and saith, That
<hi>not one Commoner appears;</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Hoveden,</hi> in that very place
so often by the Opponent cited, tells him, that both <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi>
were there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Opponent citeth an instance of Laws made by <hi>Richard</hi>
the First, in his Twenty fourth page; and he setteth down the several
Ranks of <hi>Great Men,</hi> and amongst the rest, ingeniously mentioneth
<hi>Milites;</hi> but it is with a Gloss of his own, that they were <hi>Barons</hi> that
were made <hi>Knights,</hi> whenas formerly <hi>Barons</hi> were mentioned in the
general; and therefore how proper this Gloss is, let others judge; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing that not onely <hi>Milites,</hi> and <hi>Milites Gregarii,</hi> but even <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistri,</hi>
were present in such Conventions, even in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times: And
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the former known place mentioneth an Observation, that
<hi>Vniversi personae qui de Rege tenent in Capite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. Honour, pag. 703.</note> 
               <hi>sicut caeteri Barones debent
interesse judiciis curiae Domini Regis cum Baronibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He citeth in his Twenty fifth page another instance in King
<hi>John</hi>'s time, in which, after the <hi>assent of Earls and Barons,</hi> the words
<hi>Et omnium fidelium nostrorum</hi> are also annexed, but with this conceit of
the Oponents, that these <hi>Fideles</hi> were those that adhered to the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Enemies: be it so, for then the <hi>Commons</hi> were present, and
did <hi>assent;</hi> or they may be, saith he, <hi>some specially summoned as Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;</hi>
take that also, and then all the <hi>true-hearted</hi> in the Kingdom
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64112:208"/>
were specially summoned, and were there; so as the conclusion will be the
same.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, he cited a strange Precedent (as he calls it) of a Writ of
Summons in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, in his Twenty seventh page, wherein <hi>Omnes
Milites</hi> were summoned, <hi>Cum armis suis;</hi> and he concludes therefore the
same was a <hi>Council of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Because they were to come armed.</hi> It is very true; and so they did
unto the <hi>Councils</hi> in the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and so the Knights of the
Counties ought to do in these days, if they obey the Writ, <hi>Duos Milites
gladiis cinctos, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he saith, that the <hi>Knights</hi> were not to come to <hi>Council.</hi> That
is his opinion; yet the Writ speaks, that the <hi>Discreti Milites</hi> were to
come, <hi>Ad loquendum cum Rege de negotiis regni:</hi> It is true, saith he, but not
<hi>Ad tractandum, &amp; faciendum, &amp; consentiendum.</hi> It is true, it is not so said,
nor is it excluded; and were it so, yet the Opponents conclusion will
not thence arise, <hi>That none but the King, and those who are of the House of
Lords, were there present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sixth and last instance mentioned by the Opponent, is in his Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
page, and concerneth <hi>Escuage</hi> granted to King <hi>John,</hi> who by
his Charter granted, <hi>That in such cases he would summon Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and the greater Barons, unto such Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by special Writs; and that the Sheriff shall summon promiscuously all
others which hold in</hi> Capite: and thence he concludes, That <hi>none but
the Great Lords, and the Tenants in</hi> Capite (whom he calls the <hi>les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Barons) were present; but no Knights, Citizens, or Burgesses:</hi> all
which being granted, yet in full Parliament the <hi>Citizens</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi>
might be there. For <hi>Councils</hi> were called of such persons as suited to the
matter to be debated upon.</p>
            <p>If for matters purely <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council of Lords,</hi>
and the <hi>Church-men,</hi> made up the <hi>Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If for advice in emergencies, the King and such Lords as were next at
hand determined the conclusions.</p>
            <p>If for <hi>Escuage,</hi> the King and such as were to pay <hi>Escuage,</hi> made
up a <hi>Council</hi> to ascertain the sum, which was otherwise uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>If for matters that concerned the <hi>common Liberty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Littler. lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> all sorts were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as may appear out of the very Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> noted in
my former discourse,<note place="margin">Brit. p. 122.</note> page 258. and also from an Observation of
<hi>Cambden</hi> concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Ad summum honorem pertinet,</hi>
(said he) <hi>Ex quo Rex</hi> Henricus <hi>Tertius, ex tanta multitudine quae se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiosa
ac turbulentia fuit, optimos quosque ad Comitia Parliamentaria e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocaverit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Opponent takes that for granted that never will be,
viz. <hi>That all the Kings Tenants</hi> In Capite <hi>were of the House of Lords;</hi>
whenas himself acknowledgeth a difference, page 28. <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
are summoned by Writs, <hi>sigillatim,</hi> as all the Members of the <hi>House
of Lords</hi> are; but these are by general Summons, their number great;
and hard it will be to understand, how, or when, they came to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:64112:209"/>
I shall insist no further upon the particulars of this Tractate, but demur
upon the whole matter, and leave it to Judgement upon the Premises,
which might have been much better reduced to the main Conclusion,
if the Opponent, in the first place, had defined the word <hi>PARLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AMENT:</hi>
For it was a Convention without the <hi>People,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without the <hi>KING,</hi> as in the Cases formerly mentioned, of
the <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> And if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> onely may be against the King, and so
without <hi>King</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> as in the Case between <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Maud</hi> the
Empress; and the Case likewise concerning King <hi>John,</hi> both which also
were formerly mentioned; All this is no more to the Government, than
it would be, should at any time the <hi>Commons</hi> hold a Parliament without
a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>House of Lords:</hi> and then all the Opponents labour is to little
purpose.</p>
