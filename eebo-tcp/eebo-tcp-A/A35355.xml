         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our native Countrey (the County of <hi>Kent)</hi> hath many
obligations of much due reſpect unto you, for your prudent
and valiant actings formerly, and at preſent, for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and ſafety thereof. And your courteous reſpests to
all, and to my Father in ſpecial (heretofore and lately, in
that you were pleaſed to honour him, by calling on him to
accompany you, when you ſurveyed the places of danger for landing a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
enemy along the Sea-coaſts in the Iſle of <hi>Tanet,</hi> which lies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
the Coaſts of <hi>Flanders.)</hi> And your undeſerved favours to my
ſelf, have encouraged me to preſume of, and crave your worthy Patronage
of the enſuing Apologie, which the law of filial love and duty hath compelled
me to write, in the ſpeedy and neceſſary defence of my aged Father, whoſe
Miniſterial imploiments will not give him leiſure to do it with his own pen:
I do unfeignedly profeſs it rather a grief, than any delight to me, that (upon
this occaſion) I am neceſſitated to publiſh that any ſuch ſavages, as are here
deſcribed ſhould be found in <hi>Old-England,</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after
ſo long continued gracious means of extraordinary civility and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But hereby may be ſeen in what ignorant, barbarous, profane condition,
Prelates, and Dean and Chapter, Non-reſident Doctors <hi>(à non docendo)</hi>
and their ignorant, drnnken, leud Curates, have left people, which is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſad caſe of many Pariſhes, as hundreds of faithful Miniſters have
found by wofull experience. But it is apparent, that the All-ſeeing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God will not have the Perſecutions and Oppreſſions herein recited to be
buried in the grave of ſilence and oblivion, ſeeing a publick diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is called for exraordinarily, and neceſſited and extorted, not only by open
ſlanders, by written and printed Libels, but by publick revealings, and loud
boaſtings of ſecret actings of enemies, by enemies themſelves; all which could
not but be made uſe of, without diſhonour to God, and injury to Juſtice it
ſelf. For thoſe that have made lies their refuge, and calumnies the weapons
of their rage against my Father, and have by a confederacy withheld all
their Tythes wholly from him, for above three years laſt paſt, do grow now
more than ever publickly clamorous againſt him. And their malice is grown
to that monſtrous height of rage, that it hath ſo blinded the little common
<pb facs="tcp:61104:3"/>
reaſon that was left in them, that they have preſumed impudently (diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
the merits of their cauſe) to paſs by his Highneſſes worthy Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for ejecting of ignorant and ſcandalous Miniſters, and to wave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, and have petitioned againſt him to his Highneſſe himſelf; upon
what grounds, fancies or vain hopes, they only know; But this is certainly
known, that in their boaſtings (before they have put on their armour) they
vaunt much of their potent military friends: But I am conſident none of
thoſe worthies will ingage againſt my Father, but caſhier them out of their
good affections, when they are informed of the truth, by the enſuing defenſive
Narrative, which is my Fathers defenſive weapon, which their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Alarm have forced him to arm himſelf withall, and to ſtand upon his
guard and defence, to prevent the ruine of his good Name and Family,
which nearly concerns me in particular, who am a ſouldier alſo at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in commiſſion for the preſent State. And this cauſe is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
than is at firſt conceived, not only to him, but to the publick;
And Gods glory is much concerned in it: For if his adverſaries could by
ſubtilty prevail to have him ſacrificed to their malice &amp; covetouſnes, by the
hands of abuſed Juſtice and Authority: It would not only prove his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ruine, but much encourage the mutinous enemies of Reformation to
endleſs oppoſitions, and perſecutions of faithful Miniſters, and would
diſcourage Miniſters to be faithful, for fear of ruine, for want of juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
from the Higher Powers, to which they adhere in the cauſe of God:
which is not written out of fear of any ſuch thing, which his adverſaries are
ſo confident of, to take effect againſt him; as of old againſt abſent <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth;</hi>
And although means of defence and preſervation are to be uſed,
and to this end the enſuing Apologetical Hiſtory, or Hiſtorical Apologie is
written, concerning things that have not been acted in a corner, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and lately, and are notorious, and will not be denied: Yet (as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi>

Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice, and who puls down mighty

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Perſecutors of faithfull Miniſters in theſe times, may
behold as in a glaſſe, the vileneſſe of their ſinne, and
the great diſpleaſure of God againſt them for it: If
they look into the Scripture, or later Hiſtories, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
experience. We read (2 <hi>Chron</hi> 36. 14, 15.) <hi>And
the Lord God of their Fathers ſent unto them by his Meſſengers, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up betimes, and ſending them: becauſe he had compaſſion on his houſe,
and on his dwelling place: But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and
deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of God
aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy: Therefore he brought
upon them the King of the Chaldees, who ſlow their young men with the
ſword, in the houſe of their Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the Prophets of God, but dogs licked up the bloud of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
after he was ſlain, and dogs did eat perſecuting <hi>Jezabel.</hi> The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which did mock, and miſcall <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet and Miniſter of
God, were two and fourty of them torn in pieces by wilde Bears
(2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.) They were the children of Perſecutors of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and ſpake their parents language. The Perſecutors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come let us deviſe devices againſt Jeremiah,
let us ſmite him with the tongue</hi> (Jer. 18. 18.) <hi>Therefore God delivered
up their children to the famine, and their bloud was poured out by force of
the ſword.</hi> Thoſe that perſecuted our Saviour the great Shepherd, and
did perſwade people not to hear him preach, ſaying, <hi>He is mad, and
hath a Devil, why hear ye him?</hi> (Joh. 10. 20.) <hi>and would ſtone him,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61104:4"/>
though he ſpake as never man ſpake, and did works which never man did:</hi>
yet they having begun to perſecute him, did ſinne againſt the light of
their own conſcience, and againſt the holy Ghoſt, to make good their
begun acts, and hold up their reputation, and did perſecute him to
the death: What became of thoſe perſecutors? Is not their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
eternal in hell for their unpardonable ſinne? <hi>Alexender</hi> the
Copperſmith, and other Perſecutors of the Apoſtles have their woful
reward, though they clamoured and articled againſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> as a
<hi>peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe things are written
for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> and teach
Miniſters now for their comfort what Chriſt ſpake, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when
men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you; for ſo perſecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that were before you; And if they have perſecuted me they will alſo
perſecute you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome men will not be warned by other mens harms, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
therefore they are made examples to others. Our late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and their Adherents are a rare and remarkable preſident of
Gods Judgments on Perſecutors of faithfull Miniſters, which ſin made
them ripe for their deſerved downfall: But their Perſecutions ended
at the beginning of the long Parliament: Then the iron teeth of thoſe
beaſts were knockt out, and the iron yoaks, which they had put on
Miniſters necks were all pull'd off: But when the Eccleſiaſtical Courts
were taken away, the people took lawleſſe liberty to themſelves, to
put (as it were) a hogs yoak on Miniſters necks, and did perſecute
faithful Miniſters ſent unto them, as ſheep among wolves: Oh what
woorying and wearying out moſt precious Miniſters by word and
deed, by tearing and tugging, lyings and ſlanderings, revilings and
defraudings, and withholding their maintenance by confederacy!
And theſe Perſecutions (eſpecially in point of maintenance) continue
very great at this day all the Nation over; people being encouraged
hereunto, for want of better Laws for Tything, and of more ſpeedy
execution of juſtice, according to the Laws that are in force. Many
hundreds of faithfull Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> may juſtly write ſuch books
againſt their Perſecutors, to awaken the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, and
warn Perſecutors, againſt whom their cries are gone up to Heaven,
and have brought down vengeance upon very many: And their
complaints and moans by words are daily heard, and may be read,
ſome in print, and in their Bils againſt thouſands in the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
where relief is certain, but ſo long waited for, that in the
mean time the poor Miniſters and their families periſh; And oft-times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61104:4"/>
the parties, or witneſſes, or both die, or the Tyth-robber breaks,
and runs the Countrey, which is uſuall, before the Cauſe come to
hearing. I could ſhew Perſecutors many very freſh examples of their
ſinne, and of puniſhments on people, that have lately perſecuted
faithfull Miniſters in ſeveral Pariſhes, as that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>E. K.</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi>

               <hi>Vincent</hi> a godly able Miniſter, who was
ſent thither by the Parliament, and perſecuted him otherwiſe: But
the Perſecutor perſecuted himſelf a little after by laying violent hands
on himſelf, and was a ſelf-executioner by hanging himſelf. This and
many ſuch bleeding examples may be produced touching the hand of
God againſt ſuch Perſecutors, enough to fill volumes. But I ſhall

               <hi>Richard Culmer</hi> (hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Maſter of Arts, and) now
Miniſter of <hi>Mynſter</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi>
whoſe Perſecutors are now very few living in that Pariſh; but mighty
and numerous elſwhere; even thoſe of the Popiſh, Prelatical and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
Party that never ſaw him, becauſe of his activeneſſe againſt
their Cauſe. They have printed two libellous Books againſt him, and
often articled againſt him, and raiſed Perſecution againſt him to the
ſhedding of his bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the enſuing Hiſtory ſhews; And to
have their wils againſt him (if it be poſſible, to ruine him) they have
lately petitioned againſt him to his Highneſſe himſelf, and ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
boaſted againſt him in their confidence now to prevail againſt
him; which hath cauſed this Apology to be publiſhed in his juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and for vindication of the truth. This man after he left the
free Grammer-ſchool at <hi>Canterbury</hi> (being <hi>ſenior</hi> of all that School,
then conſiſting of above two hundred Scholars, in the time of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Raven,</hi> the King of Schoolmaſters, as he was deſervedly ſtyled at
his Funeral, an eminent, godly, learned, yet perſecuted and ſilenced
Miniſter) lived about eight years a Student in <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledge in
<hi>Cambridge.</hi> And being afterwards Miniſter of <hi>Goodneſtone</hi> in <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Kent,</hi>
was perſecuted from thence by Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> only for
refuſing to publiſh the Kings Book for Sabbath-recreations: (See the
Hiſtory of that Arch-biſhops Tryal in the Index letter <hi>C. Culmer.)</hi>
And he continued three years and ſeven moneths ſilenced before the
firſt Parliament was called; In all which time he got not one farthing
by his Miniſtry, having ſeven children ſo little, that he could, and did
carry them all at once on his back: And (to adde to his Perſecutions
by the Prelate) he was perſecuted by the Patroneſſe M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>P.</hi> (whoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61104:5"/>
Poſterity hath felt ſome reward of Perſecution) who immediately
upon his ſilencing gave his Living away to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>A. H.</hi> who for lucre of
that Benefice, did joyn in the Perſecution, and did publiſh that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Book in that Pariſh Church on the Sabbath-day, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer;</hi> and of the people there: But a year after he
loſt his goods by fire, and the next year he himſelf was drowned in
the water. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>D.</hi> (yet living) then Curate to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rocheſter</hi> at <hi>Barham,</hi> did that Sabbath alſo publiſh in the Church at
<hi>Goodneſtone</hi> the unjuſt Decree of Suſpenſion made againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi>
in the Arch-biſhops Eccleſiaſtical Court, by the Arch biſhops ſpecial
Order and Command to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>N. B.</hi> But a little after this, the people of
<hi>Barham</hi> fell to dancing on the Sabbath, and a quarrel aroſe about a
wager between two dancers, and he that won the wager had his brains
knockt out that Sabbath.</p>
            <p>But at the firſt coming in of the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> the perſecuting
Arch-biſhop (who a little after was beheaded at Tower-hill for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> preſently abſolved M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> who might juſtly ſay, Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy
good <hi>Scot</hi> for his Abſolution. And he being at liberty to
preach, was preſently called by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robert Auſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in</hi> (now living) to be
his Aſſiſtant at <hi>Harbledown</hi> near <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where he preached di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
years, and had very many Auditors from that famous City. But
there alſo he was perſecuted for his actings againſt drunkenneſſe, and
againſt prophaning the Sabbath by Crickit playing before his door, to
ſpite him, which when he had reproved privately and publickly, they
removed that ſport to a field near the Woods, where they threw
ſtones at his Sonnes, whom he ſent to ſee if they played there; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
publick reproof, the Church-warden (whoſe wiſe was for juſt cauſe
denied the Sacrament) bought boards to keep the people of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
out of the Church Seats. And the grandee Perſecutor <hi>J. W.</hi>
uſed to go with his crew of brawlers and railers, his wife eſpecially,
upon the Sabbath to the Parſonage-houſe, and there did clamour and
bawl to the Doctor to move him, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> might preach no
more there; and one of them <hi>S. S.</hi> cried out, ſaying, <hi>It is a ſhame
to ſpeak what he hath done;</hi> and being asked by the Doctor, what
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> had done, the only anſwer of the accuſer was, <hi>Why was he
turned out of</hi> Goodneſtone? And being urged to ſpeak what he could
ſay more, he could not alledge any thing elſe: By this the Magiſtrate
may ſee, that ſome people are like a kennel of Hounds, that will bark
for company; if one or two bark againſt a Miniſter, then preſently one
and all, right or wrong: as of old they all cried, <hi>Not him,</hi> they all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61104:5"/>
cried, <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> &amp;c. The upholding of the noiſe and cry was, <hi>Oh
our ſouls, our ſouls, will you damn our ſouls! we cannot edifie by one
we love not:</hi> But when their clamours prevailed not, they writ Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> as followeth, <hi>That he refuſeth to adminiſter the
Sacrament according to the Church of</hi> England: <hi>That he raiſed ſcandals
of the Pariſh in the Pulpit: That he made differences between Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
That ſome refuſe to hear him, and others declare they cannot edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by him.</hi> Theſe, and only theſe Articles they exhibited to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
who having heard all things objected againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> gave
them an anſwer, that what they objected he found either frivolous,
or falſe; And he reproved a rich widow M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>R,</hi> who being asked,
Why ſhe clamoured? her only Anſwer was, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> had
ſaid to the Overſeers of the poor, that he wondered that ſhe refuſed
to pay her aſſeſſement of 2<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. to the poor. But the Doctor being
elſewhere provided of a Benefice, wholly left that place to the Patron,
who placed a Miniſter there; And when they were told a little after,
that they had made a ſorry exchange in the room of M <hi>Culmer;</hi> It was
anſwered, <hi>We care not whom we have, n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w we are rid of M.</hi> Culmer: But
what is become of thoſe Perſecutors of M. <hi>Culmer</hi> is famouſly known:
One of them <hi>E. Br.</hi> (becauſe M <hi>Culmer</hi> would not give him the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
immediately after he had been drunk, and did purſue his wife
with a drawn ſword, did thereupon write a Petition againſt M. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
and went about the Pariſh to get Subſcriptions to it) was a little
after found guilty of Felony, and was burnt in the hand at the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And you may now finde the Grandee Perſecutor
<hi>J. W.</hi> in the Goal at <hi>Canterbury</hi> (his ſonne uſed to threſh Corn on
the Sabbath mornings for fodder:) And now after the death of two
Miniſters, the third (having little encouragement amongſt them) left
them deſtitute. And after M. <hi>Culmer</hi> leſt preaching at <hi>Harbledown,</hi>
he preached in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and there he and other Miniſters were
appointed by Authority or Parliament, to detect, and cauſe to be
demoliſhed the ſuperſtitious Inſcriptions, and Idolatrous Monuments,
in the Cathedral in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> And when they came to the great
high priz'd moſt idolatrous Window, in the Chappel of <hi>Thomas
Becket,</hi> in that Cathedral (the Labourers, not acting as was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
M. <hi>Culmer</hi> laid, <hi>If we neglect this opportunity, we may repent it;</hi>
and thereupon threw off his Cloak, and took a whole Pike in his
hand, and went up a Ladder fifty ſix ſteps high, and did full executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Idolatrous Monuments there: whereupon ſome ſtirres
began, a Prebends wife cried out, <hi>Save the childe,</hi> meaning Chriſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61104:6"/>
lying in the Manger pictured there; and M. <hi>Culmers</hi> bloud was then
threatned by ſome that ſtood without the iron grates, in the body of
the Church: But M. <hi>John Lade</hi> then Maior of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſent a
file of Muſqueteers, who conveyed Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſafe home to
his own houſe. And a little after M. <hi>Culmer</hi> publiſhed a Book
entituled, <hi>Cathedral News from Canterbury,</hi> which is a true Hiſtory
of the ſins and plagues of that Cathedral <hi>Babel;</hi> The Title page of
that Book is, <hi>Cathedral News from Canterbury, ſhewing the Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burian
Cathedral to be in an. Abbey like corrupt and rotten condition,
which cals for a ſpeedy Reformation or Diſſolution, which Diſſolution is
already foreſhewn, and begun there by many remarkable Paſſages upon that
place, and the Prelates there: Recorded and publiſhed by</hi> Richard Culmer
<hi>Miniſter of Gods Word, dwelling in</hi> Canterbury, <hi>heretofore of</hi> Magdalen
<hi>Colledge in</hi> Cambridge, <hi>Maſter of Arts:</hi> If I ſhould hold my peace
the ſtones would immediately cry out, <hi>Luk. 19. 40. Imprimatur</hi> John

obſerve, that the hand of Providence hath indeed wrought a new thing in

            <p>But this Book being the finger in the Bile, and ſwelling Ulcer of
Prelacy and Cathedrals; Immediately upon the firſt publiſhing of it,
the neſt of Cathedral Hornets at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and their waſpiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

                  <p>I Do herewith preſent unto you M. <hi>Richard Culmer,</hi> a Miniſter of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> who though I cannot properly ſay he hath been plundered,
yet hath loſt much for not publiſhing the Book for Sabbath ſports: And I
have had perſonal experience from the firſt of theſe diſtractions of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and great activeneſſe in the Common Cauſe. And now ſeeing a
Teſtimonial under the hands of the Burgeſſes for <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and of the
Maior, and many well-affected chief Inhabitants there; That he is a
man of exemplary life, and an able, and diligent Preacher: And ſeeing
alſo Letters directed to you in his behalf, from many of the Deputy-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
of <hi>Kent:</hi> And for aſmuch as I am certified that the Archdeacon
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath deſerted his Cure at <hi>Ickham</hi> near <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent:</hi>
My earneſt requeſt to you is, That <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer</hi> may by your Order offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
that Cure, and be ſetled in it, if the Archdeacon ſhall be removed
out of it: And I am the rather willing to move you on <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
for that I know the Houſe of Lords (taking him into ſpecial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration)
did Order that he ſhould ſucceed the Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in
the Parſonage of <hi>Chartham;</hi> but at my motion he ſate down, and gave
way that my Lord Generals Chaplain ſhould have that Benifice: And ſo
with my affectionate reſpects commended to you, I reſt,</p>

            <p>And to proceed, after thoſe Libels were ſpread abroad in Print: A
Libel was written againſt him at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and in the night thrown
under the door of the then Maior of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who ſent it up to
the Committee for Plundered Miniſters: And (to cauſe the people
to deſtroy him) they raiſed a falſe report againſt him, that he had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61104:8"/>
broken the earthen pots or pipes, which conveyed water to the City,
and that he was ſeen to break them; And that he had ſaid, that all that
neither could or would give any thing to the Parliaments proceedings,
ſhould be put into a houſe, and the houſe fired on them; and that the
King would be at <hi>Canterbury</hi> at ſuch a day, and then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi>
ſhould be hanged, <hi>But threatned folks live long.</hi> And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo recommended to the Committee for Plundered Miniſters, as
afore-ſaid; they thereupon reſolved to place him in the Sequeſtred
Vicarage of <hi>Mynſter</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> But the Malignants and Cathedralliſts
from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Harbledown</hi> preſently endeavoured
to make the minds of the people of <hi>Mynſter</hi> ill affected againſt him;
and it was ſaid often openly in the ſtreets at <hi>Canterbury, Blue
Dick ſhould be ſet out of</hi> Mynſter; And divers Miniſters that ſeemed
to be his friends, did him ill offices there, for their own ends: One
that aimed at that Living himſelf, told them, that although the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
had voted M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> the Place, yet if they would ſtir and ſhew
great oppoſition againſt him, they might remove him: An other
(when he ſaw he could not get it for himſelf) adviſed them malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
ſaying, <hi>Clog it with a Lecture, clog it with a Lecture;</hi> But
after the people had heard M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> preach there, nineteen of the
Pariſh ſubſcribed, that they were willing to receive him as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor:
And one of the chiefeſt did then give him loving entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but deſired him to entertain his brother-in-law M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>P.</hi> then Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to be his Aſſiſtant, and to give him 40<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> by the year, which
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> deſired to be excuſed in, ſaying, <hi>He was able to officiate
alone, and that if</hi> 40<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> per annum <hi>Fifts, and as much in Taxes, and</hi>
40<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>to his Aſſistant, Were paid out of</hi> 200<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>, <hi>he ſhould have little
himſelf:</hi> But the truth is, That Curate was very ſcandalous, called
<hi>The Father of Drunkards,</hi> becauſe divers <hi>Toffe-pots</hi> in the Pariſh cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him <hi>Father,</hi> and he called them <hi>Sonnes:</hi> But one day in a Cellar
they complained to him, that he called them <hi>Sonnes,</hi> but gave them
no portions: Then he gave them portions; To one <hi>Knaves-acre,</hi> to
another <hi>Dunſ-acre,</hi> to another <hi>Cuckolds-corner,</hi> to another a <hi>Patent
to hug and buſs,</hi> to another <hi>Meretrix-Hall:</hi> He would tipple with
them in the Tap-houſe near the Church every day in the week, and
on Holy-dayes, out of the Ale-houſe to the Church, and from the
Church to the Ale-houſe, and come out hollowing at midnight, and
was ſo drunk that he could not ſtand: He would bowl with them on
the Sabbath, and forced the people by threats openly in the Church
to come up and kneel at the Alter rails; And ſaid, <hi>Prince</hi> Rupert
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61104:8"/>
               <hi>came over to right his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Wrongs.</hi> And when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> came
to the Vicarage-houſe, there was a large Picture of a man in the
window, and underneath it was written, <hi>Salvator mundi,</hi> the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the world. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid before many preſent, <hi>This is
not the Saviour of the world, for it cannot ſave it ſelf,</hi> and thereupon
daſhed it in pieces; But the Curate reviled him, and ſaid, <hi>It was
there in many Doctors times, and in M.</hi> Bromwels <hi>time; He had ſerved
above twenty years as Curate there, and was well beloved.</hi> And his
Predeceſſor Curate would go to <hi>Sandwich</hi> and fetch Bottles, hanging
round under his Prieſts coat; He was wont to huddle up forenoon and
afternoon Service altogether, and tell the people he did it, becauſe
there was a merry meeting in the afternoon; And the Prieſt (as they
call'd him) was ſure to be preſent, and it was their glory to have him
amongſt them, in their drunken courſes, and to laugh at the drunken
Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Another thing was then propounded to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>viz.</hi> That he would give under his hand in writing, to take the
Tythes as the Sequeſtred Doctor had them: But he refuſed to make
any compoſition, whereupon differences aroſe: And the brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law
to the Curate ſaid, <hi>He would ſpend</hi> 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>to keep out Mr.</hi> Culmer,
and procured divers others to joyn with him to keep out M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi>
and to bring in ſome other Miniſter. But when they ſaw they could
not prevail to bring in whom they would; They went up to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Aſſembly of Divines, ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to get any, they
cared not whom, to ſupplant M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer;</hi> being confident that any
Member of that Aſſembly would carry it from him: There they firſt
met with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Smith,</hi> who hearkned to them at the firſt: But having
diſcourſed with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> and ſeen his Teſtimonials, and enquired
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Herbert Palmer,</hi> and others touching him; He came to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and told him, That if his Living were worth 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>per annum,</hi>
he would not have it from him, but would aſſiſt him againſt his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries:
But afterwards they ſurprized one of that Aſſembly, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of that place; but when it was moved in the Aſſembly for his
approbation from them to the Committee for Plundered Miniſters;
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Herbert Palmer,</hi> who had known M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> for many years, made
a Speech in his behalf of at leaſt half an hour long, as if it had been
penned, and (amongſt the reſt) he ſaid, If <hi>Mr</hi> Culmer <hi>be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
of this Living, I am confident the Malignants in</hi> Canterbury
<hi>will make bonfires for joy:</hi> Then D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gouge,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wilſon,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Corpet,</hi>
and others there, which knew M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> ſpake alſo in his behalf:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61104:9"/>
whereupon the Vote of the Aſſembly was, <hi>That their Brother ſhould
be intreated to ſit down, and give way to Mr</hi> Culmer <hi>for that Place:</hi>
And thereupon after that Aſſembly had certified to the Committee
for Plundered Miniſters, touching M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> fitneſſe to officiate at
<hi>Mynſter,</hi> that Committee granted him their Order of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>But when news of this came to <hi>Mynſter,</hi> ſome began to rage at it,
ſaying, <hi>Such a deviliſh Round-headed Prieſt, that brake the Windows at</hi>
Canterbury, <hi>and refuſed to give the Sacrament to all at</hi> Harbledown,
<hi>and would not uſe the Service-Book, ſhould not come there:</hi> And it was
given out, that a band of women ſhould meet him at <hi>Sarwall,</hi> and
throw him into a ditch: But one M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>O,</hi> that had heard well of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> ſaid to the Goſſips in the Church-porch, <hi>What band?
Who ſhall be Captain?</hi> One named, ſuch a woman; The other replied,
<hi>Oh ſhe, ſhe was brought a bed a moneth after ſhe was married, we are like
to have a good band I hear, either whores, or with childe before marriage.</hi>
And upon this occaſion I cannot but recount what fell out lately in a
Veſtry there at a Debate about putting out Apprentices, it was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> adverſaries, and ſet down in the Seffe-book, <hi>That
ſuch a Girl (a Baſtard) ſhould be Mr</hi> Culmers <hi>Apprentice:</hi> But he
afterward addreſſed himſelf to the Juſtices, and deſired them, that
ſuch an affront might not be put on him, and ſaid further, <hi>There were
yet but eight baſtards ſince his coming thither, and deſired he might be
excuſed until the tenth fell:</hi> The Juſtices ſmiled, and ordered him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apprentice. I rehearſe this, becauſe I hear the accuſation againſt
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> is his rehearſing of a ſame of words of the feminine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But the band of women never advanced nor charged, but with
their ſharp tongues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man, with others, went preſently (before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>came down with his Order) with a Petition to divers Peers of the
Realm, which were then in the Iſle, upon pleaſure of Hawking and
Hunting, and lay there: But when the Earl of</hi> Warwick <hi>had read
their Petition againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> I know <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer</hi> well, he
is an honeſt man, I pray receive him according to Order; If need be, I
have a better Living for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer;</hi> But we muſt not oppoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>&amp;c. A little after a chief Pariſhioner of another Pariſh (brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law
alſo to the ſaid Curate, ſince a ſequeſtred Cavalier) went with
two of</hi> Mynſter <hi>to</hi> Canterbury <hi>to a Committee of Deputy-Lieutenants,
and there they clamoured againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer, <hi>who was thereupon
ſent for to the Chequer-Inne: But after they had heard him ſpeak,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61104:9"/>
Sir</hi> James Oxinden <hi>ſaid,</hi> Now we have heard Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſpeak, all that
you have ſaid againſt him, falls from him as water from a tiled houſe:
<hi>And Mr.</hi> Boys <hi>of</hi> Bettiſhanger <hi>(then Knight of the ſhire for</hi> Kent)
<hi>ſaid,</hi> their allegations were of no weight, and would not prevail: <hi>and he
ſaid, I</hi> pray oppoſe him not; I am confident you will never prevail againſt
him to remove him, he hath been ſo eminently active for the common
Cauſe, and you have nothing to alledge againſt him, I pray receive him, he
is ſent unto you by Authority, I dare ingage for him he will be an honeſt
quiet man amongſt you if you will be quiet. <hi>But he that was of another
Pariſh ſaid,</hi> They had Scouts out againſt. Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> and would finde
enough againſt him, He were better leave them quietly. <hi>And indeed they
ſent out to all places where Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>had lived, or had any dealing,
to find matter againſt him: The chief thing which they then alledged
againſt him was;</hi> that he was a contentious man at <hi>Harbledowne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Committee ſent to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Auſtin, <hi>who is an eminent godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
to know the truth of matters concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer <hi>at</hi> Harble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe:
<hi>The Doctor returned them an anſwer in writing as followeth:</hi>
Octob. 11. 1644. Whereas I am deſired to teſtifie what I know concerning
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmers</hi> carriage and behaviour at <hi>Harbledowne,</hi> eſpecially for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of contention between him and ſome there; I doe hereby truely teſtifie,
that having heard all that hath any wayes been objected againſt him, I
judged it rather to proceed out of malice, than from any ground of truth:
and the contention ſpoken of, to have been rather out of his zeal to the
cauſe of God, than any private cauſe of his own: And though they did
alledg matters againſt him, yet I judged them but frivolous; And I
have been thanked for his miniſtry there; which many of the City of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
alſo thought ſo well of, as they took the pains to travell thither
to enjoy it, and that for many years: <hi>And I alſo teſtifie,</hi> That I have had
much dealing with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer</hi> for at leaſt twelve years, yet if he were
now mine enemy, I muſt ſay, I have never found him but an honeſt man,
both in word and deed: In teſtimony whereof I have hereunto ſet my Name,
Robert Auſtin. <hi>About that time the Committee of Deputy-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
for</hi> Kent, <hi>made the Order following,</hi> (viz.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas we are informed, that there is a weekly Lecture at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Johns <hi>in
the Iſle of</hi> Thanet, <hi>in the County of</hi> Kent; <hi>we think fit that Mr</hi> Culmer,
<hi>being a very well-affected man, and put in by the Parliament into a Cure
in the ſaid Iſle, ſhall take his turn in preaching the ſaid Lecture.</hi> Alsford
12 June 1645. <hi>Richard Hardreſs, Anthony Welden, Robert Scot, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Miller, John Boys, William Kenrick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But after this Order, and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> preaching there, that Lecture ſoon ceaſed, becauſe (it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61104:10"/>
ſeems) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> preaching was not pleaſing to the Cavaller party:
The Miniſter there was afterward ſequeſtred for malignancy, and not
one of the ſeaven Miniſters of that Iſle but was neuter or two pockets
at the beſt, or rather the worſt at that time; and could make his Mill
goe with any winde. But the ceaſing of the Lecture did not ſatisfie
them; but their chief project was to remove M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> out of that
Iſle: They (as the event proved) having a deſigne to raiſe a new
Warre, they knew that Iſle to be a fit place for landing an Enemy:
There is <hi>Ramſgate</hi> alias <hi>Roman-gate,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> landed when
they conquered this Nation: And not far from thence, there is at this
day found (after a great rayne) Romane Coyn, with the Title and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies
of Romane Emperours: And they conſidered M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
diſpoſition, activeneſs, and reſolution againſt them and their
Cauſe: Thereupon they procured divers to go to <hi>Sandnich</hi> to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Deputy-Lieutenants, where Sir <hi>Edward Boys</hi> (a Parliament
man and Governour of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle) was Chair-man; there at leaſt
fourty in their beſt cloathes, and with their beſt friends and Sollicitors,
did earneſtly petition, and clamour as for life, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> might
be removed from <hi>Mynſter.</hi> But Sir <hi>Edward Boys</hi> asked them, <hi>What
they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ad to object againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer? It was anſwered, <hi>They had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for the preſent, but they might have in time:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>(Non ame to Voluſi. nec poſſum dicere quare.</l>
                  <l>Hoc tantum poſſum dicere, non ame tc.)</l>
               </q>
               <hi>They clamoured that they could not edifie by him, and deſired the
Committee to pity their ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But Sir</hi> Edward Boys <hi>anſwered
them ſaying,</hi> I have known <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer</hi> many years to be an honeſt man,
and zealous for God in the worſt times, and a good Preacher; you do ill to
oppoſe a man ſent unto you by Authority without ſhewing cauſe: if he ſhould
be removed upon ſuch oppoſition, it would open a flood-gate to ruin all good
Miniſters, and encourage oppoſition againſt them: I am a plainman, and
love to deal plainly, I like not theſe courſes, and untill you have matter
againſt him, I ſhall engage for him, and engage all the friends I have in
<hi>England</hi> for him againſt you; therefore pray honeſt men be quiet, untill
you have juſt and ſufficient cauſe to complain of him. <hi>At another time
they came to a Committee at</hi> Eaſtry, <hi>and the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man ſpake againſt
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer <hi>a long time; Then Sir</hi> Edward <hi>replyed ſaying,</hi> He had
heard him patiently, and all was in their own commendations, but nothing
alledged againſt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer;</hi> but (ſaid he,) when you have ſaid all,
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Culmer</hi> hath lent more voluntarily to the State than all your Pariſh,
beſides his perſonall actings: pray trouble us no more with your clamours
<pb facs="tcp:61104:10"/>
till you have cauſe. <hi>And afterwards Sir</hi> Edward Boys <hi>(hearing of ſome
potent agents, which they had procured againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer <hi>at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter)
<hi>wrote a Letter as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Honourable Committee of the Houſe of Commons aſſembled
in Parliament, for plundered Miniſters, preſent theſe.</p>
            <p>Honoured Sirs, I and many of the Deputy Lieutenants of <hi>Kent,</hi> have
heretofore written earneſtly unto you, in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Richard Culmers</hi> behalf,
whom you have ſince ſetled in the Vicarage of <hi>Mynſter</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
in <hi>Kent,</hi> for which I, amongſt others, heartily thank you: Some of
which Pariſh (being men of note for Religion, and activeneſs in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cauſe) have this day been with me, earneſtly moving me to be a
means, that he may be upheld and continued there againſt a few violent
oppoſers, who, having begun to oppoſe him, endeavonr to make good their
own wills and acts, and leave no ſtone unremoved to that purpoſe, although
I have once and again ſhewed my diſlike upon good grounds; I doubt not
but when you underſtand the truth of things, you will be ſenſible of this
cauſe, which is of great concernment, and will be ſuch a preſident if his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
prevail, as will be of very ill conſequence; and I am certified, that
there is no ſuch cordiall oppoſition in the moſt of the Pariſh as is pretended;
but if two or three would ſurceaſe, all were at an end; his life and Doctrine
being ſuch, that it hath prevailed already with divers. I ſhall not trouble
you further, only I intreat this honorable Aſſembly, to continue him there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
be ſhall give juſt cauſe to be removed, or outed in a Legall way; which
I preſume to crave at your hands, for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the worſt times ſuffered
under the tyranny of the Archbiſhop; and for a man which (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg)
hath been moſt famouſly active for the Parliament many wayes, from
the firſt of theſe diſtractions, and for a man ſo well atteſted as he is by ſo
many godly Miniſters and others. So I reſt. Your humble ſervant
<hi>Edward Boys.</hi> Dover Caſtle this <hi>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1644.</p>
            <p>A little after this, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> had ended his morning Sermon
at <hi>Mynſter,</hi> on the Sabbath day, one <hi>R. H.</hi> came crouding up to his
desk door, and clamoured ſaying; <hi>Neighbours, You that have ſet your
hands againſt Mr</hi> Culmer, <hi>for a more abler man, pray ſtand to it againſt
him; we have had no Communion this bleſſed Nativity, nor Prayers all
this Chriſtmas Holydayes:</hi> Whereupon one or two clamoured, but
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> went out preſently: and the afternoon Sermon being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the clamourer came, and cried out as in the morning; then a chief
man of the Pariſh cryed <hi>all, all:</hi> and the clamourer ſaid aloud in the
Church to the forenamed Scout, who was of another Pariſh and
then preſent; <hi>Captain I hope you will joyn with us:</hi> The Scout anſwered
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61104:11"/>
aloud in the Church ſaying, <hi>I will both ride and write:</hi> but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi>
ſoon left them clamouring and talking. Not long after that they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a ſlander againſt him, that he ſaid <hi>they were Malignauts:</hi> which I
have often heard him ſay, they meerly forged againſt him, and that he
only ſaid, <hi>he knew it was a plot of Malignants to incenſe them againſt
him:</hi> Upon this the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man and ſome others went to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of the County at <hi>Alesford,</hi> and there accuſed him of that ſaying,
which they indeed had forged for their own ends, to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to get a Certificate from that Committee, <hi>That ſome of them
being of the Trayned bands, did advance towards</hi> Arundell, <hi>and that they
conceived them to be no Malignants.</hi> The Certificate was drawn up by
the Clerk of that Committee, and upon debate about it, Colonel
<hi>Blunt</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſee you have cloathed Mr</hi> Culmers <hi>oppoſers, but you ſend
him away ſtark naked, one Mr</hi> Culmer: <hi>I dwell far from him, yet I have
obſerved his activeneſs in the common Cauſe: and once I made a Speech
in the Lords Houſe, and he preſently made another there, to good purpoſe:
What ſay you Gentlemen of</hi> Eaſt-Kent, <hi>who are his neighbours?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they cloathed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſo well with Commendations, that his
adverſaries were unwilling to make uſe of their Certificate. A little
after that, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> was adviſed to call the Pariſhioners together
after evening Sermon, and to read his Certificates unto them; which
he did accordingly: But ſo ſoon as they were read, the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man
clamoured ſaying; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer, Now the people have heard
your papers, they are as much againſt you as ever they were, if you be not
ſpeak ho:</hi> whereupon only one man <hi>(J. W.)</hi> ſpake, he cried out <hi>all, all,
all, all:</hi> Then the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man and ſome others ſpake againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi>
to incenſe the people againſt him: The 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man fell a jeering him
about his little flock at <hi>Mynſter,</hi> becauſe he had mentioned that day,
<hi>Fear not little flock.</hi> And one accuſed him ſaying, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer, you
make diſſention in the Pariſh; you ſay when you begin your Sermons,</hi>
you that fear God, hearken to the Word of God; <hi>as if ſome in the
Pariſh did fear God, and ſome in the Pariſh did not fear God; and ſo you
divide the Pariſh, and ſet us all at difference.</hi> Another cried out, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
you may preach, but you get no Tythes of me but by Law, if you can
come by them by Law, ſo it is: Nor of me but by Law,</hi> ſaid another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Then ſaid one, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer, you gave thanks for a Lye, for taking of</hi>
Scarborow <hi>Caſtle, which is not yet taken.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> did indeed
give thanks for the taking of <hi>Scarborow</hi> Town, and regayning of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
Then the clamourer <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaid <hi>he would take his Oath on it,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was falſe which he would ſo atteſt againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer.</hi> But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61104:11"/>
               <hi>J. W.</hi> (that ſo clamoured <hi>all, all,</hi> and offered to ſwear falſly;) about a
week after being drunk, fell (in his drunken reel) under the wheels
of a wagon laden with 1500 houſe-tyles, and was cruſhed to death, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
up his bloud at his throat and mouth: <hi>God is known by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he executeth.</hi> But ſome notwithſtanding continued after
that to revile Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> publikely calling him <hi>devilliſh roundheadid
Prieſt;</hi> and <hi>Ha Blew Dick, the devil break your neck:</hi> and roaring
out of the Alehouſe window, as he went by; <hi>You ſirra Jack Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c.
And ſome came of purpoſe from other Pariſhes to jeer the Prieſt, and
affronted him at his door in ſuch a manner as is unfit to be named,
much leſs committed to paper. And becauſe he uſed not the Service-Book,
they called it <hi>the Round-headed kinde of Service. Come, will you
hear the Roundheaded kinde of Chriſtning too.</hi> And one that was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by him, affronted him in the Church at the time of marriage,
and told him <hi>he did not ſay right</hi> &amp;c. but he had not done right, who
had made a whore of the Bride divers moneths before the marriage.
And he was much reviled becauſe he did not officiate at the grave: but
he ſaid, <hi>he would not be Chaplain to the wormes, to ſay grace to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they go to dinner and feed on the dead corps:</hi> upon this account he
was threatned to be buried alive. He deſired them to go into the
Church after the corps was interred, and ſaid <hi>he would there give them
a word of Exhortation, ſeeing ſo many were there met together:</hi> but their
uſuall anſwer was, <hi>If we can have nothing at the grave, we will have
nothing in the Church.</hi> It were well if all Miniſteriall ſpeakings at the
grave were prohibited, to take away all appearance of evill; for by
ſuch officiating of the Miniſter, there is hardning of popiſh, ignorant
and ſuperſtitious people; as if ſome good came to the dead by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſpeaking over the dead at the grave, and as if the devil will not
come nigh Holy Prieſthood, Holy Church ground, Holy Service: And
upon this account there is much enmity raiſed againſt good Miniſters,
becauſe ſome Miniſters practice it out of ſuperſtition, and ſome to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and pleaſe the people, leaſt they ſhould Article againſt them, or
not pay their Tythes well. At one buriall when they began to raiſe at
Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> becauſe he did not officiate there; one <hi>J. D.</hi> (a common
ſwearer) fell flat on his belly, and thruſt his arm into the grave, and
ſaid aloud, <hi>We ſhall have him here, here, here ſhortly:</hi> but this man (a
young man) died a little after ſtark mad, curſing and calling out,
<hi>the devil, the devil.</hi> And one <hi>T. D.</hi> who had two wives living, and
children by them both, who did beat his own aged deareſt father, was
inſtrumentall in the perſecution of Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> whom he uſed to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61104:12"/>
affront, and ſaid, <hi>he had as much to do at the Vicarage as he;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he
would go no more to the Steeple-houſe:</hi> this man was a little after hanged
in <hi>Suſſex.</hi> And when Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> gave meat and money to divers poor
people, the perſecutors told the people, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>did that in
policy to get their good wills, that they ſhould not joyn with the rich men
againſt him; but they ſhould not finde him ſo liberall afterwards.</hi> A
Grandee of the faction did uſe to lead many after him on the Sabbath
as they went to the next Pariſh, which when a worthy Gentleman of
that Pariſh obſerved; He ſent the Grandee word, <hi>That it was a badge
of malice to leave Mr.</hi> Culmer, <hi>to come to hear at that Pariſh, where
there was a Preacher, whoſe gifts were farre inferiour to their own
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters:</hi>
But this is an ordinary perſecution of Miniſters, as now,
when lately in that Iſle, a drunken, ſcandalous, railing Prieſt was
ejected, there comes ſcarce one of ten to hear the godly Miniſter,
placed in his room. And when Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> reproved them for ſetting
up a Tree <hi>May</hi>-pole, it was told him to his face, <hi>That there was a
Bough ſtrong enough to hang him on it:</hi> And when he preached not on
their <hi>Chriſtmaſſe</hi>-day, as they call it; He was reviled for it in the
Church, and called Rogue, and aſſaulted in the Church-yard; and it
was told him, <hi>Such a Miniſter did preach then, and why not you?</hi> The
uſual ſaying of the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man, and his faction was, <hi>We don't take you
for our Miniſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt the Perſecutors plotted to advance their deſign againſt
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> by articling againſt him, before the Committee for Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Miniſters, thereby to make publick ſhews of numerous Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to manifeſt their implacable and violent oppoſition againſt
him; Only by that pretence of enmity againſt him, to prevail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him; becauſe thereupon it would be conceived, That he was
not like to do any good amongſt them, who acted with ſuch animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
charge, trouble, or travel: That was the myſtery of the iniquity
of all that oppoſition, a confidence to prevail meerly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of pretended oppoſition, and unlikelihood of not edifying by
him upon that account: That's the knack of it all the Nation over;
when only ſelf-will, and malice, and private intereſt, and ſelf-ends,
are the weights that ſet all the Wheels a going: For they could not
be ſo ſottiſh, as to imagine to prevail by the merits of the cauſe. They
had a Treaſurer (at warre, as I may ſo ſay) who kept the money
which was collected to defray the Charges in purſuance of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
to pay Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They raiſed and ſpent above 300<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>, (as
appears by their own confeſſion) in proſecuting of him Some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61104:12"/>
of the Articles are <hi>verbatim</hi> in the printed Libels, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he was a fantaſtick narrow brain'd man. That falſe News was
by a Proverb called</hi> Culmers <hi>News. That he made a popular ſhew, but
gave very little. That he denied to pay Parliament Texis. That he is
an impudent man, and did piſſe in the Cathedral in</hi> Canterbury. <hi>That
he gave not the Communion at</hi> Harbledown <hi>as he ought,</hi> &amp;c. And (to
ſteel their numerous, frivolous, woodden Articles, and to ſet an edge
on them) they accuſed him to be a common ſwearer, and a Protector
of Malignants. They carried whole Coaches full of Witneſſes through
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> in a triumphant bravado; But at the hearing before the
Committee, they could not produce one Witneſs that ever heard him
ſwear one oath, It is true, that one <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtreet</hi> (a Ditcher)
was fitted with ruſſet-boots, and Yeoman-like, and carried up to
<hi>Weſtminster</hi> to witneſs one Oath againſt M. <hi>Culmer;</hi> But when he came
to the Committee door, his heart failed him: For the truth is, That
he had falſly accuſed Mr. <hi>Culmer;</hi> whom he met one Morning, and
told him, <hi>He did ride upon a Round-headed horſe;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid
little to him, uſing no oath or evil word againſt him, as <hi>Thomas Heath</hi>
who heard all that was ſpoken was ready to witneſs, if Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi>
had been called to his defence: But a little after <hi>Wilde</hi> fell ſick, and
conſumed, and died in a fearfull manner. And that ſcandal touching
Mr. <hi>Culmers</hi> protecting of Malignants; It was raiſed by the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
from <hi>Harbledown,</hi> becauſe he dealt courteouſly with a Gentleman,
who was taken to be the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> being found at an Inne there in
the night: But the true Lord <hi>Digby</hi> rid through <hi>Canterbury</hi> that day,
and eſcaped over Sea. The Gentleman in his frolick put his ſcarlet
cloak on the Can-maker, and he put on the Can-makers lethern apron,
and ſo danced in his gold lace; But upon ſuſpicion) the houſe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
and Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> (then Miniſter there) was called up at midnight,
and went to the Juſtice at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and did write a Warrant at the
Juſtices bed ſide, and called up <hi>Richard Redwood</hi> then Conſtable: The
young Spark kept his room with his naked Rapier, which be thruſt
thorow the glaſſe-window: But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> entred in upon him alone,
and he yielded and put up his Rapier; whereupon Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him gentle carriage, which was performed: For he went (as he
deſired with his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by his ſide, and with Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> alone, and the
rabble not near him, and was brough a back way privately to the
Juſtice, and there delivered to the Conſtable; but he proved no Lord
<hi>Digby,</hi> but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> was no protector of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
his recited Cathedral Hiſtory, and the Records of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61104:13"/>
for Examinations, and of the Councel of State can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>One of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that ſaid, <hi>He would fain go like himſelf
to</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to witneſſe againſt M.</hi> Culmer, had about five pounds
towards his charges, when he went up to witneſſe, <hi>where Mr.</hi> Culmer
<hi>made water in a duſty corner behinde old boards and rubbage, in the body
of the Cathedral</hi> (where afterwards the Ammunition-wagons ſtood,
as in <hi>Pauls London,</hi> and where afterwards the <hi>Dutch</hi> priſoners were
kept) which Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> was neceſſitated unto, at the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing
the Idols there, when all the doors were ſhut, and thoſe
without ready to knock out his brains, if he had gone forth to make
water. And a Gentlewoman (then of <hi>Mynſter,</hi> now of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury)</hi>
being asked by the Chair man of that Committee, <hi>What ſhe
could witneſs againſt Mr</hi> Culmer, anſwered, <hi>That ſhe heard Mr.</hi> Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>ſay, That if her huſband</hi> William Goldfinch, <hi>Would not agree to
pay his ſmall Tythes at a rate in money, he expected his Tythes in kinde of
T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Pigs.</hi> And ſhe ſaid further, <hi>Sir, I told Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>at our
houſe, that I wondered that he would not go away from</hi> Mynſter, <hi>and that
it did not move his patience to be ſo hated and houted at. And</hi> Sir, <hi>his
anſwer to me was, That he was a cholerick man by nature, and ſoon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but he did wear a hat with broad brims, Which did keep the rain from
his collar.</hi> This was all ſhe did, or could accuſe Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> of, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Records of that Committee; which Committee ſaid,
<hi>They found nothing againſt Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>fit for their Cognizance to eject
a Miniſter:</hi> And the worthy Chair-man gave them good counſel, and
in concluſion bid them <hi>Go home and live quietly:</hi> Whereupon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to have their wils againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> then offered a Petition to
the Committee, wherein they freely offered to give Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life, the whole revenue of the Vicarage, and to provide a
Miniſter at their own charge, upon condition that Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> might
be removed from them: And in that Petition it is propounded as an
argument to have him caſt out, <hi>That they had ſpent in proſecuting him,
two hundred and fifty pounds,</hi> and clamoured by word of mouth, <hi>That
they had ſpent about three hundred pound.</hi> But the anſwer to that was
very unpleaſing; and Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid, <hi>Beneficium propter officium,</hi> and
<hi>Officium propter beneficium.</hi> But
<q>Flictere ſi nequeo ſuperos Acheronta movebo.</q>
Preſently after that the Proſecutors, being returned home, two of them
ſtirred up others to confederate to carry away all Mr. <hi>Culmers</hi> Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn
that harveſt, which they did (almoſt all) accordingly; One that
paid him a little was reproved for it by one of the Confederates, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61104:13"/>
ſaid to him, <hi>You wrong all the Pariſh in paying your Tythes, ſeeing we
are all agreed to pay none.</hi> One (when the Tythes were demanded) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
ſaying, <hi>Others do not pay, I am loath to foul the Vicarage-barn
with our little Tythe-corn.</hi> Another ſaid, <hi>We have poſſeſſion, which is
eleven points of the Law: The firſt point in Hawking is hold-faſt.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaid, <hi>I will pay no Tythes, but go along with my Neighbours, as
dogs go to Church, and take Neighbours fare, come what will come;</hi> But
he a little after riding in a Cart, it overthrew and killed the childe that
was with him in it, and cruſhed his own Leg ſo, that it cannot be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but remains with wounds and bruiſes that he (continuing
lame) cannot go along with his Neighbours. A little before that,
he (hearing Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſay in his prayer, <hi>Lord, thy mercy is great to
us; there be many in Hell, that never ſinned as we have done, and yet
are out of it, it is thy mercy we have time to call for mercy;</hi> thereupon)
vowed, <hi>never to come to Church more, if M.</hi> Culmer <hi>preached:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſabled to go elſwhere, remains obſtinate to this day, and glorieth
in keeping his vows: He is called <hi>Will Wounds,</hi> becauſe of his uſual oaths,
<hi>by Wounds,</hi> &amp;c. but now he &amp; others may read his ſin in his puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Another (a Sectary Leveller of another Pariſh) denied his Tythes,
and gave this reaſon of it, ſaying, <hi>I deſire the ruine of all the Miniſters
in</hi> England, <hi>and know no way better to effect it, than by ſtarving them
out, by keeping their maintenance from them; and if it were in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I would ſheath my ſword in the bowels of all the Ministers in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Another refuſing to pay his Tythes, ſaid, <hi>If the Parliament
ſet Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>on work, if they provide us ſervants, let them provide
them wages.</hi> The Tythe robbers ſervants would cry out in the field,
when the Tythe was gone, <hi>Ha! the Bird is flown, the Bird is flown,</hi> and
would hollow and hoop like mad men. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaid a Sectary) <hi>Don't the
Prieſts men want boughs to mark out their Tythes,</hi> &amp;c? Some did threaten
his ſervants from off their ground, ſaying, <hi>We know the Law forty thing:
By Law you have nothing to do to meddle about ſetting out the Tythe, we
by Law can tythe when we liſt, whether you be preſent or abſent:</hi> His
tything ſervant was knockt down, and beaten, and bruiſed, and was
after ſtripped before the Juſtice, who, with others, ſaw the bruiſes.
They would not Tythe in his ſervants preſence, but ſome left a little
Tythe-corn in their abſence, to colour the matter. If his ſervants
waited all day, they would let the corn lie unheaped, and go home at
night, and after ariſe at midnight, and leave what Tythe they pleaſed,
and change the Tythe, and bring bad corn from elſwhere, and traſh
out of the Barn to put in the room of good Tythe: <hi>Come Ned ariſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61104:14"/>
we muſt go and do righteous things;</hi> No Knave to the pretended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Knave; No enemy to the pretended, yet falſe friend: As he
that overtook the honeſt Traveller over night, and ſupped, and lay
with him; but next day morning, when thieves aſſaulted and robbed
the true man, the pretended friend joyned with them.</p>
            <p>And many other Tythe-robbing tricks were uſed, againſt which
tricks there is no-remedy provided in the Law: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
printed two Books touching the frauds in Tything, hoping that
upon ſuch Diſcoveries of the Defects of Law and Juſtice about Tythes,
either Miniſters ſhould have been left wholly to the charity of people,
or that better Laws would be made for their enjoyment of Tythes,
which are eſteemed as their Livelihood, and in conſideration of them
they pay Taxes, Fifths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the frauds of the lawleſſe Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robber
are ſuch, that upon the matter (though not intended by the
makers of former Laws) Tythes in kinde are but a State-cheat, or
mock-maintenance, thoſe good Laws being now outplodded by malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and covetous people: I pray God that thoſe Books, eſpecially that
called <hi>The Lawleſs Tythe-robber diſcovered,</hi> may never riſe up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the Higher Powers, or againſt any other that have read
them. But thoſe confederated Tyth-robbers acted ſo againſt M. <hi>Culmer,</hi>
that for two years together he had not half ſo much Tythe-revenue
(one way or other) as would pay his Fifths, and Tenths, and Taxes,
which were ſeverely exacted of him, when almoſt all his Tythes were
in the peoples hands: He had ten Troopers at a time quartered upon
him, horſe and man; and was conſtrained to borrow money of the
next Juſtices Mr. <hi>Thomas Paramor</hi> and Major <hi>Foach</hi> to pay his Taxes,
which Taxes have been aſſeſſed and exacted to the utmoſt farthing of
his Living, and more, when all the Pariſh was eaſed a fifth part, ſome
a full half. The Perſecutions and oppreſſions that way have been
unparallel'd, and yet he never complained of it, untill they made
that injury a rule of other aſſeſſements, wherein they eaſe themſelves
and burden him. There was then little or no relief for Miniſters in
Sequeſtred Livings, though he made many journeys for relief about
his Tythes: And the Seſſe-book was denied him, that he might ſee
who occupied Marſhland, and the Order of the Deputy-Lieutenants
ſlighted by the Perſecutors, who anſwered them at <hi>Canterbury, That
Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>ſhould not ſee it, but by Law,</hi> and ſo matters reſted. And
to adde to his oppreſſions, beſides the ſcoffs formerly rehearſed, it
was clamoured to him as he rid in <hi>Mynſter</hi>-ſtreet, <hi>Look how the
Prieſts horſe ears loll, he goes ſo oft to</hi> London, <hi>and can get nothing:</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61104:14"/>
Yet theſe men paid their Tythes in corn to the full to the <hi>Non-reſident
Doctor,</hi> who had 1<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per Acre</hi> for the Marſhland, and Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi>
was contented with 1<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, yet could not, nor cannot enjoy that, as the
Miniſter of <hi>W. H.</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> abated 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of 1<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. due by cuſtome for the
Acre, hoping they would pay that freely, but I heard him ſay, <hi>That
if he had abated</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>and took</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>he findes they would have been as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to pay that.</hi> And although M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> have forborn many for
five, ſeven, ten years, and hath not ſued them; yet he findes it to
redound to his greater loſſe, and to their, and others hardning, only
to avoid contention; leaſt thereby they ſhould prejudice the Goſpel;
but they now finde by experience, wofull experience, that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
hath hardened men to be more unrighteous, as ſoft fires
harden ſome things: By bearing one injury wicked men are invited
to do more injury. A Miniſter in <hi>Eſſex</hi> (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Willet)</hi> for peace-ſake
remitted 20<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> due to him for Tythes taken from him in Harveſt, 1652.
and the ſame Tythe-robber carried away all his Tythe-corn in Harveſt,
1653. And Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> had the ſame experience in <hi>Mynſter,</hi> becauſe
he ſued not thoſe that carried away all his Tythe-corn in Harveſt,
1646. they carried away all alſo in Harveſt, 1647. But before
Harveſt, 1648. <hi>The Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon</hi> made them
pay their dues. Oh bleſſed Law and Sword of Magiſtracy, thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileſt
more with wicked men, than the Law of Nature, of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
of Reaſon, or the Law in judgements of God himſelf! But
this is obſervable, that there is not one of the wilfull Tythe-robbers
then, or now, but are confounded as to their eſtates, one, and all,
to admiration: One being a priſoner at the ſuit of others had thirty
pound forgiven him by Mr <hi>Culmer;</hi> yet within two dayes after the
firſt Parliaments diſſolution, he clapt two Actions on Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi>
who afterwards had eight pound coſts in thoſe Suites; Now their own
ears loll in other Pariſhes, while they make their houſes their priſon
for fear of Lawyers, and have no revenue out of which they may pay
Tythes, unleſſe it be Tythe lice. And it is to be conſidered, that
theſe oppreſſors of Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> did not only pay their dues fully and
quietly to the <hi>Non-reſident,</hi> but were exceeding bountifull to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Curates, and paid a kinde of Tythe or Contribution of Hay and
Peaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to him for horſe-meat, beſides continual gifts and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of him and his wife. And to oppreſſe Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> the more,
they regard not the Limits of their Pariſh that he may know his
maintenance, utterly refuſing to go the Bounds of it, though he have
often privately and publickly intreated them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61104:15"/>
And beſides all theſe oppreſſions, one thing more in point of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
I thought fit to mention, That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> having laid
out about 5<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> in demoliſhing the Monuments of Idolatry at <hi>Mynſter,</hi>
by ſpecial Order according to the Act of Parliament for their demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing,
cannot get his money ſo laid out. At his firſt coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he often deſired the Churchwardens to do that work according
to that Act: But the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man being Churchwarden refuſed to act,
and ſaid, <hi>He could not get a Sailor at</hi> Sandwich <hi>to climb up to the Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
on the Spire of the Steeple under</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. So that that work was left
undone about a whole year after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> coming thither; But
then Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> was jeered by a Sequeſtred Malignant Prieſt, who
ſaid to him, <hi>Phyſician heal thy ſelf;</hi> telling him of his actings at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury:</hi>
Theſe words took ſuch deep impreſſion on him, that he
would no longer wait the Churchwardens leiſure: But a day or two
after, being the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Novem.</hi> he got up into the Steeple before day, and
by Moon-light, got up to the top of the Spire, ſeven roods or poles from
the ground, and did ſit on the round Globe there; and did with a rope
affix ladders ſo, that it was then little danger to go up &amp; down from the
flat Steeple to the top of the Spire. And then he came down and hired
<hi>Peter Wotton,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Auſtin</hi> to go up the Ladder, and demoliſh the
two croſſes there: The huge wooden Croſs covered with lead under the
Vane, and the iron croſs above that. And many other Idolatrous Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were demoliſhed, and the Chancel ground levelled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
the Workmen and Maſons, whom Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſatisfied, but to this
day he cannot get one farthing of thoſe charges repayed him, though
the Juſtices have ordered it according to that Act: And although he
never demanded any thing for his own actings about that work of
Reformation.</p>
            <p>And all this oppreſſion did not quench the burning malice of the
500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man and his faction: They ſaid, <hi>The greateſt croſſe (the Prieſt)
was yet remaining.</hi> And they ſuffered the Churchyard to be without a
gate, that the paſture there might be common, and ſo it continued:
at laſt they put a Wattle or Hurdle, in ſtead of a Gate, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſo for divers years, to the laughter and deriſion of all that paſſed
by: And they handled the matter ſo, that none durſt help the Sexton
to ring the great Sermon-bell on the Sabbaths: But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> own
Servants did conſtantly do that ſervice. After that one of the chief of
the faction took away the Key of the Church from the Sexton, and
kept the doors locked, when about two hundred people (Pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and others) were aſſembled in the Churchyard, on the Sabbath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61104:15"/>
morning, ſo that they were all conſtrained to return home without
any publick Worſhip. A Grandee ſaid aloud, <hi>The Church-doors ſhall
not be opened:</hi> Another crouded up to the door, and ſaid, <hi>Let me ſee
who dares break open the Church-door?</hi> And the next Sabbath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
got into the Church at the broken Chancel windows, which were
left unrepaired about half a year by the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man, in hope that
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſhould pay for all the ruines, which came through the
wilfull neglect of the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> mans ſpeedy reparations of thoſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
which belong'd to him to repair as Parſon, according to the
ſaid Act of Parliament; There was not at firſt ten foot of glaſſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
there: And when Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> was gotten into the Church, he
rung the Bels, and when people were come thither, he unbolted one
door, which had no lock, and let them into the Church: But about a
quarter of an hour after he had begun the Publick Worſhip, there
came into the Church ſeven men of the Pariſh with their hats on, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring
and yelling like Tygers: Five of them ruſhed into his Desk:
One called him <hi>Thief, becauſe he came not in at the door, but at the
window:</hi> And thoſe five laid hands on him, and thruſt him violently,
and the other two at the door tugged and pulled him; but they could
not move him, untill the Conſtable <hi>Robert Wells</hi> (ſeeing him look
pale, as if he were fainting) prayed him to give way: They thruſt
his ribs on the edge or point of a plank, and bent them, and cruſhed
his body ſo, that he vomited bloud, and purged bloud: They drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him by head and ſhoulders out of the Church; but he did not lift
up his hand againſt them; yet I have heard him ſay, <hi>He could eaſily have
killed them every one with his ſteeletto:</hi> But he often ſaid, <hi>He bleſſed
God, who kept his hands from ſhedding their blouds; and that he admired
at the goodneſſe of God to him, that gave him ſuch a ſpirit of meekneſſe
upon ſuch an occaſion, contrary to his natural and uſual diſpoſition in his
own defence, when violence hath been done him:</hi> But when he was gotten
out of their clutches in the Churchyard, he preſently ran into the
Church at the other Church-door, and went on in the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and anon the Rioters came in again, clamouring with their hats
on: But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> went on in his reading of the Chapter, and then
many good people were come into the Church: And Mr. <hi>Har<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>is</hi> of
<hi>Birchington,</hi> and many Pariſhioners came out of their ſeats, one ſaid,
<hi>They ſhould have his heart-bloud before they ſhould touch Mr.</hi> Culmer
<hi>again:</hi> And then they laid hands on the Rioters, who preſſed forwards
to come at Mr. <hi>Culmer:</hi> But they were all crouded and tugged in a
throng down to the lower end of the Church, where being left, they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61104:16"/>
went out into the Churchyard, to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> themſelves; But while
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> was praying before Serm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>he Pulpit, they came in
again clamouring as before, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> preſſe towards him; But
they interrupted him, and ſaid, <hi>He ſhould not preach then, though it
ſhould coſt them their lives:</hi> Then ſaid M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Culmer, though you will not
let me preach, yet (I hope) you will let me read a little Scripture out of
the Bible, and I will come down:</hi> They yeelded to that: Then he read
out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. how they preſſed upon <hi>Lots</hi> door in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and how
fire and brimſtone preſently conſumed them, and he applied it to the
Rioters. Then he read <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi>
And 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 15. They abuſed his Meſſengers,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 18.
and <hi>Matth. 23. Oh Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem, thou that killeſt the
Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. Then they clamoured: But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> deſired them
to hear one Text of Scripture more, and he ſaid, he would come
down; whereupon they were ſilent: Then he read, <hi>Rom. 13. All Powers
are ordained of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he that reſiſteth receiveth damnation.</hi> Then
he diſmiſſed the Congregation, and came down.</p>
            <p>No marvel if his Highneſſe in his Commiſſion for <hi>Ejecting ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Miniſters, and placing Godly Miniſters in their rooms, provide
againſt Riots,</hi> which, it ſeems, there was juſt cauſe to fear. Such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
have been in many other Pariſhes alſo, where the Biſhops, <hi>Non-reſidents,</hi>
and ignorant, and drunken Curates have let in the Devil,
who, now he is to be caſt out in theſe bleſſed dayes of the Sonne of
Man, rends and tears, as he dealt with the poſſeſſed man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
when he ſaw he muſt be caſt out: When <hi>there was like Prieſt
like people,</hi> and where it is ſo now, and <hi>the ſtrong man is in poſſeſſion,
all was and is in peace,</hi> and honey-love between Miniſter and people in
many Pariſhes, where there is no articling or complaint againſt moſt
ſcandalous Prieſts, that humour the people in their ſuperſtition and
prophaneneſſe. But if faithfull Miniſters be placed in their rooms;
then the Devil roars againſt ſuch Miniſters; He moves his Vaſſals to
ſpend their bodies in journeys, their eſtates in expences, their ſouls in
Tythe-robbings, lies, ſlanders, riots, perſecutions, to worry out
ſuch Miniſters; They ſeem to ſay, when ſuch Miniſters of Chriſt are
ſent to them, as the Devils ſaid to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us before the time? Neighbours, ſtand to it againſt this deviliſh
Round-headed Prieſt, and either keep him out, or weary him out, or elſe
we ſhall be weary of our lives, we ſhall be ſo plagued with him, with his
bawling at Church, and new Round-headed tricks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to proceed) in the afternoon of that rioted Sabbath, they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61104:16"/>
placed a guard of men under the broken Chancel windows, which
they had be daubed with filthy ſir-reverence; but Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> vaulted
over the heads of the guard, who had not the hearts to touch him;
and (being got into the Church) he tolled the Bels, and unbolted
the Church-door, and preached that afternoon, and no Rioters acted
againſt him; But the next Sabbath (when he was got into the Church
in the morning, and went to ring) the clappers were all taken out of
all the five Bels, ſo that none of the Bels could ſpeak (as they uſe to
ſay:) But he went home, and took his wives great iron-peſtle, and
went up into the Steeple, and tonged the Bels with the peſtle, in ſtead
of clappers, and did preach twice that Sabbath.</p>
            <p>One of theſe Rioters, who ſaid <hi>Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>was a thief,</hi> was after
that a Pirate, a thief at Sea, being a Cavalier Captain, and was ſlain
at Sea. And another of the Rioters that pulled out the clappers, a
luſty young man, was the firſt of that Pariſh that wanted a clapper to
ring his knell: He uſed, when he ſaw M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> returned from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
(whether he was neceſſitated to go often in his own defence, and
<hi>needs muſt he runne whom the Devil drives)</hi> the Rioter uſed to ſwear
fearfully, and ſay, <hi>Hath not the Devil broke his neck yet? Is he not
hanged yet?</hi> And the next Sabbath after the Riot, they ſent about the
Pariſh, to warn people from coming to Church, and when any ſaid,
<hi>They would come,</hi> then the Meſſenger prayed them that they would
not tell <hi>that they were ſent;</hi> but now the Meſſenger is lame, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
looks behinde him. At laſt there came a Warrant from the
Committee of Parliament for Plundred Miniſters, to the Sheriff to
<hi>raiſe Forces and aſſist Mr</hi> Culmer <hi>againſt the Ricters;</hi> And ſome of
the Pariſh, who oppoſed the Rioters, went to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
who was Lord Admiral then, and lay at <hi>Walmer</hi> Caſtle; He preſently
ſent his Warrant to have the Peace kept. Afterward two Juſtices did
ſit upon the Riot, and the Rioters were bound over to the Seſſions;
and there indicted and found guilty, and fined each of them fourty
ſhillings, which they received again from their good maſters and
dames, by a Collection in the Pariſh. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> did not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Law againſt any of them for the aſſault and battery, neither
had he his charges expended at the Juſtices ſitting about the Riot, and
about journeys, Warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about 8<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. He had no recompence
for his bloud and bruiſes, though the Phyſicians and Chyrurgions
bils were coſtly. When the Juſtices ſate at <hi>Mynſter</hi> upon the Riot, a
godly man of the next Pariſh (S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Laurence</hi> Pariſh) where they had
no Miniſter at all, ſeeing theſe actings, ſaid, <hi>Here is a ſtirre againſt a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61104:17"/>
Minister, we would praiſe God if we had a Minister:</hi> Then the
500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man, and three more (I have their Names in writing) ſaid,
<hi>Would to God, if it were Gods bleſſed will, that we were in your caſe,
and had no Miniſter neither, if it were Gods ſweet will and pleaſure.</hi>
At the Seſſions the Ring-leader and Incendiary of the Rioters, being
called to the Bar, the Judge called him the Trumpeter, becauſe he
being decrepid and limping, only clamoured: But he put up a Petition,
and theſe Articles to the Bench againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer;</hi> Theſe Articles, I
ſay, and only theſe,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> did preach, That many be like the
Dogge in the manger, that will not let the Horſe eat, nor eat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</item>
               <item>2. That he preached, That a man was taken up at Sea alive,
ſwimming with a Teſtament in his boſom, and his fleſh ſoaked, as if
ſodden.</item>
               <item>3. That the Popiſh-Prieſt did drink all, <hi>ſupernaclum.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That the Papiſts reſerve the Communion bread in a box, and give
it to dying men, who die with their mouths full of it.</item>
               <item>5. That Satan was a ſubtil Fox, and was above five thouſand
year old.</item>
               <item>6. That one called him a ſoul-murtherer, and he took no
courſe to clear himſelf.</item>
               <item>7. That he ſaid in his Prayer, Lord, thou knoweſt there be many in
hell, better than we, which is a dangerous thing to bring weak Chriſtians
into the ſin of deſpair.</item>
               <item>8. That he prayed, Lord, how long wilt thou avenge our bloud on them
that dwell on the earth? Lord, give the ſcarlet whore plenty of bloud to
drink, for ſhe is worthy: We do think it a dangerous thing to meddle with
the judgement of God, to direct him how he ſhall puniſh ſinners.</item>
               <item>9. He ſaid the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> cauſed a Proteſtants guts to be wound
out alive.</item>
               <item>10. That he laid aſperſion of Malignants upon ſome of the Pariſh.</item>
               <item>11. When the Pariſhioners pitched upon Mr. to be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid, The poor of the Pariſh did ſet their hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would give two meſſes of porridge to Mr. <hi>Culmers</hi> one, which is
enough to diſcourage any Miniſter from coming amongst us, as if we more
regarded the food of our bodies, than of our ſouls, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe Articles are to be ſeen under their own hands, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> after the Juſtices had peruſed them: But the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61104:17"/>
two laſt Articles were wholly forged againſt him; And that of the
man taken up at Sea, is in the Book of Martyrs. And after this Riot,
the Miniſter of the next Pariſh dying, moſt of that place came uſually
to <hi>Mynſter</hi> Church; And eſpecially two Juſtices of Peace, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-Lieutenants
came with their Families conſtantly, for about two
years, untill it did pleaſe God to provide a godly Miniſter for them in
their own Pariſh: But their coming pleaſed not the faction; for (to
uſe the Gentlemens own words) the ſtyle over which they were to
come on the Sabbath to the Church, was bedawbed with reaking hot
ſir-reverence, of purpoſe by ſome that waited their coming, ſo that
they were conſtrained to have a gap made in the hedge to go thorow.
And the wife of the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man (who told her husband, <hi>She edified
moſt by Mr.</hi> Culmer<hi>'s Miniſtry, and deſired him to carry her no more
about to other Pariſhes with him on the Sabbath)</hi> when ſhe was gone
home in the Sabbath noon-tide, a ſir-reverence was laid in her Pew
in the Church: But a ſtranger (a Gentlewoman of <hi>London)</hi> coming
from the next Pariſh before her to Church, when Divine Worſhip
was begun, kneeling down ſuddenly in the Pew, was ſo bedawbed
with that ſtinking excrement, that ſhe was conſtrained to ſtrip her
white Sattin-peticoat over her feet in publick, in the Church, in the
time of divine Worſhip, and wrapping it up, gave it to her man over the
Pew, in the face of all the Congregation. And many other abuſes at
home and abroad have been put upon M. <hi>Culmer</hi> for his good affection
to the preſent Powers and Government, enough to fill a volume.</p>
            <p>One of the Grandees of the Faction that cried <hi>All, All</hi> in the
Church at <hi>Mynſter</hi> (ſeeing him in <hi>Sandwich</hi> when the mock-Prince
was there, the day before the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Petitioning with Swords) made
a clamour againſt him in the open ſtreets as he paſſed by, to incenſe
the numerous crew there againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> but he then eſcaped.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he coming thither from <hi>London</hi> about Noon
upon the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>December,</hi> 1647. called <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day; and
being in his Inne, a tumult was made in the ſtreets againſt godly men
which opened their Shops that day; and when Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> heard the
Maior was knockt down, he was running out to help the Maior: But
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Joſeph Phillips</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>Saracens-head,</hi> ſhut his doors,
and he and his men laid hands on Maſter <hi>Culmer,</hi> and kept
him in, and a little after he was perſwaded to ride out at the
back gate; But he was not gone half a quarter of an hour, but the
Rioters came in, and ſearched for him, and would not be perſwaded
but that he was in the houſe, and ſwore, <hi>They would hang the Round-headed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61104:18"/>
Rogue;</hi> and afterward he was informed, <hi>they would have hanged
him over the Cathedral-gate, where he helped to pull down the large
Image of Chriſt, with the holy Ghoſt in form of a Dove over his head,
in full proportion.</hi> And he then riding thorow the back-ſtreet, there
were few people there: for all were in a tumult in the High-ſtreet,
after ſome <hi>Plumporridge-Prieſts</hi> (as M. <hi>Culmer</hi> uſed to call them) had
ended their Sermons: But at North gate ſtreet, ſome women ſeeing
him ride that day with his Cloak bag behinde him, railed at him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Oh Rogue, will not you give Chriſt his day?</hi> he was compelled to
eſcape the dirt thrown at him, to runne the Gantlet, or thorow Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
as they call it. And on Moonday-morning (according to his
promiſe to a friend) he returned to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> having heard nothing
of their ſearch for him the Saturday before: And at North-gate-ſtreet
there were few people: But two women there asked him, <hi>If he
were Mr.</hi> Culmer, which when they knew, <hi>Oh Sir,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ride
no further, for the City-gates are ſhut, and they are all together by the
ears, and ſome in</hi> Canterbury <hi>ſwore, If they had taken you upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,
they would have ſtoned you to death, or hanged you:</hi> But (being
mindfull of his promiſe) rid on to the midſt of <hi>Ruttenton</hi>-lane; but
upon better conſideration, he took this as a warning from God, and
returned to <hi>Forditch,</hi> where he wrote a Letter to excuſe his not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to promiſe, and then he rode to Sir <hi>James Oxendens,</hi>
where after Dinner the News being ſeconded of the Riſing in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
he and his Sonne (being Deputy-Lieutenants) ſent Orders to
raiſe the trained Bands; and a Regiment came from the <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi>
which quelled the Rioters, who were many of them carried to <hi>Leeds</hi>
Caſtle: But when Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> came to <hi>Canterbury</hi> at the coming in of
thoſe forces, a woman in <hi>North-gate</hi> ſaid <hi>Oh M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer, <hi>there's good
quarter for you now in</hi> Canterbury. But I cannot conceive for which of
Mr. <hi>Culmers</hi> good works in <hi>Canterbury</hi> any there ſhould ſtone him,
whoſe Miniſtry they enjoyed <hi>gratis</hi> for many years, and where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
with the hazard of his life, to quench their fires in <hi>Dover</hi>-lane,
and elſwhere, and where he hath leaped into a deep whirl-pit,
and dived to ſave life, and fetched up the party from the bottom, when
he was Miniſter at <hi>Harbledown,</hi> as hundreds there know, being eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes
thereof.</p>
            <p>But in the year 1648. the Scout and the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> man, and their
Faction, <hi>One, and All, All, All,</hi> proved themſelves Malignants with
a witneſſe, by their practice and actings in the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Riſing, wherein
divers of them were Commanders, and were Sequeſtred; The Scout
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61104:18"/>
was a Captain therein. Two dayes before the Riſing they ſummoned
a meeting at Church, to ſign the Cavaller-Petition, which when
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> had read, he earneſtly diſſwaded them from ſubſcribing it;
The Petition cried down <hi>Taxes, and would have the Army diſbanded,
&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſhewed them the neceſſity of Taxes, to defend
our ſelves againſt the enemies of our Religion, lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
wars were chargeable, as Phyſick in ſickneſſe, more chargeable than
ordinary Diet, and that we were in a Tempeſt, and at ſuch times
men throw their goods overboard, to ſave their lives, and that theſe
Taxes were not ordinary, but upon neceſſity; And that the Kings
Taxes of Ship-money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were made without a Parliament, and
without neceſſity, and that theſe illegal preſſures were taken away.
Then one of the chief of the Faction (who after was a Commander,
and an Impriſoner) ſaid, <hi>The Parliament hath taken a Flea out of our
boſome, and put in a Serpent:</hi> And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſpeaking againſt the
disbanding the Souldiers, ſaid, <hi>The Wolves would make peace with the
Shepherds, upon condition they would hang up their Dogs; The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
deſirous of peace, hung up their Dogs, but when the Dogs were
gone, the Wolves devoured Sheep and Shepherds too:</hi> And this my father
applied, ſhewing, that the Army kept us, Governours and People
from bloudy Wolves in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Papiſts, Atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
refuſed to ſubſcribe, but the <hi>All, All, All</hi>-man cried out, <hi>Pen
and Ink:</hi> Then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> left them ſubſcribing: And the next day
<hi>Richard Langley</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Laurence</hi> Pariſh (a very godly man, and active
for the State) was ſet upon, and put to it to flie for his life, and was
purſued to <hi>Mynſter,</hi> and murdered there upon <hi>Thourn-down:</hi> But the
Gentleman Cavalier that ſent out the purſuers, and furniſhed them
with Horſe and Piſtols, did afterwards cut his own wife in pieces, and
was hanged at <hi>Sandwich.</hi> This man was a great jeerer at praying by
the Spirit, a contemner of publick Ordinances, a great Incendiary
againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> and came to him, reviled and berogued him before
hundreds of people at a publick meeting in the Tents at <hi>Mynſter</hi> at a
muſter. And Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> being at home, when the Riſing began,
knew nothing of it, or of the murder of <hi>Langley,</hi> untill his ſervant
came home, and told him how matters ſtood, and that they were
arming in the ſtreet to fall upon him, and that there was a Court of
Guard at <hi>Ebbsfleet,</hi> and at <hi>Sarr:</hi> Whereupon he (knowing himſelf
unable to defend himſelf in his own houſe) preſently eſcaped out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to his houſe; And (night coming on) he went to the
River ſide next <hi>Aſh,</hi> and did ſwim in his cloaths over the River; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61104:19"/>
having left his Boots when he took water, he went without ſhoes on
the South of the River, till he was paſt <hi>Ebbsfleet,</hi> where the Court
of Guard was, on the other ſide of the River: And then he croſſed
the Haven again nearer <hi>Sandwich,</hi> at a place called <hi>Little-joy.</hi> And
who it was ſhot at him, God knoweth, but he was fain to play the
<hi>Dydapper,</hi> and croſſing the Haven again below <hi>Sandwich</hi> (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wade</hi>
now Gentleman Uſher at <hi>White-hall</hi> can tell more of this.) Then he
travelled bare-foot on the ſands to <hi>Deal,</hi> where he had entertainment
at Pilot <hi>Culmers</hi> houſe, whither he came at break of day, and there
he had a gray Sute, and refreſhed himſelf: But preſently there begun
a Tumult before the door againſt him, and they ſwore, <hi>They would
hang the Round-headed Prieſt,</hi> and the Rout increaſed; but by means
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wood</hi> a Phyſician there, and his ſaid Kinſman <hi>John Culmer</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Potter,</hi> he eſcaped and got ſafe to <hi>Deal</hi>-Caſtle to Col. <hi>Rainſborow,</hi> which
was his intent, when he firſt ſet out. The noble Collonel uſed him
very courteouſly. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lmer</hi> of <hi>Sandwich</hi> (coming newly out
of the Iſle) told Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> how his friend <hi>Richard Langly</hi> lay in his
bloud, and that they ſaid, <hi>If they had taken him, he ſhould not have
died that death; and that he had no way to eſcape them, but by ſwimming.</hi>
And that day the Collonel carried M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> aboard with him in his
Long-boat, and put him aboard Captain <hi>Nubery,</hi> in the <hi>Hunter</hi>
Frigot, which was then diſpatcht for <hi>London,</hi> whither M <hi>Culmer</hi> came
one <hi>Saturday</hi> night late. And the next day he preached in his gray
Pilots ſute at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Whitakers</hi> Church, called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Mary Bermonſey,</hi> and
incouraged the people to ſtand faſt and cleave to the preſent Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And when the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> marched into <hi>Kent,</hi> he returned home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the Army, and came ſafe to his Family and Charge, where
they had plundred him of horſes and other goods: But in Mr. <hi>Culmers</hi>
abſence, the Faction had got a <hi>like Prieſt, like People,</hi> and they had
<hi>Service-Book worſhip, Gloria Patri,</hi> and <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> &amp;c.
Afterwards they compelled Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> to pay what they had laviſhed
upon a Malignant Prieſt in his abſence, and he (for peace ſake) gave
them their demands.</p>
            <p>And in his abſence a grand Perſecutor of his of another Pariſh
(who came to the Ale houſe at <hi>Mynſter)</hi> incenſed them againſt him,
jeering and calling him, <hi>The godly, able, orthodox Divine.</hi> This man
ſent word to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Paramour</hi> (at his firſt advance in that Riſing) <hi>That
he never did ſee a Sword ſcarletted,</hi> but he was ſlain at <hi>Wye,</hi> and left
ſtark naked lying in his bloud. And a little after that Riſing the 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>
man died: And for divers years after Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> lived peaceably
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61104:19"/>
without diſturbance, untill he entred upon the Adminiſtration of the
Lords-Supper, and refuſed to give it to all, as all the Iſland Miniſters
then gave it. <hi>(Hinc illae lachryma)</hi> Then ſome oppoſed that way pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
and a new ſtir began againſt him; The Communion-Table
Carpet was cut out into Breeches, ſlanders raiſed, Tythes detained.
And divers did hate him upon other grounds alſo, becauſe after pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and publick means uſed by him in his Miniſtry to reform abuſes in
the Pariſh, and that not prevailing, and all others refuſing to act
by complaints to the Magiſtrate, Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> complained againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſwearers and drunkards, and prophaners of the Sabbath; And
(amongſt the reſt) he complained of the Scouts prodigious executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
And he indicted him (with the conſent of divers of the Pariſh)
for erecting two new Cottages there, to the great prejudice of the
Commonwealth, and of that Pariſh, which hath been lately charged
with above 300<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> a year to the poor, who cannot all be imployed
there, and will (in all likelihood, if Cottages and Inmates be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed)
pull the rich men out of their houſes, as they have done the
Miniſter out of the Church. It is not ſo proper, I confeſs, for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to indict ſuch men, and to attend the publick Seſſions, with ſuch
complaints, though for the common good, as <hi>England</hi> finds by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and will finde more need of, and incouragements to ſuch
Indictments: but in that Pariſh none dare act or ſhew themſelves
publickly in ſuch things, although the Pariſh be undone by them: But
I heard Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> ſay, <hi>He was reſolved to wave the ſcandal, and odium,
and prejudice, that came to him by ſuch actings, ſeeing they were of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the common good, and all others refuſe to act, the conceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to have a calling from God to do it as a Pariſhioner there.</hi> Upon
which account he conceives himſelf bound in conſcience, never to
ceaſe ſuch endeavours for the common good, though it much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
his private. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> indicted the Scout for barring a
common ſheep-way, for which he had a Verdict againſt him at the
laſt Summer Seſſions at <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe and other actings for the publick, Mr <hi>Culmer</hi> is hated and
perſecuted, eſpecially now by the Scout, who (being no Pariſhioner
of <hi>Mynſter,</hi> yet occupying Lands there) to be avenged of Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
hath detained his Tythes for three years laſt paſt, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
five more to joyn with him to put into the Exchequer a joynt
Anſwer with him, wherein they inſerted ſcandalous and falſe Articles,
and did ſwear, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>is an enemy to the preſent State,</hi> &amp;c.
But the Honourable Barons of that Court, ordered Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> five
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61104:20"/>
pounds coſts meerly for the ſcandal in their Anſwer, which they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be expunged. Whereupon the enraged Scout, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
went lately to a Juſtice of Peace, who is a Commiſſioner for
Ejecting of Scandalous Miniſters in <hi>Kent,</hi> to whom they accuſed Mr.
<hi>Culmer,</hi> as followeth, <hi>viz</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That his breath ſmelt of drink one Evening. That he ſaid, that</hi>
Pontius <hi>was his Chriſten-name, and</hi> Pilate <hi>his ſir-name. That he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on</hi> Pſal. 51. 18. <hi>and ſaid, by</hi> Sion <hi>was meant the Church, and by</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
<hi>the Civil State. That he preached. That a Toleration was better
than a Perſecution.</hi> And when the Juſtice ſaid, <hi>He was ſorry to hear
complaints againſt a Miniſter upon ſuch weak grounds:</hi> It was replied
(by him that firſt clamoured againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> for want of prayers
in his <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-holy-dayes, and Trumpeter in the Riot on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath)
<hi>That if they above had that about a Toleration before them, they
would make ſomething of it.</hi> This man was lately brought in to be
Pariſh-Clark by the Faction, for his good ſervice done againſt
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> many wayes, eſpecially in being Ring-leader in that Riot,
and for railing at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> at the Church-wall before and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and never going to Church elſwhere, only attending that evil
work, and affronting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> coming and going to Church for
divers years, they would have no aſſiſtant to the Miniſter to ſave
charges, ſo that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> beſides praying, reading, expounding,
and preaching twice every Sabbath, and catechizing conſtantly, was
conſtrained to name and read the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to the people, for this man
reads very falſe, and now he comes to Church for gain; he uſeth
when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> is preaching on the Sabbath to make mows and Apes
faces, and laugh, and make other ridiculous geſtures in the Church,
to move contempt againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> and laughter; which divers
godly men make great complaint of, to ſee Gods name ſo taken in
vain, and his Ordinances and Sabbaths ſo prophaned, which is no
ſmall Perſecution of, and grief to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer.</hi> But the truth is that
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pontius was as his Chriſten-name,</hi> &amp;c. And the Scout
ſaid openly at the Seſſions, (when the Verdict was given againſt him)
<hi>Mr.</hi> Culmer, <hi>you have let my purſe bloud, but I will let your bloud to
ſome tune ere long, I'll warrant you;</hi> But he may be ſilent about bloud,
if he look home (but I forbear impertinent recriminations.) And
(in proſecution of that blood-letting) one of the ſaid Anſwerers
(endeavouring to fill up the meaſure of his deceaſed Fathers perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> from whom he hath detained his Tythes for
above three years, to a great value, and who is a prophane ſcoffer at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61104:20"/>
the Communicants, calling them, <hi>Mr.</hi> Culmer<hi>'s Diſciples:</hi> And in
oppoſition leaves the Chancel windows unrepaired, ſo that the rain
daſhed into M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> face lately at that Adminiſtration, and rained
into the Cup, and wet the bread exceedingly, and the Communion
Table-cloath was as wet as if it had been taken out of the water)
came lately alone to the ſaid Commiſſioners houſe, and offered to put
in Articles againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> but he ſaid, <hi>He had none written, only
he deſired to ſee the Ordinance for the Ejecting of Scandalous Miniſters,</hi>
which was read to him, as to the Sca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dals therein enumerated, as juſt
cauſes of the Ejection of ſuch Miniſters; and he anſwered to every
Article by it ſelf, <hi>That he had nothing againſt Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>touching it.</hi>
But in concluſion he ſaid, <hi>Although I have nothing againſt M.</hi> Culmer,
<hi>which the Articles will reach, yet I will denl ſomewhere elſe againſt him
for words he hath ſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken of my wife:</hi> Whereupon he petitioned
and complained of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> to his Highneſs, and thereupon it is
ſince boaſted in <hi>Canterbury, That Mr.</hi> Culmer <hi>ſhall be caſt out of
Mynſter.</hi> A <hi>quondam</hi> Singing-man of the Cathedral, ſaid in the open
ſtreets, <hi>That he heard M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Culmer <hi>had routed</hi> C. S. <hi>at the Seſſions, but</hi>
C. S. <hi>would rout him out of Mynſter;</hi> And a Cavalier of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
ſaid to one of <hi>Mynſter, N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w your Round-headed Prieſt of Mynſter ſhall
be caſt out.</hi> And they boaſt of their friends above in the Army. But
they need not ſeek further revenge for that then their own avenging
themſelves by their calumnies, and falſe accuſations and railings againſt
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer;</hi> Beſides the real wrongs they have done M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi>
eſpecially in keeping his Maintenance from him, and combining to
undo him by charges in Law. But it ſeems nothing will ſatisfie their
malice and rage, but his purſes bleeding to death, by taking away his
means of Livelihood and Subſiſtence, by his Ejection or Removal from
his place and Station.</p>
            <p>But if this project againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſhould prevail without
the merits of the Cauſe, to have their wils of him at ſuch a cheap
rate without their price of near 200<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>per annum,</hi> or (rather than fail)
I ſuppoſe ſo much as <hi>Haman</hi> offered to pay into the Exchequer for the
ruine of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and others: Then what triumph would the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral,
Prelatical, Cavalier party in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and elſwhere, make
againſt him, and againſt all his worthy friends, and againſt that Cauſe
of God to which he hath conſtantly adhered? How would they
inſult, againſt whom Perſonally he hath acted, for the ſuppreſſing of
vice, and brought them to condign puniſhment? They triumph
already in hope and confidence to prevail; but then (no doubt) they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61104:21"/>
would rejoyce, and ſend gifts one to another, at the ruine of him,
who had tormented them; They would make, if not Bonfires, yet
Books and Ballads, as they did in the rehearſed Libel, called, <hi>The Razing
of the Record,</hi> viz.</p>
            <q>
               <l>When the ſtrongeſt was King, there roſe up a thing</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>And there was found in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at the beginning of this
Parliament, a baſe jeering, quibling Catch, or Libel, written againſt
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <l>And what's the News in Kent?</l>
               <l>They want a Parliament:</l>

               </l>
               <l>And what's the News in <hi>Tennet?</hi>

               <l>He lov'd the Parliament;</l>
               <l>But now he doth lament:</l>
               <l>The Biſhops he did hate;</l>
               <l>But now <hi>Dick</hi>'s out of Date:</l>
               <l>Cathedral he did maul;</l>
               <l>But now he ſpits his gall:</l>
               <l>He broke the painted-Glaſs,</l>
               <l>But now he cries alas:</l>
               <l>Then drink to me brave <hi>Jack,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And let the Round-head pack</l>
            </q>
            <p>And if pretences of not Edifying be cauſe of oppoſitions, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
enmity ſhould prevail to remove a Miniſter without the merits of
the Cauſe (which I fear is the only ground of the preſent attempt
againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer)</hi> eſpecially when ſuch a rioting, mutinous, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
crew act againſt him: If they ſhould be ſo indulged, as to
wave the Commiſſioners and Common-Law; Would not other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
be thereby incouraged to endleſs unwearied, impudent Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of faithfull Miniſters, in hope to prevail and weary him out
one way or other, one time or other, eſpecially under that pretence
of not Edifying. And many times there is pretence of univerſal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
oppoſition in a Pariſh, when only one or two lead all the reſt, to
ſubſcribe Petitions, clamour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt a Miniſter, and all follow
the Ring leaders for company, or other reſpects, as Sheep follow a
Ramme drawn through a gap, or leap out of a Boat, as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61104:21"/>
ſhews, as they at <hi>Harbledown</hi> did, where they barked for
company. It's a ſure ſign commonly, that a Miniſter is good, when
all the Pariſh is againſt him: and commonly when a whole Pariſh
loves a Miniſter, and ſpeaks well of him, he is ſtark naught <hi>(Woe be
unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you) A like Prieſt like people;</hi>
as a Neighbour-Prieſt to Mr <hi>Culmer</hi> ſaid to the Pariſhioners, when he
had called them up into the Chancel; <hi>Neighbours, I would gladly give
you all content, pray do I read too much or too little of the Service-Book?</hi>
And every Pariſh hath as much right to have the Miniſter removed,
becauſe they oppoſe him, as any one Pariſh, and thereby faithfull
Miniſters ſhall be runagates, and wandring Levites, all the Nation
over. Beſides the very removal of a Miniſter, which is not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
is ſcandalous and prejudicial to his Miniſtry, whitherſoever he
is removed; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmers</hi> Perſecution from <hi>Goodneſtone</hi> was taken up as
a ſcandal, and cauſe of oppoſition, and clamour againſt him at
<hi>Harbledown:</hi> And whitherſoever M. <hi>Culmer</hi> is removed, he (above
all Miniſters) muſt expect hatred, and oppoſition, and perſecution
from ignorant, prophane, diſaffected perſons, which abound in every
Pariſh; For not only the Perſecutors that have their wils of him to
remove him, will purſue him, and ſtir up enmity againſt him whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he goes, as they at <hi>Harbledowx</hi> did incenſe them at <hi>Mynſter,</hi>
and thoſe at <hi>Mynster</hi> did incenſe them at <hi>Cliff</hi> againſt him, if he had
been removed thither, which was endeavoured. But ſome of the
Parliament oppoſed it for reaſons of State, that Mutineers ſhould not
be incouraged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is the nature of perſecutors ſo to purſue the
perſecuted (read <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 19.) And he muſt the rather expect ſuch
oppoſition, becauſe the Ly-bels, printed and publiſhed, and ſpread
all the Nation over, have many lyes ſo loud againſt him in all places:
He was aſſaulted at <hi>Billingsgate</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (in the time of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi>
Riſing after he was fled to <hi>London</hi> in 1648.) where the people were
incenſed againſt him by a Scribe that did belong to the Archbiſhops
Regiſtry at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> hardly eſcaped with his life,
retreating in <hi>Summers</hi>-Key with his Rapier-Cane, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mapſden</hi>
took him into his houſe: And about two years ſince <hi>P. K.</hi> a debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Malignant-Prieſt, incenſed the people againſt him in the <hi>Minories</hi>
without <hi>Algate;</hi> but the Gentleman that is now Deputy there, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> to come into his houſe, leſt they ſhould murder him.
And an Elder and Preacher of <hi>J. T.</hi> pretended Separate Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(who is Curate to that <hi>Non-reſident</hi> Paſtor, who lives near thirty
miles from divers of his ſcandalous flock at <hi>Mynſter)</hi> meeting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61104:22"/>
lately upon the road, affronted him, and uſed opprobrious tearms,
and cried out, <hi>Mr.</hi> Culmer, <hi>Mr.</hi> Culmer, <hi>Pray ſell me four pounds-worth
of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> repeating thoſe words again and again, and
ſaid, <hi>I know you had enough of the holy Ghoſt from the Biſhop to afford a
good penny-worth.</hi> And afterwards overtaking Travellers, boaſted of
this, and told them, <hi>How he had handled the Antichriſtian Priest.</hi> And
this Sectary ſaid at <hi>Sandwich</hi> to Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> before many witneſſes, <hi>If
you be not all Antichriſtian Prieſts then the Devil fetch me away before all
this company;</hi> And being reproved for his execration, he ſaid, <hi>If you be
not all Antichriſtian Priests, then I pray God to command the Devil to fetch
me away body and ſoul before all this company.</hi> So that it is now come to
paſſe that M. <hi>Culmer</hi> may ſay with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, In journeying often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countreymen, in perils
by the Heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderneſſe, in
perils in the Sea, in perils amongst falſe brethren,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 26.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, whatſoever the Adverſaries of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> ſuggeſt
againſt him in their ſecret or publick accuſations, and calumnies
as if he were ſuch a <hi>Peſtilent fellow,</hi> &amp;c. yet he is ſtill the ſame man as
he was before atteſted to be, both in his life, and doctrine, and good
affection to the preſent Powers: And of this aſſertion, I will only ſet
down ſome late Teſtimonials, and conclude: One of theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials

            <p>Another Teſtimonial is ſubſcribed by nine of the ſaid Commiſſioners
in <hi>Kent,</hi> as followeth:</p>
            <p>We whoſe Names are here under written, do hereby teſtifie, that <hi>Richard
Culmer</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Mynſter</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> in the County of

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61104:22"/>
Gods Word, and hath conſtantly and eminently ſhewed his good affection to
the State, and to Reformation. <hi>Dated the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of</hi> June, 1655.</p>
            <p>Henry Oxenden, John Boys, John Dixwell, Thomas Foach, Thomas

<hi>Miniſter of</hi> Sandwich.</p>
            <p>Another Teſtimonial is from the chief Sea-Town in that Iſle (where
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> (with others) preacheth a weekly Lecture <hi>gratis)</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</p>

<hi>Kent,</hi> whoſe Names are here under written, do hereby freely certifie, that
Mr. <hi>Richard Culmer</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Mynſter</hi> in the ſaid Iſle, doth (with
others) freely preach a weekly Lecture in the ſaid Pariſh, to the good liking
of the ſaid Pariſhioners; and that we receive much benefit by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
to our Edification and Conſolation: In witneſſe whereof we have
hereunto ſet our hands this ninth Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1656.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And it may adde ſomething to this Apology and defence, for the
continuing and upholding of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer</hi> in his place, that he being
threeſcore years of age, hath laid out (beſides Fifths and Taxes)
above 200<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> in Reparations, Buildings, Gardens, Orchyards, Pond,
Fences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the Vicarage-houſe in <hi>Mynſter,</hi> which was an unfit
habitation at his firſt coming thither; There having lived no reſident
houſ-keeping Vicar in fifty years before; And he was at all this coſt
upon a Sequeſtred Vicarage, chiefly relying on the Juſtice &amp; favour of
his Highneſs, knowing that Vicarage to be only in his Highneſſes Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Patronage and diſpoſal; after the death of the preſent ſequeſtred
Incumbent; And all this Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> often ſaid he did, <hi>In faith and
confidence of Gods continuing to own his own Cauſe, and the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
under His Highneſs, whom God preſerve.</hi> But that which
doth eſpecially blaſt and weaken the project and pretences, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
from his place and ſtation (wherein he was ſetled by Authority,
and hath been upheld by the Juſtice of the Higher Powers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the ſpecial Providence of God) is, that there he hath edified
ſouls; Having (maugre the Devil and all his Inſtruments) <hi>the ſeal of
<pb facs="tcp:61104:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Miniſtry there, by the beating down with the ſpiritual weapons of his
warfare the ſtrong-holds of Satan, ignorance, drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. He
having by his Miniſtry there, <hi>turned many from darkneſs to light, and
from the power of Satan to God</hi> which the moſt obſtinate Adverſaries
have confeſſed in divers places. There was lately one of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
who being with his Tenant at the Inne at <hi>Mynſter,</hi> heard one railing
on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Culmer,</hi> to whom he ſaid, <hi>I have heard you ſpeak evil of Mr.</hi>
Culmer, <hi>I have known him better ſpoken of: But have you no good to
ſay of him? Pray deal plainly, Doth he no good amongst you?</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, <hi>We think the Pariſh is better for him in two things, One is,
That there is more knowledge, (becauſe beſides his Preaching) he doth
conſtantly c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>chiſe. And the other is, That there is not half ſo much
drunkenneſs in the Pariſh, as there was before he came to be Miniſter
here.</hi> And if any ſhould maliciouſly and impudently deny this Seal of
his Miniſtry, and clamour, whiſper, or ſuggeſt, that he ought to be
removed, becauſe he doth no good there, nor never will, becauſe he
is oppoſed, which (as is ſhewed before) is the uſual plea of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to have their wils without the merits of the cauſe, in an arbitrary
way, and move the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to joyn in the Perſecution;
yet the thing it ſelf doth ſpeak and confute that untruth: For many in
the Pariſh (the chiefeſt) are convinced by the power of the Word in
his Miniſtry; and are come in freely to the wayes and Government of
Jeſus Chriſt in Church-fellowſhip, giving a particular account of their
Chriſtian knowledge; and promiſing to be willing to be admoniſhed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the number of viſible Saints increaſeth in that Pariſh daily,
bleſſed be God: And there is not only a very great Reformation in
that Pariſh, but in the whole Iſle, as to good affection to the Preſent
State, and to Reformation; ſince the eſtabliſhing of a Godly, Well-affected
Magiſtracy there, and ſince the ſettling of a faithfull Miniſtry,
almoſt in all the ſeven Pariſhes of that Iſle, <hi>Wherein (as in Zabulon
and Napthali) by the way of the Sea, the people that ſate in darkneſſe
ſee great light.</hi>
