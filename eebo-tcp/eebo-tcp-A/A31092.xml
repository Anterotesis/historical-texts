            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MAny may be ready to judge, that this wonderful and
merciful manifestation of God's Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the delivering my Child from so great an Evil,
doth arise rather from ostentation, than from any real cause I
had to publish the same: for I know, that it was in all Ages,
the design of Satan to put an odium upon the best of works
that have been done in the world. Hence it was said of Christ,
that <hi>he cast out Devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of
Devils,</hi> that by that means the Iews might hide from the
eyes of the People, the Goodness and Power of God, which was
plainly seen in what Christ did. Things of this nature will
not pass without censure.</p>
            <p>Such is the reigning power of Satan in the hearts of many
at this day also, that a work of this kind will by them be stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized,
and the persons also that God made use of as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in his hand to do it. I therefore thought it meet, to give
the <hi>Reader</hi> to understand, that my end, in the publishing of
what God hath done for me, in taking my Child out of the
hands of Satan, is not the lifting up of my self, nor those men
that wrestled with the Lord for me; God who knows the
secrets of all hearts, knows it: but that he alone might have
the glory and praise of so great a mercy, to whom I desire to
give it, and to no other but him alone, which is the main reason
why I make the world acquainted with it; for should I conceal
so great a Mercy, it would be ingratitude in me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47211:3"/>Another reason that hath induced me to publish what hath
been the Lords doings, is, that others might be stirred up to
praise the Lord with me, who is a God hearing prayer; of
whom we may say, as once <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Who is like unto
thee, O Lord, amongst the gods? who is like unto
thee, glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing
Wonders!</hi> Exod. 15. 11. for surely it would not only be ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in me to the Lord, to conceal a thing of such weight, but
it would accuse me of want of love to other Christians, who
may thereby be not only occasioned to praise the Lord, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to seek the Lord in all their straits, forsaking those
vain, if not wicked proceedings of some, who by Charms, think
to deliver from the power of the Devil, as will appear in the
following Discourse: for I my self indeed, being no otherwise,
nor no better informed, endeavoured the help of my Child by
such means, as I have now cause to repent that ere I made use
of them; but the Lord was pleased at length to let me see my
folly therein, after I had spent and wasted that little estate I
had, as is well known to many: therefore what ends I should
have in what I do, may be easily discerned by the Wise.</p>
            <p>I know there are some tongues that will not be wanting to
sander me and my Child with dissimulation, though it is well-known
by many it was no such matter, neither can it be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so judged; seeing there was no profit made thereby, but as I
said, it was to the impoverishing of me and mine. Whatever is
said by any, shall not I hope trouble me, I having a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
I bless the Lord my Child is now well, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
so ever since the Lord was sought to. Blessed be the
Lord; let all his Saints bless him with me.</p>

            <head>The Lord's Arm stretched out in an
Answer of Prayer, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1661. was the beginning of the lamentable and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
trouble of my poor Child, who was then taken ill after this
manner following.</p>
            <p>His Mother, my Wife, bad him read his Book, which he did;
and after he had read a Chapter, he was taken with a violent burning, so
great, that we thought it would cost him his life. In this condition he
continued about a week, at the end whereof, being on his Legs again,
he would walk up and down the room, throwing his hat from his head,
laying his hands under his belly, and screeking out lamentably, forty
times in a day or more; this lasting some eight or ten dayes, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
taken in another manner: as he walked about the Chamber,
there was heard a croaking in his throat, very strange to them that heard
it, which continued eight or ten dayes, or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>Suddenly after this there appeared Rats to him, and Cats with Rats in
their clawes, dancing them sometimes coming (as he said) with glasses
of Sack in their clawes, and Pasties, offering them to the Child, but he
refused to receive them, and threw things at them; then they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Soul, bidding him give it to the Devil, but he refused to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to them. They told him when his Father and Mother was gone
forth, they would come and dine with him at the long Table; after
which time he could neither eat nor drink, except he did first go behind
the door and sing, with his hat off; otherwise what he eat or drank would
not go down, but endanger the choaking of him.</p>
            <p>Suddenly after this, he was taken above thirty times in a day both
lame, dumb and blind, continuing so for a time. After this, I no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
went out about my imployment, (which lay abroad) but he would
be cast upon the ground with a great force, insomuch that I could not
otherwise conclude but it must be done by the malice and power of the
Devil. When he was upon the ground he would strike himself upon the
face with all his force, to the great amazement of the spectators, which
were several Friends of mine that came to see my Child, hearing what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47211:4"/>
condition he was in, by reason of whose coming, as we supposed, he was
changed into divers and several actions; for the more they came to see
him, the more his fits came upon him, which we perceiving, desired
them to forbear coming; they did so, and then his fits abated.</p>
            <p>After this he was confined to a certain stool that was in the house, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that if any one else did sit down on that stool, he would be
thrown flat on the ground, as it were dead, and not arise as long as any
one else did sit on the aforesaid stool.</p>
            <p>At a certain time going to a Neighbours house he carried this stool
with him, because he could sit upon no other; some friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of mine being desirous to see the Boy, came to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
house where he was; they were no sooner come in but he fell into
the same fits, using the same action as is above related: At the end of
which fits, he said he would go home to dinner, which accordingly he did,
and at his going, he bad that none of them should sit upon his stool, if
they did, he told them he should know it. The boy being at home at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
fell down flat on his back, spreading his arms much to my admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but suddainly he got up and said, <hi>I know that some body hath sat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my stool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was about to eat (according to his accustomed manner)
he went behind the door to sing, but said he, <hi>I will not sing,</hi> (at which
time he was like to be choaked with his food) as he often would say,
but till he did sing he could not swallow one bit. After he had ate he
went again in haste to the Neighbours house, where my Friends were
still waiting for his coming; as soon as he came, he told them, <hi>That
some of them had sat upon his stool;</hi> they seemingly denyed, but he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirmed, <hi>they did;</hi> which at the last, they that sate thereon did
confess, and wonder how he should know it. After this he would walk
up and down in a frantick manner with a hammer in his hand, often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon four persons, <hi>viz. Sam. Man, Iohn Sames, Mol Williams,
Mary Prett;</hi> saying, <hi>Mary, O Mary, O brave Mol, I'll fit you Mol,</hi>
often throwing the hammer behind the door: Thus he continued part
of the day calling over the aforesaid Names. Many asked me when
they heard him, Whether I knew any such? My answer was, <hi>I knew none
but I supposed they were such canting names suitable to him that taught him,
and caused all the rest of his troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time as he was sitting at a Table, he had gotten paper,
a pen, and ink, and a pin; I seeing him have a pin, ask him, what he
would do with that pin? he answered not, but hung down his head as
though he had been ashamed; I then spake hastily to him, and took the
pin from him, at which he fell a crying; with that I asked him again,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47211:4"/>
what he would do with that pin? then he asked me, <hi>whether God were not
above the Devil?</hi> I said, Yea, God is above the Devil, he told me then,
he must write down that: I would not be so put off, but would know
what he would do with the pin, but no answer could I get for a while,
at length he told me there was a young man, that prayed with him, and
told him, that if he would go with him to such a place in the Country,
that then he should be well. This was all I could get from him, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these put offs were of the Devil, who would not suffer him to tell
me what he would do with it.</p>
            <p>At another time he sate with his legs across; I went to him and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his legs asunder, with that he fell a screeking out, and called for
his mother to pull off his hose and shoes, which she did, and found his
legs and feet so cold, that there was no heat at all to be felt in them; my
wife then applied some warm clothes to them, but the boy seemed to be
in extream torture, crying out in a very lamentable manner for three
quarters of an hour, <hi>O what shall I do! O what shall I do!</hi> &amp;c. at last he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his hose and shoes to put them on again, but could not by reason
of the pain he was in; but so soon, as by our help, they were got on, he
presently was well, and leaped up and down the room as at other times.</p>
            <p>At another time as he was sitting in the yard on a block, a Rat did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to him (as he said) unto which he was heard to say, <hi>Satan, thou must
be burned in hell fire, and all that do obey thee,</hi> often rehearsing these words:
and further said, that Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the
Devil. Neighbours coming in, and hearing these sayings, and seeing his
actions (for he sate fillipping with his fingers) did very much wonder
at it. He said moreover, the Rat told him he must go up stairs, and play
with his pretty Rat there; and up stairs he would often go: He also
had a little box with single money in it, which would sometimes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of his hand, which he would strive to take up often, repeating
these words, <hi>I will not sing, I will not sing,</hi> but could by no means take it
up, except he did sing.</p>
            <p>He had many times very strange actions, sometimes after this, and
sometimes after that manner, as running up and down the house with
his hands to his ears, and hopping, as though he were mad: sometimes
he would sweat very much; and sometimes he would labour and strive,
as if he had been ready to be choaked, with some thing that did rise in
his throat: sometimes he would be confined to a place where my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were at work, in which place he would lye down with his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a board, stretching forth his arms, and beat himself on the face and
head as hard as he could; and this he would do often in a day, rising
very much like a Changling. Diverse times as we did walk abroad toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47211:5"/>
he would be taken with lameness, his limbs hanging down, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that I was forced to bring him home in mens arms: Sometimes
he must be drawn behind a door in a chair, and there be forced to
sing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One thing more is very observable, that when I did set him to read,
he could not utter the name of God, nor of Christ, but any other words
he would speak very well. Moreover, if any other did take the Bible,
and mention the word God or Christ in his hearing, he would roar and
cry, making a hideous noise.</p>
            <p>In this great extremity, I knew not otherwise what to do, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
my self to Physitians and Astrologers, and such-like men, for help,
but could meet with none from them; at length after I had made use of
them, one <hi>Iohn Hubbard</hi> was commended to me, and he and another
with him came to my house; I asked him, whether he could do my
Child any good? he said, <hi>Yea,</hi> he was not the first that he had medled
with in that condition, for he told me that he was bewitched: I asked
him what I should give him? he said, he must make no bargain, for the
Witch had power over him to come again: yet notwithstanding, he
went on, and used many fopperies and charms, as hanging papers about
his neck, and putting quils under the door, with quick-silver, and such
kind of stuff, which did him no good, and so I told him, he coming often
to my house; then he told me he must use some stronger means, and
that he had learned more experience; thus he kept me in suspence half
a year: after this he would have the Boys hair cut off from his crown in
a round circle, also the nails of his fingers and toes must be pared, then
he must go to an Oaken-tree, and the Boy with him, three or four miles
off, taking some oaken boughs home with him, which boughs he put to the
soals of his feet, and some about his belly, and other places about the
house; the Boy must sleep with them all night, and then take them off
the next morning, then he must go to the tree again, taking with him a
mallet and an augor, and a wooden peg, and a hammer; the augor was
to bore a hole to the heart of the tree, the hair of the boys head, and the
paring of his nails, were to be rapped up in a paper, and rammed into
the hole he had made, and the peg was to keep it in; which did signifie,
as he said, that the Witch would be forced to come every morning and
evening to that tree, and that would weary her, and then she would
come and compound with him: he said moreover, the Witch did come
to him, and askt him, why he did torment her so? But my Child being
never the better, I seeing all was but a cheat, I left him.</p>
            <p>After all this, I used the advice of Doctors, Astrologers, and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
from whom he took Physick; and at last there was something
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47211:5"/>
came up in his throat, which made him vomit, to the sad admiration of
the beholders, which held him about three quarters of an hour, and at
last he gave a groan, and a great deal of water came forth of his mouth,
and nothing else as we could see: at length he came to himself, and
continued well for about three months. The Boy desiring to go forth to
be Apprentice, I accordingly provided him a Master, with whom he was
near half the three months that he was wel: but being at a certain time
in his Masters Garden, his fellow Apprentice being there with him, he
told him, that he knew he should be mad; his fellow Apprentice asked
him why he said so? he told him that a Rat appeared to him often times:
the next day, about the same hour, as near as could be computed, the
Rat entered into him; the news was sent to me, which was very unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
I went the next day and found him in bed, looking and acting like
a Changling, I caused him to rise and put on his clothes, and a very
good dinner was provided, but not a bit could he eat: his Master desired
me to take him home with me, lest he should be starved; which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
I did, and then he did eat. In a short time after I carried him to
his Master again, but nothing he could eat there; his Master then
brought him to me again, and told me, he knew not what to do with
him: his Master was no sooner gone, and left him with me, but the
Boy turned his face to the wall, and whispered, and straightway came to
himself, saying, <hi>How came I hither? I thought I had been at work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I counselled him to be a good boy, and go home to his Master,
and shew himself a wise lad; he then went home to his Master, and fell
to work, but that lasted not long; at length his master was very hasty
with me, still asking me what he should do? but I could not well tell,
neither could he, which caused a difference between us; but at length
his Master told me, that he heard of a man which came from <hi>Ireland,</hi>
that cured all diseases; which I did not believe, because he was a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Catholick; yet nevertheless, he perswaded me to carry the boy to
him (his Master being a traveller, and acquainted with the Catholicks)
which I did, and was no sooner come, but they pulled out their Crosses,
and put them behind the boys head, which the boy not seeing, fell a
roaring; they conceiting it was the Devil that roared at the Cross, as at
a thing he could not endure.</p>
            <p>Forthwith my self, the Boy and his Master must go before the Lord
<hi>Abony,</hi> we coming before his Lordship, one of his servants drew forth a
Cross or Crucifix; at which the Boy roared as abovesaid; I told the
Lord <hi>Abony</hi> I would relate the heads of the Boys trouble, but that I
feared neither my Memory nor his Patience could bear it. He bad me
go on and he would hear me; then I declared to him the whole matter,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47211:6"/>
which after he had heard, he gave me a Ticket to carry to the aforesaid
Gentleman at his lodging; But things falling out contrary to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
he being at that time at St. <hi>Iames's,</hi> we went thither, found
him and presented the Ticket to him, which when he had read, he had
me bring the Lad into the Queens Chappel, there being more than 500
impotent people, as dumb, lame, blind and the like, yet he medled with
none of them, onely read his <hi>Ave-Maries, Creeds</hi> and the like.
Then he called for a Pot of <hi>Holy-Water,</hi> as they call it, and kneeled down
with his Friars, and rising up again, he called for a Ribband, Brimstone
and a Candle, the Ribband he tied in three knots about my Boys neck,
then takes a piece of paper and burneth the Brimstone under his nose,
speaking several words in Latine three times over; The Boy all this
time roaring and stamping at their Altar, being so outragious that three
or four men were fain to hold him, and as much as they could do. There
were several Countesses, Ladies and Gentlewomen (as I supposed them
to be) who beholding the Boy, wept sorely. The place being very full
of People, this thing was soon blazed all about <hi>Westminster;</hi> forthwith
the Boy spake, who had been dumb ten or twelve days before. Then the
Gentleman asked the Boy what he did see? Who replied, <hi>A Rat.</hi> He
asked him which way the Rat went? The Boy said, <hi>Towards the Priest.</hi>
With that the Lord <hi>Abony</hi> presented the Boy to me, and bad me bring
him in at another door, which I did; many Friars flocking about me, bad
me make the Boy a Catholick: <hi>I told them I was not such a Fool as he that
was at their Altar, who promised them that if they cured him of his stutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
speech, he would become a Catholick.</hi> Then they asked me what the
Boys Name was? I told them, <hi>Iames.</hi> They said to the Boy, <hi>Iames, pray
to St. Iames.</hi> I asked them what rule they had in Scripture for that?
<hi>They told me in the time of the Law Angels did worship the Patriarhs.</hi> I
told them those were but Salutations, and desired them to turn to the
<hi>Revelations</hi> and read that passage between <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Angel; when
<hi>Iohn</hi> would have worshiped him, the Angel would not suffer him, but
said, <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant; worship God.</hi> Then they
urged the sayings of their Fathers, as they call them, which is their usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
way, leaving the Scriptures. I told them if they would stick to the
Scriptures, I would confer further with them, but they would not;
so we ceased.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, by that day seven days the Boy was as bad as before;
but in the mean time there was great joy amongst them, they supposing
they had wrought a Miracle. Priests and Jesuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to see
the Boy, bringing their Crosses, Holy-water and Ribbands, which the
Boy mocked at, holding his two fingers across, and laughing at them.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47211:6"/>
One of them endeavoured to put a Ribband about his neck, but the Boy
would not let him; which when he saw, he swore, <hi>Damn him,</hi> and fell
a cursing.</p>
            <p>But afterwards they hearing the boy was as Bad as ever, their joy was
turned into mourning. The Lord <hi>Abony</hi> sent for me, but I denying to
come, he sent for me again by one of his chiefest Gentlemen, to desire the
Boy might come again to the Priest, that he might touch him once more;
at which I gave him a flat denyal, and told him that I had no faith in the
thing when I was at their Altar. The Boyes Master being desirous he
might go again to the Priest, sent for him; I could not deny sending
the Boy to him because he was his Apprentice, but sent him: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
sent me word he would carry the Boy to the Gentleman again, for
said he, <hi>If he do him no good, he can do him no hurt.</hi> I asked counsel of
some friends what I should do in this matter? They said, 'twere good
I should see what became of the Boy, and to let him try what good could
be done him. Whereupon I did go, it being the first day of the week,
a Coach was provided, and we came to the Gentleman; coming into
the room where he was, he looked on the Boy as he used to do, then
opened his Book and read Prayers, calling for a Ribband, Brimstone,
and a Candle as he had done before, with his Holy-water, throwing
much of it at the Glass Window; the Boy all the while roared, making
a hideous noise, stamping with his feet, having a croaking in his throat
contrary to nature; he using his stuffe as aforesaid, the Boy groaned,
and then spake to their great rejoycing. Then the Priest came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the Boy to me, and told me, the Boy was Bewitched, that I had
ill Neighbours, and bade the Boy go to his Master, and not go home to
me, for that would be safest for him. But this charm lasted but twenty
four hours, for then the Boy was as bad as before. I further considering
with my self what I should do in the thing, being tost about by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, besought the Lord to direct me what to do, for I had sinned
in treading these by-paths. At last it came into my mind, that <hi>Fasting</hi> and
<hi>Prayer</hi> was the onely means to be used in this case, that Scripture being
set upon my heart, <hi>This sort, or kind, cometh not out but by fasting.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it might be some evil Spirit, or Spirits, he was possessed with, by
the malice of some Witch, I craved the advice of godly Ministers and
Friends; among the rest one of them told me, it was a difficult thing,
and bad me get four Ministers and four Doctors to consult with; then I
went to two more, and one of them desired me to go to another, that
was a learned Doctor, who heard me repeat the heads of all these things,
with much admiration. I told him that some People said the Boy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled;
but I said, I did perceive it was the craft and malice of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47211:7"/>
Devil. He pausing a while, told me, that it was his thoughts also, and
called for the Boy, and told him, he knew he was a dissemler, the Boy
making faces, mocks, and wry-mouths at him: The Doctor told him, he
could take him up into his Chamber, and shew him the appearances of
Spirits: I desired the Doctor he would do so, and I would stay-below;
but, to put me off, he called for a Latine Bible, and read some words in
latine to him; with that he told me, that thereby he knew he dissemled,
because he did not roar as at other times, when the word God is read in
Latine. I desired him to put the Boy forth, and I would talk further with
him; the Boy was caused to withdraw, then said I, Now Doctor, you
and I are here, I must tell you plainly, the Devil is too cunning for you
and I, for he can hold his tongue when he listeth for his advantage:
Now Doctor, I will tell what I have done, I have both stript and whipt
him till it hath grieved me to the heart, and yet I cold make a Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool
speak as soon as he. The Doctor bid me send him to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> for
I had fed him too high: but I told him, three pence a day would keep
him. I left my Doctor, and came again to him a week after: he asked
me how the Boy did? I told him, as bad as he was before, and that he
was at the door: he asked me, what I would have him to do? I said,
I would desire him to have him up into his Chamber, and try his skil;
he said, he had not time, and called for his cloak, for he must forthwith
be gone. I perceiving it was the Devils work to hinder his dis-possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
left the Doctor and departed.</p>
            <p>Being thus tossed about from one to another, at last, by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Almighty God, I was cast amongst a poor dispised People,
whom the Lord owned as instruments in his hand, to do this great Work;
to his eternal Praise I speak it; for the Lord saw their fastings, and heard
their prayers in the behalf of my poor Child, at a wonderful rate. The
true Relation of which, is that which followeth.</p>
            <p>As was said, It pleased the Lord to bring me among a People, who
were perswaded that the Lord would be found, if sought unto, in behalf
of my Child; judging, according to what is before related, that he
was possessed with some Evil Spirit; and believing that that kind might
be cast out by fasting and prayer, some of them did agree to keep a day
for that purpose; which was performed in the month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1663. by
<hi>Iohn Clayton, Rich. Aylmore, Rich. Webb &amp; Tho. Mildman;</hi> Who being
met together, one of them spake as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My friends,</hi> said he, <hi>We are come about a weighty work, a work too great
for such poor unworthy creatures as we are to perform, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us to go unto God.</hi> No sooner was the word GOD pronounced, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47211:7"/>
the Boy slipped down from the Chair he sate in, crying out with such a
hideous noise, that made him that spake, tremble, though he had no sense
of fear upon him; he going on in his discourse, mentioned the name
<hi>IESUS,</hi> at which the Boy roared again, and in a strange manner,
spread himself on the floar, where he lay with one leg backward and
another forward, with his arms spread out: Also after he had ended his
Exhortation, they went to prayer, and even when the Name of God or
Christ was pronounced, the Boy was tormented, and much enraged; for
he would double his fist, and seem by his looks to threaten him that
prayed, endeavouring to get nearer and nearer to him, till God or Christ
was named, at which words he would start back, as though he was frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
using endeavours to get out of the Chamber, and had, but that two
of them held the door and would not let him; which when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he crept to the farthest corner of the room, crying out, <hi>Legat,
go to the Devil Legat, will not you go to the Devil, Legat, Go to the Devil
Legat, go to the Devil Legat.</hi> It was observed, that though he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
these words, yet his mouth was open, but his lips moved not;
at which time he used many strange and absurd actions: They offered
him a Bible, which he would not look into, but seemed to be much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented:
they then offered him another Book, at which he was not at
all troubled: Thus they continued till about noon, and then he fell
asleep, and slep a pretty while, and when he awoke, he was like a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fool, and could not speak a word, saying, <hi>Legat go to the Devil,</hi> as
aforesaid; from whence it appears, that it was not he that spake, but the
Evil Spirit in him, making Crosses, wetting them with spittle, playing
with, and spitting on the Andirons that stood in the Chimney; and
when they were taken from him; he cryed like a Child: after this they
shewed him a Bible again, at which he was not troubled, but seemed to
rejoyce: In this condition he continued till towards night, and then he
fell into a very strange fit of raging and roaring, calling <hi>Legat</hi> many
times. While this fit was on him, one went down stairs, and staid a
little, and then came up again, against whom the Boy was so enraged,
that he spit at him, and would have struck him, but that he was held by
two others. After this the evening came on, and they commended him
and their work to the Lord, who was able to do more for him than they
were able to ask. The answer of this day was, the restoring of his speech
in such a measure, that one might understand him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1663. was the second day that they set apart
to seek the Lord in behalf of my Child; at which time there were only
three exercised in the duty of Prayer, to wit, <hi>Iohn Clayton, Rich. Webb,</hi>
and <hi>Rich. Aylmore,</hi> except some women (who were spectators) my self
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47211:8"/>
and my wife. When they were met, they applied themselves to the
Lord in prayer, as they did the day before; in which duty they had spent
the greatest part of the day, and the Boy seemed not to be troubled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it grew towards night, and then he fell into a very great Agony,
roaring and crying, <hi>Legat, Legat</hi> many times, and was so outragious,
that he was held by two of them; but a little before night, this fit left
him, and then they committed him, themselves, and their work into
the hands of God, who disposeth all things according to the Counsel
of his own will. The answer of this dayes work was, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cold not hold a Cup in his hand to drink, but took it in his teeth,
before they parted, he took a pot in his hand, and drunk as orderly as. I
or any one could, and the next day he read a Chapter without trouble.</p>
            <p>And so they were led to the third dayes work, being <hi>September</hi> 21.
1663. The persons that met this day, were <hi>Rich. Webb, Tho. Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Rich. Pilgrim, Rich. Aylmore, Iohn Smith, Iohn Borchit, Iohn Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
with some others, both strangers and acquaintance; this day they
endeavoured to be there as soon as they could, but neither my self, nor
my wife, nor Boy, were come to the place appointed; two friends
came to meet us, and found us in the way coming, but had been troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Child, by reason of strong temptations of the Devil, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to cut his throat, or drown himself, or knock out his brains against
a post. His mother asked him, if he would go to Hell? <hi>Yea,</hi> said he,
<hi>with all my heart:</hi> But at the last he came to the place where the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
friends were, and went laughing up the stairs like a fool, and when
he was come in, looked earnestly about him, and seemed to count them
that were there, by pointing at them: Then after some discourse about
the work of the day, as in relation to Christ's Promises, upon our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, we found our selves in an oneness of spirit, believing
the Lords Presence, and then one went to prayer. The first that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
concluded his prayer without any material observation from the Boy,
except some inward fretting, which did appear by his looks, and snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his hand at his face and head.</p>
            <p>The second that prayed with an holy boldness, asked of God a sign
whether the work should be finished that day; the sign was, That if
God would do it that day, That the Spirit should be roused up immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately:
and so it pleased the Lord to answer, that at that very time, the
Spirit did roar in the Boy with an hideous noise, after a manner that we
could not tell what to compare it to, but something like the noise a dog
makes when he howls, and toar open his clothes, throwing his Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
that was about his neck on the floor, treading on it with his feet, and
spitting at him that was at prayer, crying out, <hi>You cannot do the work:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47211:8"/>
Our friend replied, <hi>Satan, thou art a Lyar, for through the strength of the
Lord we are able to do it,</hi> or words to that purpose; further replying, <hi>Thou
damned fiend, thou enemy to mankind, who wert a Lyar from the beginning,
I adjure thee in the Name of Iesus of</hi> Nazereth, <hi>come forth:</hi> at which he
roared, and beat himself, crying out, <hi>What, three dayes! two dayes was
enough;</hi> looking wishly on all as we stood about him, saying, <hi>What, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but pray! what, all pray! all mad! will you kill your selves with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
three dayes is too much in conscience.</hi> Then one said, if three dayes
would not be enough, we would have three and three too: and then he
was very much troubled, and beat himself again, and howled as before.
And then he endeavoured to perswade us, that <hi>there was a dinner below,
we might go down to that, and eat it.</hi> But answer was made, that we had
set our selves to fasting and prayer to plead with God against him, and
would not eat till the Sun went down: and then he would perswade us,
<hi>that it was night and dark, and time to go home.</hi> Answer was made, Thou
art a lyar as from the beginning; for then it was about eleven or
twelve of the clock, Again, he told <hi>there was a bed, we might go to bed:</hi>
And when none of these lies and deceits would do, he began with other
stratagems, and told us <hi>that we had got for every day one, could not we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented?</hi>
Answer was made, that we would not give over while any did
remain. And then he fixed his eyes on the window strangely, and fell
a calling for more help, as though some stood without, and beckned with
his hand to them, and bad them come in; <hi>Why did you go out? come back
again, come back again, they will not hurt you, you need not fear, you may
come if you will; come quickly, what, are you mad to stand there?</hi> and then
would beat himself for anger that they did not come when he called.</p>
            <p>It was observed that two hats hung in the Window, and a friend took
them down, supposing the Boy might heed them, and when they were
down he cryed the more, <hi>Now there is more room, now you may come if you
will; come away, come, come:</hi> and then cryed, <hi>Diabolus, Diabolus,</hi> many
times, saying it many times, <hi>Come, or the work will be done.</hi> And one
taking him by the hand, he cryed, <hi>Let my manus go,</hi> many times. One
asked me whether I had taught him any Latine? I said, <hi>No.</hi> Then the
Boy sweat much, and seemed to be in a great toil or agony: and then
told us, <hi>If we would not give over and depart quickly, the house would fall
and kill us all, you will be all killed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was observed, that at the departure of every Spirit (which
was, as we suppose, five, at distinct times) their departure was with a
kind of strange rising upwards to his throat as if he was ready to be
choaked, bursting forth with a kind of belching, and throwing forth his
hand, saying, <hi>There is one gone;</hi> so in the departure, giving the distinct
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47211:9"/>
number of them as they went forth, crying out when the third was gone,
<hi>There is one for every day,</hi> as aforesaid: And when the fourth went out,
he shaked his hand after him, saying, <hi>Fare thee well, farewel, there is four;
now all is gone, now all is gone.</hi> One said, Thou art a Lyar; for till God
put praise into this Boys mouth, we will not give over: But when he
said, four were gone, it was to be observed, he did butten up his doublet
very carefully and orderly, measuring the breast of it, to see whether
he did it even; after which he fell asleep, and slept, as near as we could
judge, an hour and an half, or thereabouts: in all which time, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
earnest in prayer to God, and at the last he awaked and looked
about him wildly, and in a little time the fifth spirit began to roar and
to be disturbed, as the other before; and then one of us did adjure him
in the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> to come out: Then he said, <hi>If he did, he would go
into another;</hi> upon which he was commanded to come out and go to his
own place. Then we heard him cry, <hi>Legat, come out, come out, come out,
thou must come out, thou must come out,</hi> oft saying it over; and then stopt
his mouth with his hands, and coat, and knees, and arms, as if he were
resolved to stop in the Devil with them; but at the last, to the praise of
our God be it spoken for ever, which worketh wonders, by his own
Power alone brought him out; he brought him out with a sneeze and a
kind of thruttling in his throat, and so the fifth came forth: at which
time the Boy sate very still, with a very sober countenance, lifting up
his hands and eyes, as though he had matter of praise in his mind, for the
space of three hours: and at that time I was desired to speak to him, but
found him dumb, and then he sate down again, and we applied our
selves to the Lord in prayer; and the last that prayed, asked of God a
sign, as in the morning, whether the work was done? and that if it was
done, the Lord should put praises into the Boys mouth; and then the
Boy did lift up his hands and eyes, which we did look upon as an Answer
from the Lord: and so with one accord returned praise to God with all
our hearts: and when we had concluded, we asked the Boy how he did?
but he could not speak: One asked him whether we should pray for
him? but he did not answer. <hi>Iames,</hi> said one, if we shall pray for thee,
give us a sign; then he did lift up his hands and eyes: and then they
went to prayer again that the Lord might loose his tongue, and so they
left him (my self, his mother and two other friends more with him) and
went into the Kitchin. One of the friends that stayed above put his
finger into his mouth, and finding his tongue doubled, laboured to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
it, and groaned in spirit to the Lord; and it pleased the Lord so to
loose his tongue, that he spake, and praised his holy Name, who alone
worketh great Wonders. Then we found that the Lord had answered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47211:9"/>
our prayers, to the great joy of us all; then we sung forth his praise,
and met that day sevennight, and kept it a day of thanksgiving to God,
for that he was pleased to shew us that his hand was not shortned, nor
his ear heavy that it could not hear, but that he is the same to day, and
yesterday, and for ever. <hi>This in the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in
our eyes.</hi>

who was sore afflicted by Witchcraft,
for the space of nine months; with the
several means used, and way in which
she was relieved.</head>

            <p>THis following Relation, is not put forth to reflect upon any sort of
People, nor to seek any popular applause from any; but onely to shew
that the Lord's hand is not shortned that he cannot save, or that
his ear is heavy that he cannot hear; but the Iniquities of the
sons of men in this day have hindred good things from us, as well as it did in
times past; and that the want of Faith in Gods promises, have made us want
those spiritual presences of God by his Spirit; and to manifest that if we seek
him in the way of his Appointments, he will be found of us, as he hath said;
Yea, if we have faith as a grain of mustard seed, great things shall be obtained
by Faith in the Promises he hath made, being the onely means he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
(through Christ) to draw down the Benefits and Priviledges that
belong to his servants by promise. And therefore we having had great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Lords faithfulness in our approaches to the Throne of Grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a time, have taken liberty to declare in his particular Treatise, two special
Appearances of our God in answering our Prayers. The first is that that goeth
before; the second is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47211:10"/>One <hi>Iohn Crump</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> having a Daughter which was very
much afflicted with strange fits, to the amazement of all her Relations,
her grieved Father left no meanes unattempted for the Recovery of his
afflicted Child, as Physick, and what the wisdom of man would afford
him in the place where he lived; but all proved in vain. Then at last
He and one other of his Daughters came up to <hi>London,</hi> and brought up
the afflicted Maid, in order to get Cure; himself being here before, and
having made way to get her into <hi>Thomas</hi> Hospital in <hi>Southwark;</hi> she
being come, the day of her reception was appointed, her Father with
two of her sisters (one living in Town) brought her to the said Hospital:
But so it happened that when the Officers came to receive her, she was
taken with one of her fits in such a manner that they would not; but
said she was fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than to come into an Hospital among sick
People. Thus her Father being filled with care and sorrow, knew not
well what course to take, but was then advised to have her to a man that
lived in <hi>Winchester</hi> Park in <hi>Southwark;</hi> which advice he accepted of,
and went to the said man with his Daughter; and after some time of
discourse and consideration he (professing some skill in <hi>Astrologie</hi>) told
them she was bewitched, and that if he did take her in hand he would
have five pound, ye could not promise perfect cure: <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>if I
cannot be strong enough for the Witch, after I have taken the affliction from
the Maiden I must bear it my self; but if I can be strong enough for the
Witch, she must bear it, till she dispose of it to some other, for none of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
will bear it.</hi> The Father of the Maid having received this Answer,
had no encouragement to make use of him.</p>
            <p>Thus being at last almost without hope of obtaining any help for his
distressed Daughter, whose distracted condition was the cause of much
trouble and sorrow to all her Relations, beholding her (if not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
to bite her own flesh, or doing other violence to her self, or such
as came to hold her; also, that if her own father had at any time
taken a Bible to read, she would have been gone and not heard nor
read her self, but would fall into her raging fits. And now her Father
having used all wayes for help, and could find none, like to the poor
man that waited for the moving of the waters, so had he waited on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means, and at last met with the mercy of the same compassionate
<hi>Iesus</hi> as the poor man did: For in the month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1662. the Lord
drew forth the heart of one of her sisters to desire that we would <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ep
a day in fasting and Prayer in the behalf of her sister, which we were
ready to perform, and appointed a day; at which time appointed we
came to the house where this afflicted Maid was, and there we found her
in a deplorable condition, which put us upon some consideration of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47211:10"/>
work before us, calling to mind the Promises of God for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
knowing and believing that that God that cannot lie, would be
found of them that diligently seek him according, to his Promise, <hi>Mat.
18. 19, 20. Mark.</hi> 11. 24. We having Gods Word to confirm our
Faith, and nothing but his Glory for our end, and the distressed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Maid, being an object of Pity, seeing her bound with the
bonds of Satan, we applied our selves to the Throne of Grace by Prayer:
The Maid being laid on a bed, lay a pretty while undisturbed, but at last
she rose and was in a very great rage, and unlaced her clothes to her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
skin, pulling her headclothes off her head, crying out in a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
manner; in which fit her Father and Sister proved too weak to deal
with her, one of us rising from our knees to help hold her; she finding
her self mastered, said, <hi>If we would let her alone she would sit down and be
quiet:</hi> Then we set her down in a Chair, she was no sooner sat, but she
said to him that held her <hi>she would kick him,</hi> and as she spake, did so:
Soon after she lay down again, and seemed to sleep between whiles, and
after a little time rose again, and as before, pulled open her clothes,
struck her father and sister, took up fire from the hearth, clapped it to her
sisters arm, burnt it the breadth of a shilling that the skin shriveled off
presently; and thus she remained by fitts most part of the day, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
endeavouring to pull down all the Hangings about the Bed and
Chimney, breaking the Windows; at other times making excuses to go
down from us, and did so far prevail with her sister, that she was let go
down, but was not willing to come up again; but that she had left a
Tobacco-pipe above, which they refused to bring her down, and rather
than she would be without it, she came up for it, and so was kept in by
shutting of the door: The reason why she set so much by her pipe, was,
because she took very much Tobacco. About mid-day as she lay on the
bed, being pretty quiet, one asked her how she came into this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
she answered, <hi>That one time she was sick, and there came a woman to
her and brought her an Apple, which she did eat, and</hi> (saith she) <hi>it
lieth here still</hi> (pointing to her throat.) We perceiving by this that
she might be bewitched, therefore in our petitions to the Lord made
mention of the Witch, and desired he would be pleased to rebuke her
power, if any such thing were: but at such times as we spake those
words she would taunt at us, and say in an extream rage, <hi>What have
you to do-with the Witch, cannot you let her alone? she doth not trouble you,</hi>
and would labour to disturb us all the wayes she could, so that at the last
she was fain to be held down on the Bed by her sisters; but while they
held her down she struck one of us on the face violently, while he was
at Prayer by her, insomuch that she made her own arm swell: After
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47211:11"/>
this one of us being at Prayer at the beds feet, and she perceiving she
could not reach him, spat at him, so that it hung on his hair and breast,
very loathsom to behold; but he continued in Prayer, was not any way
moved at it; and soon after the evening came on, we left her very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
on the bed, as one that was willing to rest her self after a weary
dayes work: And truly the Lord was so pleased to give in an answer
after such a maner, that after this day she would take a Bible &amp; read an
hour or two together; and in a small time God clothed our friend <hi>Iohn
Crump</hi> and his daughter <hi>Hannah</hi> with garments of joy for sorrow, and
filled all the hearts of their Relations with praise; and so she continues
in good health unto this day, free from that affliction, which began upon
her on the first of <hi>November</hi> 1661, and continued till the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned:
for which Mercy we may say with the Prophet, <hi>O bless the
Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let all the people of <hi>England</hi> know to whom this may come, that
not by our own power, but by the Power of God, in the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
were these two made perfectly whole. We whose names are here under
written were eye-witnesses of this great Work of God.</p>
