            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ate proceeds againſt him after an implicit manner, by paſsing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by putting him to death upon the Church triall and inditement only; or elſe arraignes him the ſecond time for the ſelfe ſame offence, (a double injurie and injuſtice) which, beſides, being ſpiritual, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate has no cognizance, is no competent Judge thereof, nor can take upon himſelfe any ſuch authority without confounding the Eccleſiaſticall Judicature with the Civil.</p>
            <p>But I muſt trouble your patience a little longer with an other touch upon this ſtring, this whipcord which you graunt the Magiſtrate to ſcourge your Brethren withal, in confidence your ſelves for this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence ſhall ſcape ſcotfree, and paſſe for white boyes, whatever offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you commit; this no doubt wil expiate them all, and make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them though they be never ſo many:</p>
            <p>You ſay the Civil Magiſtrate may compel [men of different opinions] to ſubſcribe or to be gon; nay, you ſay the Civil Magiſtrate may command and compel a corrupted Church and negligent Church Officers into a Reformation; and that even when they are Reformed, hee may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and compel them by his Civil power, to give ſatiſfaction, and reverſe ſuch Eccleſiaſticall cenſures and judgements, as the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhall apprehend to bee oppreſsing unto any man, or contrary to the Civil lawes: Tell me, is this power which you preſent the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate withall in ſpirituall matters, a leſſer, leſſe ſpiritual or efficacious power, than what you reſerve as peculiar to the Church? If it bee leſſe, the Civil Magiſtrate ſurely is much beholding to you that you are ſo bountifull to him of ſuch ſcrapps; that you will ſet him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

work (as the Egyptian Task-maſter did the Iſraelites Exo. 5. 18.) with ſuch leavings and ſhredds of diſcipline, and yet expect hee ſhould doe that for you, which all your broad ſides and batteries of Decrees, Ordnance, and Canons of Excommunication &amp;c. could not effect; And why I pray may not the Church her ſelfe make uſe of ſmall ſhot as well as greater? But if you meane really <hi>ſide publica,</hi> and this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which you attribute to the Civil Magiſtrate concerning Spiritual Offenders and offences, be greater, more Spiritual and efficacious to win and gain men unto true piety and Godlineſſe by fining, baniſhing, impriſonment or death; Can you not give him in the vantage? Can you not let him have the leſſer of Excommunication and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious (in compariſon of Civil Coercive) Cenſures?</p>
            <p>Briefly then; if this power which you give the Civil Magiſtrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, bee a toy or trifle, bate it him, and let not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Ind<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But perhaps you'l ſay there is an Act of Parliament, a Civil law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring hereſie, or any different, from the State opinions, ſuch as for the preſent are in faſhion to be cenſurable by the Civil power: I anſwer not without all due reſpect unto the lawes and ſuch as made them, that if there be any diſtinction betwixt a Church State and a Civil State, which all Chriſtians <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps you will ſay though they live <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> they may die Converts, or well-willers to the Presbyterian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin and Doctrin: I anſwer, that this is ſuch a May-bee, that if it come not whilſt they live, I'le paſſe my word 'twill never happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: You may as well ſay or think they may die <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> were you not apt to flatter your ſelfe, or glad to ſay any thing, rather than by plaine argument be made appeare as if you thought, God had firſt made the joyes of Heaven, and in the fulneſſe of time ſent his Son to repurchaſe them, for your fond opinions onely to vapour in; But in caſe you doe not thus reprobate all <hi>Lutherans, Independents</hi> and ſuch as differ from you in opinion, allowing them a poſsibilitie, even whilſt they live and die <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Independents,</hi> to find the way to Heaven; why will you then not let them goe their own way? What if it ſhould ſeeme to you the fartheſt way about? May it not prove the neereſt home, according to the proverb?

            <p>There are two great controverſies which have ſet both State and Church on fire, about which ſo many Pamphlets have beene ſcribled, and not a few continued muſing untill their heads grew addle, which yet, in my ſlender judgement, may be fully Stated in a verie few lines only: That in the Civil State, is betwixt Magiſtrate and Subject; On the one ſide it is alledged, that if everie ſoule, the whole bodie of a people or Nation muſt be ſubject unto the Higher Powers in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whether they govern juſtly or tyrannically, then would it reſt in the Magiſtrates breaſt and power to ruin and deſtroy the whole Nation at his pleaſure: On the otherſide, if the people may in ſome caſe deny ſubjection, it muſt bee in ſuch as they apprehend themſelves in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of deſtruction; and then it will follow, that ſo often as they apprehend this imminent deſtruction, this neceſſitie; ſoe often they may deny ſubjection, which would render the Higher Powers obnoxious unto the bare pretentions of the people, if they did but withall alledge their feares were reall:</p>
            <p>Both theſe I confeſſe are great ſtumbling blocks, yet the latter, as I conceive, is to be adhered unto; becauſe it is a greater evil, to expoſe a whole Nation to deſtruction, than a Magiſtrate only: And leſt it ſhould be thought this tenet does expoſe the Magiſtrate unto the inconſtancie and violence of the People; Let ſuch remember that Magiſtrates are Gods Vice-gerents and as many times it happens that ſome ſcape bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the preſent, For offending God than man but pay for it with a witnes afterwards; ſoe if a People ſhall injuriouſly imploy that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power and might, which God has given them only for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, againſt the Magiſtrates juſt commands and priviledges; God becomes ſo much more engag'd to vindicate them, by how much being few in nomber, in compariſon of the People, they want an arme of fleſh to helpe themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for the Church controveſie, it may bee ſaid in behalfe of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, that unleſſe differing and erroneous opinions bee tolerated; the moſt orthodox and rectified are equally Subject to bee perſecuted: On the other ſide, Presbyterians ſay, that the permitting differing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in a State, is to open a flood-gate to all manner of Hereſies and

Schyſmes: What if wee did ſuppoſe theſe to bee the two Great Rocks of offence, which in ſome ſenſe were no otherwiſe than <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis;</hi> one of which you could not avoide without adhering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other? Does it not remaine then, that wee ſhould conſider which of them is accompained with the greateſt inconveniences? The latter preſuppoſes a poſſibilitie of entrance unto all Hereſies; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer concludes a certainty of with-holding a great meaſure of Truth, and even a poſsibility of keeping out the whole Truth: Now, this truth is like God himſelf; even verie God himſelfe, invallewable; we may not hazard the leaſt attom, the ſmaleſt proportion thereof, for al other poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities or impoſſibilities whatſoever: What? Shall we put our ſelves into ſuch a condition, that if we be in an errour it ſhall be impoſſible for us to get out of it againe, unleſſe the whole Civil State, the men of war, the world doe ſee it as clearely as our ſelves? That if as yet wee have but ſome degrees of truth and knowledge, it ſhall be impoſsible for us to attain to greater? That though we were in poſſeſsion of the true Religion, wee ſhould bee liable to have it taken from us by everie ſharper Civil ſword than our owne?

            <p>But to be briefe, as the Title promiſed for me; Our Saviour bids us do as we would be done to; that is, Love our Neighbours as our ſelves, on which commandment hangs the Law and Prophets, Math. 7. 12. and 22. 39. 40. and Paul tels us that Love is the fulfilling of the whole Law; Rom. 13 10. Nay our Saviour would not have us dare to aske forgiveneſſe of our heavenly Father, otherwiſe, than as we forgive our Brethren. Math. 6. 12. 14. 15. Now, amongſt all ſorts of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, there is no one offendeth ſo highly, ſo undoubtedly againſt this law of loving his neighbour as himſelfe; or doing as hee would bee done to; as he that perſecutes, that but diſturbs his Neighbours wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, becauſe he differs from him in opinion, for cauſe of conſcience though erroneous; which I prove thus:</p>
            <p>Every man hath ſo much of an Athiſt in him, by how much he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes not the enjoyment of his conſcience, above all enjoyments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; And though we have known many turne, ſome with more facility, others perhaps not without ſome difficulty, from <hi>Popiſh</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions unto <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and then from <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> to <hi>Presbyterial,</hi> according as either of them became more commodious, gainſome or faſhionable;

yet, if Athiſme not having totally taken poſſeſſion of their hearts, they began at any time to demur or ſcruple, according to the remnant of conſcience which might be remaining in them; it was never knowne that ſuch were contented to have even theſe reliques of conſcience perſecuted or diſquieted, howſoever abſurd and Heretical they might ſeeme to other men; and therefore ſuch as raiſe any manner of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt their Brethren for conſcience ſake, which they could not be contented to have done unto themſelves, unleſſe they were very Athiſts, muſt neceſſarily be the greateſt offenders againſt this Law of loving our Neighbours as our ſelves, of any in the world: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am enforced at preſent to apprehend you in this gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet my prayers and hopes ſhall be, that with the Apoſtle 1 Cor. 6. 10. 11. it may be only ſaid hereafter, that <hi>ſuch were you once; but you are now enlightned; you are waſhed; you are ſanctify'de;</hi> which God graunt in his good time and pleaſure.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> No: but rather the contrary; for if you marke it well, you may ſee they are ſtill the Presbyterians who generally begin firſt to find fault, and pick quarrells with the Independents opinions, not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents with the Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>Q. 16. May not the permitting men to teach and imbrace new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions be occaſion that we quite <hi>looſe old truthes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> No: for if all opinions be permitted, the true ones muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be included.</p>
            <p>Q. 17. But is it fitting then for everie man to be of what religion he will?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:125743:20"/>
               <hi>An.</hi> Yes ſurely; and far better ſo, than to bee of whatſoever reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion an other will have him to be of, ſince one of them muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall out.</p>
            <p>Q. 18. Muſt we then ſuffer men to run headlong in the way to Hell, if they have neither will nor underſtanding to prevent it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Surely yes: wee muſt ſuffer what we cannot hinder.</p>
            <p>Q 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But may it not be hindered by hindering ſo many erroneous doctrins to be publiſhed, which <hi>if they never heare of they cannot long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor beleeve in to damn themſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> N: becauſe a mans own phanſie, Imagination and Diſcourcive facul<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of themſelves ſuggeſt and preſent unto his Memory variety of Opinions, though not ſo clearly perhaps at firſt; which if it bee not graunted him freely to debate, aske counſel, judge and make choice of, his condition were worſe than beaſts, incapable of doing either good o evil; and ſuch as are carried away with every wind of novelty and falſe doctrin, were never ſound in the true doctrin, though they might ſeeme ſo before, for want of oppertunity to ſhow the contrary.</p>
            <p>Qu. 20. If there be <hi>but one true religion,</hi> why ſhould we ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one religion in a Country?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If there be but one true Religion we ought to be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full how to get and keep it in the Country; not baniſhing any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which in opinion of different Judges may <hi>poſſibly</hi> be the true one, and by ſuch as make profeſsion of it, (both, as wiſe learned and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as our ſelves) is proemptorily affirmed to be the <hi>only</hi> true one.</p>
            <p>Q. 21. Is it not a pious act to <hi>compel</hi> a companie of careleſſe idle <hi>people to hear a good ſermon,</hi> to do a good work whether they will or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> No more pious an act, then for Papiſts to uſe the like compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Jewes and Proteſtants in forcing them to heare their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, maſſe, or Veſpers.</p>
            <p>Q. 22. Yea: but though they bee thus compelled to heare good ſermons at fi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt againſt their wills, the power and efficacy of truth is ſuch, as that in likelihood it will win upon their affections, and work in them afterwards a deſire to heare and practiſe them of their owne accord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> This is not likely; becauſe we do not find in all the Goſpel,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:125743:21"/>
that ſuch unwarrantable means were ever ſanctifide to produce ſo good effect.</p>
            <p>Q. 23. But have we not ſeen it by experience, that whilſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in England were made go to Church, many of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and dyed Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> The converſion of ſuch Papiſts was rather to be ſuſpected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit to ſave their purſe; and if it had been real at any time, we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to ſome private illumination, or other handy-work of God, and not to ſuch means as are ſo contrary, both to the doctrin and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of our Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Q. 24. May not the Civil Goverment interpoſe to puniſh ſuch Church-members with whom the ſpiritual, by reaſon of their refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines cannot prevaile?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Nothing leſſe; ſince the Civil State or Government has no more power nor virtue to make a Papiſt turn proteſtant in England, than it can prevaile to make a Proteſtant become a Papiſt in Spaine.</p>
            <p>Q. 25. Becauſe Papiſts do ill in compelling Proteſtants to heare an Idolatrons Maſſe; may not Proteſtants do well to <hi>force Papiſts to heare Godly ſermons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> A Proteſtant ſermon is as Idolatrous to a Papiſt, as a Popiſh Maſſe is to a Proteſtant; and neither of them can more judge with the underſtanding, than ſee with the eyes of the other, beſides that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards only ſuch as ſerve him willingly.</p>
            <p>Q. 26. But can there be any hurt in forcing refractory people to be <hi>preſent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Yes: 1. Becauſe there can come no good thereof through want of willingnes, which God only regards, in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
