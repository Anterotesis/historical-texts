            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME REASONS Humbly offered for the EXPORTATION of <hi>COPPER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ABout 150 Years ſince, it was thought neceſſary to prohibite the Exportation of it, by reaſon of the ſcarcity at that time; ſince which, the great plenty abroad, and the increaſe of our Forreign Trade, has for theſe many years ſupplied us with quantities ſufficient for our own Conſumption, and to ſpare, and therefore neceſſary to have liberty to Export the Overplus.</p>
            <p>But Copper being now become a Manufacture of this Kingdom; and greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities being made here than can be Vented, (there being now above 50 Tunns lying unſold, for want of Buyers,) a Licenſe for Exportation is become yet more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>The want of Exportation will wholly diſcourage the making of Copper here; which will be a loſs to their Majeſties in their Cuſtoms, a great damage to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Copper-works and Mines, prevent farther Diſcoveries and Improvements of this kind, take from many Thouſand poor People their lively-hood, make the late Act about Royal Mines in a great meaſure uſeleſs to the Subject, and deprive the Nation of the benefit of what is like to be one of its beſt Manufactures.</p>
            <p>So long as the liberty of Importation is allowed, 'tis moſt reaſonable the Nation ſhould Export the Surplus of its own Product; for what we buy is gain to other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but what we ſell is all profit to our own, and if Forreign Copper may be brought to our Markets 'twill be a great diſcouragement and loſs to us, not to be permitted to ſend ours to Forreign Markets.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, That for many Years before the preſent Copper-works were ſet up, there was no want of Copper in <hi>England;</hi> and why then ſhould any oppoſe the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what is here made, unleſs it be that they may have it at ſuch price as none in <hi>England</hi> can afford to make it, and little more than half what any can import it for; which is prefering a private Intereſt before a publick Good.</p>
            <p>The Pewterers and Plummers, may as well complain at the Exportation of Tin and Lead, as the Braziers and Founders at Exporting Copper.</p>
            <p>There is however no reaſon to fear that any will be Exported, whilſt it can be ſold here at home, fince the price of Copper abroad is in no place greater, but in many leſs than 'tis here. Beſide the duties of Exportation and other incident Charges, will be at leaſt 16 <hi>per Ct.</hi> added to the price here, which makes it very improbable that 'twill beſent abroad until it happens (as it ſhortly will, if the Act for Exportation of it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) that much greater quantities be made here than will ſupply our own neceſſities, and the owners of the Copper-Works here, offer to ſupply the Complainants at all times with English Copper, at cheaper rates than they can buy that which is Imported from Torreign Parts.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note, That for theſe two years laſt paſt, there has been in all but <hi>97</hi> Tons of Copper Imported into the Port of</hi> London, <hi>as appears by the Cuſtome-houſe books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And above</hi> 100 <hi>Tons have been made here in</hi> England <hi>out of</hi> Engliſh <hi> Oares, within theſe eight Months last past.</hi>
