            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A Dislike of Contention hath long restrained my engaging in this Work, tho oft sollicited thereto by several worthy Ministers. Peace is the Blessing which I chearfully pursue; and is, with the Truth, what I propose in this very Endeavour. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, after frequent Prayers, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thoughts, That the Revival of these Errours, must not only exclude that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry as Legal, which is most apt in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by Christ's Ordination, to Convert Souls, and secure the Practical Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but also renders Unity among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians a thing impossible. Every Sermon will be Matter of Debate, and mutual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the severest kind, are unavoidable; while one side justly press the Terms of the Gospel, under its Promises and Threats, for which they are accused as Enemies to Christ and Grace; and the other side ignorantly set up the Name of Christ, and Free Grace, against the Government of Christ, and the
<pb facs="tcp:41167:3"/>
Rule of Judgment. I believe, many Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of these Mistakes, are honestly zealous for the honour of Free Grace, but have not Light sufficient to see how God hath provided for this, in his rectoral Distribution of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by a Gospel-Rule. By this Pretence, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianism</hi> so corrupted <hi>Germany;</hi> it bid fair to overthrow Church and State in <hi>New-England;</hi> and by its stroke at the Vitals of Religion, it allarm'd most of the Pulpits in <hi>England.</hi> Many of our ablest Pens were engaged against these Errours; as Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr.<hi>Rutherford, Anthony Burgess,</hi> the <hi>Provincial Synod</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> with very many others, whose Labours God was pleased to bless to the stopping of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> (by Name opposed by the foresaid Divines) <hi>Saltmarsh, Denne, Eaton, Hobson,</hi> &amp;c. To the grief of such as perceive the tendency of these Principles, we are engaged in a new Opposition, or must betray the Truth as it is in Jesus. I believe many Abettors of these Notions, have Grace to preserve their Minds and Practices from their Influence: But they ought to consider, that the generality of Mankind have no such Antidote; and themselves need not fortifie their own Temptations, nor lose the Defence which the Wisdom of God hath provided against remissness in Duty, and sinful Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings. Who can wonder at the Security
<pb facs="tcp:41167:3"/>
of Sinners, the mistaking the Motion of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Passions for Conversion, and the general abatement of exact and humble walking, when so many affirm, Sins are not to be feared, as doing any hurt, even when the most flagitious are committed? Graces and Holiness cannot do us the least good; God hath no more to lay to the Charge of the wickedest Man, if he be elected, than he hath to lay to the Charge of a Saint in Glory. The Elect are not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Fear or Hope; for the Laws of Christ have no Promises nor Threats to rule them by; nor are they under the Impressions of Rewards or Punishments, as Motives to Duty, or Preservatives against Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this present Testimony to the Truth of the Gospel, I have studied Plainness; and to that end oft repeated the same things in my Concessions, to prevent the Mistakes of the less Intelligent, though I could not think it fit to insist a new upon all. To the best of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I have in nothing mis-represented. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Opinion, nor mistaken his sence: For most of them he oft studiously pleadeth: Of each I could multiply Proofs, and all of them, be necessary from his Scheme, though not consistent with all his other occasional Expressions. His Scheme is this; That by God's mere Electing Decree, all Saving Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are by Divine Obligation made ours, and nothing more is needful to our Title to these
<pb facs="tcp:41167:4"/>
Blessings. That on the Cross, all the Sins of the Elect were transferred to Christ, and ceased ever after to be theirs. That at the first moment of Conception, a Title to all those decreed Blessings is personally applied to the Elect, and they invested actually therein. Hence the Elect have nothing to do, in order to an Interest in any of these Blessings; nor ought they to intend the least good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in what they do: Sin can do them no harm, because it is none of theirs; nor can God afflict them for any Sin. And all the rest of his Opinions follow in a Chain, to the dethroning of Christ, enervating his Laws and Pleadings, obstructing the great Designs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, opposing the very Scope of the Gospel, and the Ministry of Christ, and his Prophets and Apostles. The Doctor had not entertained these Opinions, if he had considered, that God's Electing Decree is no Legal Grant, nor a Formal Promise to us: The Decree includes the Means and the End, willing the first, in order to the last; and as it puts nothing in present being; so it barrs not God, as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to fix a Connexion between Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Duties by his revealed Will: So if the Doctor had animadverted, That Christ's Sufferings were the Foundation of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but not Formally our Pardon; For them our Sins are forgiven, when-ever they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; without them Sin cannot be forgiven,
<pb facs="tcp:41167:4"/>
and they were endured, that the Sins of all the Elect, when Believers, should be forgiven. But yet they are not forgiven immediately upon, nor merely by his enduring those Sufferings; but there were, by Divine Appointment to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, a Gospel-Promise of Pardon; the Work of the Spirit, for a conformity to the Rule of the Promise in the Person to be pardoned, and a judicial Act of Pardon by that Promise on the Person thus conformed to the Rule thereof.</p>
            <p>To clear this Point, Consider, <hi>1.</hi> The Law is sometimes taken for the Preceptive part of God's Will, with the Sanction of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. In this Covenant, Life was promised to sinless Obedience; and Death was threatned against every Sin, without admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Repentance to Forgiveness. Upon the Fall, Life is impossible by the Law with this Sanction: And hence, to preach it to Sinners as a way of Blessedness, is sinful and vain, and no Saving Benefit is dispenced to any of us by this Rule. <hi>2.</hi> The Gospel includes the Moral Preceptive part of the first Law, with some additional Precepts, which suppose our Apostate state; as Faith in an atoneing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and Repentance for Sin: These could not be enjoyned as Duties on innocent Man, by a Rule of Happiness and Misery; nor could they be necessary to his Right to Life, because they would suppose him a Sinner. The Gospel is taken in a large sence, when I say it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb facs="tcp:41167:5"/>
all the Moral Precepts; but yet the Gospel doth so, and they are the Commands of Christ, as Redeemer, (to whom all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is committed,) as well as the Law of the Creator. <hi>3.</hi> The Gospel hath another Sanction to the Preceptive part of the Law, than the Covenant of Works had. Though nothing be abated in the Rule of Sin and Duty, yet Blessings are promised to lower degrees of Duty; and a continuance in a state of Deuth, with a barr to the Blessing, are not threatned against every degree of Sin, as the Covenant of Works did. Can any doubt this to be the Grace of the Gospel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise? Doth it promise Life to all Men, however vile and impenitent they be? Or doth it threaten Damnation, or a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, on any true, penitent, believing, godly Man, because he is imperfect? This Change of the Sanction supposeth the Death of Christ, and his honouring the Law by his perfect Obedience; wherein God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his own Glory, while he promiseth Life, by Forgiveness, to imperfect Man; and yet he insists on some degree of Obedience, to which of his mere Grace he enableth us. This the Covenant of Redemption secures to the Elect, tho' the Grant therein is pleadable only by Christ, as the stipulating Party for us; and our personal Claim depends on the Gospel-Covenant, whereof Christ is Mediator.
<pb facs="tcp:41167:5"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> This Gospel-Sanction determines as certain a Rule of Happiness and Misery, as the Law of Works did, though it be not the same: For while it promiseth Pardon to all believing, repenting Sinners, and declares a barr to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the impenitent Rejecters of Christ, and Gospel-Grace; it fixeth true Repentance, and Faith unfeigned, to be the Terms of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: So when it promiseth Heaven to the sincerely holy, persevering Believer; it fixeth sincere Holiness, and perseverance in Faith, as the Terms of possessing Heaven. Hence the Use of Faith, Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to these Benefits, is not from their Conformity to the Precept, but their Conformity to the Rule of the Promise: Our applying Christ's Righteousness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on it, would no more Justifie us, than our sincere Holiness would Save us, were it not for this Gospel-Promise, That God will Justifie, for Christ's sake, all such as believe. <hi>5.</hi> Hence, by Gospel-Grace, there is a great difference between perfect Faith, and utter Unbelief; between sincere Holiness, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Profaneness, or Wickedness: True Love to God, and prevailing Enmity; imperfect spiritual Duties, and rebellious Neglects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the Law of Works, nothing was Holiness, but what was perfectly so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But read the Bible, if thou doubtest whether there is not a true Faith, Holiness, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which be short of Perfection. <hi>6.</hi> God, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
<pb facs="tcp:41167:6"/>
of Gospel-promised Blessings, doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially determine a Conformity to this Rule of the Promise: When he forgives, he judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially declareth a Man hath true Faith; when he admits into Heaven, he judicially declares a Man sincerely Holy and Persevering. As upon a view of his Guests, he cast out him that had not on the Wedding-Garment, <hi>viz.</hi> True-uniting Faith; so he judicially determined, That they who were not cast out, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to share in the Marriage Feast, <hi>viz.</hi> made Partakers of Union with Christ, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof, had True Faith, and not a mere Profession. As by keeping out the foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, for not having Oyl in their Lamps, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Grace, and persevering Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: so by admitting the wise Virgins, he judicially declared they had a Spirit of Grace, and persevering Holiness. Can any think, that Forgiving, Adopting, Glorifying, or the conveyance of every other promised Benefit given on God's Terms, are not judicial Acts of God, as Rector? If so, doth he dispence these blindly and promiseuously, without any regard to our being Believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or no? Or whether our Faith be true or no? Any one would blush to affirm it. With respect to what's above declared, the Gospel is called a Law of Faith, a Law of Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it especially insists on that sincerity of Grace and Holiness which the Rule of the Promise makes
<pb facs="tcp:41167:6"/>
necessary in its Description of the Person whom it makes Partaker of its included Benefit. And the main of our Ministry consisteth in pressing Men to answer the Rule of the Gospel-Promises; and disswading Men from those things which the Gospel threatens shall hinder their Interest in all, or any of its Benefits; with an Aggravation of their Misery, if they be final Rejecters of its Grace. We call Men to be reconeiled to God, upon which we know God will be at peace with them: These things will help thy Conceptions, still remembring, that the Merits of Christ are the cause of this Gospel-Ordination: His Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, is the cause for which we are justified and saved, when we do answer the Gospel-Rule. And I exclude not this Righteousness, when I affirm, That the Righteousness of God, <hi>Phil. 3. 9.</hi> principally intends the Gospel-Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Person justified by Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; both which, by Faith in Christ, all his Members shall be perfect in. The Grace of God is hereby stated as free as is consistent with his Government, and Judicial Rectoral Distribution of Rewards and Punishments; and none need the Riches of Grace more than I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Note, That in this Book I still speak of the Adult, and not Infants. When I say, <hi>The Difference is not;</hi> I state my own Concessions, and mean not that the Doctor is in all these of my mind. Thou must expect
<pb facs="tcp:41167:7"/>
to take up my full sence, by a view of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters, and not only one; because sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Chapters referr to the same Points, more or less: And forget not, That though the Doctor oft in his Book speaks to Men, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; yet every thing is true of the Elect, viz. <hi>They have as much a Title to all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Blessings, only they do not know it.</hi> This was his Judgment. I have carefully avoided any Reflexion on Reverend Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> whom I believe a holy Man, and abstained exposing many things according to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage offered, if by any means this Book may become useful to such as most need it. That the Father of Lights would lead us into all Truth and Love, is the Prayer of thy Servant in the Gospel,</p>

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> IT is certain from God's Decree of Election that the Elect shall in time be justified, adopted, and saved in the way God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and the whole meritorious Cause and Price of Justification, Adoption and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, were perfect, when Christ finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Work of Satisfaction. Nevertheless, the Elect remain Children of Wrath, and subject to Condemnation, till they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called by the Operation of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Errour.</hi> The Elect are at no time of their Lives under the VVrath of God, nor are they subject to Condemnation, if they should die before they believe; yea, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Dominion of Sin, and in the Practice of the grossest Villainies, they are as much the Sons of God, and Justified, as the very Saints in Glory.</p>

                     <hi>Proved that this is Dr.</hi> Crisp<hi>'s Opinion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The Doctor tells us, Pag. 363. 364. <hi>It is thought by some, that in case such a Person should happen to die before God call him to Grace, and give to him to believe, that Person had been damned; and that Elect Persons are in a damnable Estate in the time they walk in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Riot, before they are called. Let me speak freely to you, and tell you; that the Lord hath no more to lay to the Charge of an elect Person, yet in the height of Iniquity, and in the excess of Riot, and committing all the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can be committed; I say even then, when an elect Person runs such a Course, the Lord hath no more to lay to that Person's Charge, than God hath to lay to the Charge of a Believer: Nay, God hath no more to lay to the Charge of such a Person, than he hath to lay to the Charge of a Saint triumphant in Glory.</hi> Pag. 368. <hi>The Elect of God, they are the Heirs of God, and as they are Heirs, so the first Being of them puts them into the Right of Inheritance, and there is no time but such a Person is a Child of God.</hi> And this is a Principle he oft asserts, and labours to prove, P. 354, 355, 365, 577, 578, 579.</p>
                  <p>But the Readers will object, Sure he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more, than that the Elect are sure to be justified and adopted, and that Christ hath fully merited it for them; but not that they are actually justified and adopted before they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41167:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are called. <hi>Answer:</hi> The Doctor frequently endeavours to prove, that we are actually justified before we are born, before we are baptized, before we believe, before we are converted, and reduceth the Sum of his Thoughts, P. 374. in these VVords, <hi>But when did the Lord do this?</hi> Viz. <hi>Justifie us.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>He did it from Eternity, in respect of Obligation; but in respect of Execution, he did it when Christ was on the Cross; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Application, he doth it while Children are in the Womb.</hi> And then shews, that they do mistake, who judge that God applies the Pardon of Sin at the time of Conversion. In other Places, he saith, <hi>We are actually justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Wherein the Difference is not.</head>
                  <p>The Difference is not, 1. Whether God hath eternally decreed, That certain Persons freely elected by him, shall certainly be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and adopted. 2. Nor whether these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Persons are the Objects of God's Love of Good-will, even while they are Sinners. 3. Nor whether God continues his gracious Purpose of doing them good in his appointed, ways: notwithstanding their Provocations. 4. Nor whether Christ hath made full A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for Sin, and merited eternal Life for the Elect, which shall be in God's time and way applied; and that he left nothing to be done by us in a way of Atonement and Merit. 5. Nor whether there be not a great Difference between an elect Sinner and others, as to what they shall be in time. All these I affirm.</p>

                  <head>Wherein the real Difference. is.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. VVhether the Elect, while uncalled, are actually pardon'd and adopted to Life. This the Doctor affirmeth, and I deny. 2. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect, while dead in Sin and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, are Children of VVrath, condemned by the Law, and not justi ed by the Promise. This I affirm, and the Doctor denies.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Truth confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures expresly declare the Elect, before they be effectually called, to be <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 2, 3. <hi>Enemies.</hi> Col. 1. 21. <hi>Which were not my People, and not Beloved.</hi> Rom. 9. 25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Gospel bars all Unbelievers and dead Sinners from Pardon and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and denounceth the Continuance of Condemnation against them, limiting its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to such as believe. Joh. 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned.</hi> Ver. 36. <hi>The Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22. <hi>And if any Man love not the Lord Jesus, let him be Anathema.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Such were some of you, but you are justified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it were not so, neither the Spirit nor the VVord of God have any Influence in the saving of Sinners, which so oft they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to have. This is plain; for these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our Persons in time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suppose us in no State of Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. See <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>He saved us by the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Joh. 5. 34. <hi>These things, I say, that you may be saved.</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 10. <hi>They receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Love of the Truth, that they might be</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41167:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>saved.</hi> Jam. 1. 21. <hi>Receive the Word which is able to save.</hi> But the want of the Gospel would be no Damage, if we be Heirs in the VVomb; we should be freed from VVrath if we never heard it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Gospel Benefits imply that there is a time, when we are actually guilty and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: There could be no <hi>Forgivenss,</hi> if <gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> were not guilty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 7. They were at Enmity, of whom the Apostle saith, <hi>Now hath he reconciled.</hi> Col. 2. 12. If Men were always Sons, they could not be said in time to be <hi>adopted,</hi> nor to <hi>pass from Death to Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Doctor may as well infer, VVe are sanctified, and possessed of Heaven in the VVomb, for God hath elected us to these, as well as to Pardon, and Christ merited these also.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Dost thou not find God justifies none but whom he calleth? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. Would there be such Joy in Heaven at the Conversion of a Sinner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 7, 10. if they be pardoned and safe before? How much is our Ministry or Concern for Souls debased, if all that we can prevail with are actually pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Who can reconcile to this Notion the Pleadings of God with Sinners? He speaks to them as wounded, undone, and miserable. <hi>Look to me and be saved, why will you die? Turn to me and live, Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Least they should be converted, and I should heal them,</hi> and the like. These sound strange, if Matters are so perfected before they be born.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor, p. 312. tells us, <hi>It's Iniquity it self that the Lord laid upon Christ; not only our Punishment, but our very Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Transaction of our Sins to Christ, is a real Act; our Sins so became Christ's, that he stood the Sinner in our stead, and we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.

                  <p>The Difference is not, 1. Whether Christ bare the Punishment of our Sins. 2. Nor Whether Christ bare the Guilt of our Sins; which is that Respect of Sin to the Threatning of the Law, whereby there is an Obligation to bear the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. 3. Nor whether Christ was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by Men a Transgressor and arraigned as such. 4. Nor whether, what Christ suffered, was not as effectual to put

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The real Difference.</head>
                  <p>The real Difference lies in these things, 1. Whether Sin it self, as to its Filth and Fault, was transacted on Christ. This the Doctor affirms, and I deny. 2. Whether Christ was made and accounted by the Father, the very Transgressor, the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the Blasphemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor affirms, and I deny.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Truth confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. To transact our very Sins on Christ, as opposed to Guilt is impossible; for it would argue either a mistake in the divine Mind, to account him the Committer of our Sins; or a propagator of our corrupt Qualities to him, which is as impossible; and any other way to transact Sin on him, besides impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Guilt, there is none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is needless to the ends for which our sins were laid on Christ. Sins were laid on Christ, that he might make Atonement by suffering for them; and so release us who had transgressed. Now, Christ, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Guilt, as an Obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the Terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, was sufficient to this end, and all that was needful. All that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered us, was the Threatning of the Law; that which was destructive to the Offender, was the Punishment included in that Threat. Hence Christ by the Father's Appointment, obliging himself to suffer, and actually suffering what he was obliged
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41167:12"/>
to; and this upon an Agreement, that, for his sufferings, we should be released; where is the need of more? The obliquity of the Fact, as against the Precept, shall not hurt, where the Sanction of the Law is answered; and he that suffers as Sponsor for another, need not sustain in himself the Filthiness of the Crime, to make him capable of giving Satisfaction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 33. <hi>Philem.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Transacting of the Filthiness of our sins on Christ, is blasphemous.</p>
                  <p>He that took care his Body should not <hi>see Corruption,</hi> Act. 2. 3. would much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to take in our Pollution, to need (as the Doctor says) a <hi>breathing it out. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from Sinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. It was condescension enough that he agreed to be treated as a Sinner; but how odious is it to load him with Sin it self? To spit that in his Face, which the worst of Men abused him with? and it would justify his Persecutors who punished him, if that he was really the Person the Doctor's Principle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Had he been accounted, by the Father, the very Transgressor, his atonement had been unavailable to us. The Person esteemed a Sinner was uncapable of atoneing; he that must redeem us was to be <hi>the Just</hi> for the Unjust, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. Whilst offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice, he must be accounted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and blameless; an Offering without Spot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. All the typical Sacrifices were to be clean. Let none say he must have no sins of his own; for if the Filthiness
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41167:13"/>
of our Sins is transferred on him, they are as much his own as if they had been originally his; and the Doctor saith, They made Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the Father; and more he had not been, if the Sin had been committed by himself.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ then suffered for his own Sins, and not for ours; this is plain: For by the Doctor's Notion, they ceased to be our. Sins before he suffered, and they became his own; for they were laid on him before he suffered for them; yea, before he was obliged to suffer for them: This laying of Sins on him, was that without which (the Doctor saith, <hi>p.</hi> 294.) he could not justly be put to suffer. But surely none can doubt, but it was the punishment of our sins was laid on Christ, and <hi>not his own,</hi> Heb. 7. 27.</p>

Doctor <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Tr. of Justif. p.</hi> 284, 285, 287. He vindicates the Reformed from what he calls a <hi>horrid</hi> Consequence, <hi>viz.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41167:13"/>
of Sin is an external Respect of it; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Sanction of the Law only, this is separable from sin, and this alone was imputed to Christ. And he at large proves that this Imputation of Guilt to Christ, is the meaning of Christ's being made Sin for us: <hi>He laid on him the Iniquities of us all.</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 511. he saith, The Imputation of Sin unto Christ, did not carry along with it <hi>any</hi> of the Filth or Pollution of Sin to be communicated to him by Transfusion, a thing impossible: So that <hi>no</hi> Denomination can thence arise, which should include in it any respect to them; a Thought hereof is impious, and dishonourable to the Son of God.

                  </head>
                  <p>He seems to speak of Sin as a positive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing, and doth not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's laying our Sins on Christ as a Physical Act, and as a Moral Act; and seems not to apprehend what the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of imputing a thing to another in Law in criminal Cases, is; hence because laying a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Burthen on a Shoulder, is putting that very Burthen there, he thinks God took our very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sins and placed them on Christ: whereas God's laying our Sins on Christ, is a moral Act of God, as a Rector; <hi>i. e.</hi> he agreed and appointed, that Christ should in his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41167:14"/>
Person stand obliged to bear the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sins, that we might obtain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and that punishment was actually laid upon him, and suffered by him. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because a man bound in a Bond for Money becomes a Debtor; therefore he thinks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ suffered to save the Idolater, or Blasphemer, therefore Christ must be the very Idolater and Blasphemer; whereas Christ, paying our Debts was a Satisfaction for Criminals, not a Payment of Money; And yet it's plain, that if I were bound for Money for one, that by Drunkenness wasts his Estate, my being bound to pay the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, doth not argue that I was the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or must by the Creditors be so account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I make the Payment. Because Christ was made Sin, that is, an Offering or Sacrifice for Sin; therefore he thinks our very sin was on him, and he made filthy. To add no more, because Men wickedly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned him as a Blasphemer therefore the Doctor thinks he was so indeed, and in God's Account.</p>

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> THE Atonement made by Christ, by the Appointment of God, is that, for which alone the Elect are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it is applied to them. But the Elect are not immediately pardoned upon Christ's being appointed to suffer for them, nor assoon as the Atonement was made; nor is that Act of laying sins on Christ, God's forgiving-Act, by which we are personally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Errour.</hi> The very Act of God's laying Sins on Christ upon the Cross, is the very actual Discharge of all the Elect from all their sins.</p>

                  <p>This is so much the declared Opinion of the Doctor, that it runs, as a Line, through all his Discourses; and is the foundation he builds most upon. <hi>P.</hi> 298. <hi>I say, all the Weight, and all the Burthen, and all that very Sin it self, is long agone laid upon Christ; and that laying of it upon him, is a full Discharge, and a general Release and Acquittance unto thee; that there is not any one Sin now to be charged upon thee.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 375. 281, 285. and hence he shews, that <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are justified before they do believe; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,</hi>

                  <head>Wherein the Difference is not.</head>
                  <p>The Difference is not, 1. Whether Christ made a full Atonement for sin. 2. Nor whether that shall in time be applied to the Elect for their actual Remission as the Effect of it. 3. Nor whether we be so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased thereupon, as that God can demand no Atonement from any who shall submit to the Gospel-way of the Application of it. 4. Nor whether the Law be answered, and God's Honour so vindicated thereby, that the sins of Men cannot hinder an Offer and Promise of Forgiveness, and Life. 5. Nor whether, when we are pardoned, the whole meritorious Cause of Pardon be that Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and what is required of Sinners is only a Meetness to receive the Effects of it. 6. Nor whether this Atonement was the only way of Forgiveness, which we can apprehend. All these I affirm.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The real Difference.</head>
                  <p>The real Difference is, 1. Whether the Elect were actually discharged of all their sins at the time that Christ made Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This the Doctor affirms; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 2. Whether that very Act of God's lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins upon Christ, on the Cross; be the Discharge of the Elect from all sin. This the Doctor affirms and I deny.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41167:15"/>
                  <head>The Truth confirmed.</head>
                  <p>The first point of Difference thou mayst find handled in Chap. 1, 9, 11, 12. the last I do refer to in this Chap. <hi>viz.</hi> that the very Act of laying of Sin on Christ upon the Cross, is not the actual immediate Discharge of the Elect from sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was not the Will or Purpose of God or Christ, that the laying of our sins on Christ should be the immediate Discharge of the Elect. I suppose thou wilt grant, that if it was not the Will of God or Christ, that this should discharge them; then it did not discharge them. And it's plain, God did not will it should be so: For we have a full Account, that it is the Elect when he is a Believer, that is to be discharged. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. <hi>This is the Will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting Life.</hi> The Decree it self adjusted this Order: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Christ.</hi> This is further eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced elsewhere; even in all such Places as be produced to prove that Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is required to our actual Remission, and that declare the Impenitent and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving to be unpardoned: For we cannot suppose, that Christ's revealed Will in his Word is repugnant to his Purposes, when dying; or that he should add other Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites to the Pardon of the Elect, if they were immediately pardoned on his Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41167:16"/>
2. This overthrows the whole Scheme so wisely contriv'd for the Distribution of the Effects of his Death. Things are so adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, forgiving the Elect, should be an Effect of Christ's Kingly Office, as well as his Priestly Office: <hi>He is exalted to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and Remission of Sins, Acts</hi> 5. 31. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost is to influence in the Application of Christ's Merits for Forgiveness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>But you are washed; but you are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but you are justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Hence the Design of the Gospel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is <hi>to open mens eyes, and turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sin, Act.</hi> 26. 18. It's a Mercy received in this Order, which is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, if the Elect be discharged when Christ died.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the opposite Errour, the Elect would have been discharged, if Christ had never risen again. For, if meer laying our Sins on Christ did acquit the Elect, let Christ never have risen, we were rid of them, they ceased to be ours; and so could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, by returning upon our Persons, tho' Christ had continued dead; yea, his continuing dead had been the surest Release. Whereas we are said to be <hi>begotten to a lively hope by Christ's resurrection,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>and saved thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea, if taking sins off from the Elect, and laying them on Christ, was their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41167:16"/>
they would be discharged before the sufferings and Death of Christ: This appears; for they were laid on Christ before he suffered; and, according to the Doctor's Scheme, were taken off us, to lay on Christ; and their being laid on Christ, made the Sufferings of Christ to be just: From which it must follow, that the Elect were eased of their Burthen before Christ suffered; yea it would be easily proved, they were released tho' he had not suffered.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If this Errour hold, the Gospel-Notion of Forgiveness by the Blood of Christ, is destroyed. Forgiveness denotes the Person guilty; and it's a judicial Act of God, as a Rector, acting by the Gospel-Rule; and this supposeth the full and perfect Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Christ, and the Grant made in the Virtue thereof. But, in the Doctor's Opinion, the Person is never guilty; for sins were laid on Christ before we were born, and therefore they were never upon us. A ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Act by a Rule, there is none; for the Gospel-grant of Pardon, is not to the Elect, as elect; but as penitent Believers; neither is the Atonement of Christ supposed to our Forgiveness: For the Doctor owneth, that our sins being laid on Christ is before the making of the Atonement; and without our sins lay on Christ, he could not justly be punished. So that, our Discharge being a Transferring of sin from us to Christ, and this being done before Christ made Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are discharged, not for the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, nor by an Act of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41167:17"/>
for the sake of this Atonement. I need not add, that by this Notion, Heathens may be in a pardoned state, and there's no need of the Gospel, or Knowledge of Christ, to bring them out of a state of Wrath.</p>

He requireth of us, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus, and the diligent Use of the outward Means whereby Christ communicates to us the Benefits of his Mediation. Here thou seest, that, 1. We may be, for a time, without the Benefits of Christ's Mediation. 2. That, notwithstanding his Mediation, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curse and Wrath, as still due to us for sin till we repent and believe: For it's to escape these, God requires Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith. 3. It's by Means attended to and operating on us; that the Benefits
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41167:17"/>
of Christ's Mediation are communicated for the Removal of the Curse and Wrath. VVhat can be more fully spoken against our being discharged when Christ suffered; yea or before we repent and believe?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Synod of New-England</hi> condemn this Speech, <hi>viz.</hi> To say, <hi>We are justified by Faith, is an unsafe Speech:</hi> VVe must say we are justified by Christ; the Synod tells us <hi>it is no unsafe Speech.</hi> But on the contrary, to say a Man is justified before Faith, or without Faith, is unsafe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Language of the Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 17, 18.—and they confute That as the 68.

Doctor <hi>Owen of Justif. p.</hi> 306. saith, But yet the Act of God, in laying our sins on Christ, conveyed no actual Right and Title to us unto what he did and suffered: They are not immediately thereon, nor by virtue thereof <hi>ours, or esteemed ours;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath <hi>appointed somewhat else,</hi> not only antecedent thereunto, but as the <hi>Means</hi> of it, unto his own Glory.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistakes.</head>
                  <p>Because it was God's Act to appoint Christ to suffer for our sins, that we might in his VVay and Time, be discharged; therefore he thinks we are immediately discharged by that Act. Because Christ's Atonement is the sole meritorious Cause of Forgiveness; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks God suspends not Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness till he works any thing else in the Soul,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41167:18"/>
which he hath made requisite to our being forgiven; tho' not as any meritorious cause. Because the Scape-Goat carried their sins into the Wilderness, who expressed their Faith and Repentance, by laying on hands on it, and confessing sin; therefore the sins of men are taken away by Christ, while they continue impenitent and unbelieving.</p>

               </head>
               <p>REader, I shall premise, 1. Men are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or cease to be sinners, in several distinct Respects: 1. As to the Filth and Obliquity of Sin; with respect to this, they are more or less sinners, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their Innocence and Holiness. 2. With some, as to the Guilt of sin, which refers to the Sanction of the Law against Offenders: With respect to this, the Offenders be more or less sinners, as they are forgiven, or not forgiven. 3. As to the Charge of the Fact, which was sinful, with respect to this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther After-sanctification nor Pardon, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Transgressor from having been a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Fact was his: The first and last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate one a sinner most properly: The second denominates a Man punishable, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41167:18"/>
not a sinner formally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the whole Scheme of the Doctor's Principles, it's the Elect, as elect, who cease to be sinners: Therefore, when he speaks of a Believer, he doth not mean, he was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before he believed; for he states the time to be when Christ had our sins laid upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Cross. Having explained the Title of this Chapter, I proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> An elect Person ceaseth not to be a sinner, upon the laying of our sins upon Christ; that is, he remains a sinner, as to the Guilt, till he believes; (if Adult.) He is a sinner, as to the Filth of sin, till he be sanctified. He is a sinner, as to the charge of the sinful Fact he commits, and that even after Pardon and Sanctification: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, he is free from the Curse when he is pardoned, and shall be purged from all the Filth of sin when he is perfect in Holiness. And tho' Christ did bear the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Iniquity; yet it never was Christ's Iniquity, but ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Errour.</hi> The Elect upon the Death of Christ, ceased to be sinners; and, ever since their sins are none of their sins, but they are the sins of Christ.</p>

                     <hi>it Christ's, therefore he cannot reckon it his.</hi> This he endeavours to prove p. 270. <hi>If thou hast part in the Lord Christ,</hi> (which he thinks all the unbelieving Elect have) <hi>all these Transgressions of thine, are become actually the Transgressions of Christ, and so cease to be thine; and thou ceasest to be a Transgressor, from that time they were laid upon Christ, to the last hour of thy Life: So that now, thou art not an Idolater; thou art not a Thief,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art not a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Person, what sin soever thou committest, p.</hi> 271. <hi>So that, if you would speak of a sinner, supposing that Person, of whom you speak, to be a Member of Christ</hi> (i. e. <hi>Elect) you must not speak of what he manifests, but of what Christ was.</hi>

3. God reckons mens sins to be their own; he reproves them as theirs; he forgave them as theirs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. Surely, the few things which God had against <hi>Thyatira,</hi> were the sins of that Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 20.

                  <p n="4">4.

such an Imputation of our sins to Christ, as that thereon they should cease to be our sins, and become his absolutely, is to overthrow that which is affirmed; for on that supposition Christ would not suffer for our sins.

                  <p>Reader, Take with thee what hath been said <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. that the Filth of sin was not laid on Christ; and it remains, that what I am to prove, is either, 1. That Christ was under an Obligation to bear the Punishment of sin before his Crucifixion Or, 2. That he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally suffered some of the Punishment of sin before his Crucifixion. And can there be a Necessity of saying much of either? As to the <hi>First,</hi> Whatever proves a Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, what ever Grant was made of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits to any fallen Sinner, before the Death of Christ, in trust of his executing what he had engaged; yea, all such Expressions, <hi>as I come to do thy Will,</hi> Heb. 10. 57. <hi>For this cause I came unto this Hour,</hi> and the like, do prove that he was bound to the bearing of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as our Sponsor, before he was on the Cross. As to the <hi>Second,</hi> I would only note, 1. That the whole of his Humiliation was a degree of his suffering for sin, and so a part of his Satisfaction. His being made low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels by being incarnate, his Poverty, his Temptations, his Stoning, his Reproaches, his Whippings, his Agony in the

Whether Christ was thus on the account of the Filthiness of Sin upon him, separated from, and under the Abhorrency of the Father, during his lying in the Grave.

                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. This Separation was impossible, because of the Union between the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Christ in one Person. This Union could not be dissolved, nor could all Communications of Comfort or Strength from the Divine Nature be interrupted while the Union remained. Yea, the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ had never a personal Subsistence of its own, but was assumed by the eternal Word, the second Person, of one Essence with the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Father had promised constant Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to Christ, in the whole of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings and Sufferings, and his comfortable Presence with him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1, 4, 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Doctor, of all Men, had least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to assert this Separation, when he had so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41167:24"/>
exceeded in telling us, <hi>P.</hi> 379. <hi>That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is a kind of Soul to the Humanity, consisting of Soul and Body, and is the Form and Strength of both,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The God-head gives Life to Christ, and so all the Sufficiency to bear Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity proceeds from the Divine Nature of Christ.</hi> And, <hi>P.</hi> 378. <hi>Should Iniquity be laid on the Humane Nature, and the Divine Nature not support the Humane Nature, it would have sunk under sin.</hi> Reader, is it not strange, that after this, the Doctor should affirm a Separation, and that for all the time when Iniquity was upon Christ?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord Jesus could not be abhorred, or odious to God, for in him God was always <hi>well pleased,</hi> Isa. 42. 1. Mat. 17. 5. He was now yielding the highest Act of Obedience, and so there was at least no cause of Offence; yea, God loved him for this, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. the Person of the Son was always Gods <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> from Eternity to Eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. and could not but be so. Christ must have been as odious to himself as to the Father, for he is of the same Holy Essence.</p>
                  <p>Reader, How horrid a sound must it have to a Christian Ear, to say, A Christ <hi>odious</hi> to God, <hi>abhorred</hi> by the Father, and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a loathsome, a detestable, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable and filthy sinner for a time.</p>
                  <p>This Point carries that Aspect, that from Regards for the Doctor, I will not insist on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor its necessary Consequences, and yet upon this depend many of his Positions.</p>

5. Christ could not be thus separated from, and be, as it were, the Abhorred of the Lord, while his Body lay in the Grave, for then his Soul could not <hi>be in Paradise,</hi> as it was when his Body was in the Grave, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. Alas! how can any bear to think, that (as the Doctor affirms) <hi>he never saw God's Face all that while?</hi> Where was he? Yea, What tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Agitations of Soul must he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even after Death, in the unseen State? The Papists indeed tell us he was in Hell; but they assign Purposes more becoming Christ's being there, than the Doctor's Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imports. It was the height of Hell, for Christ to be banished from God's Face, and be under his very Wrath and Abhorrence all that time, and his Mind tormented with the Filth of sin made his: He never would have been a Saviour on Terms so inconsistent with his Person. But the whole Notion is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scripture, for under the greatest Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Comfort, he owns God's Presence and Relation: <hi>My God, My God,</hi> Matth. 27. 46. and just upon his loud Cry, he said, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into thy Hands I commit my Spirit; and having said thus he gave up the Ghost,</hi> Luk. 22. 46. Was there a Separation or Abhorrence, when he thus addresseth himself to God, as his God, and his Father? Did he never come near God all that while, when God received his Spirit, or rejected his Prayer? which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did reject: <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 42. <hi>Me thou hearest always.</hi> See <hi>Ps.</hi> 69. 13, 14, 15, 17, 18. <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. 18, 19, 20, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>He was heard in that he feared,</hi> which refers to this time.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 270, 271. The Doctor saith, <hi>Mark it well, Christ himself is not so compleatly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but we are as righteous as he; nor we so compleatly sinful, but Christ became, being made sin, as compleatly sinful as we. Nay, more, we are the same Righteousness, for we are made the Righteousness of God; that very Sinfulness that we were, Christ is made that very Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before God. So that here is a direct Change, Christ takes our Person and Condition, and stands in our stead; we take Christ's Person and Condition, and stand in his stead. What the Lord beheld Christ, that he beholds the Members of Christ to be,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that if you reckon well, you must always reckon your selves in anothers Person, and that other in your Person.</hi> And, <hi>P.</hi> 180. <hi>God gives his Son Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God gives the Person of Christ to Men, as much as to say, God gives Christ to stand in the room of Men, and Men stand in the room of Christ. So that in giving Christ, God is pleased, as it were, to make a Change, and all the Loveliness the Person of Christ hath, that is put upon us, and we are as lovely with him, even as the Son himself.</hi> And, <hi>P.</hi> 158. <hi>Here is a Person in Blood in a loathsome Condition, but for all this, as loathsome as the Person is in himself, and in his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet here is Perfection of Beauty,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. Nor whether our Justification, and all other Benefits, when we are made Partakers of them, be the Fruits of this Righteousness, as the only meritorious Cause of them.</p>

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p>My designed Brevity prevents Enlargement on so many Points, and therefore I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glance at each.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is not a Change of Person betwixt Christ and the Elect:</hi> For Christ was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and never ceased to be so: VVe are the Saved, and not the Saviours. Christ was still the Redeemer, and never the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we are the Redeemed, and never the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers. Christ was he, who by his own Merits forgives us, but never was forgiven; we are forgiven, and never had Merits of our own to forgive our selves, or others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. It's prophane Arrogance for us to pretend to his Prerogatives; and it's Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to debase him among their Number, who were <hi>Enemies without Strength; and Sinners,</hi> for whom he was the dying Sacrifice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8, 10. It's enough, that he reserving the <hi>Peculiars of a Redeemer,</hi> should agree to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for our Sins; it's enough that we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and adopted for his Sake, when we deserved endless VVoe and are never capable of making the least Atonement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Mediatorial Righteousness of Christ is not subjectively in us.</hi> I do not speak now of our inherent Righteousness, of which he is not only the Pattern, but also is the Cause
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41167:28"/>
and VVorker, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. The Discourse is only of that Righteousness which belongs to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, on the Account of his fulfilling the Law of his Mediation, and his Title to the Rewards promised to him as Mediator, for fulfilling that Law, which he did to every <hi>Iota.</hi> This Righteousness is accounted to be for us, and to deliver all the Elect, was the end of all his Undertakings. Nevertheless, it is not subjectively in us, because 1. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Nature of Gospel-Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. To impute to one what is suffered by another, is to esteem the one undertaken for in the Sufferings of the other, and to deal with him as if himself had suffered the same things; yea, and had never deserved to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; but it is not to judge, that he did in his own Person suffer, for that were false, and a Derogation to the Honour of him who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Sufferings; especially, if he freely suffered in another's Room, and for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as our Lord did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Much less is Imputation an Infusion of Christ's Righteousness into us, or a Putting it subjectively in us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Soul in all Actings of Faith on Christ's Righteousness, ought to look at this Righteousness, as in Christ, and not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who believeth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12. VVould it not be strange Language? to say, I trust for new Pardon or Comfort to the Righteousness that was once in Christ; but is now in me: in me, is the meritorious Cause of my Pardon: In me, is the Fountain, to which I must look for VVashing and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41167:28"/>
not as it is in Christ, to whom I am uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as it inheres in me as the immediate Subject of it. But the Gospel directs to look to him and be saved, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 22. Faith owns the Foundation of our Plea to be in Christ, from whom are derived to us that Pardon, and Right to Life, which are the Effects of his Righteousness. <hi>For this</hi> we are justified, for that Righteousness which is in Christ, we are acquitted and adopted. The efficient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in him, the Effect of the judicial Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for that Merit is in us. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is still in Christ, for the Sake whereof we are absolved, or justified. God hath, <hi>for Christ's Sake, forgiven us,</hi> but not for the Sake of what is in our selves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. Had not he obeyed and suffered <hi>for us,</hi> we could not have been absolved for the Sake of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Sufferings: And now being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, or made righteous in a <hi>Law Sence,</hi> we have as much Matter of glorying in him, as absolved, acquitted Sinners can have: VVe are justified by his Righteousness, that is for that we are forgiven; and also entitled to Life, which we had forfeited our selves; but we are not made <hi>Innocent,</hi> nor so esteemed; we are not accounted them who made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. VVe still take hold of (or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and approve, with Reliance on and Submission to the Terms of its Application) of Christ's Righteousness, that we by it may be forgiven; and this is our <hi>Blessedness, Rom.</hi> 4. 7. and our Gospel-Righteousness, which all such refuse who reject redeeming Love from a Conceit of their own Merits; or refuse the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41167:29"/>
Terms of the Gospel, which by the Promise do make us capable of being justified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Merits of Christ. Yet these still remain, his Merits, though thus beneficial to us in their Application, as the procuring Cause of all our Good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Mediatorial Righteousness be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively in us, we must grant all those Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which the Enemies of Gospel-Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion object, and the Orthodox deny. If it be in us, then we may be as truly Intercessors as Christ, and in the same Sence, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Virtue of Merits made personally ours. We have a Righteousness in us which is able to save the World, and capable of being imputed to their Justification. VVe need no Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but are saved by the Covenant of VVorks as claiming Life by its Sanction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, which is inconsistent with all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; yea or Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which did no way consist in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, but in a full Satisfaction. This would denominate us Saviours from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we were justified, if not before. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, we still need Pardon, and continue justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Efficacy of the Righteousness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and must look to Christ as the only Subject of it all our Days. Our justified State is a Continuance of the blessed Effects of he Righteousness of Christ from first to last. That Cause is still productive of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as our Guilt returns, or Necessities and Capacities renew or grow; but our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ever in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41167:29"/>
3. <hi>That we are as Righteous as Christ, is not a proper or safe Speech.</hi> It's true indeed, our Pardon and Acceptance is firm and lasting, and will no more fail us, than the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ will fail; it being the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cause and Security thereof, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits can abate to none who answer the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Rule of it's Application. But yet we are not as Righteous as Christ: We are not so as to Sanctification; he being perfectly Holy, we being imperfectly so, though really Holy. And it's to be noted, That Believers are said to be <hi>Righteous</hi> in the common sence of the Scripture, on the account of Sanctification, 1 Joh. 3. 7. <hi>He that doth righteousness, is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi> And to suppose the Elect to be as san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified as Christ, even while they wallow in the mire, is a strange Position. But suppose the Phrase refers to <hi>Justification,</hi> yet it is not proper. For, 1. Christ is denominated Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, on the account of what he personally did, and suffered: He derived not Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from another, but possessed it as Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally his own. He is eminently <hi>the Righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. whereas we are reputed righteous for the sake of what Christ did, and not for the merit of what we have done. Is it not unagreeable to hear a redeemed Sinner say, I am as worthy as he that paid the Ransom? Or a pardoned Worm say, I am as righteous as he who merited my Pardon? 2. Christ was so Righteous, as to merit the Forgiveness of all his Seed: He is so Righteous, as to make many Righteous, or safe from the Threat, and entituled to the Reward, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41167:30"/>
to the Gospel-Rule: But we cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie one other Person by our being righteous: We are not righteous enough <hi>to save a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Psal. 49. 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Though Christ be perfectly holy, yet his Holiness is not so imputed to us, as that We are therefore perfectly holy.</hi> This is evident: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Holiness refers to Sanctification, and not to Justification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Holiness is a Conformity to the Precept, as describing what is Sin and Duty: But it refers not to the Sanction, which determines the Reward and Punishment; and so to be Holy, and to be Righteous, are distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. Having premised these, it follows,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That to be Perfect in Holiness, while we are in our own Persons Imperfect, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, ungrounded, and absurd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's <hi>Impossible,</hi> being a Contradiction. To be perfectly Holy, and not perfectly Holy at the same time, are inconsistent. If any doubt whether they are imperfect in Holiness, they are little acquainted with the Law, or with themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's <hi>Ungrounded.</hi> I know that it will be objected, That it's so by <hi>Imputation:</hi> But the Gospel knows no Imputation of this kind; we may as well infer, That we are Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Omniscient, because Christ is so. I understand that the Promise gives to the imperfectly holy, Impunity, and Right to Life, on the account of Christ's Merits: But where hath God said he will esteem the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to be Perfect, as to what he declares them imperfect in? Or hath God ever said we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41167:30"/>
are thus perfect? He may deal with a sincere Christian (who is called Perfect, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of others,) as if he were perfect; having provided for his Justice and Honour in doing thus, by the Satisfaction of Christ: But he cannot account him perfectly Holy. The very Union in Marriage, doth not transfer habitual Qualifications from Husband to Wife: Is a foolish Wife perfectly wise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her Husband is so? No, though she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Benefit by his Wisdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's <hi>Absurd.</hi> Our restored Holiness, is through the Operations of the Spirit, and not by Transfusion. If the very Holiness of Christ's Person be in us, it is his Increated Holiness, or Created: If his <hi>Increated,</hi> then we are Gods, and not Men; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Increated but God: If the <hi>Created</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Christ's Humane Nature be in us, it must depart from him, or cease to be in him, as far as it's derived to us; for the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Quality cannot be in two Subjects at once, though the same for Kind may be. If we are as Holy as Christ, what hinders us to be entituled to the same degrees of Glory and Honour as he? And all this being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Change of Person between Christ and us, we may well say we are Christ's, even every elect Person severally: And if our perfect Holiness should be surmised from the Union between Christ and Believers, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would not be a change of Person, but the making Christ and us one <hi>Natural</hi> Person. And then on the same grounds as we can say we are as holy as Christ is, we may say we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41167:31"/>
are as much Gods as Christ, as Wise as Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as entituled to Worship as Christ; we do all that Christ doth in Heaven or Earth, and he doth all as we Sinners do; we give what he gives, and he receives what we receive; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Persons is gone, Christ and we do nothing, and are nothing as distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. A thousand such things are unavoidable Consequences.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Can this be reconciled to the scope of the Scriptures, wherein Believers are called <hi>to grow up in Christ?</hi> Eph. 4. 15. To perfect Holiness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Grow in Grace?</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Holiness is bewailed by all the Saints, <hi>Wretched man that I am!</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>I press forward,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 12, 14. that is, Oh, that I were as holy as Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to make me, and as I shall be at the Resurrection! And the want and weakness of Holiness, is oft reproved by God, even in his own Children.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Fifth Head</hi> to be proved, is, That Believers are not, as to Holiness, without Spot, Blemish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experience may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of this: But I pass it by, as having occasion to speak to it in <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.</p>

imputed to us <hi>only</hi> with respect to our Personal Want; not as it was satisfactory for all but as our Souls stand in need of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, it follows <hi>only,</hi> that those to whom it is imputed, are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> and <hi>saved,</hi> not at all that they are Redeemers or Saviours. And <hi>pag.</hi> 242, 243. Imputation is not the Transmission or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the Righteousness of another <hi>(viz.</hi> Christ) into them that are to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, that they should become perfectly and inherently Righteous thereby; for it is impossible that the Righteousness of one should be transfused into another, to become his subjectively and inherently.</q> And the Doctor adds; <q>That the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ is imputed to us; as unto its Effects, hath this sound sence namely The Effects of it are made ours, by reason of that Imputation: It is so imputed, so reckoned unto us of God, as that he really communicates all the Effects of it unto us: See <hi>pag.</hi> 310, 311.</q> What can be spoken more oppositely to Dr. <hi>Crisp?</hi>

                  <p>I might add Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> who tells us, <hi>Orth.

                  <head>The Ground of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because Christ suffered in our stead that the fruit of his Suffering might be our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from suffering, and our being saved at last; therefore he thinks there is a Change of Person. Because we are made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, that is, Partakers of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, and a Right to Life, through Christ's Atonement for us, which be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies so eminently the Contrivance and Gift of God; therefore he thinks the very Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Righteousness of Christ is subjectively in us. Because we are accepted with God, for Christ's sake; therefore he thinks we have the perfect Cause of that Acceptance, <hi>viz.</hi> All Loveliness upon our selves. Because the Church is now without spot, so as for Christ's sake to be accepted, and not detested by God; and is, on the account of the beginning's of God's Image, pleasing to Christ, and will hereafter be perfectly sanctified, without the least blemish, or any such thing; therefore he thinks it's now without Blemish or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Because Christ's perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Security for our Pardon, and inviolable Right to Glory; therefore he thinks we are as Righteous as he, as to Justification and Sanctification too. Because Christ is made of God to us, <hi>Wisdom, Sanctification,</hi> &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks we are as Holy as he; whereas the meaning of that place is, That Christ is appointed and given to enlighten, renew and redeem us by his Merits, and by his Spirit:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41167:33"/>
If this be not the sence of it, we are as wise as Christ; for he is <hi>made to us wisdom.</hi>

               <p>THis being a Point of great Concern, I shall premise an Enquiry into some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for explaining the Subject of this Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is not the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Father and Spirit as one Party, and the Eternal Word, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, as the other Party. Were this Covenant understood, I think many well-meaning People would be undeceived: In that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all the causes of Man's Salvation are adjusted and secured; all Satisfaction and Merit are on Christ, as his Undertaking; yea, it's provided there, That the Elect shall obey the Terms of Life, and certainly possess Salvation: Yea, as that Covenant was not made <hi>with</hi> the Elect, though <hi>for</hi> the Elect; so they have nothing to do, as a Condition
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41167:34"/>
of this Covenant. And to this all absolute Promises and Prophecies of Grace are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, they being a Transcript hereof: This Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes to be a distinct Covenant from the Covenant of Grace. See his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Justif.</hi> pag. 268, 269.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. <hi>What is intended by Condition?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I shall answer in the words of worthy Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> (Discourse of Errors, <hi>pag.</hi> 248.) <hi>An Antecedent Condition signifies no more than an Act of ours; which though it be neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every degree, nor in the least meritorious of the Benefit conferred, nor performed in our own natural strength; yet, according to the Constitution of the Covenant, it is required of us, in order to the Blessings consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by virtue of the Promise: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Benefits and Mercies granted in this order, are and must be suspended by the Donor, or Desposer of them, till it be performed; such a Condition we affirm Faith to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some call this a <hi>Consequent Condition;</hi> but they mean not Consequent to the Benefit promised, but Consequent to Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to enable us to do it. <hi>Reader,</hi> I would have thee note, 1. The Conditions do not merit the Blessings promised. 2. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not uncertain; for Christ hath undertaken that the Elect shall perform them. 3. They are performed by Grace,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41167:34"/>
and not by Natural Power. 4. They are performed by Men, and not by Christ, though it is by Christ that any are enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them: It's not Christ repents, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in a Saviour, but Men themselves. 5. It's from God's Will in the Promise, that they are made to be Conditions, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected the Benefit and the Duty; though he chose Conditions that were fit, yet their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would not have availed to our interest in the Benefits, unless he had promised that they should so avail: A penitent Believer had not been saved, but for the Promise, though it's unlike a God to have saved any that were not such. 6. These Conditions are our Duty by God's Command; and not less so, by being made Terms of the Benefit in the Divine Grant. 7. The Covenant, though Conditional, is a Disposition of Grace: There's Grace in giving ability to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as well as in bestowing the Benefits: God's enjoyning one, in order to the other, makes not the Benefit to be less of Grace; but it is a display of God's Wisdom, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Benefit, suitably to the nature and state of Men in this Life, whose Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition is not eternally decided, but are in a state of Tryal; yea, the Conditions are but a meetness to receive the Blessings. 8. The reason why we use the word <hi>Condition,</hi> is, because it best suits with Man's Relation to God, in his present dealings with us, as his Subjects in tryal for Eternity. Christ, as a Priest, hath merited all; but as a King or a <hi>Priest upon his Throne,</hi> he dispenceth all:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41167:35"/>
He enjoyns the Conditions, in order to the Benefits; and makes the Benefits Motives to our Compliance with the Conditions: He treats with Men as his Subjects, whom he will now <hi>Rule,</hi> and hereafter <hi>Judge.</hi> Now what word is so proper to express the Duties as enjoyned Means of Benefits, like this word <hi>Conditions?</hi> The word <hi>Conditions,</hi> is of the same nature as <hi>Terms</hi> of the Gospel. There be few Authors of Note, even of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, but they make use of this word in my sence; as <hi>Ames, Twiss, Rutherford, Hooker</hi> of <hi>New-England, Norton, Preston, Owen, Synod</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> the <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Divines,</hi> &amp;c. And I know none have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to scruple it, except such as think we are United to Christ, and Justified before we are Born. To such indeed all such Terms are improper, because they deny God's dispensing of Saving Benefits in a way of Government.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> are performed by the Grace of Christ
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41167:35"/>
freely given to Sinners. The Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Innocency,</hi> were performed by a strength due to, and inherent in our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The principal Conditions of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> express the guilt and misery of them that perform them: Repentance owns our Filth and Guilt, and Faith in a Redeemer expresseth our sinful and lost State; neither of these could have place in our legal Righteousness, as being utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with an Innocent Condition: Nor can they have much room in Heaven, where we shall be perfect; whereas the Terms of the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> implied nothing but Innocency and Happiness.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> make us capable of no Happiness except what Christ hath bought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us; his Blood is the Price of all: But the happiness granted to sinless Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was immediately from the Creator, and knew no Atonement or Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Blessings promised on the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> are meerly of Grace: They be for another's sake, and not our own; they are given to such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and that are still condemnable by the Law for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the performed Gospel-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, it's <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> which renders these Persons <hi>blessed,</hi> Rom. 4. 7. whereas the sinless Obedience of innocent <hi>Adam</hi> made the <hi>Reward to be of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. which we, as being happy by Pardon, must renounce.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41167:36"/>
5. The Use and Interest of Gospel-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not from the conformity of them to the Preceptive part of the Law, (though in a degree there be that,) but from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Rule of the Grace of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: The Promise of Pardon through Christ, being to the penitent Believer, and no other; Repentance and Faith become necessary and useful Conditions of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by the Order of God in that gracious Promise: But by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> the meer Work gave an Interest in the Reward, as it was Obedience to the Precept, by a Sanction that had Goodness, but no such Grace in it.</p>
                  <p>On these accounts, I shall never fear that the <hi>Conditionality of the Covenant of Grace</hi> should turn it into a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> till I see it proved, That God can promise, and apply no Benefit purchased by Christ to a poor Sinner, upon the Condition of any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he commands, and freely enableth the Sinner to perform: The Judgment-Day is past, and a State of Tryal is over, when-ever this is proved.</p>
                  <p>These things I have premised, that, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, I may remove the Mistakes which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Minds of some well-meaning people.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Thou canst not but observe, that the <hi>Assembly</hi> did judge, 1. That though God hath provided a Mediator for Sinners, yet they have no interest in him till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 2. That the Covenant is Conditional. They scruple not to call Faith the <hi>Condition</hi> of our Interest in Christ, and of Salvation by him. 3. That Christ and Salvation are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all Sinners on the same Condition, though God effectually enable the Elect to obey the Condition.</p>

They must <hi>come</hi> to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Supper, or have no share in it: So is it of Pardon of Sin, Acceptance to Life, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Jelus, and shalt believe in thine Heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou shalt be saved.</hi> Rom. 4. 25. <hi>To whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him, that raised up Jesus our Lord.</hi> Gal. 3. 7. <hi>They which are of Faith, are the Children of</hi> Abraham. See more of this in the Chapters of <hi>Union, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> &amp;c. And note, that it's Injustice to add new Terms of any of these Benefits, if they be ours by the Covenant as absolute before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Covenant be not conditional, as to the disposing of these Benefits, it would follow, 1. That all to whom the Offers are made, have an Interest in them, or it is not a serious Offer, no, nor a true Offer, as not containing a real and mutual Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Benefit and the Duty. 2. Faith it self is no more necessary to our first Interest in these Benefits, than any other Grace; nay, than Unbelief. Let no body object, it's a Sign, for so is any other Grace; yea, so might be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Paul</hi> by his Name, by his Abode; yea, by his Sin; <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Persecutor: Paul</hi> the Persecutor, of such an Age and Place, would serve as well to evidence him a justified Man, as his Faith. Abundance of such Consequences, to the very overturning of the Gospel, and all Religion, are unavoidable.</p>

I will cause you to <hi>pass under the Rod</hi> and will bring you into the <hi>Bond</hi> of the Covenant. All these Expressions are convincing, that there is a Restipulation on Man's part; and that it's a Covenant, with respect to that <hi>mutual</hi> Stipulation between God and us. To suppose the Covenant to be the sole Act of God, and an Act that's meerly absolute, renders all these Phrases impertinent and impossible. Can we be said to make or keep the Covenant which is only God's absolute Grant? It was his Act to appoint this Covenant, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to make and keep it: It's his Act to restipulate on his Part; but to deny it to be conditional, as to the very Benefits, is to make God to be the sole Party Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider the <hi>Seals</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism and the Lord's Supper; and you will easily judge, that they do not Seal absolutely, but conditionally; if absolutely, then every one that partake thereof are saved. If they Seal conditionally, the Covenant must
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41167:40"/>
be conditional, for by them the Covenant is renewed, and the Benefits exhibited accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tenure of the Covenant it Self. They do not Seal to us, that we have the Grace to which the Benefit is promised, but they seal the Benefits of the Covenant on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we have that Grace. Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Baptism that <hi>saves us, is not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away the Filth of the Flesh (i. e.</hi> outward Washing) <hi>but the Answer of a good Conscience towards God,</hi> i. e. The upright Consent of the Heart to the Vow, and Profession made in Baptism. If Men would consider that a meer elect Person, though by Revelation known to be elect, yet whiles unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is not entitled to the Lord's Supper; sure they cannot but inferr, That this Person hath not an actual Interest in the Covenant, and all its Benefits, whiles he continues so.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I might shew, that Unbelief, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are Sins contrary to the Terms of the Covenant, are the only Hinderances to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Interest in the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and by these we are said to <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> the Covenant. The Scripture is full in this, it lays Mens want of Forgiveness on their Unbelief, as the culpable Cause <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's needless to shew how this infers the Covenant-Benefits are conditional.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Gospel promise being the way which Christ appoints to dispense saving. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to Sinners, must have the same Rules with the Covenant of Grace. This Gospel is his <hi>Testament,</hi> and the same with this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the Benefits are the same, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41167:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot be a disposition of these Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in a way contrary to this Gospel; but this Gospel or Covenant tells us, 1. That there is a Promise of the first G<gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> made to Christ for the Elect, and by the Virtue of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, the Elect do consent to the Covenant. 2. This Gospel, or Covenant, is the Means whereby that Faith is wrought. 3. This Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel commands, and by the Power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, works that Faith, in order to saving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; which Benefits, it promiseth to such as do thus believe, and to no other. 4. This Gospel, or Covenant invests Believers in those saving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. 5. It secures the Perseverance of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in that true Faith, and the necessary Effects and Operations of it, and thereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures those Benefits as unforfeited. But Christ never bequeathed, or promised in the Gospel, a Pardon or Salvation to the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; nor the Continuance of that Pardon or Salvation, but on Supposition, that this Faith perseveres; and if the Gospel Promise say no such things, I am sure the Covenant did not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Account of the Covenant, which seems most for its Absoluteness, implies this conditional Connexion of the required Grace, and the promised Benefits, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>Ezra</hi> 11. 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that referr to the Restauration of the Captivity. I'll fix on that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. <hi>I'll make a new Covenant with the House of Israel, and the House of Judah.</hi> 33. <hi>After those days, I will put my Laws in their inward Parts, and</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41167:41"/>
                     <hi>write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my People; and they shall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother,</hi> saying, <hi>Know the Lord, for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them; for I will forgive their Iniquities, and remember their Sins no more.</hi> This is quoted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 12. <hi>and</hi> 10. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>To understand this, we must consider, 1. Whom is this Covenant made with. 2. What cannot be inferred from this Scheme of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whom is this Covenant made with.</hi> It's with the House of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> not the Men in present being, but Men to be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>It's after those Days I will make it:</hi> So that it was after the Mosaick Covenant was to expire, Ver. 32. and it could not be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant of Grace, for that had its Being from the Fall. And the sincere <hi>Israelites</hi> did not lose the Advantages of it by the Mosaick Dispensation, as the Apostle Argues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. The Point before us, is to know who this <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> be. 1. They are either the natural Jews to be alive <hi>in those Days</hi> which this Promise refers to. 2. Or true Believers, who are <hi>inwardly</hi> Israel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it terminate on the <hi>natural</hi> Jews; it's the strongest Text for the Conversion of that People, and describes the Extent of it, <hi>viz. to all:</hi> The Manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Influence for the most part; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their Iniquities, refers to their Sin, in crucifying Christ, for which that Blindness came upon them, that is here removed. If
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41167:42"/>
you take it in this Sence, yet here is <hi>a Law written in the Heart,</hi> which includes Faith, in order to God's being their God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their Sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If true Believers, or they that are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Israel,</hi> be meant, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9. then it's plain, that there is Faith in all such who are the Parties with whom God makes this Covenant: They are the <hi>Children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 7. and no Unbelievers are <hi>Israel</hi> in this Notion. If you take it thus, the Text imports, Perseverance, great Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and high Improvements in Holiness and Knowledge, great Nearness to, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Benefits secured, and reserved for the <hi>New-Testament-Times,</hi> and all these to multitudes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be inferred from this Scheme of the new Covenant, that (as the Doctor would have it) God doth not require any Duty as the Condition of the Benefits which he promiseth to give; for here's Gods. Law written in the Heart, before our Relation to him as his People, or the Pardon of Sins; and though this Text includes the Effects and Materials of the Covenant, yet it doth not describe the whole <hi>Form</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for in other Places, God requires the new Heart as a Condition of Life. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Cast away from you all your Transgressions, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why will you die, O House of Israel? But turn and live,</hi> Jer. 7. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, which is the Ministry of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. is to preach Faith
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41167:42"/>
and Repentance for the Remission of Sin. We are to promise the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all that submit to the Terms of it; and to declare, that all who refuse the Terms, shall therefore be excluded from the Benefits, as you'll see <hi>Chap.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 21.</p>

                     </q> which the Synod thus confutes: <q>This Position seems to deny Faith to be a <hi>Condition</hi> at all, or at all active; and so, if Condition in this place signifie a Qualification in Man wrought by the Holy Ghost, <hi>without which,</hi> the Promises do not belong to Men. This is contrary to <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 48.</q> Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> saith, <hi>Treat. of Justif.</hi> P. 264. <q>That Christ under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, that those who were to be taken into this Covenant, should receive Grace, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to comply with the Terms of it, fulfill its <hi>Conditions,</hi> and yield the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which God required therein.

He thinks, because God hath promised to Christ, That the Elect shall <hi>believe;</hi> therefore God cannot make Faith a Condition of any other Blessing, which he resolves to bestow in order after Faith. He thinks, because Christ is given to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that is, he is appointed as a Surety, to see the great Ends of the Covenant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished and secured; therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required from Men, as the way of their Interest in the Benefits of the Covenant, though under the influence of Christ. He thinks, because Christ is appointed to work Faith, in order to Union, and other Benefits; therefore we must have an actual Interest in Christ, and those Benefits, before this Faith is wrought. He thinks, because all Grace

after Union comes from Christ, as our <hi>actual</hi> Head; therefore Christ by his Spirit can work no Grace in us, as our <hi>designed</hi> Head.

                  <p n="1">1. Whether the whole Essence of Saving Faith, consists in an Inward Persuasion or Assurance that our Sins are pardoned, and Christ is ours? This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; yea, I deny that it is at all of the Essence of Saving Faith.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRUTH.</hi> CHrist is freely offered to be a Head and Saviour to the vilest Sinners, who will knowingly assent to the Truth of the Gospel, and from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their Sin and Misery out of Christ, are humbled, and truly willing to renounce all their Idols and Sins; denying their own carnal Self and Merits, and accept of Christ as offered in the Gospel; relying on him alone for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Observe, 1. Christ is freely offered to the vilest Sinners, for their acceptance of him according to the Gospel. 2. He is not offered so, as if any Sinner might have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Interest in him, till they are willing to deny themselves, renounce all Sins and Idols; and do accept of, and rely on him as a full Saviour, according to the Terms of the Gospel. There cannot be an Acceptance of Christ, without a Renouncing of Sin and Idols, and Denying carnal Self, and our own Merits, as Opposites to him: And on the other hand, to renounce Sin and Idols, and deny our selves, will not avail us, without an acceptance of Christ, and relianceon him. 3. I mention some things that are antecedently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41167:48"/>
to our renouncing of Sin and Idols, and to our acceptance of, and reliance on Christ; as Knowledge, Assent, Conviction of Sin and Misery, and some Humblings of Soul, which must attend all true Convictions: These are <hi>Preparatory Qualifications;</hi> not that an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Christ always follows these, but they dispose the Soul to a hearty acceptance of Christ, in opposition to all rival Opposites, and are necessary thereto in some degree. 4. The declared Design of the Offers of Christ to Sinners, is, That they may be thus willing to accept of Christ, and so partake of an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ERROUR.</hi> Christ is offered to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, Murtherers, and the worst of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that they remaining ignorant, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, unhumbled, and resolved in their purpose to continue such, they may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured they have a full Interest in Christ; and this by only concluding in their own Minds upon this Offer, That Christ is theirs.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Proved that this is Dr.</hi> Crisp<hi>'s Opinion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I need give no Proof of it but this; That it's a declared Point, which he oft strives to prove, That all the Elect are actually united to Christ before they Believe, yea, before they are Born; as you'll see in the next Chapter. So that all the design of these Offers, is only to manifest to Men, That Christ was theirs before; as he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 100. <hi>Is not Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief a Bar to have a part in Christ?</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; <hi>It is a Bar to hinder the manifestation</hi>

                     <hi>of Christ in the Spirit; but it is not a Bar to hinder one from having a part in Christ.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Doctor seems to insist on Mens coming to Christ, and closing with him; as <hi>p.</hi> 206. <hi>No Consideration in the world can so aggravate a Man's Condition, would he make his condition as bad as the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet if there be but a Coming, there can be no Consideration, in the highest pitch of sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for Christ to reject him.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 202. <hi>Whatever thou art, suppose a Drunkard, a Whoremaster, a Swearer, a Blasphemer, a Mad-man in Iniquity; couldst thou but Come to Christ, I say,</hi> Come, <hi>only</hi> Come, <hi>it is no matter if there be no Alteration in the world in thee when thou dost come to Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. But Coming, or Believing, is no other, in the Doctor's Judgment, than an Inward Persuasion or Concluding that Christ is ours: And this is not in order to an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, but to our Knowing it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 106. The <hi>Dr.</hi> saith, <hi>I must tell you, There is no better way to know your Portion in Christ, than upon the general tender of the Gospel, to conclude absolutely, he is yours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Say to your selves, (and let not this be contradicted, seeing Christ hath reached out himself to Sinners as Sinners,). My part is as good as any Man's: Set down thy rest here; question it not, but believe it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Venture thy Soul upon it, without seeking for further Security. But some will say, He doth not belong to me. Why not to thee? he belongs to Sinners, as Sinners; and if there be no worse than Sinfulness, Rebellion and Enmity in thee, he belongs to thee, as well as to any in the World.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 2. Not Believing, or not Coming to Christ, is nothing with the Doctor; but not Concluding within one's self that Christ is mine.</p>
                  <p>Pag 203. <hi>It would be welcome to them to be certainly satisfied that his Blood is their Ransom, and that their Sins are blotted out thereby; but they dare not yet close with Christ, they dare not set up their rest there, they dare not sit down with any such Conclusion, but still there is something or other that remains, that must be removed out of the way before they can make this certain Conclusion, Christ is their Christ. Now my Errand is to this sort of People, whose hearts tell them, If it could clearly appear, that without danger to them, they may say Christ is their Salvation, and sit down with this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but they dare not, something or other is wanting, they dare not lay hold on Christ, and it's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption for them to sit down satisfied that Christ is their Christ.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 36, 44, 432, 490.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not, Whether there is in Christ a sufficiency of Merit and Grace to save the worst of Sinners? 2.

Nor, Whether the worst Sinners are often the Objects of God's Effectual Calling, in order to an Interest in Christ? 4.

                  <p>The main Question is decided by what I have spoken of <hi>Saving Faith:</hi> For if <hi>Coming</hi> be not this Persuasion, and <hi>Saving Faith</hi> be necessary to our Interest in Christ, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains little to prove. Of this last see <hi>ch.</hi> 11. <hi>Of Union,</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> 8. Only consider, That Christ cannot be offered to be ours on any lower Terms than such as by which he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becomes ours by the Gospel-Grant.</p>
                  <p>It remains then, that I briefly prove the Truth, as contained in the Third and Fourth <hi>Questions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Soul of a Sinner, as to its habitual Disposition and Purpose, is not under the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of Enmity, Rebellion and Filthiness, till after it hath a Saving Interest in Christ.</hi> You see I speak not of Degrees of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Change of Practice; but of a Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41167:51"/>
of Heart, and Purpose of Mind. This Truth appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Effectual Vocation makes this Change in the Habitual Disposition of the Heart; and this Vocation is necessary to our Interest in Christ. The <hi>Elders</hi> at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Assembly,</hi> agree, <hi>Decl.</hi> and <hi>Conf. ch.</hi> 10. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <q>That this Call lies, in enlightning their Minds spiritually and savingly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the things of God; taking away their Heart of Stone, and giving them an Heart of Flesh; renewing their Wills, and by his Almighty Power determining them to that which is good; effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ, yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his Grace. And <hi>a.</hi> 2. Until being quickned and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this Call, and embrace the Grace offered and conveyed in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou seest what a great Change is made on the Heart and Mind by Effectual Calling; and that our Answer to this Call, (which lies in a Consent answerable to this Change in the Faculties) is the Means of our Interest in the offered Grace; which is Christ, and his Benefits. It's a Call to <hi>Life,</hi> see <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. The Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall <hi>live.</hi> It's a Call to <hi>Holiness,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 7. Hence called a <hi>Holy Calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. A Call to <hi>Light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. If any doubt whether our Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a Means to our Interest in Christ, see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. God is faithful, by whom

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. How inconsistent with Vocation, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and Conversion, are Hearts of such vile Disposition? Is this a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Calling? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. What would it avail to make such a <hi>Calling sure?</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10.

                  <p n="3">3. That cannot be a true Faith, or Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Christ, which consists with such vile Dispositions, and is void of a Purpose to be otherwise. Can he be said to accept of Christ, who, as the Doctor saith, <hi>Hath a Knife in his Hand, and Thoughts in his Heart to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ, and that without so much as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his Arms?</hi> P. 210. What is rejecting Christ, if this be not? What is saying, <hi>We will not have him to reign over us?</hi> Do not we prefer our Lusts before him? And can we thus marry him?

                  <p n="2">2. Some Degrees of Convictions and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of Soul, are necessary Prerequisites to the Soul's true Acceptation of Christ for Pardon.

The Converts recorded in the Word, found such a Work on them, those were <hi>pricked in their Hearts, and cried, What shall we do?</hi> Act. 2. 37.

Yea, These are absolutely Necessary to bring a Man to be willing to close with Christ. Were there no Weight, no Remorse, no Sense of Sin or Misery Christ would not be regarded, much less complied with: Yea, to come to Christ, cannot be an Act of the Will, it thus having a contrary Biass, and the practical Judgment determining against it.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures expresly affirm all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, unregenerate Unbelievers, to be united to Christ, and in a State of Separation from him. The believing <hi>Ephesians</hi> were before Conversion, <hi>without Christ,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. Were they always united to Christ, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>They were in Christ before me?</hi> Or was <hi>Paul</hi> himself always in Christ? Were not the <hi>Romans</hi> out of Christ, while <hi>a wild Olive-Tree,</hi> and untill they <hi>were grafted into the true Olive-Tree?</hi> w ich they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conversion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of Christ, and Faith in him, are the things whereby God hath ordained us to be united with Christ; <hi>By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. <hi>Christ dwells in our Hearts by Faith</hi> Eph. 3. 17. on which account we are said to <hi>receive Christ,</hi> Col. 2. 8. <hi>And are Children of God by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The want of this Union is denounced against all such as have not the Spirit, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41167:55"/>
are Unbelievers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his,</hi> i. e. Let the Man be elect or not, be the Man who he will, if he hath not the Spirit, he is not Christ's in this Union. And it's the Design of that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 3. to 13. that they who accept not of the Invitation, or do not sincerely and spiritually consent to Christ's Offer, shall not be united to Christ, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Marriage Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The necessary immediate Effects of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are plainly wanting in all such as have not the Spirit, and want Faith. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17. Can any unbelieving Wretch pretend to have one Spirit with Christ whiles his Inclinations, Purposes, and Carriage are so contrary? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>If any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>q. d.</hi> Let the Man be who he will, he is not united to Christ, if he be not a new Creature. I hope none will doubt, he is no new Creature, who is carnal, who is a Stranger to the New Man, which <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God is created in Righteousness and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> Eph. 4 24. When the Scriptures describe any Person <hi>in Christ Jesus,</hi> they tell us, they (at least in purpose) <hi>have crucified the Flesh with the Affections thereof,</hi> Gal. 5. 24 and <hi>they walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom 8 1. It's not they that have crucified the Flesh, are in Chr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st, which some might say, would render it only a manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign of their In-being in Christ; but these Texts do exclude all others from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Share in this Union. The like Places
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41167:55"/>
might be multiplied: <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 27. <hi>If Christ be in you, the Body is dead, because of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. Rom 8 9, 10 But alas, these and the like are not only wanting in Unbelievers; but the direct contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prevalently reign in them, and each of these Contraries, do by a Gospel Rule subject Men to those Miseries as are inconsistent with the Members of Christ: As <hi>If ye live after the Flesh, ye shall die; to be carnally minded, is Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. 6, 14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Union with Christ is determined to our effectual Calling: This is the Means and Season of that Blessing; <hi>God is faithful, by whom ye are called into the Fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 9. Hence the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of our Vocation are said to <hi>espouse us to Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2. To <hi>beget</hi> them for him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. This Privilege is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Christ's regenerate Seed, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any that are not so.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Unbelievers are not Members of the Catholick invisible Church, which is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ: <hi>By one Spirit you are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one Body, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. There is a present <hi>effectual Working in every Part</hi> of this Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. It's by the Spirit's Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are Parts of this <hi>Holy Temple, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens with the Saints,</hi> Eph. 2. from 18. to 22. Every Member hath a <hi>Measure of Faith and Grace,</hi> Rom. 12. 3, 4, 5. None of these can be true of Men dead in Sin: Nor can they be Members of Christ, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41167:56"/>
are not Members of his Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Should they that are united to Christ, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatize from Faith, they would thereby forfeit and lose this Union. If any cease to be Believers they would cease to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ. This is the Scope of <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>If a Man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a Branch, and is withered: Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away.</hi> And is it not apparent, that Apostacy sinks a Man into no more Unbelief, than what prevailed before he believed at all?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The opposite Errour would reconcile what the Spirit of God declares inconsistent. The Apostle in vain asketh, <hi>What Concord hath Christ with</hi> Belial? <hi>or what Part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? and what Agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6. 15, 16, 17. By this Opinion, Christ and <hi>Belial</hi> can be, and dwell quietly in one Man for many Years; and he that believeth, and an Infidel, have the same part in the highest Privilege, <hi>viz.</hi> Union with Christ. In Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, God receives all alike, and is their <hi>Father,</hi> though they resolve against being <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate,</hi> Men can (though God saith they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) <hi>partake of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 21. For Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Communion with Christ be the Heart of the Benefits included in partaking of the Lord's Table.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Weigh these things, and thou canst hardly conceive, what Act of God an Union before Faith can be ascribed to. It's
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41167:56"/>
not to the Decree, for that only resolveth it shall be in future. It's not to God's appointing, or Christ's engaging to be a Mediator; for thereby he undertook in time to raise a Seed, which, <hi>in the fulness of Time, God would gather in one in him,</hi> Eph. 1. 10. It's not in Christ's assuming the humane Nature, for that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits all Mankind to be united to him, as well as the Elect. And what Mr <hi>Sterry</hi> and others talk of a radical Union with Christ, as he is the top Branch, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Spirit of the Creation, in a Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from his Divine and Humane; it's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did to such who know of but two Natures in Christ; and if granted would not prove the Doctor's Notion of <hi>actual</hi> Union.</p>

                  <head>The Grounds of the Dr's. Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because Christ is appointed, and given to raise a Body eternally elected thereto; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks, they are this Body before they be raised. Because all After-Grace is from Christ as our <hi>actual</hi> Head; therefore he thinks, Christ cannot, by his Spirit, work the first Grace, as our <hi>designed</hi> Head. VVhereas the Spirit makes <hi>us an Habitation to God,</hi> Eph. 2. 22. And it's a strange conceit, that Christ can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert no Act of Power on a dead Soul, in order to Union, but Men must infer that Union prior to it. Because the <hi>natural</hi> Body cannot see with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Head; therefore Christ cannot convert a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41167:57"/>
Sinner to bring him into his <hi>mystical</hi> Body. One might better infer, the Head cannot see without the Body, and the Body sees as much as the Head, and the Head sees no better than the Body; and so conclude, Christ can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till every elect Person be a Member, and every Member seeth as well as Christ, and the dim Sight of every Member, makes the Sight of Christ as blind as his. Because Christ <hi>received Gifts</hi> for the Rebellious, that God might dwell among them; therefore God dwells among them, before those Gifts ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or be communicated to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. tells us, how these Gifts are the Means by which the Elect are converted, and made Believers, and so come to partake of Union with its peculiar Effects. Because, from the Parable of the Vine, the Gardiner puts the Graff into the Tree before there's Sap or Fruit; therefore he thinks a Man is in Christ, before God puts him in Christ by the Spirit and Faith, which is the only <hi>ingraffing</hi> the VVord tells us of, besides external Church Privileges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 19. I may as well argue, a Member of Christ must always do wicked VVorks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Graff bears always Fruit of its own Kind, and not after the Kind of the Stock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it is ingrafted. How sad is it to strain and abuse Parables or Metaphors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Scope of the Gospel, because God condescends to explain some Truths thereby? as if all that belongs to the Metaphor, teach and prove any Doctrine, because that one Point, for which the Lord useth it, is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41167:58"/>
thereby. VVhat VVork may soon be made by fond People, if this be true? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are chosen in Christ from eternity; that is, elected to obtain Life by him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; therefore we are one with him before any uniting Bonds.</p>
                  <p>Reader, I forbear to represent the Nature of this Union as he seems to state it, <hi>P.</hi> 104, 105, 648, 649, 615. hoping he meant better than many of his VVords do import; but for thy own Good, know, that upon believing we are made Partakers of Gospel-Benefits; we are related to him for all the Advantages which the Metaphors of this Union express. He loveth, enricheth, and honoureth us, as a Man doth his <hi>Wife:</hi> He directs, rules, and quickens us, as a Head doth the Members: He ministers Grace for Fruit and Exercise, as the Root doth to the <hi>Branches.</hi> Yea, This Relation he'll keep undissolved; and yet more, the very Spirit that his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture received in Fulness, abides in, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Conformity to the Life and Temper of Christ in all his Members; which at last he will perfect to the utmost of our Capacity. But yet fansie not, that we are deified with God, or christified with Christ, or one <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Person with him, as if he had a superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Nature, which was a sort of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Soul, or that our distinct Personality shall ever cease; with other Notions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of God's Government, and of all Judgment. Beware of confounding God and the Creature, or making Christ the Subject of our Graces, because he is the Author of them.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But you said in the <hi>Errour,</hi> that Men are said to receive Christ against their VVills. <hi>A.</hi> The Doctor tells us, <hi>Our first receiving of Christ, is when Christ comes by the Gift of the Father, to a Person while he is in the Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his own Heart, and the Father doth force open the Spirit of that Person, and pours in his Son in spight of the Receiver,</hi> P. 99. In <hi>P.</hi> 98. <hi>It's as a Physician poureth Physick down the Patient's Throat, and so it works against his Will.</hi> And tells us, <hi>P.</hi> 612. <hi>Our first coming to Christ, is as a Coach is said to come to Town, when it is but drawn to Town.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall make no further Remark on this, than tell thee, the Doctor distinguisheth not between what we are abstracted from the Spirit's Influence, and what we are by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's Influence. VVe are passive in effectual Vocation, as that is God's Act on us; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then no Violence is offered to the VVill, for the Mind dictates what it chooseth freely Under this healing VVork and that passiveness, is not our coming to Christ; but by the Effect of God's Act on the Mind and VVill, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Call, and that is our first coming, and thereby we <hi>receive</hi> Christ, and not before. He is not forced on us, but accepted from a Light that commends, and a VVill that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires him. VVhereas we come not a step, whiles we do refuse and reject him. Though I wonder why he speaks of any first coming against our VVills, when his Principle is, that we are united to Christ at latest, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conception in the VVomb.</p>

                  <hi>TRUTH.</hi> I Have spoken of <hi>Justifying Righteousness,</hi> chap. 7.</p>
               <p>Though Faith be no way a Meritorious Cause of a Sinner's Justification, yet God hath promised to Justifie all such as truly Believe; and requires Faith, as an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Qualification in all whom he will Justifie for Christ's Merits; declaring, That Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief shall not only hinder Mens knowing that they are Justified, but that it is a bar to any Person's being Justified while he continues an Unbeliever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Note, 1. There is a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for which a Man is Justified: This is only Christ's Righteousness: This is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promise, and the Merit of the Blessing promised: Nothing can add to it, or mingle with it; it's sufficient, and alone sufficient to satisfie Justice, atone for Guilt, and merit Acceptance and Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's to be considered, what the Condition of the Person is whom this Mercy is promised to. He is one that hath this Grace of true Faith, and exerts it into Act. This Grace is also required and commanded as indispensibly necessary to the Participation of Forgiveness. Christ's Righteousness shall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41167:59"/>
not be imputed to this use, unless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: And nothing shall hinder our Title to this Benefit, if we do believe in Christ; for the Promise is inviolable. And this Faith being a Conformity to the Rule of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, some call it a <hi>Subordinate</hi> Righteousness; not meaning any Righteousness <hi>for</hi> which Sin is forgiven, for it's Christ's Righteousness alone for which God Justifies us; but it's our answering that Rule by which Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth his Righteousness for our Remission, and a Right to Life; and his Promise is the Ground of our Title.</p>
               <p>Having premised these things for Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Truth, I proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ERROUR.</hi> The whole use of Faith in Justification, is only to manifest that we were Justified before; and Faith is no way necessary to bring a Sinner into a Justified State, nor at all useful to that End.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Proved that this is the Dr's. Opinion.</head>
                  <p>The Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 85. puts this Objection; <hi>Is not Believing required to the Justification of the Ungodly?</hi> Answ. <hi>An ungodly Person, after he is Justified, doth Believe. But you will say, It is an Act of Christ by Faith.</hi> Ans. <hi>Then Christ doth not Justifie alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay, I say more; Christ doth Justifie a Person before he Believes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He cannot believe that which is not; and if he be not Justified before he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it, he believeth that which is false; but he is first Justified before he Believes, then he believes that he is Justified.</hi> The Doctor then asks, <hi>But what doth Faith serve for?</hi> He
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41167:60"/>
answers, <hi>It serves for the Manifestation of that Justification which Christ put upon a Person by himself alone.</hi> P. 86. <hi>We do not Believe, that we</hi> may be <hi>Justified, but because we</hi> are <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</hi> P. 578. <hi>God doth add never a tittle of Pardon it self more to him that is a Believer, than to that Person not yet converted to the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. P. 597. <hi>I say, Faith, as it takes hold of Christ's Righteousness, it doth not bring this Righteousness of Christ to the Soul, but doth only declare the Presence of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness that was there even before Faith was.</hi> He in that Page denies Faith to be so much as an <hi>Instrumental</hi> Cause of Justification. In very many places he declares, We are not Virtually, but <hi>Actually</hi> Justified before Faith. If thou ask <hi>when</hi> he thinks the Elect are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. The Doctor tells us, <hi>It's from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, at Christ's death; and the latest time, is, before we are born.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 101, 255, 361, 362, 616, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See more, <hi>ch.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 11.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not: Whether Faith, or any Grace, be a jot of the meriting Righteousness for which we are Justified? 2. Nor, Whether Faith, or any Grace, add any thing to the Value of Christ's Merits? These I deny; yea, I add, That if Christ's Righteousness could be applied for Pardon to the vilest Sinner before he Believes, it would Justifie him; but God hath declared it shall not be applied to Unbelievers. 3. Nor, Whether we are Justified the same moment as we truly Believe in Christ, and the Blessing is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41167:60"/>
not suspended for any time longer? This I affirm, because God Justifies us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as his Instrument; and this Promise declares that he will Justifie him that Believes: It's a Christ truly Believed in, doth Justifie us; and a Christ so Believed on, cannot but Justifie us. 4. Nor, Whether an elect Person once Justified, shall by Christ's care be kept in a Justified state? 5. Nor, Whether God hath decreed, That the Elect shall certainly Believe, and so be Justified? 6. Nor, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther True Faith be an Infallible Sign of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? These four last I do affirm.</p>

Whether the Use of Faith in Justification be only to manifest our Justification, which we personally had before? This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; and add, That Faith Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies us by receiving Christ, and therein answers the Ordination of God, who hath promised to Justifie the Believer by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Christ's Righteousness in this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Effect of it upon the guilty Soul.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

To be Justified, was a Benefit which <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Converts, had an Eye to in Believing. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>We have believed, That we may be justified by the faith of Christ.</hi> The Blessing of Justification is limited to a Believer, and extended to such by such conditional and indefinite Clauses as these: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24.

What a gross Notion would it create, That Faith should be required by God, in order to a Benefit, and this Faith acted by the guidance of the Spirit, as a Means to partake of that Benefit, and this Benefit proposed and limited to all under an express respect to that Faith; and yet that Benefit is ours before Faith hath a Being?</p>

3. The Gospel denounceth and declareth All <hi>Condemned,</hi> till they do Believe: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares they are so, and denounceth they <hi>shall</hi> be so: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. He that believeth not on the Son, <hi>shall not see life;</hi> but the wrath of God <hi>abideth on him.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 18. He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is <hi>condemned already.</hi> Here's the Case of all Men by the Fall; They are <hi>Condemned,</hi> and under <hi>Wrath.</hi> Here's the way of Relief; A Christ <hi>believed on:</hi> And they that believe, their Condemnation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd. Here's the Case of every Man that believeth not; <hi>Wrath abideth on him:</hi> The Condemning Sentence remains, and Men are distributed into Condemned, or Justified; and this <hi>as</hi> Believers, or Unbelievers. Oh! that any can think, all this Wrath that abides, is no more than want of an Assurance that we are Justified! Sure it's more danger! <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>If you believe not, you shall die in your sins.</hi> Mark 16. 18. <hi>He that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> Then they must be liable to Damnation whilst in Unbelief, or they could not be Damned for Unbelief. To be Condemned and Justified are Opposites; at once none can be both: Nor can God Justifie a Man whom he then and still Condemns.</p>

They could not enter, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Unbelief.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 4, 6, 7. And if Unbelief did not obstruct Life, and a Right

                  </p>
                  <p>How easily might I argue this Point, from the Nature of Justification, as it's a judicial Act of God, by a Gospel-Rule supposing Christ's Satisfaction? As also, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Effects of Justification, which are all suspended as to Unbelievers: God in all his Carriage not executing the Justifying Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on them, but the contrary; he leaves them many years Slaves to Sin and Satan, void of his Spirit, admitting them to no Communion with him, rejecting their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, barring them from his Table, suffering them to blaspheme and dishonour him; he suffers them to remain Curses and Plagues to other Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth God deal thus with the <hi>Justified?</hi> What short of Hell is the Execution of the Curse, if these be not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> I leave it to thy self to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all these things make Faith of no more use, than to shew us the goodness of our state; which we were as much possessed of before, only we did not know it? Is that all the change on believing, which such great Expressions import? Is our being <hi>now</hi> washed and justified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. no more than we now know it? Is <hi>Assurance</hi> all the motive we can <hi>honestly</hi> use with Sinners to believe? Or the <hi>want</hi> of it, all the Danger we have to threaten them with, to any <hi>beneficial</hi> purpose, against their abiding in Unbelief?</p>

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because God Justifies the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> that is, the Man who the moment before he believed to Justification was ungodly; yea, and who still remains ungodly in the Eye of the Law of Works, needing daily Forgiveness by Grace; therefore God Justifies him who continueth wholly ungodly fifty years after. Because Christ <hi>alone</hi> Justifies, as he whose Satisfaction and Merits are the only Righteousness <hi>for</hi> which we are Justified; therefore he thinks there is nothing else present in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not considering that God Justifies, the Spirit Justifies, the Gospel-Promise Justifieth, in sences distinct from Christ: And so doth Faith, though not as what meriteth, yet as what the Promise <hi>requireth</hi> in all whom God will Justifie for the sake of Christ's Merits. Because it's Christ, the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; therefore Faith in that <hi>Object</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to Justification; though it's as plain as the Word of God can speak, it's a Christ <hi>believed on</hi> which Justifies: It's not Faith, without a Christ, can do it; and Christ, without Faith, will not do it; but on our Believing, he will not fail to do it. Because we must, in order to <hi>Assurance</hi> of Pardon, believe our Sins are actually pardoned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our actual Pardon is the Object of the Faith by which we obtain Pardon; and so <hi>he</hi> sets our Pardon, instead of God, Christ, and the Gospel-Promises, which are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Objects of Justifying Faith. Because Faith is the <hi>Evidence</hi> of Invisible Realities
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41167:63"/>
still remaining Invisible; therefore it's whole Use is, to manifest our Pardon before our Pardon hath a Being.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>The Doctor lays great stress on</hi> Ezek. 16. 6, &amp;c. <hi>and very often builds this and other of his Opinions upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> He doth so, and without the least Ground. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chapter doth not describe the Dealings of God with a particular Soul, in order to Salvation; but with <hi>Israel,</hi> as a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Body, in a <hi>peculiar</hi> Covenant. It shews how mean and idolatrous their Original was; how graciously God singled them out, and dignified them above the rest of the World by many Privileges; and among the rest, by making a Covenant of Peculiarity with them. But this Covenant is not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Eternal Life: For <hi>ver.</hi> 59. it was a <hi>Covenant they broke:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 61, 62. it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Thy</hi> Covenant, as opposed to <hi>My</hi> Covenant. Dare any Man say that all the Jews were Washed, Quickned, Justified? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet each of these were true of the whole Body in this Chapter.

2. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a Grace to which Pardon is <hi>promised;</hi> and upon the working of it, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness is <hi>given:</hi> And Impenitency <hi>continues</hi> Guilt where-ever it reigns. How much of the Bible must I transcribe, if I quote all places that prove these? <hi>Ez.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4.

Christ was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, <hi>to give Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Remission of Sins, Act.</hi> 5. 31. Nay the Sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable; because it's impossible to bring the Committer of it to <hi>repentance, Heb.</hi> 6. 16. Are all these things consistent with Pardon before Repentance? Can I be subject to perish and pardoned at once? Can God command Repentanee, under a Promise of Pardon, and yet suppose I must be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned before? Is the turning of the Heart from the power of Satan to God, urged and directed to this end, that <hi>I may receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,</hi> and none follow my turning, but all be before it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There's no Saving Faith that includes not this purpose in it: Can I fiducially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Christ, and not intend to leave my wickedness? Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> well proves, <q>That Justifying Faith cannot be, without a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart to obey God in all things.</q> 
                     <hi>(Treat. of Justif. p.</hi> 40.) And adds <q>Neither is it possible that there should be <hi>any</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this Faith, but where the Mind is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41167:66"/>
prepared, disposed and determined unto universal Obedience.</q> See the <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> Account of <hi>Saving Faith, ch.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Without this Purpose, we do not accept of Christ as the <hi>Way</hi> to God. It would be strange, that the great Term of Life should terminate in Christ, who is the <hi>Means,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to God, who is the <hi>End:</hi> Whereas Christ is able to save such as come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and others he will not save, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 21. God was not thus over-looked when <hi>Paul</hi> testified Repentance towards God, and Faith towards Christ. And indeed, without this purpose, the Soul never answers God's Call; and so must be Pardoned before effectually Called.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We cannot receive Christ as King, without this Repentance of Heart. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as King, is to renounce all Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and resolve Obedience to his Will: And we must receive him as King, or Lord, or it is not the Christ we so receive: <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. As you have received <hi>Christ Jesus, the Lord.</hi> God gives him, a <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Commander, Isa.</hi> 55. 4. And so must we take him, or never hope for Forgiveness by him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Without this purpose of Heart, no Man accepts of Christ for Sanctification. The <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> tell us, <hi>Conf. chap.</hi> 14. <hi>a.</hi> 2. <hi>That Saving Faith accepts of Christ for Sanctification.</hi> I am sure, God gives Christ <hi>to bless you, in turning every one of you from his iniquities,</hi> Act. 3. 26. And can that Soul believe to Forgiveness, that thus receives him not? Or can any one thus
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41167:66"/>
receive him, who intends not to turn from Sin to Holiness?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A resolved purpose to continue in Sin and Rebellion against God, is <hi>Damning,</hi> let Men pretend what they please. I hope I need not prove, but one of these Purposes must have place in every Heart, when it is dealing with Christ about Salvation. And I think I have proved, That a Resolution to continue Rebels, will bar any Man from a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing of Christ. See <hi>chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It's not to be allowed, that it should not be necessary to renounce our Sins with our Hearts, in order to Pardon; when it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to renounce our own Merits, or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Is the one opposite to Christ, and is not the other so? Will one make us backward to accept of Christ, and will not the other do the same? Is the one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with a true Approbation of a Saviour? The other is no less: For Christ is to save from the <hi>Power</hi> of Sin, as well as the Guilt; and he that submits not to him with a desire of both, duely accepts him for neither.</p>
                  <p>I might further evidence this from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary fitness of Repentance for Pardon. It is very unsuitable to the Nature and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to pardon a Sinner that resolves to rebel, and not to return: This seems too low a Provision for his Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, it would render our Faith a meer selfish thing; and all our Compliance, to be a meer concern for our own <hi>Impunity;</hi> whiles Sin is still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and God's Dominion rejected, and Christ's Design of restoring the Image of God,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41167:67"/>
slighted and opposed. It were easie to shew, that Repentance and Faith are so near to, and inclusive of each other, that one is put for the other; and the Call to one, is a Call to each.</p>

without this in the order of the Gospel, an Interest in it, <hi>(i. e.</hi> Christ's Righteousness,) is not to be attained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again; Justifying Faith includeth in its Nature the entire Principle of Evangelical Repentance; so that it is utterly impossible that a Man should be a true Believer, and not <hi>at the same instant of time</hi> be truly Penitent: And therefore are they so frequently joyned in Scripture, as <hi>one simultaneous</hi> Duty: Yea, the Call of the Gospel unto Repentance, is a Call to Faith, acting it self by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then tells us, The First Act of Faith respecting the Grace of God in Christ, is not conceived in order of time to precede its actings in Self-displicency, Godly Sorrow, and Universal Conversion from Sin to God.</q> See <hi>p.</hi> 300, 301. These things Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> asserts, though he ascribes no Causality of Pardon to Repentance: Which will offend none who deny any Grace in Man to be a Cause of Forgiveness; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I own my self.

If we do it for our selves, we do but labour in vain; if a Man will run a hundred Miles for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if that Money be proffered to him before he step out of his House, at his Door, his Journey is in vain, seeing he might have had it before he stept out of Door,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Christ comes and brings Justification, loving Kindness and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he lays them down, presents them, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them to the Heart; when we are ungodly, he enters into Covenant, that we should become</hi>

It is a received Conceit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Persons, that our Obedience is the Way to Heaven; and though it be not, say they, the Cause of our Reign, yet it is the Way to the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. This he disapproves, saying, <hi>I must tell you, all this Sanctification of Life, is not a jot the Way of that justified Person unto Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Truth is, since Redemption is managed by Christ, the Lord hath pointed out other Ends and Purposes for our Obedience, than Salvation.

But he tells us in that Page, though these be done by <hi>Persons being in Christ,</hi> though thus <hi>assisted by Christ's Spirit,</hi> though <hi>Christ be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely owned as the Author of such Assistance, the Righteousness so assisted hath no efficacy at all, to obtain any thing of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So P. 425, 426, 124, 125, 24. His common Phrase is, <hi>We must not work for Life, but from Life. Obj.</hi> But we may suppose the Doctor saith this only of external Duties, but not of the Actings of Grace. <hi>Answ.</hi> No, I could shew you how he saith the same of all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but it's enough to instance in that of <hi>Faith.</hi> P. 326. <hi>That is the proper Work that God hath given to Believing, not to effect any thing to the Good of a Man, but only to be the Witness of that Good to the Spirit of a Man,</hi>

                     <hi>and so give light to that which was hidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Obj.</hi> But is not God pleased with us the more for Grace, <hi>&amp;c. A.</hi> The Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, P. 429. <hi>If you have more Ability than others in doing, let it not come into your Thoughts, as an Inducement to think better of your selves, as if you were more accepted of God, or pleasing in his Sight.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not whether God hath decreed that the Elect shall be holy and obedient, and so partake of saving Blessings. 2.

                  <head>The Truth confirmed.</head>
                  <p>The Points are too many to admit En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and most of them carry that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the whole Scope of the Bible must be forgotten, when they are denied. Can two or three wrested Texts overturn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Language of the Scriptures? And is it not strange, that all Religion, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature it self in a State of Trial, should be so fully struck at, from a gross Conceit, that the infinite God cannot foresee, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Events, unless it must null his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over reasonable Subjects, and prevent his Distribution of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by a stated Rule? What a Reflexion is it on the Divine Wisdom, and the glorious Platform of the Redeemer's Work and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he cannot purchase Benefits for Sinners, unless he forbear to use them as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Obedience? Yea, The whole of his serious Pleadings with Men, must be a Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, rather than he must be allowed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his Blessings in a <hi>rectoral</hi> way. He shall <hi>merit</hi> nothing as a <hi>Priest,</hi> if he <hi>dispense</hi> it as a <hi>King,</hi> nor be estemed to enable Sinners to act, if he appoint them any thing to do, in order to a Reward.</p>
                  <p>Having occasion to mention some Words, which I would prevent thy Mistake of, know, that by <hi>Holiness,</hi> I mean the inward Renovation, and Devotedness of the Soul to God, with the Expression thereof in holy Actings. By <hi>Good Works,</hi> I mean all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actings of Grace in a sincere Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41167:72"/>
to the Will of God, as our loving God, our fearing God, trusting in Christ, godly Purposes and Resolves, &amp;c. These are good Works, called <hi>internal.</hi> There be also <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> good Works, as Praying, Hearing, exact Walking, Alms-deeds, and any other Act of Obedience directed by the Word, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Faith, and a renewed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and intended to glorifie God and save our Souls. By <hi>Doing,</hi> the same Actings are intended, and so loving God is Doing; yea, <hi>Believing</hi> in Christ is Doing; it is an Action on our Part, even when it accepts of Christ; though it is by Divine Ordination made the effectual Means of Receiving, or partaking of a promised Christ.</p>
                  <p>Having premised these things, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Proof of the Truth, which is comprehended under these Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinners have much to do, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> There be few Leaves in the Bible but argue this: It's the Scope of all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God to Men since the Fall. It's true, we have nothing to do in a way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or Purchace; but it is as true, we have much to do in order to our Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what Christ hath purchased: We must <hi>repent,</hi> that our Sins may be blotted out, <hi>Act,</hi> 3. 19. We must believe, that we may be saved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Lord is express, if you know these things, <hi>happy are you if you do them,</hi> Joh. 13. 17. All Gospel-discoveries are made known for the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16. 26. And Christ will take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41167:73"/>
on all them who <hi>obey</hi> not the Gospel; neither Christ nor Gospel will secure them, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8. The Revelations of God to Men, are not a bare <hi>Description</hi> of Duty and Benefits, but an Injunction of Duty in a <hi>Connexion</hi> with Benefits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>If thou confess</hi> with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus, and <hi>believe</hi> with thy Heart, thou <hi>shalt be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> 2. I could shew, there's no <hi>one</hi> saving Benefit granted to a Sinner, but on supposition of his Doing: See much of this <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 21, 22. Christ never intended the Application of his Merits for our <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> without ordering them as Motives to Duty on our Part. 3. The Influences of the Spirit of God, and God's Institutions, have no Causality in our Salvation, if Men have nothing to do in order to be saved. It's plain, that Salvation is ascribed to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and also to the Means of Grace: Neither of them are the Atonement or Price of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore they must save as they operate on the Soul in order to its Actings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And this must be, as it answers the way appointed for our Participation of Life. 4. On what account is it said, that we <hi>believe to the saving of our Souls?</hi> Heb. 10. 39. and <hi>Repentance to Salvation</hi> is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. What Sence can be affixed to these and the like Phrases, as they are opposed to their Contraries as destructive, if Men do nothing towards their Salvation? See <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Can Faith save him:</hi> Yea, and I may ask, 5. What meaneth the Holy Ghost, when he saith, <hi>In</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:41167:73"/>
                     <hi>so doing, thou shalt save thy self, and them that hear thee?</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. Sure the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is not strong, if it be true, we can do nothing for Salvation. 6. The Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners, under the Gospel, is still laid on <hi>not Doing;</hi> they are condemned by the Law, but they <hi>remain</hi> condemned, and their Ruine is fixed (and so they are <hi>twice dead)</hi> for want of doing somewhat. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that you might have Life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40. How oft is the Ruine of Souls laid on not Turning, not Repenting? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. If Men have nothing to do for Salvation, then Christ hath no <hi>Rule</hi> to judge them who lived under the Gospel. I hope none will say, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Sentence will pass on Men as elected, or <hi>not</hi> elected. Doth it agree to the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Tribunal at that Day, to say, Thou shalt be damned, <hi>because</hi> thou wert not elected? Is this the Account the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives? Doth it not proceed on the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Mens Carriage and Tempers? See the Parable of the <hi>Talents:</hi> They who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Talents were saved; he that hid it in a Napkin, was <hi>therefore</hi> damned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 21, 24, 28. Consider any Description of the last Day, and you'll find, God saves and damns with a Respect to Mens Neglects and Compliance with his Gospel. 8. I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily demonstrate, that if Men have nothing to do in order to Salvation, the Ministery of Christ and his Apostles, the Ministery most apt and most blessed to Souls to this very day, is all a Vanity and Falshood; they are cold Pleadings with Sinners, that are not backed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41167:74"/>
with Life and Death: Remove saving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and undoing Dangers, from being Arguments to Compliance with the Will of Christ; and any Man may read the Success of such a Ministery, and to use these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to persuade Men to repent and believe, if we have nothing to do for Heaven, is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest <hi>Falshood</hi> and Trifling. It's awful to consider, how inconsistent some Mens <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is with their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> though it's well their <hi>Uses</hi> to the Unconverted have so much Truth in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>True Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works, and Perseverance, are the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and so necessary to the Salvation of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that without them he cannot be saved, and continuing in them he shall be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This might be evidenced by many Reasons, 1. It is not saving Faith which is not opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to these Effects. It ceaseth to be <hi>true,</hi> whenever it wholly fails of <hi>purifying the Heart, and working by Love.</hi> Many affirm, That all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are seminally in Faith as in their Principle. Such must grant, that as Faith justifies us at first in receiving, and relying on Christ; so it continues to justifie us by continuing those Acts, and exerting it self in those other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which are essential to its Nature. And thus some expound <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 20, 24. 2. Obedience, good Works, and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>preserve</hi> us from those <hi>contrary Evils,</hi> which do subject Men to Condemnation: <hi>I keep my Body under, least by any Means, when I have preached to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others, I my self be a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 27. I shall add to this in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41167:74"/>
some following Heads. 3. The Gospel-Constitution doth by its Promises and Threatnings make Persevering Holiness, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or Good Works the <hi>necessary way</hi> to Heaven. These are not only a Natural, but a Moral meetness for Heaven. That this Point may be clear, I shall, 1. Shew that the Gospel-Constitution contains Promises and Threatnings, which affect all of us, as a Rule of Happiness and Misery; it's so to the Elect; yea, Believers, as well as others. 2. That by this Constitution, Persevering Holiness, Sincere Obedience, or Good Works, are necessary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Gospel-Constitution contains Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Threatnings, which affect all of us, as a Rule of Happiness and Misery: By these God governs Men; and Mens Hopes or Fears should be directed by these, as their Rule. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> not observing this, hath run into those Mistakes which open a door to all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness, though he intended it not: His whole Scheme implies, That Christ doth not distribute Blessings or Punishments by any Rule that referrs to the Actings of Men. I have proved the contrary, <hi>chap.</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if the Covenant of Grace be Conditional, and Faith and Repentance are Necessary to Forgiveness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Substance of this must be granted. But I add a few Reasons more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Most of the Promises and Threatnings in the Bible, that referr to the State of Souls, are <hi>Evangelical</hi> Promises and Threats: They
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41167:75"/>
are not the Sanction of the Law of Innocence, but of Gospel-Grace. Who can doubt this, if they consider, 1. That the Covenant of Innocency promised Life to nothing below <hi>sinless</hi> and <hi>perfect Obedience.</hi> 2. The Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Covenant of Innocency admitted no <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>After-Relief</hi> to the <hi>Guilty:</hi> They did fix the Curse irrevocably, in case of any Transgression. 3. No Overture of Life, or Door of Hope, or Argument to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with Hopes of Acceptance, could be framed out of those legal Threats or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to any Man that is a Sinner. <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye; why will you die?</hi> was not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that Covenant: No, if a Man is once a Sinner, the Law could speak no lower than this, Thou art undone, whether thou turn <hi>or no.</hi> Things being thus, I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to consider all the <hi>Calls</hi> of God in Christ to Men since the Fall: VVeigh the Promises and Threats wherewith God strengthneth those Calls: See if any one of the Calls to Faith, or Repentance, or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thus back'd with Promises and Threats, be not Evangelical. 1. Doth God, in those Calls, promise Life to nothing below sinless, perfect Obedience? Or doth he threaten Eternal Death, in those Calls, against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is short of perfect Obedience? 2. Do the Threats annexed to those Calls, exclude all after-Repentance? See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. Is that Gospel or no; <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he shall surely live; his transgressions shall not be mentioned?</hi> 3. Are not these Calls, with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41167:75"/>
the Promises and Threats directed to <hi>Sinners,</hi> for their <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Recovery?</hi> Is it not to Sinners God speaks in them? and is it not for their healing and Salvation? Are not the Promises an <hi>Offer</hi> of Relief? Are not the Threatnings intended to <hi>awe</hi> and <hi>warn</hi> Sinners against Refusal of these Offers? They be not uttered, to bind the Curse; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from it, by urging our Compliance with the Commands of a Redeemer: <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8. &amp; 4. 7. Every Threatning used by God as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Conversion, is a Gospel-Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What kind of Government can Men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to Christ, if there be no Sanction to his Precepts? Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> oft tells us, That the Sanction of the <hi>Law of Works</hi> is <hi>removed;</hi> the Curse is gone, as to the Elect. This is true, if he mean, that sinless Obedience is not now the Way of Life; and that all below it, shall not bind Death upon us so as to hinder our Relief by the Gospel. But what then, hath the Redeemer no Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to rule Men by? And is their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Disobedience an indifferent thing, as to their Happiness or Misery? Must he save all, or damn all, or else be a <hi>Respecter of Persons</hi> in his judicial Distributions? Is this the Language of God to Sinners since the Fall? Did Christ preach at this rate, when on Earth? Or doth he so speak now from Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh; for if they escaped not,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41167:76"/>
                     <hi>who refused him that spake on earth; much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven?</hi> Heb. 2. 3. <hi>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. Our Lord assures us, Mens Sins are aggravated, and their Damnation grows greater, by a Rejection of his Call to Sinners, through Impenitence and Unbelief. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>Ye shall die in your sins.</hi> Heb. 10. 29. <hi>Of how much sorer punishment,</hi> &amp;c. It's a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Dominion that Christ exerciseth, if he hath neither Rewards nor Punishments to induce Mens regards to his Authority. Read the Scriptures, or wait the Judgment-day, and you'll find it otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How unsuitable is it to the present state of Mankind, that Christ should govern us without Promises and Threatnings? He is a King, and we are his Subjects. And we are, 1. Subjects in a state of <hi>Tryal</hi> for another World. 2. We have great <hi>remains</hi> of Sin within us, and Temptations without us. 3. We have still in our Nature <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> which are the things which all the methods of Christ's Government suppose, and are suited to: Each of these would furnish me with Arguments beyond all rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for the Proof of this Point; whereas the opposite Errour implies, That either Men are Machines, or Brutes, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants at best; or else the Judgment-day is past already: Yea, how vain are the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulations, Warnings, Reproofs and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which the Word is filled with?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41167:76"/>
The Divine Being, and all the Methods of Grace, are strangely exposed by Conceits so sordid. He calls us to <hi>fear, lest we should seem to come short of the Promise,</hi> Heb. 4. 1. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. <hi>Work out your salvation with trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>He that ploweth, should plow in hope,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 10. <hi>We are saved by hope,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 24. What are all these, if our state be in no suspence as to what we shall be or do?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I hope I need not prove that these Gospel-Promises and Threatnings are the Rule by which Christ dealeth with Men: To doubt it, would inferr a heavier Charge than any good Man would sustain: It's enough to calm us, that he saith, <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God is not mocked; that which a man soweth, that shall he reap,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. This is spoken to Believers, and true of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. By this Gospel-Constitution, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works, are <hi>Necessary</hi> to Salvation. He that made Faith necessary to Justification, hath made Obedience necessary to Salvation: He hath as well promised Heaven to the Godly Man, as Pardon to the Believer: And our perseverance in Holiness and Obedience, is as truly our <hi>Way</hi> to Glory as the Scriptures can describe it: Nothing of these merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but he that merited Heaven, hath peremptorily appointed these to bring us thither: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12. For, <hi>God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41167:77"/>

4. God declares the Obedience and Works of Believers, as <hi>rewardable</hi> of Grace, through Christ. They shall walk with me in white; <hi>for they are worthy,</hi> Rev. 3. 4. Great is your <hi>Reward</hi> in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 12. If I do this willingly, I have a <hi>Reward,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. Come ye blessed of my Father, <hi>&amp;c. For</hi> I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35. It's true, it's a Reward from the Benignity of a Father, not from the Dignity of the Work: It's from the Ordination of the Promise which is owing to the Merits of a Christ, and not any Claim of the Performance. And so tender is God of the Honour of his Goodness herein, that the Second Article of our Creed must be; That he is <hi>a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

III. The <hi>Third</hi> thing I should prove, is, <hi>That many other Blessings besides mere Eternal Life, are promised to the Exercise of several Graces, and Performance of Duties.</hi> This is so easie a Task, that I would leave it to the most ignorant but to read the Bible with his own Eyes. VVhat mean such places, <hi>The effectual, fervent Prayer of a righteous man availeth much?</hi> Jam. 5. 16. VVill no Prayer, or cold Prayer, avail as much? <hi>If these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull in the knowledge of Christ?</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 8. VVill the want, or scanty degrees of Grace, do the same? So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. <hi>Give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make your calling and election sure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for so an entrance shall be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of Christ.</hi> May one be assured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence? Or shall we enter Heaven with the same full sail, though we be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and unassured? 2 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>He that soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully; he that soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly.</hi> But then shall we reap as liberally, if we sow not at all, or sow sparingly? VVhere shall I stop, when the Scriptures are so full of Instances? And sure I need not prove that Repentance, and earnest Prayer, contribute to preserve a Nation, when God so many times <hi>urgeth</hi> these to this end; when he hath promised and performed Deliverance hereupon; when he complains so oft, that he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy for want of these; and lays the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of places always on neglect of these

                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Men should govern their Expectations and Fears, according to the Conformity of their Hearts, and Behaviour to the Rule of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi> It's <hi>Unbelief,</hi> not to expect the Good promised, when we answer the Condition of it. It's obstinate <hi>Hardness</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> not to expect the threatned Evil, when we are guilty of the Sin or Neglect threatned. There's no grounded Hopes or Fears but this way; all else are <hi>Enthusiastick.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> of God, in these Declarations of his Will, are not otherwise complied with: God often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all Hopes, as vain, that are not thus regulated; and by this Rule the Servants of God governed themselves. I need not cite Texts for things so plain.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>God is better pleased with his People in the exercise of Grace and Holiness, than when they neglect these, and do the contrary.</hi> What Notions have Men of God, of Grace, and Sin, that they should need Proof for this?

to all <hi>pleasing,</hi> Col. 1. 10. Of the Obedience of Children, he saith, <hi>This is well-pleasing to the Lord.</hi> What great things of this Nature are spoken of Prayer, Praises, and other Good VVorks? VVhereas God is <hi>fretted, grieved, vexed; provoked to anger and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> by our Sins and Neglects. How can we apprehend, that God is as well pleased with us, when testifying our <hi>Enmity,</hi> as our <hi>Love?</hi> when <hi>rejecting</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> as <hi>doing</hi> his <hi>Will?</hi> Are the Fruits of the <hi>Spirit</hi> alike to him, as the Fruits of the <hi>Flesh?</hi> And can the Image of the Devil render us as grateful as his <hi>own</hi> Image, and the <hi>Life</hi> of his <hi>Son?</hi>

                  <p>Obj. <hi>It's for Christ's Incense these are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Ans.</hi> But Christ's Incense will not be applied to our Sins, but to our Graces and Duties; and that shews they are more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God than our Sins be. And again, They are these Graces and Duties which are accepted for the sake of Christ: His Incense will not be denied to them; and thereby they are well-pleasing to the Lord, and tend to render us so. <hi>Davenant, de Justitia Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuali,</hi> and Others, say much more.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41167:81"/>
Reasons, to prove that Grace, Holiness, and Obedience are useful to prevent Evil. I leave it to thy Experience, if thou art a good Man, and referr it to what thou wilt feel hereafter, i thou art a bad Man. If there were no more these do prevent Sin, which in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. I hope to prove is not so innocent as to do us no harm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> To summ up all, I appeal to thee, 1. Whether God doth require any more of any Sinners for Salvation, than that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, repent of Sin, persevere in true Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works internal and external; and if we do so, can we perish? hath not Christ provided all else? and doth not the Promise secure Life upon doing these? 2. If any Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, and repent not, hath Christ ever promised to save him? Will any decree, or the Merits of Christ secure him? Again, if any penitent Believer shall apostatize, prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and unfruitful, hate God, or neglect to love God and his Neighbour <hi>wholly,</hi> &amp;c. Shall this Man be saved? Hath not Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the contrary? Will his first Faith save him? A Resolution of these two things, according to the very Scope of the Word, will decide the Main of this Controversie. These assert the Rule of Christ's rectoral Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Decree comes not in opposition to the Methods of his Government, by which we are to govern our Hopes and Fears.</p>

                  <p>Doctor <hi>Owen, Of Justif.</hi> P. 222. <q>We grant that, 1. God doth indispensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him (a justified Person) personal Obedience, which may be called his <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteousness.</hi> 2. That God doth approve of, and accept in Christ, his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> so performed. 3. That hereby that Faith whereby we are justified, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, proved, manifested in the <hi>Sight of God</hi> and Men. 4. That this Righteousness is <hi>pleadable</hi> unto an Acquitment against any Charge from Satan, the World, or our own Consciences. 5. That <hi>upon</hi> it, we shall be declared righteous at the last Day; and <hi>without</hi> it, none shall be. And if any shall think meet, from hence to conclude
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41167:83"/>
unto an Evangelical <hi>Justification,</hi> or call God's Acceptance of our Righteousness by that Name, I shall by no means contend with them. Where-ever this Enquiry is made not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but how a Man that professeth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Faith in Christ shall be <hi>tried, judged,</hi> and whereon, as such, he shall be justified: We grant, that it is, and must be by his <hi>own personal, sincere Obedience. P.</hi> 156. It is commonly said, Faith and new Obedience are the Condition of the new Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If no more be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that God, in, and by the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, doth indispensibly require these things of us, in order to his own Glory, and our full <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of it; it is unquestionably true. <hi>P.</hi> 158. our whole Obedience, through his gracious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, hath a <hi>rewardable Condecency,</hi> with respect unto eternal Life. <hi>P.</hi> 207. These Duties are so far necessary unto the Continuation of our Justification, as that a justified State <hi>cannot</hi> consist with the Sins and Vices that are opposite unto them. So the Apostle affirms, If we live after the Flesh, we shall die. <hi>P.</hi> 208. If this be that which is intended in this Position, That our own Obedience and good Works are the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Continuation of our Justification; namely, that God doth <hi>indispensibly</hi> require good Works and Obedience in all that are justified; so that a justified State is <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with the Neglect of them, it is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted.</q>

                  <p>What I have recited of the Doctor's in the last Chapter, will spare much Labour here. I will add a few Words, <hi>P.</hi> 150. <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing you can do, from whence you ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Gain unto your selves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us, that we should not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live to our selves, but to him that died for us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Scripture is plentiful in this, that no Believer, for whom Christ died, should have the least Thought in his Heart of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or advancing himself, or any End of his own, by doing what he doth. Obj.</hi> But sure he intends only to exclude a Design of Meriting, or setting up our own Profit in opposition to God's Glory. <hi>A.</hi> No: He intends to forbid our intending our own Good, though in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to Gods Glory, and the laying no stress of meriting. For he saith, <hi>People may think here's a marvellous Discouragement to Persons, to do what God calls them to do, when they shall have nothing for it.</hi> I Answer, <hi>When there is a Spirit of Ingenuity, they shall be as industrious to glorifie God, and to do good to Men, as if they did it for themselves. They shall do as much for Good already bestowed, as if they were to procure it by their own Doing.</hi> Now you cannot suppose, Men can merit God's Glory by what they do: And he argues, that it is dis-ingenuous and vain, to intend our own Good at all. Saith he, <hi>There is no Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, because you cannot propound to your selves any possible Gain; but whatever is a Spur, or Encouragement to Duty, is already</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:41167:85"/>
                     <hi>freely and graciously provided to your Hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When you fall on Humiliation, Prayer, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, What do you look for?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saith one, I get this by it, Prevention of many great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hanging over my Head, Another saith, Peace of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, Assurance of Pardon of Sin; these things would I get by attending on Ordinances, by serving God Day and Night, in that way he calls me out unto. I tell you plainly, there's none of all these things that conduce a jot towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of any of these Ends you propose to your selves.</hi> P. 149. <hi>The World is grown to a miserable pass, that Obedience, Zeal, and Seeking after God, must be of no use at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Man himself be a Gainer by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I say, except you will fall upon the Performance of Duties for the common Good and Benefit, without having any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, as what shall accrew to you thereby, you are not Persons yet come to have that common Spirit, and dead to the old Spirit, as becomes Christians.</hi> P. 425. <hi>When you labour by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and seeking the Lord, to prevail with God to take away his Displeasure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to procure such Good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>you serve not God now, you serve your selves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Wherein the Difference is not.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not whether we should principally aim at God's Glory in all we do. 2. Nor whether we should aim at a publick Good with great Concern. 3. Nor whether Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God deserves our utmost Service, and Love to him, should influence our Aims and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41167:85"/>
Labours. 4. Nor whether we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce every Thought of purchasing from God, any Benefit for what we do. 5. Nor whether Carnal Selfishness, or seeking Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Riches, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above spiritual and eternal Good, be the undoing Sin of the World. All these I affirm.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Wherein the Real Difference is.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether the spiritual Improving, and saving our Souls, may be a Motive with us to our Religious Duties and Endeavours. This the Doctor denies and I affirm. 2. Whether our Souls Advantage be not so joyned with God's Glory, that we ought to intend them both, as the Scope of our Life and Labours.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I have in the last Chapter, proved that our Graces and Duties do benefit us, and God hath appointed them to this End, that thereby we may obtain those Benefits; if so, we then despise God's Ordination, in not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our obtaining the Benefits, when we act those Graces and Duties; and we obey his Will in doing them for that end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All Promises and Threats in the Word, directed as Motives to Obedience are foolish, if we must not intend our own Good by our Obedience. How are they Arguments with the Will, to perswade from our own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? if we must not aim at that Advantage in doing the Duty, I am perswaded to there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: When Christ saith, <hi>Come to me and I will give you Rest,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. Must not I intend that Rest in coming to him? God saith, <hi>Turn to me and live,</hi> Ezek. 18. 32. Must not I turn
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41167:86"/>
to him for Life, or frustrate his Use of that Argument? The Devil will soon prevail with us to sinful Neglects, if he can thus enervate all the Pleadings of God with Men. The best Helps which God hath contrived for our Holiness and Diligence, are rendred vain, if we must have no Eye to the Advantages he hath promised to our Duties and Obedience. How should a <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> engage Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to Faithfulness, if they must not aim at it in their Labour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 4. What Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have such Pleas? <hi>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 12. What Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is it to suffer, if I must not suffer with an Eye to that reigning? The very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bible proves this Point, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 34, 25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God approveth of holy Men's regard to their own Advantage. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. Moses <hi>had respect to the Recompence of Reward.</hi> And this is given as the very Cause why he esteemed the Reproach of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Treasures of <hi>Aegypt: For he had Respect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> governed himself by these Regards: <hi>For if I do this willingly, I have a Reward. They do it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an incoruptible,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 17, 24. That is, they are temperate, who strive for an earthly Crown; we are temperate and diligent to obtain an eternal Crown, 2 Cor. 4. 16, 17. <hi>For which cause we faint not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for our light Affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory.</hi> Were all Doing for Life,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41167:86"/>
and an Eye to gain by Service, such a legal and wicked thing, as some represent it, sure the blessed Jesus would have admonished his Disciples, and not answer them as he doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Then answered Peter, and said unto him, behold we have forsaken all, and followed thee; What shall we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And Jesus said unto them, verily,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye shall sit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Doctor's Argument from the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of proposing our own Gain by Labour and Duties, because all is fixed and given already; is to make the Decree an effectual Means to overthrow the Government of Christ, and brand all his Offers to Sinners with Weakness and Falshood. Should not poor Sinners pray as they can, abstain from Sin, consider and apply the Word with an Eye to Conversion? Why doth God call them to this? Should not they wait and strive to believe and repent, with an Eye to Forgiveness and escaping VVrath? VVhy else should God encourage them with an Offer of these upon such Terms; and tell the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that they refuse these Mercies by new Forfeitures? But by the Doctor's Scheme, the Elect may be idle, and the Non-elect do best when they despair; for there's no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between these Benefits, and these Graces or Duties. And so the Non-elect are in the same Case with Devils, there being no serious Offer to them; nay, their Case is <hi>worse than Devils,</hi> for these Offers are made to them for no other Design, but to increase
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41167:87"/>
their Condemnation. Nay, every Sin of their's, is the Sin against the Holy Ghost; that is, every Sin is alike, the <hi>Unpardonable</hi> Sin, and not only that Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. To say no more, Christ hath no Rule of distributive Justice, but his own eternal Purpose, and Men's Regards to his promised Benefits, are all forbidden, even when our Respect to them, is that which subserves his Government, and is supposed in all the Methods of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And why should we intend the Glory of God, the Service of Christ, or the Good of others? Are not these as determined as our own Good? Hath not God fixed and secured his own Glory? Doth Christ need our servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more than our selves? Shall any other Persons receive more Good than God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given and provided for them? Why should we intend these in our Duties, more than our own Profit? the very same Reason excuseth from all, and so we ought to intend nothing at all. I could shew, had I Room, that we cannot sincerely aim at our Souls good, but we therein aim at God's Glory. Nor doth God ever require us to intend his Glory, but in a Concurrence with an Eye to our own Salvation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because the Spirit of God is a <hi>Comforter;</hi> therefore he cannot comfort us, by helping us to see the VVork of his Grace, in order to Joy in his Blessings. Because the Spirit was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of Christ's <hi>Righteousness,</hi> as what alone could <hi>procure Life;</hi> therefore he tells Men that they have an <hi>Interest</hi> in it, without shewing them any change on their <hi>Hearts.</hi> Because he was to take of Christ's Fulness, and shew it to his Disciples; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he immediately speaks peace to the hearts of such as are, or at least appear his <hi>resolved Enemies.</hi> Because by the Spirit of Adoption, we cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father; therefore we need not find any love to God, to know that we are his Children. Because the Spirit witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>with</hi> our Spirits, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; therefore he witnesseth <hi>alone,</hi> without so much as revealing to our Spirits, that we have the <hi>temper</hi> of Children: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are many great Effects of the Spirit manifest on the Souls of them to whom the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11, 12, 14, 15, 16. And the design of the place, is more to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our Dignity, and free Access to God, under a Gospel-state, than mere Assurance of Forgiveness. Because a <hi>Natural Man</hi> cannot perceive the Riches of the Promise, and the Spirit enableth a <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> by his <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> to perceive the nature of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by an immediate Voice he discovers to the <hi>Natural Man</hi> his Propriety in them, even while he is and appears Natural.

                  <p n="1">1. Whether an Elect Sinner be at any time a guilty Person in God's Esteem? This the Doctor denies, and I affirm; I have proved in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 3. 7, 12. 2. Whether the Remains of Sin defile us? This I affirm, and the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies against all Protestants, who prove it of Original Sin against the Papists. 3. Whether a justified Person, falling into gross Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is defiled thereby, and contracts Guilt upon himself thereby? This the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and I do affirm. 4. Whether God esteems the repeated Abominations of Believers, not to be their own Crimes, and they not to be the Sinners, but they are Christ's Sins? This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; which I have cleared, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and 4. and 7. 5. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a justified Person, upon new Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is charged by God, and ought to charge himself as guilty and defiled, so as in God's appointed way, to repent, believe, renew his Covenant, and be earnest with God for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness? This the Doctor denies, and I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irm. 6. Whether all Sins past, present and to come, are actually pardoned at once?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41167:95"/>
This the Doctor affirms, and I deny. 7. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath required new Exercises of Faith and Repentance for their actual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? This the Doctor denies, and I affirm. 8. Whether a Believer ought to be <hi>as</hi> assured of the Forgiveness of his repeated Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, just when he hath committed them, and before he hath humbled himself, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actings of Faith on Christ, repeated his Covenant, and prayed for Pardon for Christ's Sake, as after he hath thus done?

                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p>I have said so much, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4, 8, 10, 12, 13. that tends to clear this Point, that I shall single out now only the Substance of what was least insisted on.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God doth see and charge a Believer with his new Enormities, as his Sins, and not Christ's: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Why hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord, to do this Evil in his Sight?</hi> It was an Evil, it was in God's Sight, it's charged by God on <hi>David: Psal.</hi> 90. 8. <hi>Thou hast set our Iniquities before thee.</hi> I hope <hi>Moses</hi> was not mistaken. All God's Reproofs of his People for Sin, all his Calls to Reformation from Sin, all his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against them as polluted by Sin, are so many Arguments to prove this; yea, all his Threats, all his Anger, all his Corrections witness hereto. Sure all these are not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Christ's Sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Believer ought to charge himself with his own Sins. God commands this in all the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41167:96"/>
Calls to Confession, Humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> reprove the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this? Did you ever find a Saint in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture still refuse to own his Guiltiness before God, upon his Falling into Sin: <hi>Against thee have I sinned, and done Evil in thy Sight,</hi> Psal. 51. 4. <hi>I have sinned, against Heaven, and before thee,</hi> Luk. 15. 21. Read <hi>Ezra</hi>'s, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>'s and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Confessions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. New Transgressions need renewed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and all Sins are not pardoned at once. To say nothing, how impossible it is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ would never teach his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray daily for Pardon, if they did not need it, and it could not be repeated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi> How oft do we find the Servants of God renew their Prayers for Remission? They oft beg God would <hi>blot out Sin as a Debt,</hi> Psal. 51. 9. <hi>Wash it away</hi> as a Stain, remit it as a Fault, remember it not as a Crime binding to Punishment, the Church complains we have rebelled, and thou hast not pardoned, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 42. So <hi>Job</hi> 7. 21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Humiliation, Confession, Sorrow of Heart, new Resolutions, and looking to Christ for Healing, are the Duties of Saints upon new Faults, and the Work God hath appointed them, in order to his repeated Acts of Forgiveness; though these do not forgive us, yet it's this way God declareth he will forgive, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 3. <hi>It may be, the House of Judah will hear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and return every one from his evil Way, that I may forgive their Iniquity and their Sin.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. <hi>If we confess our</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:41167:96"/>
                     <hi>Sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins.</hi> The Apostle includes himself, and calls the best a <hi>Liar</hi> that disowns his Sins, and thinks he needs no Pardon; Confession is what should be repeated as Sin returns, and this so qualifies for Pardon according to the Promise, that Forgiveness upon it is an Act of Faithfulness in God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged:</hi> VVhich the Apostle speaks to Believers guilty of undue Approaches to the Lord's Table. Read the Scriptures, and wilt thou not find Saints repenting, and acting Faith in order to Pardon, and God pressing them thereto for that very purpose, and continuing a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with them, while these are neglected? If a Man were thrice stung, must not he thrice look to the brazen Serpent for Healing? See <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer in a Type of Christ's Intercession, as it respected the Temple; there thou wilt find who were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 48, 49.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Believers ought to be more assured of Pardon, and joyful after renewed Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith; then assoon as they have grosly sinned, and before these Acts. It's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise against that wise Order which God hath stated for a due Reverence to him, and for Caution to Man, who is so prone to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>If her Father had spit in her Face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the Camp seven Days.</hi> The People of God have had those sad Fits which the Doctor condemns, and when Sin greatly breaks out, they do well become
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41167:97"/>
them. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the contrary Frame under Guilt, <hi>a being puffed up,</hi> and Calls to Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. and commends their <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Indignation, Fear, Zeal, Revenge and godly Sorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 8, 9, 11. And till there was much of this in the incestuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he was not restored: And indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering God <hi>remits or binds in Heaven,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what his Church doth justly on Earth; either the Pardon of the not repenting Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is suspended, or Censures are vain, Need I give you <hi>David's</hi> Experience? <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3, 5. <hi>When I kept Silence, my Bones waxed old, through my roaring all the Day long; for Day and Night thy Hand was heavy upon me: I acknowleged my Sin unto thee; I said, I will confess my Transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> Here's great Darkness and Trouble before Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; here's Forgiveness upon it, and it's the <hi>Iniquity of his Sin</hi> is pardoned, not the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on separated from its Filthiness: And <hi>V.</hi> 6. This Practice of his was to be a teaching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to all Saints in the like Case, <hi>For this shall every one that's godly pray unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>The Ground of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because our Sins were laid on Christ, that God might, to his Glory, forgive them in his appointed way; therefore they are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

forgiven before God forgives them in that way, or that way be complied with.

Because God commands <hi>Israel,</hi> Isa. 1. to wash and make themselves clean by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> therefore we are clean without it.

                  <hi>TRUTH.</hi> IT's true of Believers, that if Sin should have Dominion over them, they would thereby be subject to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

                  <p>P. 510, 511. <hi>They need not be afraid of their Sins, they that have God for their God; there is no Sin that ever they commit, can possibly do them any hurt: Therefore, as their Sins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt them, so there is no cause of Fear in their Sins committed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There is not one Sin, nor all the Sins together of any Believer, can possibly do that Believer any real hurt.</hi> This he attempts to prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Some will be ready to say, here is a Fear of Sin: Oh wretched Man, that I am! Who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death? But give me leave to tell you, that the Apostle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I conceive, doth personate a scrupulous Spirit, and doth not speak out his present Case,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obj.</hi> Sure the Doctor only meaneth, that Sin shall not damn them. <hi>A.</hi> Hear him putting this Case: <hi>You will say no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Hell; but yet as there are Remainders of Sin in God's own People, so there will some Evil or other fall upon the Commission of Sin.</hi> He summs up his Answer thus: <hi>Now Sin is condemned to the Believer, it can do no hurt at all to him.</hi> P. 513. <hi>Sins are but Scare-crows</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not, Whether God will preserve elect Believers from eternal Condemnation, by keeping them from the Dominion of Sin? 2. Nor whether a justified Person be freed from the Curse of the Law, or the Sanction of the Law of VVorks. 3. Nor whether a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver should fear his eternal Condemnation no farther than his Sins bring his Sincerity in question, or lead to Security or Apostacy. 4. Nor whether God may in Soveraign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, spare to execute those Rebukes, National or Personal, which a godly Man's Sins may expose him to. 5.

                  <head>The real Difference.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether, according to the Gospel-rule, if a Believer should yield up himself to the Dominion of Sin, he should perish? This I affirm, and the Doctor denies, against plain Texts directed to Believers; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. 2. VVhether a Believer, falling into such Sins, as Idolatry, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought not to awe his Soul against Security, with lively thoughts of Damnation; and if he continue long here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ought not he to suspect the State of his Soul, as in danger of Hell? This I affirm, and the Doctor denies; and thereby he renders the Gospel-threatnings, as urged by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on the Hearts of Believers, to be all foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. 3. VVhether Christ is at liberty sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to afflict a justified Person for provoking Sins, though he be secured against Soul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Judgments? This I affirm, and the Doctor denies. 4. VVhether a Believer, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into great Sins, ought to fear God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Rebukes for such Sins? This I affirm, and the Doctor denies. 5. VVhether great Offences be a real hurt to a Believer, and oft brings on him much present harm. This I affirm, and the Doctor denies. The Case of National Sins is concluded as these be, and I have elsewhere spoken to.</p>

                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p>The principal Point to be proved, is, That Sins do a Believer hurt; this will convince us of the rest, for as it brings hurt, it is the Object of Fear in all that wisely resent things. And as any threatned Affliction is caused by it, it argues a Power reserved in Christ so to threaten and afflict: both which I have proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. One would think a little Labour will serve to prove a Point, which the Feeling and Experience of all Men plead for; yet take a Hint of those Heads of Arguments which might be improved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sin it self is a great hurt to any Man guilty of it, or pestered with it: It's so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 11. Its a <hi>Wound,</hi> or we need no Healing; it's a <hi>Defilement,</hi> or we need no Washing; it's a <hi>Crime,</hi> or what's Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? it's a going <hi>astray,</hi> or where's the Use of Returning? it's a <hi>Weakness,</hi> or Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after it were needless. Is that no harm, which is a Blemish to our Natures, the Disease of our Souls, the Disorder of our State, in reference to God and our selves, as depending on him. If Sin be no harm, why should we pray against it? Why doth God so warn us still against it? Why doth Grace so oppose it? Why doth the Spirit strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it? Wherefore do we praise God for preventing it? On what Account hath God made it the Duty of Magistrates and Parents to punish for it? and of Ministers to censure the Transgressors? If it's become so innocent in his People, Why doth Christ complain so
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41167:100"/>
oft of it? Why should the Doctor tell us, we should fear it before we commit it, though not after? Why should Saints desire Heaven to be rid of Sin? Can that be a small Mischief, that dishonoureth God, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Name of Christ, grieves the Spirit, pleases the Devil, offends the Good, hardens the Wicked, puts the tender Heart on Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it in it self, yea, in others? <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 136. If Sin be no hurt, Grace and Holiness, as the Contraries to it, are not Good; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a Blessing, as a Prevention of it. Where shall I stop? Yet each of these refer to the Sins of God's own People, and some of them more affect their Sins, than the Sins of other Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There's great Hurt befalls God's People for committing Sin. Doth not God hide his Face? the Spirit abate its Influences? Is not the Conscience oft seared? the Heart oft less capable of Impressions by the VVord? the Soul streightned in Duty? great Decays in Grace and Vigour, too oft never recovered this side the Grave? Many are rendred inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Service by Reproach for Sin, or by Poverty, Diseases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVho hath not found by Sin, what he must call Hurt? VVhat Pains, Loss of Friends, Ruine on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, Blasts on Undertakings? Are VVars, Plagues, Fire, Removal of Ordinances, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, cursed Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Hurt? Sure so many will not be proselyted to this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to Transubstantiation. But what can. be offered for it? <hi>Obj.</hi> God will order all this for the good of a Believer; therefore none of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41167:101"/>
these hurt him. 1. <hi>A.</hi> I do not know where God hath promised, ThatSin shall do us good, and in its Nature it hath no aptness to Good, and the best Good it can do, is to prevent it self. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. saith, <hi>All things shall work together for good,</hi> &amp;c. But it speaks of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Christ, not Sins against him; and though God should over-master it to some Concurrence for Good, yet it were a greater Mercy to receive that same Good by other Means. 2. <hi>A.</hi> Though Sins, or corrective Afflictions may be ruled to do us good, yet that doth not hinder, but that they do us hurt. This may be evinced, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it were a greater Mercy to have that Good another way, which, but for Sin, we should not miss of: But also 1. VVhatever God threatens to inflict, that thereby he may dissuade from Sin, must needs be a Hurt or Damage. It is not a Threatning, if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no harm, and it's a Reproach to our God in his Government to think otherwise. VVhat confounding of Promises and Threats would it inferr? Doth not God intend to awe Men with some Hurt, when he saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Remember,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or I will remove thy Candlestick out of its Place;</hi> and was this no hurt when it befell them? I might instance a thousand Places of this kind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saints, with God's Approbation, bewail and deprecate Sins, and Punishments for Sins, as a real Hurt. <hi>Why hast thou hardned our Hearts from thy Fear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 17. <hi>For the Hurt of the Daughter of my People, I am black, astonishment hath taken hold on me,</hi>

Jer. 8. 21. The Book of <hi>Lamentations, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s, <hi>David</hi>'s Moans are forgotten. Read <hi>Paul</hi>s Complaints of himself and others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God himself accounts these things to hurt his People, for he calls it <hi>Patience</hi> and Long-suffering in him, to forbear inflicting them. He oft declares his <hi>Pity</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when under them, and a ceasing to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> when he inflicts them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13 4.

He oft testifieth against <hi>Insensibleness</hi> of these, as evil and afflictive things, and threatens to encrease them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a duer sence of Sin and Judgments. Sure I need not add, That Mercies opposite to these are Blessings, and promised as such; all the good in Repentance argues the Hurt we get by Sin, and by the Effects of it. If these things will not prove Sin brings hurt, we must declare <hi>Patience</hi> in Saints to be no Grace, or find a new Description of what is a <hi>Hurt</hi> in this VVorld. The Doctor indeed calls us to this when Sin is made so innocent, and present with-holdings of more Grace from us is a Mercy; as he affirms, <hi>P.</hi> 541. Let me add, that by Sin, a Saint's degrees of Glory may be diminished in another VVorld; for sowing sparingly, he shall <hi>reap sparingly,</hi> and he therefore <hi>that shall break one of the least of these Commandements, and shall teach Men so, he shall be called least in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Mat. 5. 19. <hi>That's unprofitable for you,</hi> Heb. 13. 17.</p>

Saints may fall into grievous Sins, and for a time continue therein; whereby they incurr God's Displeasure, and grieve his Holy Spirit; come to be deprived of some measure of their Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; have their Hearts hardened, and their Consciences wounded; hurt and scandalize others, and bring temporal Judgments on themselves.</q>

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because there is no <hi>Eternal</hi> Condemnation lies against a Believer; therefore there is no penal <hi>Present</hi> Affliction upon a Believer: Whereas there's much hurt below Hell; and and that it is not Hell that follows the Sin of a Believer, is not from the Innocency of Sin, but the Grace of God that brings him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Faith in Christ for Remission. Because all Sufferings <hi>for</hi> Christ work for Good; therefore all Sins <hi>against</hi> Christ can do no Harm. But allow that Sins, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Sin, were included, then thus it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth; Because God can and doth over-rule these to some good at last; therefore they do no harm in the mean while, nor in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Because a Believer is freed from the damning Curse of the Law; therefore no <hi>Gospel-</hi>Threatning of Christ can reach him.

                  <p>He affirmeth, <hi>P.</hi> 15. <hi>Except God will be offended where there is no cause to be offended, he will not be offended with Believers: For, I say, he hath no cause to be offended with the Believer; because he doth not find the Sin of the Believer to be his own Sin, but he finds it the Sin of Christ.</hi> P. 19, 10. <hi>But are not the Afflictions of Believers, for their Sins? I answer, No: Afflictions are unto Believers</hi> from <hi>Sin, not</hi> for <hi>Sin; that is, God doth not intend to punish them, as now laying on them the desert of their Sin, for that's laid upon Christ; but he doth afflict them, to preserve them from sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So God afflicting a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, hath no respect unto sin, as if he did afflict for sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I say, in respect of the sins</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not: Whether God ceaseth to love a Believer when he sinneth. 2.

Nor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God can bless the sorest Judgments for Sins, to the future good of a Believer. This I affirm; though were it not for our Sins, God would effect that Good a milder way: And I doubt whether every good Man may be said to get profit by all sorts of Affliction; for every degree of Good is not equivalent to the Hurt; and sometimes God punisheth Sin with Sin. 4. Nor, whether some sensible Calamities may fall on a good Man; not so much in a way of Rebuke for Sin, as to try

This I affirm: Yet I believe the very Martyrs did not so glory in the joyful Cause of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as always to neglect an humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on what Sin of theirs might then Justifie God, as a hidden cause of their Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> Know that there's none of all this but Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> meaneth it of the <hi>Unconverted</hi> Elect: For their Sins are on Christ, and off from themselves as much as Believers. Their Sins do them no hurt; nor is God angry with them, though God saith <hi>he is angry with the wicked every day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us consider the Points, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to Believers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I affirm, God is displeased with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, for their Abominations. If he is displeased at all with them, it must be for their Sins: And that he is displeased; yea, and chat for Sin, he oft affirms it; he forceth his People to own it, and they with bitterness bemoan and acknowlege it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 60. 1, 3. <hi>O God, thou hast cast us off! thou hast been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased! O turn thy self to us again! Thou hast</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:41167:104"/>
                     <hi>shewed thy people hard things! thou hast made us drink the wine of astonishment!</hi> 2. Sam. 11. 27. <hi>That David had done, displeased the Lord.</hi> And you may read how he threatned and punished him. Was not his <hi>Anger kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled against Moses?</hi> Exod. 4. 14. <hi>Against his People?</hi> Isa. 5. 25. &amp; 12. 11. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord was angry with me,</hi> Deut. 4. 21. <hi>The Lord was very angry with Aaron,</hi> Deut. 9. 21. Christ was oft displeased with his Disciples. How oft is God's Anger said to be provoked by his People, and kindled against them? He is said to <hi>turn away from his fierce anger:</hi> Is it not his Anger against them, which is but for a <hi>moment,</hi> and to be turned away? I hope the Doctor would own, that it never ceaseth against Sin it self. Nay his very <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> be oft mentioned against his own Servants. Read the Sixteenth of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> a Verse or two whereof is so abused by the Doctor, <hi>Thou hast fretted me in all these things,</hi> &amp;c. Cannot good Men grieve the Holy Ghost? What doth the Church intend, when she saith <hi>I    ll bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him?</hi> Mic. 7. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God doth by many Afflictions express his Displeasure against his People for their Sins. I have in the last Chapter proved, that Sins do hurt a Believer; and all there spoken, proves this, as far as the Hand of God is in our Rebukes. Besides those things, Consider, God is oft said to <hi>rebuke</hi> and <hi>chastize</hi> his People for Sin: They are not the less Chastisements of a Father, if at <hi>present</hi> grievous, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41167:105"/>
they bring forth the peaceable Fruits of Righteousness. The Great Promise of the Covenant doth not prevent this. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>If his children for sake my law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then will I visit their transgressions with a rod, and their iniquity with stripes; nevertheless, my loving-kindness will not I utterly take from them,</hi> &amp;c. Are not these Stripes for Sin? Are not these Stripes Corrections? Yea, and so much from God's Displeasure, that it is but a <hi>not utterly</hi> that God will not take <hi>away</hi> his Loving-kindness; and that it riseth no higher, is for the Covenant sake How oft doth God tell us, that he punisheth his Church, because of their Sins committed; and gives this as the <hi>Therefore?</hi> What is God's <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the transgressions of his people?</hi> Was it for an innocent thing that Christ rebuked <hi>Peter?</hi> Mark 8. 33. And was it not for luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that <hi>he rebuked</hi> and <hi>chastned</hi> those <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans</hi> whom he <hi>loved?</hi> Rev. 3. 19. Was not that for Sin, which you find, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep?</hi> What meaneth God, when he saith he'll be <hi>Sanctified</hi> in his offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children? He cannot <hi>hide his Face</hi> for Sin, nor abate his gracious Influences for Sin, and not shew Displeasure for Sin against the Offenders whom he so deserts. How wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have most pious Persons been employed, while they have humbly owned their Sins to be the cause of God's Withdraws and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, if what I assert be not a Truth? And how strange such Texts, <hi>You only have I known</hi> of all the Families of the Earth, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41167:105"/>
                     <hi>therefore</hi> I will punish you for your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. Now who dare tell God Lyes to his Face? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Because God laid on our Sins on Christ, to make Atonement for the Forgiveness of the Elect, when they repent; therefore God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offended with the Elect for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they repent. Because God doth not <hi>hate</hi> the Believer, as an <hi>unreconciled</hi> God, when he sins; therefore he is not <hi>at all</hi> displeased with him, because of the grossest Sins. Because the Refiner is not angry with his Gold (which never could offend him) when he casts it into the Fire; therefore a holy God is no way angry with rational Offenders, when he corrects them for their Reformation. Because God will not hate a Believer, so as to <hi>damn</hi> him; therefore he cannot be angry with his People, so as <hi>Fatherly to chastize</hi>

them.

It seems also that the Doctor was led into his Opinion, by not considering, that Anger or Displeasure be not Passions in God but a Will of Correcting; and are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the kinds and degrees of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

It's well if the Scriptures can escape clean, if all the Works of the Spirit are thus debased when they pass through Men. But I less wonder that Doctor <hi>Crisp</hi> should speak thus of the Righteousness of Saints, as in them; when he is so positive, that the Enemies of Christ may have Sincerity and Singleness of Heart towards God, and a constant Purpose and Inclination of Heart to the whole Will of God; and reach the very Practice of the VVill of God in universal Obedience: And that therefore none of these are a sure Sign of an Interest in Christ.

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because our Goodness extends not to God, for his <hi>profit;</hi> therefore he regards it no more than Dung and Filthiness. Because we are, after all our Obedience, <hi>unprofitable Servants</hi> to God, and less profitable Servants than we should be; therefore our Holiness is as unpleasing to him as Dung. Because God abhorred the New Moons and Sabbaths of the Hypocrites; therefore he loaths the sincere Obedience of the Upright. <hi>Obj.</hi> Doth not <hi>Israel</hi> say, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. All our Righteousnesses are as <hi>filthy Rags? Ans.</hi> But that is spoken of Persons, and not of real Holiness. It's the same as <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 4. The <hi>best</hi> of them is a Bryar. And <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>From the crown of the head, to the sole of the foot,</hi> we are putrifying Sores: Corruption had invaded the very Priests, and the generality of the best Professors, who seemed the most righteous. And that the sence of the place refers to Persons, see the Verse before; <hi>Thou meetest him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold thou art wroth; for we have sinned. q. d.</hi> VVere we VVorkers of Righteousness, thou would'st meet us, and we should rejoyce: But because we are not so, but have <hi>sinned,</hi> thou art <hi>wroth.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 7. There is <hi>none</hi> that calleth on thy Name, that <hi>stirreth</hi> up himself to take hold on thee. <hi>q. d.</hi> VVe are all remiss, the best of us are as Prayerless. See the <hi>6th. ver.</hi> it self; <hi>We are all</hi> as unclean things; our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags; <hi>we all</hi> fade as a Leaf. <hi>q. d.</hi> There's a general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41167:109"/>
and Degeneracy among us: But allow that it were spoken of Righteousness as a Quality; will it follow, that because the dead Shadow of Righteousness, in so backsliding and defiled a People, was Rags, that therefore the lively Actings of Grace, through the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit, must be menstruous Cloaths or Rags?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Apostle saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. For whom I have suffered the <hi>Loss</hi> of all things, and do count them <hi>Dung,</hi> that I may win Christ, and be found, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A.</hi> If this Place speaks of Gospel-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, as his own things which he counted Dung, it doth not prove that Holiness is Dung; all it can inferr, is, that in Comparison with winning Christ, it was <hi>esteemed</hi> as Dung. And who must not own, that compared with gaining Christ, the best thing in us is vile; yea, compared with his Righteousness: But yet it may not be vile in itself; asRivals with Christ we must <hi>hate</hi> Father and Mother.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41167:109"/>
those he calls Dogs? They were the <hi>Concision</hi> (alluding to <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests) or the Jews that rejected Christ, by an Opinion of more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in Jewish Observations, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of the Mosaick Frame. VVhat were the Things he counted Dung? I answer, They were the Jewish Privileges, and that conceited Christless Righteousness, which he once valued, as those Dogs at present did. But it was not that Gospel-holiness, which by the Grace of Christ, he was now Partaker of. <hi>Obj.</hi> How do both these appear? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer plainly, from the whole Scope of the Chapter. 1. They were his <hi>Christless</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Righteousness which he called Dung. For 1. his Discourse is a Warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jewish Perverters and Opposers of the Gospel. <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Beware</hi> of Dogs, beware of Evil Workers, beware of the Concision. 2. He states a Comparison, wherein he opposeth them, and includes a great Part of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiness in that Opposition. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. For we are the <hi>Circumcision, which Worship God in the Spirit,</hi> viz. not carnally, and with beggarly Elements, as they do; <hi>and rejoyce in Christ Jesus: q. d.</hi> We feel a true and solid Joy in, and by Christ, whom they refusing to accept of, are without; yea, and are tormented with Guilt and Fears, for their way make not the Comers to it <hi>perfect. And have no Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Flesh:</hi> That is, in being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by descent, and not his Spiritual Seed by Faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. Neither because they are the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are they all Children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That is, they</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41167:110"/>
                     <hi>which are the Children of the Flesh, these are not the Children of God,</hi> &amp;c. Or else in being Partakers of the Jewish Privileges; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. as many as desire to make <hi>a fair shew in the Flesh,</hi> they constrain you to be <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised;</hi> of this Number were these, whom the Apostle warneth the Christians against; but now by the Gospel, we are brought to place our Hopes in greater and surer things. 3. He enumerates these Jewish Pretensions, which he had as much right to glory in, as these boasting Enemies. <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. He was a Jew by Birth, and not a mere Proselyte; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as soon as any, of the strictest Sect, as fiery zealous against Christ as they, and as ceremonious as the best, <hi>touching the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which is in the Law blameless:</hi> He intends not Sinless-Obedience, nor Gospel-Sincerity; but a Life not to be blamed by the Rule of the Jewish Pedagogie, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Judgment of strict Observers. 4. Of these he professeth a Renunciation, when conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>But what things were gain to me:</hi> That is, these that I reckoned as much upon, as they now do, I counted loss for Christ; when he met me by the way, and led me to a truer Judgment of him and my self, I soon preferred him his Grace, his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and Instruction before all these. And <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. Yea, doubtless, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, I have no Suspicion of my Choice, and am still of the same Mind; they are still with me vain things, of no value, compared with that I have since known, and experienced in and by Christ; yea, for him, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41167:110"/>
I have not only quitted those Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish things, but <hi>I have suffered the loss of all things: viz.</hi> my Name, my Friends, my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, my Ease, and Life it self, in a fixed Purpose, and <hi>do count them but Dung, that I may win Christ.</hi> What these Jews do so boast of, and the World so esteem, even all are to me but Dogs-meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I may but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possess Christ, and the full Effects of his Undertakings in perfect Peace, Holiness and Glory, somewhat of which are already begun in me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was not Gospel-holiness which he counted Dung or Loss, For, 1. This was not his own Righteousness, which is of the Law, as opposed to that which is <hi>by the Faith of Christ.</hi> Nay, This is by the Faith of Christ; our Hearts are <hi>purified by Faith, Act.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>In Christ</hi> we are created thereto, and by him it is wrought through Faith in all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are all in him; and in this Union to him, I desire to continue, and share in the fuller Effects of. 2. This Holiness, instead of renouncing, or suffering the Loss of it, he earnestly <hi>presseth after,</hi> and expects to obtain; this is the Scope of <hi>Ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. that <hi>I may know him, viz.</hi> perfectly in his Person and Influences; and <hi>the Power of his Resurrection, i. e.</hi> in a perfect Newness of Heart and Life; <hi>and be conformable to his Death; i. e.</hi> wholly mortified and dead to Sin: <hi>If by any means I might attain to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Dead?</hi> that is, be as holy, and happy, as then I shall be, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Spot or Wrinkle, <hi>or any such thing.</hi> If <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:41167:111"/>
                     <hi>may apprehend that for which I am apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Christ; i. e.</hi> be as holy and happy as he designed to make me, when he seized me in my first Conversion, <hi>reaching forth unto those things that are before;</hi> that cannot be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteousness, for this he had in his first Justification; but it's that perfect Holiness and Glory, which he expected in Christ here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And this is the <hi>Mark for the Price of the high Calling of God in Christ; viz.</hi> What God intended in his Act, when he called me in Christ; and what I had in my Eye, when I consented to that Call, as the encouraging Reward. Now is not Holiness a great part of all these? and instead of renouncing it, he tells us he is for it, <hi>by any means, I follow after, reaching forth, I press towards;</hi> which was all needless, as to what he had already. 3. He bewails and owns the Weakness and Imperfection of this Righteousness at present, though he was pressing after it. <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained,</hi> either were <hi>already perfect.</hi> Ver. 13. I count not my self <hi>to have apprehended, forgetting the things which are behind.</hi> Can this be true of imputed Righteousness? Was not that attained at first? Is not that <hi>perfect</hi> when first justified? Or would <hi>Paul forget</hi> this, though his small Degrees of Holiness past, he might so forget, as that lesser Degrees should not hinder his Pursuit after more?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Tense; <hi>I do count all things loss,</hi> and therefore it was not his former Jewish Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. <hi>A.</hi> It was his present Act towards an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41167:111"/>
Object past. <hi>q. d.</hi> I even now still account them all vain; yea, and it may extend to all present secular Advantages also, as Life, Honour, and Estate, <hi>&amp;c. q. d.</hi> I value no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a crucified Christ, that I may fully know and enjoy him as a living Member in Eternity it self. But I hope none can think, that his <hi>winning</hi> Christ is either a <hi>first</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in Christ, or the Imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for Justification; for this he with Comfort knew he already had, and was not now to win by Perseverance, and growing Vigour. Far less can any think, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Holiness Dung; for what more he desired of Christ, was in order to perfect the Holiness begun already by Christ in him; and had he lost that which was already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, he had vainly expected a further Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Christ for Holiness or Joy. This Righteousness, which is of God by Faith, is that eminent Holiness he waited for, and if he could be found in Christ by an abiding Union he knew he should arrive at.</p>

                  <head>Wherein the Difference is not.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not whether we must reveal Christ in his Person, Natures, Offices, Sufferings, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, and whatever describes his Glory, Suitableness, Use, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Nor that we must teach that Christ hath purchased all saving Benefits, and that Men must look to him as the Author of Salvation, and Giver of that Grace whereby we obey the Terms of Life.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41167:113"/>
3. Nor that we must declare the free Grace of God in giving his Son for us, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to call us, and all Benefits we do receive on our Obedience to that Call. 4. Nor that we must describe Salvation in all the Parts of it, for the Comfort of Saints, and Persuading of Sinners. 5. Nor that we must make Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Christ and his Benefits to the worst of Sinners on Gospel-Terms; assuring them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall hinder their happiness by him, but their refusal to accept of him in all his Offices. 6. Nor whether we should inform them, that God hath elected a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whose Obedience to the Terms of Life, our Lord hath undertaken for, and so the Gospel shall not be in vain to all. But yet, that the Case of no Hearer is made so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by this Election of some, as that if he do repent and believe, he shall not be saved, for God will judge all of us by his revealed Will, and not by his Decrees. 7. Nor, That we must teach the best Man to renounce all the Grace he hath, and Good he performs, as if being the least Atonement for Sin, or least Purchase of Life, or any Addition of Merit to a Christ, or sharing in what is peculiar to him. All these I affirm.</p>

                  <head>The Real Difference.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether the Gospel requires any Grace or Duty, in order to our actual Interest in saving Benefits? This the Doctor denies, and I affirm, and have proved in several Chapters. 2. Whether it's Gospel-Preaching, to tell Men that they had the same Interest in Christ;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41167:113"/>
Pardon and Life, while most wicked, as any godly Man hath, and that their Happiness doth not at all depend on what Grace they act, or sin they commit? This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; being assured, whoever preacheth thus, opposeth the Gospel of Christ, and the plain Truth; as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15. 3. Whether Christ doth do all for a Believer, that God requires of a Believer? This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; though I grant, he works all in us, or enables us to do what God requires. 4. Whether the main Scope of Gospel-preaching is in Christ's Name, to perswade, and with Authority require, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to seek, and act those Graces which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits are promised to; assuring them of Salvation, if they comply, and declaring that it is impossible they can be saved; yea, that their Condemnation shall be aggravated, if they refuse? This I affirm, and the Doctor Denies.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ <hi>doth not do all for a Believer as well as in him.</hi> He doth not repent for us, nor obey the Gospel Terms for us, nor accept of, or rely on himself as a Saviour for us. He never is said to do so, we are enabled and required to do these as our own personal Acts, or perish. It is impossible Christ should do these things, as being inconsistent with his Person. Can he change his Mind, come to himself, and turn to God whom he had left, alter his Purposes, and reform his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41167:114"/>
Life? all which are included in Repenting Christ will save none, meerly as Christ, but as Christ believed on; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 52, 53, 54. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life.</hi> But, can Christ thus eat his own Flesh? Doth he mean, If I be not thus fed on by Men, they shall dye? That is, If I do not feed on my self. Christ will be saved for them, while themselves are damned, who trust to let Christ believe for them, whiles they continue in Unbelief. He doth all for us which belongs to him as Redeemer; but we must do all in his Strength, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the Redeemed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gospel-preaching is what I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and because the most Exception will lye against what I have said of the Conditional Proposals of Benefits on Terms of Duty, I shall prove that it's Gospel-preaching to call Men to believe and repent; and tell them, if they do so, God will, for Christ's Sake, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; if they do not so, their Sin will remain. And also to perswade them, to love, fear, and obey God in true Holiness, when in a State of Pardon, and profess the Faith: And if they persevere in doing so, they shall be saved by Christ, and if they do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they shall be miserable.</p>
                  <p>I have proved that these are Gospel-Truths, and therefore to preach them, is to preach the Gospel. Some one part of the Gospel, being Gospel, doth not argue that other Parts are not so too. But I shall annex a few more Reasons.</p>

1. Thus Christ and his Apostles appointed the Gospel to be preached. That the Spirit of Christ thus directed the Prophets in the Old Testament to preach, none can deny that use to read the Bible. Christ on Earth prescribed this way; <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature; he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> And as this Grace, under this Sanction of Life and Death was to be urged, so it's added, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi> Among which, no doubt, is included what he told the Apostles, when first commissioned; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. <hi>Whosoever shall not receive you, and hear your Words, when you depart out of that House, or City, shake off the Dust off your Feet: Verily, It shall be more tolerable for the Land of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrah in that Day of Judgment, than for that City.</hi> Ver. 32, 33. <hi>Whosoever shall Confess</hi> me before Men, him will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess before my Father which is in Heaven. But <hi>whosoever shall deny me</hi> before Men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in Heaven. <hi>Ver.</hi> 37. He that hath loved Father or Mother more than me, is not <hi>worthy</hi> of me. 38. He that taketh not his Cross and followeth me, is not <hi>worthy</hi> of me. 41. He That receiveth a righteous Man, in the Name of a righteous Man, shall receive a righteous Man's <hi>Reward.</hi> These are part of Christ's Speech to his Apostles, when he first sent them to preach; and so from Heaven he taught
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41167:115"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> to preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. See how <hi>Paul</hi> instructs <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach. 1. He enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates very many Duties, which he was to urge and exhort. 2. He frequently requires him to back these Exhortations with Promises, in case of Obedience, and Threatnings in case of Disobedience. I shall instance a few, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8, 9. Godliness is <hi>profitable unto all things, having the Promises of this Life, and that which is to come: This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation.</hi> What are the Promises of the Life to come to Godliness? Yea, though it's now with some no true Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Take heed to thy self and thy Doctrine, for in <hi>doing this,</hi> thou shalt both <hi>save</hi> thy self, and them that hears thee. Here's pressing to doing with a Promise of Life. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6, 9. Godliness with Content, is great <hi>Gain.</hi> But they that will be Rich, fall into Temptation, and a Snare, and into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foolish and hurtful Lusts, <hi>which drown Men in Destruction and Perdition.</hi> Ver. 17. 18. Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they do Good, willing to Communicate, laying up in store for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a good <hi>Foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal Life.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. It is a faithful Saying, for <hi>if</hi> we be dead with him, we shall also <hi>live</hi> with him, <hi>if we suffer,</hi> we shall also <hi>regin</hi> with him; <hi>if we deny him, he will also deny us.</hi> Can any Man think, we ought not to plead with Men, and Preach as Christ and his Spirit charge us? Or would he appoint us to preach what is not his own Will or Gospel?</p>

                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:41167:115"/>
2. In this manner did Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preach the Gospel. Read Christ's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Are not Graces urged by promised Blessings, and denounced Threatnings? the first none can doubt, the last is as evident. <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Good for nothing,</hi> but to be cast out. 19. <hi>Least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Except your Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness exceed the Righteousness</hi> of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall <hi>in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>In danger of Hell-Fire.</hi> 26. <hi>Thou shalt not come out thence.</hi> 30. If thy Right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee, for <hi>it's profitable for thee that one of thy Members should perish, and not that thy whole Body should be cast into Hell.</hi> See the Parable of the <hi>Seed,</hi> of the <hi>Talents, Virgins, Marriage Supper.</hi> Was it not he that declared, He that believeth not, <hi>the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, you shall <hi>dye in your Sins.</hi> If you repent not, you shall all likewise <hi>perish.</hi> Vain World! that think they can out-preach Christ, or that theirs is Gospel, which obstructs the very things that his Ministry was designed to. He that knew the Scheme of Truths, used his Satisfaction as the great Motive to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but not as what made it needless in its own place. The Apostles obeyed and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christ. The first Sermon of <hi>Peter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 40. Repent and be baptized every one of you, <hi>for the Remission of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Promise is to you,</hi> and to your Children, and as many as the Lord shall call. And with many other Words did
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41167:116"/>
he <hi>testifie, and exhort, saying, Save</hi> your selves from this untoward Generation. Read his Epistles, and see how he moves by Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Promises, and preacheth Duties. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the Sum of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 20. 21. <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying both to the Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Jesus.</hi> ver. 26, 27. <hi>I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</hi> It's he that saith, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jesus, let him be an Anathema, Maranatha.</hi> What a man <hi>soweth,</hi> that shall he <hi>reap,</hi> He will come in <hi>flaming fire,</hi> to take <hi>vengeance</hi> on all that know not God, and obey not the Gospel. What he saith of FreeGrace, and Christ's Righteousness, in Opposition to Man's Merits, doth not clash with what he saith of the Necessity of Graces and Duties, as the required Terms of such Blessings as God promiseth to them. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> is as express as can be; read his <hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Doubt;</hi> and it seems to be written against some Libertines, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Doctrine of Grace delivered by <hi>Paul:</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> expresly speaks of these Mens wresting <hi>Paul</hi>s <hi>Epistles</hi> in this very Point; as I could fully prove, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. Read the Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> and he agrees with the rest in arguing for Holiness, from Threats and Promises.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Gospel is said to be preached, you'll find that then Graces and Duties were preached under a Gospel Sanction. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 7. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> by my mouth should hear the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41167:116"/>
word of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> What this was, see <hi>Act.</hi> 10. from <hi>ver.</hi> 34. to 44. Of a truth I perceive that God is no Respecter of Persons; but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is <hi>accepted with him.</hi> The Word which God sent unto the Children of <hi>Israel, Preaching Peace by Jesus Christ, (He is Lord of all,</hi> &amp;c.) he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to preach unto the People,; and to testifie, That it is he which was ordained of God to be Judge of Quick and Dead: To him gave all the Prophets witness, That through his Name <hi>whoever believeth in him, shall have remission of sins. Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7. I saw another Angel in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying with a loud Voice, <hi>Fear God,</hi> and give glory to him, for the hour of his indignation is come; and worship him that made Heaven and Earth. So <hi>Act.</hi> 147, 15, 17. There they <hi>preached the Gospel.</hi> See their Call to turn to God from Idols, as part of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The nature of the Gospel requires that the Ministry should include these things, and it be preached in this manner. It's the Gospel of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 9. 60. It's the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> to whom all Judgment is committed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. The <hi>Law of Liberty:</hi> The <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. The great design of it, is, to destroy Satan's Empire, and recover lost Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to God. To this end, it reveals, that Salvation is to be had in Christ, if we come to God by him, though we be lost in our selves. And it is the Call of God in Christ,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41167:117"/>
to come to him, and <hi>hear</hi> him: Nay, it's the Charge of Christ, who is, for dying, made <hi>Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> Now can any think, that many Duties must not be parts of the Gospel, as well as Believing? Or, That Christ hath not Arguments from Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Dangers, from Promises and Threats, to strengthen his Charge? The Preceptive part of the whole Law is in his hand, and there is Authority in all his Injunctions and Calls: Else what means <hi>Obeying</hi> the <hi>Gospel, Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Gospel, Disobeying</hi> the <hi>Gospel? Obeyed</hi> the <hi>Truth, Obedience</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> and many such Expressions. And that there be Gospel-Threats and Promises annexed to his Precepts, I have fully proved. And I could easily shew, that the Substance of all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is said to be Obedience to the <hi>Law, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Word of Christ.</hi> If things be so, can we think that we preach not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, when we preach Duties? Or that we preach not the Gospel, when we urge Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to these Duties from Gospel-Promises and Threats? As if all Christ's Commands were mere <hi>Counsels.</hi> It's no Preaching with Authority, if we omit this: It's no answering the Eng of Gospel, if we wave this: There's no aptitude in the Ministry to draw Christ, without this. The Apostle gives us another Specimen, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. whom we preach, <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,</hi> that we may present every Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Christ. What's <hi>Snatching</hi> Men, as Brands out of the Burning? <hi>Compelling to come in?</hi> &amp;c. What Pleas do the Apostles
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41167:117"/>
use? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17, 18. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They do not preach the Gospel of Christ at all, who preach contrary to the scope of this Truth; no, nor they duly, who neglect to Preach according to it. Christ never sent such News to Sinners, That they were always Pardoned and Adopted; and they need only believe it, to know that it is so: He never told them, That they have nothing to do to the Participation of Saving Benefits; he hath Believed for them, and Repented for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Woe to them that will live as believing this! Christ knew how to support the Honour of his Grace, without overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Throne. To Preach at this rate, may excite the Affections of some; but, without a Miracle, will never Convert a Soul; and it needs an Antidote which, I hope, some of the Upholders of it have. It's the same with the Language of the Tempter, the Arguings of the Flesh, and the Conceits of presumptuous Sinners. Could they that knock'd at the door, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. be kept out? Or the five <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> be excluded, who went out to meet the Bridegroom, if this be true? <hi>Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> will be the Language of the Spirit to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. He is my Brother (saith Christ,) that <hi>doth the Will of my Father. Mark</hi> 3. 35. If any man teach <hi>otherwise,</hi> and consent not to wholsom words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the <hi>Doctrine which is according to godliness;</hi> he is proud, knowing nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41167:118"/>
He that talks of preaching Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching his Laws, his Title to rule us, his Offers, his Method of Grace, and his Motives to urge Men; profaneth and plays with that sacred Name.</p>

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because Christ's Sufferings procured Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and assure it to such as Obey the Gospel; therefore the Gospel enjoyneth nothing to be Obeyed. Because the Law enjoyned <hi>Doing,</hi> as the perfect Righteousness for which Life was a Debt; therefore the Gospel requireth nothing to be <hi>done,</hi> as the Means of Partaking of that Salvation which is merited by Christ. Because it's legal to Preach the Sanction of the Law of Innocency; therefore it's not Gospel, to press the Gospel-Sanction.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of Legal Preaching.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore I proceed, let me inform thee, That Legal Preaching hath an uncertain Sound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If by <hi>Legal,</hi> is meant the Precepts and Revelations of God in Christ, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Government of lost Man, under Gospel-Threats and Promises; then to be Legal Preachers, (as Preachers of this Law,) we account our Duty and Honour: All the Prophets, even <hi>Isaiah</hi> himself; yea, Christ, and his Apostles, were all Legal Preachers. The Law, in this sence, is that which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, Comforts, Healeth, Saveth, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Whatever is spoken in Praise of the <hi>Word,</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> of the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God and Christ, are spoken of the Law, in this sence: And it is the same with the Gospel, as I have proved, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. And they are Enemies to Christ and Souls, that disdain to be such Legal Preachers. 2. But there is a <hi>Legal</hi> Preaching which is opposed to the Gospel; and this indeed is a Crime; the word being used as a Reproach, this must be intended, if Men understand what they speak of: And to that, this Chapter refers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRUTH. Legal Preaching,</hi> is to Preach the Law as a Covenant of Innocency, or Works; or to Preach the <hi>Mosaick</hi> or Jewish-Covenant of Peculiarity: But it is not Legal Preaching,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41167:119"/>
to require and persuade to Faith, Holiness or Duties, by Promises and Threatnings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Grace of the Gospel, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Men to fear and hope accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ERROUR. Legal Preaching,</hi> is to call People to act any Grace, or do any Duty, as a required Means of Salvation, or inward Peace; or to threaten them with Death, or any Affliction, to cause Fear, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the grossest Sins, and backsside, and fall away; or to promise them any Blessing, upon their Obedience to the Commandments of Christ; or urge the Threatnings, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade Sinners to believe and repent.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Proved that this is Doctor</hi> Crisp's <hi>Opinion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>P. 616. <hi>If Persons are not united to Christ, and do not partake of Justification before they do believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then mark what will follow, That there will be bringing to life again the Covenant of Works,</hi> &amp;c. Obj. <hi>How doth this follow? I Answer; Thus you must of necessity press upon your selves these Terms, or such like; I must do, that I may have Life in Christ; I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there is no Life till I do believe. Now if their be Believing first, then there is Doing before Living.</hi> P. 561, 562. <hi>This likewise batters to the ground that way of urging Men to holiness which some hold forth, That if Men do not these and these good Works, and leave these and these Sins, then they must come under the wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c. The Love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the Faithful, and not the Fear of Wrath; a sense of being delivered from it,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41167:120"/>
not a fear of Wrath to come. <hi>P.</hi> 559, 560. Obj. <hi>Some will say, The Preaching of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law, and the Wrath of God, and Damnation, and Hell-fire unto Men, is a safer way to take Men off from Sin, than to preach Gracc and Forgiveness before-hand,</hi> &amp;c. A. <hi>I say, If we preach Wrath and Damnation, we must either make them believe they lyc under the Wrath, and that Wrath shall come; or we must make them believe, that though there be Wrath, yet it shall not fall upon them: Now, if we tell them of Wrath and Damnation, and say they are secure from them, and they belong not to them; to what purpose do we tell them of Wrath? we had as good hold our tongues,</hi> &amp;c. And he shews how it's bringing back the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> to tell them, that God will be <hi>angry</hi> with them if they commit Sin, or do not such and such Duties.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is not: Whether it is <hi>Legal Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to preach Duties or Holiness; as if Men must perfectly believe and obey, or they shall unavoidably perish. 2. Nor, That it's Legal Preaching, to denounce Wrath and Hell as Miseries from which there is no relief by Christ, in the way of the Gospel. 3. Nor, That it is Legal Preaching, to press Men to Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and other Duties, as if they were to be performed in their own strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of Christ, and Influences of the Spirit. 4. Nor, That it is Legal Preaching, to promise Salvation to any Action, if the Performer thereof be Unregenerate, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41167:120"/>
and Impenitent. 5. Nor, That it is too much Legal Preaching, to be always pressing the Duties of the Law of Nature, but to neglect Preaching Faith in Christ, and Repentance, Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so to neglect to make the Person, Offices, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Intercession of Christ; as also our Relation <hi>to</hi> him, and Dependance <hi>on</hi> him as Mediatour, with other Gospel-Mysteries known to their Hearers. 6. Nor, That it's Legal Preaching, to preach that our Faith Holiness, or Good Works, stand in the same place now, as Perfect Obedience did under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> To render the Reward to be of Debt, or be the Meritorious Righteousness for which we are Justified. 7. Or, That it is Legal to preach, that our best Obedience doth not deserve Wrath by the Law, as a Rule of Misery and Happiness: Or, That it doth not need Forgiveness, or is any Supplement of Christ's Righteousness; yea, or to neglect to call Men to renounce all in themselves, as any Atonement for Sin, or Cause of Pardon; and to look to Christ as the only Propitiation, Purchaser of all our Blessings, and Cause of the Acceptance of our Persons and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. 8. Nor, That it is Legal Preaching, to omit to urge Men to Obedience by Gospel Motives; as, what Christ Suffered, the Love of God in him, the Benefits afforded by him, the Helps he vouchsafes, the Relations he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to, and the like. 9. Nor, That it is Legal, to shew Men their Misery and Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and not to inform them of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Salvation, 10. Nor, That it is too
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41167:121"/>
Legal, to neglect to improve holy Souls to an ingenuous Obedience, from Love to God, as well as a holy Fear. 11. Nor that it is Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, to encourage such Fear as imports a Life of Torment destructive to our Hopes and Joy: Or, as if every Miscarriage should over-turn Assurance, though the dominion of Sin be not justly suspected. 12. Nor that it is Legal Preaching, to assert <hi>Judaism,</hi> or the <hi>Mosaic Pedagogie; viz.</hi> to press Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Sacrifices, a Covenant of Peculiarity, Jewish Priesthood, Sabbath, or an Abuse of the Law, in Opposition to Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who is the End of all Types, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these I affirm. These indeed make up that Preaching of the Law which is opposed to Christ, to Grace, and to the Gospel.</p>

                  <head>The real Difference.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether it's Legal Preaching, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire People to Repent and Believe, that their Iniquities may be forgiven for Christ's sake. This I deny, and the Doctor affirms against the scope of the Gospel; as I have proved, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 10, 12, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Whether it be Legal Preaching, to press Holiness, and Gospel Obedience, as necessary to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Justified Person. This the Doctor affirms, and I deny, upon Reasons given, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 13. 17. 3. Whether it be Legal, to threaten such Penalties as are short of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, against such Offences as are consistent with Sincerity, and yet avoidable by serious care and diligence. This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; for which see <hi>chap.</hi> 13, &amp;c.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41167:121"/>
4. Whether it be Legal, to preach Wrath and Damnation against prevailing Infidelity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, Ungodliness, Enmity against God, Profaneness, Apostacy, and utter neglect of Good Works; so that Wrath be urged as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Acceptance of Christ, and sincere Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him; and the Gospel-way of escaping these, be discovered, and persuaded to. This the Doctor affirms, and I deny; being well assured that Christ and his Apostles preached thus; and these Threatnings of God used since the Fall, are otherwise vain; as I have proved, <hi>chap.</hi> 13, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. Whether it's Legal Preaching, to excite good Men to an holy Fear of threatned Evils, as far as they find just Cause to suspect the Dominion of Sin, or Danger of Apostacy, or the Power of Carnal Security. This the Doctor affirms, and I deny.</p>

                  <head>The Truth Confirmed.</head>
                  <p>Consult the 20th. <hi>Chap.</hi> and those before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and thou wilt find, that what the Doctor calls <hi>Legal Preaching,</hi> is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Gospel, and the Truth according to Jesus: It's what the <hi>Assembly</hi> affirm to be the <hi>Grace</hi> of the New Covenant, and not the Covenant of Works: It's the method ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to recover apostate Sinners, and not to govern innocent Man. I have nothing left to do, except to vindicate, That it's the Will of God, that we should excite a holy Fear of threatned Evils; and this in <hi>good</hi> Men as well as <hi>bad,</hi> during their Pilgrimage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Doctor allows a Fear of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards God, from the infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41167:122"/>
between him and Creatures. <hi>A.</hi> He doth so, but it's no more than will be in Heaven it self. And therefore I add, that we ought to preach so, as to beget a fear of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the due Sense of Danger; not indeed so as to extinguish just Hopes or Joy, not to exclude Love, or introduce a Spirit of Bondage, or tormenting Amazement; but to prevent Security, and awaken Diligence, till our Danger is past, and our VVarfare be accomplished. For.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such Fear is our Duty by Gospel-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, least a Promise being left us of entring into his Rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</hi> It's an Evil is to be feared here, and Sense of Danger awakens it. See <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Least any Man fall after the same Example of Unbelief.</hi> Mar. 13. 5. <hi>Take heed,</hi> least any Man deceive you. This Duty is annexed, when the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Comfort of our present State is most represented; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Looking diligently, least any Man fail of the Grace of God.</hi> And when he had finished the peculiar Liberties of the New Testament-Time, he adds, <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. <hi>See that you refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped not, who refused him that spake from Earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven.</hi> Ver. 28, 29. Whereby we may serve God acceptably, <hi>with Reverence and Godly Fear; for our God is a consuming Fire.</hi> Here is Awe impressed by Danger; much more shall not we escape, if, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> say not the Saints shall not turn away, for yet here's an Awful

Threat if he do, and his Fear is the Means here intended to keep him from turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Work out your Salvation with <hi>Trembling and with Fear.</hi> Rom. 11. 20. Be not high-minded, <hi>but fear.</hi> Joh. 5. 14. Sin no more, <hi>least a worse thing do befall thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without this Fear in sence of Danger, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the great Duties of Religion are exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What's a <hi>Tender</hi> Heart, but a Heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by a Mixture of Fear and Love? Who is <hi>Contrite?</hi> but he that <hi>trembleth</hi> at my Word? <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. Are not taking heed, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Cares, and holy Watchfulness, great Duties? But if you exclude Fear of Danger, are these possible? Nay, VVhen God calls us to these, he doth it by representing Danger as what is to be dreaded, and thereby beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fear. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 5, 35, 36. Take heed, <hi>least</hi> any Man deceive you, for many shall come in my Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Watch ye therefore, <hi>&amp;c. least</hi> coming suddenly, <hi>he find you sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Luk. 21. 34, 35, 36. Take heed to your selves, <hi>least</hi> at any time your Hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, <hi>&amp;c. and so that Day come upon you unawares, for as a Snare it shall come, </hi> Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be counted <hi>worthy to escape</hi> all these things that shall come to pass, <hi>and to stand before the Son of Man.</hi> Heb. 3. 12. 13. Take heed, <hi>least</hi> there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief, in departing from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, <hi>&amp;c. Least</hi> any of you be hardned through the Deceitfulness of Sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21. If God spared not the natural Branches, <hi>take</hi>

Grudge not one against another, <hi>least ye be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; behold the Judge standeth before the Door.</hi> Are not all these intended to beget Fear? Are not the Motives from things that must strike an awe of Danger? The Lord argues to a Fear of Apostacy, Unpreparedness, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected at Christ's coming, being cut off and condemned; and God is represented, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>great</hi> above us, but as <hi>our Judge,</hi> as a <hi>consuming Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Fear is entertained by, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of in the best Men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>I keep my Body under, least that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my self should be a Castaway.</hi> Was here no Fear in Sense of Danger? Noah, <hi>moved with Fear,</hi> prepared an Ark, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 120. My <hi>Flesh trembleth</hi> for fear of thee, I am afraid of thy Judgments. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. Happy is he that <hi>feareth always.</hi> It was the want of this that's branded in the Virgins; <hi>They all slumbered and slept. Habakkuck's</hi> Tremblings and Faith were consistent, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This fear is absolutely necessary to Saints in their Pilgrimage. What Men should we be, if Fear were extinct? What would our Remains of Corruption, our great Snares, Heaps of earthly Diversions, while eternal things are invisible, reduce us to without Fear? Would Back-sliders recover themselves without fear? or Men in Difficulties hold out? God knew our Frame, when he saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>And if you call upon the Father,</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41167:123"/>
                     <hi>who without respect of Persons, judgeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly every Man's Work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.</hi> This Text ill agrees with the Doctor's Notion: We have no <hi>Work</hi> to do for Eternity, as if the Judgment-Day were past; away with Fear of VVrath or Danger, as if we were in Heaven already. Good Men may fancy an ingenuous Life of Love exclusive of all Fear, in this VVorld; but though they could be safe and vigorous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it follows not that all other good Men can, and we must preach the Mind of Christ to them. But I fear they know not, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not their own Hearts, who pretend to this, and if they fall into many gross Sins and Neglects, and keep up to this Rule, God calls them to fear their State. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Seeing you know these things, beware lest you also being led away with the Errour of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfastness.</hi> He will most safely walk in Love, and maintain Assurance, that is, in awe, as his Sins grow strong, and his Graces decline. I might shew that all God's Threats are despised, if without this Fear; yea, his being our future Judge is slighted, his wise Methods of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are dis-regarded, and one great help to our Salvation lost, by opposing this Fear. Fear him that can cast Soul and Body into Hell, is Christ's Charge, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5. And if thou do that which is Evil, <hi>be afraid,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. And if we must fear the Magistrate as the Minister of God's VVrath here, much more eternal VVrath; if we sin our selves into such Symptoms as the Gospel declares a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41167:124"/>
Danger of eternal Damnation by; for though the Gospel doth not say as the Law, that all Sinners shall be damned; yet it saith, that all impenitent Sinners shall be damned. And this we are bound to preach, and not gratifie the Devil to the Ruine of Souls. But they are in danger who are above this kind of Preaching; and Security, Libertinism, and Stops to the Conversion of Sinners, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail as this Preaching grows unfashionable. Nay, let me hear a Man of this Opinion preach a few Sermons, and I'll demonstrate he'll give the Lie to his own Principle, by urging Fear by some Arguments from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or he'll expose himself to the Contempt of all, when-ever he disswades from Sin.</p>

                  <head>TESTIMONIES.</head>
                  <p>I have recited so much belonging to this Head, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20. that I need only add to the last Chapter. <hi>New-England</hi> Synod condemns, as Errour 32. <q>After the Revelation of the Spirit, neither Devil nor Sin can make the Soul to doubt Errour 48. Condional Promises are legal. Errour 52. It's legal to say, we act in the Strength of Christ. Errour 56. A Man is not effectually converted till he hath full Assurance. Errour 57. To take delight in the holy Service of God, is to go a whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God. Errour 59. A Man may not be exhorted to any Duty, because he hath no power to do it. Errour 70. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, or length of holy Duties, or Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Conscience for the Neglect thereof,

are all Signs of one under a Covenant of VVorks Errour 68. Faith justifies an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, that is, that Faith that is in Christ, justifieth me that have no Faith in my self. Errour 76.</q> The Devil and Nature may be the cause of a gracious Work. All these that Synod confutes, as also that Speech, if Christ will let me sin, let him look to it, upon his Honour be it. With these Notions, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of Fear and Care were they pester'd. Doctor <hi>Owen, Of Justif. P. 52.</hi> assures us, he had written very much of the Nature and Use of Threatnings under the Gospel, and the Fear that ought to be ingenerated by them in the Hearts of Men.</p>

                  <head>The Grounds of the Doctor's Mistake.</head>
                  <p>Because the Law of <hi>Works</hi> made Life to be of Debt for perfect doing; therefore its legal to call Men to do what <hi>Christ</hi> commands, in order to any Benefit, which he promiseth by the Grace of the New Covenant to bestow on such as shall so obey him. Because it's legal to denounce Wrath as <hi>unavoidable,</hi> therefore it's legal to denounce VVrath that it may be <hi>avoided.</hi> Because God is not angry with his People for Sin, when he hath forgiven them it upon Repentance; therefore they should not be called to fear his Anger, as a disswasive from Sin, or Motive to Repentance when they have sinned. Because we cannot say the Elect shall at last be damned, being that God will bring them to Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they may be saved; therefore it's legal to tell them, they shall be damned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41167:125"/>
they believe and repent, though Christ oft tells them so. Because the Believer is not in a <hi>state</hi> of Wrath; therefore it's Legal to warn him against Apostacy, from the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that VVrath which Apostacy would bring him under: And Note, Reader, That all awful Expressions against Apostacy, are especially directed to true Believers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we should not destroy the Hope or Joy of an humble, watchful Christian; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's legal to allarm and awaken the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, careless, backsliding Christian.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Do observe, that the Pretence for these Opinions, is, That they exalt Christ, and Free Grace. Under this shadow <hi>Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> set up in <hi>Germany.</hi> This was the great Cry in <hi>England</hi> above fifty years since. The <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> expose this as one of the Speeches of them whom they call <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian:</hi> 
                  <q>Here is a great stir about Graces, and looking to Hearts; but give me Christ: I seek not for Graces, but for Christ: I seek not for Promises, but for Christ: I seek not for Sanctification, but for Christ: Tell not me of Mediation and Duties, but tell me of Christ.</q> 
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> very often bears upon this Point, as if all he said were to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41167:125"/>
Christ and Grace: I shall therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether the Opinions of Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> or the Truths I have stated, do most exalt Christ and Free Grace.</p>
               <p>It were enough to say, That I have proved his Opinions to be <hi>Errours;</hi> and what I have laid down, to be Truths: Then Christ is more exalted by these Truths. He needs no Lyes to advance his Praise, and knew how to provide the best for his own Glory, by what he hath revealed. But for farther Evidence, I shall insert,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How Christ is said to be exalted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gospel. It is not what we fancy, will Exalt him; but what he declares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his Praise, that he will accept for Glory: He that will not allow Men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him in a way they think most devout, but binds them to his own Rule, to exceed which, is Superstitious; will less venture his Glory to our ignorant Methods, whereby we are apt to diminish his real Glory, when we conceit he is exalted. It's an Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Person and Offices, which is his Honour, and not what seems dazling to our blind Affections. His Divine Glory cannot be added to, but only declared: It's only the Glory of Christ, as Mediator, that I shall speak of. As to this, Christ is exalted, when <hi>every Knee bows to him,</hi> Phil. 1. 11. VVhen made a <hi>Prince and a Saviour, to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and remission of sin,</hi> Act. 2. 23. VVhen his Kingdom is <hi>enlarged,</hi> Ifa. 49. 4, 5, 6. VVhen his People are <hi>filled with the fruits of Rightcousness,</hi> Phil. 1. 11. VVhen their <hi>Grace</hi>

is <hi>perfected,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 11, 12. VVhen they <hi>suffer</hi> and <hi>act</hi> vigorously for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. VVhen we own his <hi>Priestly</hi> and <hi>Kingly Office;</hi> relying on the first, as that whereby Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made, and all the Blessings for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners purchased; yielding to the Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as that whereby he applieth the Effects of his Merits, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 13. VVhen we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the VVord, as it brings every <hi>Thought into subjection <gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. Are guided by his Teachings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. VVe are the <hi>Glory of Christ,</hi> when we labour in his VVork, and walk worthy of his Name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>He is all in all,</hi> when Jews and Gentiles <hi>put on the New Man,</hi> which is created after him in <hi>righteousness,</hi> and <hi>true holiness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11, 12. VVhen we <hi>live and die to him,</hi> as our Supreme Lord; and submit all our Actings to his Glory, as our End, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 11, 12. These places express, that Christ is hereby Exalted; consult them, and thou wilt find it so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Truths I have stated, do tend to the Exaltation of Christ in this manner; and none can doubt but they lead to his Glory, as he is <hi>King.</hi> All that can be objected, is, Whether I do exalt him enough, as <hi>Priest?</hi> To which, I say, I have spoken as the Word directs; and I am willing to own any thing that lays Man low, and exalts Christ as the only <hi>Atonement,</hi> the only Purchaser of all our Blessings, the only <hi>Procurer</hi> of our Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finisher</hi> of all Grace: Nothing can add to his Satisfaction or Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Pardon, Peace, Life, all are the Effects of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41167:126"/>
his sole Merits: We must do all in his Name, act in his Strength, daily live on him for all Supplies, and look to him for Acceptance; without whose Incense, the best Man, and the best Action, were an Abomination. What I contend for, is, his <hi>Government,</hi> so wisely contrived to apply his Blessings to Men in a state of Tryal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Opinions of Doctor <hi>Crisp,</hi> as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to these Truths, cannot exalt Christ; yea, by the above Description, every one of them cast a Reproach upon Christ. I'll ask thee, Is Christ <hi>exalted,</hi> when he is made the very Blasphemer, and loaded with the filth of Sin, and thereby odious to God till he sweat it out <hi>P.</hi> 51, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is he <hi>exalted,</hi> in making Sin so Innocent to the Elect, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, that though they do the Fact, yet the filthy Form of it is not theirs, but Christ's; and therefore they are not defiled thereby, but are as <hi>holy</hi> as Christ, as <hi>lovely</hi> as Christ, even when they Murther? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is Man <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based,</hi> and Christ <hi>exalted,</hi> when there is a Change of Person between Christ and them; we as Righteous as Christ, and he as Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som as we; and we should not charge our selves with Sin, when the greatest Enormities are committed? Is Christ <hi>exalted</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> when all his Commands are made mere <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels?</hi> He is a King, but hath neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises nor Threats annexed to his Laws: He hath no Right to Chastize for Sin: He offers Blessings on Terms, pleads earnestly, sends his Spirits and Ministers to strive; but all this while, his Spirit nor Word do nothing to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41167:127"/>
save us; our Compliance with his Calls, yields no Benefit; our Rejection of them, puts no Hindrance; our grossest Villanies should not be bewailed, in order to Pardon; nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self believed in to that end. Our Sins can do us no harm at all; nor is Holiness, though so oft urged by him, a jot of our way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is Christ exalted as a Head, that hath actual Members oft sixty years Slaves to the Devils, Enemies to himself, and Life, and People, without his Spirit, or a Line of his Image; and publick Curses? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as Mediator, that Men are invested in all his Covenant-Blessings, washed and adopted, before they so much as own that God to whom he is a Way, or renounce his Enemy the Devil, or confess their Sin, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any amendment, see their need of him, or desire to fear or love him; yea, do resolve the contrary? Is Christ exalted as a holy Redeemer, by being represented so intent on our mere Impunity, as to contrive so little for our Holiness; he repents and believes for us, and requires no such things from us as a Means of Benefits; the Holiness he here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the best to, is but Dung and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; though he pretends to encourage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate and reprove; yet indeed he governs his Elect as Brutes, neither Hope nor Fear must influence them; he hath no Rule to Judge them, but the Decree of Election; though he warns us so oft of the Solemnities of the Last Day. No Man must intend his own good, in any Duty he performs; though he speaks so much of his Reward, yet they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41167:127"/>
have no respect at all to what we do, they will be as much ours for the greatest neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects. The Comforts of Assurance it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on no Signs of Renovation; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in our selves upon an inward Voice, that our Sins are pardoned, and this, all that Faith which the Gospel speaks so much of. How many more might I instance which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Christ inglorious, and reflect on the Truth, Wisdom, Holiness and Justice, of his nature? The Platform of his Government, the Divineness of his Purposes in Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Substance and Scope of his Word and Gospel.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We must be sure it is the Free Grace of God we speak of: This is the Love, Mercy and Benignity of God to Sinners. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of this, Note, That it is not every thing that Man can fancy, to be Free, or Grace, or Free Grace; that is, the <hi>Free Grace of God:</hi> No, it must be a Grace free, becoming the Nature of God, suitable to all
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41167:128"/>
his other holy Perfections, consistent with his Dominions, executing it self in the VVay and Instances appointed by his VVisdom; limited to the Objects, both for Number and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as described by his VVord; and serving all it's glorious Purposes of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the Free Grace of God: <hi>The Grace of God in Truth,</hi> Col. 1. 6. <hi>The true Grace of God,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> had at large described, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. This Grace consists with an Atonement made by Christ; with the Threatnings denounced in the Gospel; with the Ruine of all unbelieving, apostate, ungodly Sinners; with God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily insisting on Gospel-Terms, in the Distribution of Benefits; or else it would clash with his VVord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's not less the Free Grace of God, because it is not so <hi>free</hi> as we may dream it is: As some do fancy, it would have been more Free Grace, if he had not exacted a Dying-Sacrifice; or if it had alike extended to all sinful Men, as well as some; or included Devils, as well as Men; or made the Elect perfectly holy and happy as soon as born, excluding all Labour, Pain, Sin and Sorrow. But we see such Free Grace is not the Free Grace of God; though it seems more Free, or more Grace, to vain Surmisers, it is not Free as, if it dispensed Privileges by no certain Rule; and that God is as free to forgive and save the Impenitent, as the Penitent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. VVhat I have stated as Truth, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and exalt this Free Grace of God. I have affirmed, and would admit the fullest
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41167:128"/>
Expressions to testifie, that in these is the Free Grace of God in Truth. Of mere Grace he elected some certain Sinners to Life, upon no moving, fore-seen Condition; but yet to obtain it through Sanctification of the Spirit to Obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus. Of mere Love to Sinners, no way deserving it, he gave his Son to die for them; who also undertook to bring all the Elect to Salvation, in the way appointed between the Father and him: He, without any thing in Man to deserve it, gave his Gospel; and thereby offereth, in the virtue of his Son's Blood, Pardon, and Eternal Life, to every one that will repent, and truly believe; and no penitent, persevering Believer shall miss of Life by a failure of this Promise: He freely and of mere Grace bestows Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yea, gives his Spirit to create these, and any other good VVork, in worthless, vile Sinners: And though he will not forgive any that finally refuse to believe and repent, nor save any ungodly, barren, apostate Man; yet Pardon and Life are his free-Gift, and no Grace or Duty merits them, they being no more than the required Conditions or Means of our partaking them, as the Gifts of God, through Christ; and so hereby he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours his own Government, and no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgeth the boastings of Men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Opinions of Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> as they differ from these <hi>Truths,</hi> do not exalt the <hi>Free Grace of God:</hi> His Notions may seem more to represent an unlimited Grace as blind, and so more suitable to wicked, foolish
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41167:129"/>
Men: But it is not agreeable to the holy Nature, nor just or wise Government, or the revealed Will of God; but greatly reflects on God's Grace, beyond what I will mention. Is it the honour of God's Grace, that all the Graces of the Spirit should be needless to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Benefits, when he promiseth those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to them? Is it the Grace of an holy God, not to esteem a Man filthy by the greatest Abominations, and yet abhorr his own Image in his Saints, as Dung? Is it the <hi>Free Grace of God,</hi> to account an Elect Person, in the heighth of his VVickedness, as pure and as lovely as a Saint in Glory; and yet with-hold his Spirit from him many years? Is it the Grace of God, to leave his Precepts without any Sanction, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Curse of the Law? Never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any displeasure, when most provoked; yea, when he doth correct? To have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Good or Evil in Men, in his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Distributions? To leave Men so Imperfect in a VVorld of Temptations, and State of Tryal, free from all fear of Caution, and to have nothing in them to influence their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance and Holiness, except a Principle of Gratitude, though their Love be weak? Can it be the Grace of God, that his Subjects must have no Eye to his Rewards or Threats; fear none of his Displeasure when they offend; be confident of the Pardon of the worst Offences, before they confess a Fault; never fear a Rebuke for, or Hurt in or by any Sin; yea, condemn any trouble on that account, though he blame the contrary, and his Spirit causeth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41167:129"/>
these Relentings? Is it the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of our <hi>God,</hi> which renders him a <hi>Respecter of Persons</hi> in his judicial Acts, as the Ruler and Judge of the VVorld, because he bestows Grace as an Act of Sovereignty? It cannot be his <hi>Free Grace,</hi> who hath so wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the Kingdom of his Grace, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Idleness and Neglect in Men, as well as Boasting; that he makes the Sinner speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, for being his own Undoer, by wilfully refusing Christ, as well as he secures the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Free Mercy by all that are saved. Can that Grace be his, which nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies all his Threats, weakens the Authority of all his Commands, turns all his Pleadings with Men into empty VVords; nay, direct Fallacies? Is it the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the stated Order wherein <hi>Grace</hi> exerts it self, becoming all the Perfections of God? God's Grace first calls, and therein unites us to Christ; first quickens, then dignifies; first gives Faith, then Forgives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by the Doctor's Opinion, this Order is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Man, as Rational, as well as his Relation to God, as a Subject, in the way to an Eternal State. It cannot be God's <hi>Free Grace,</hi> which renders Men as safe for Eternity, if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the Gospel, as by hearing of it; for if they be united to Christ, and pardoned in the Womb, they need the Gospel only for Assurance, but not for Title; to change their Apprehensions, but not their State. How many more (and some grosser) Objections might be offered against that being the <hi>Free Grace of God,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers speak of as <hi>Free Grace?</hi> I desire to live, adoring the Riches of that Grace, that freely elected to Grace and Glory in Christ (as the great Means of accomplishing this Purpose) so many apostate Sinners; that freely offers Life to the worst Enemies, on Gospel-Terms, with so much help, as leaves the Blood of the Impenitent on their own Heads; that freely bestows the Spirit, to work the Dead and Ungodly to an Obedience to the Terms of the Gospel; that freely gives, by the Promise for Christ's sake, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the penitent Believer; and such amazing Dignity to such as he enableth to persevere in Faith and Holiness, as the Rule of the Promise doth require. This Grace I adore, and own the best to merit nothing to forfeit all; yea, to deserve Hell by the Law of Works: And I do renounce all that Saints have, or do, as any Atonement for Sin, or Purchasing Price of the least Benefit, much less of Salvation. But yet I disown any <hi>Free Grace</hi> to be the <hi>Free Grace of God</hi> which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41167:130"/>
overturns his Benefits from being Motives to Duty; denies the total neglect of Duties, with their contrary Evils from being a Barr to our Interest in those Benefits which by the Gospel he promiseth to those Duties; and requires those Duties, in order to this Rectoral Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blessings, it being wisely provided for in the Dispensation of this Grace, that he may Rule and Judge us according to his Relation to us, and according to our rational Nature, in a state of Tryal, for a future Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>READER,</hi> There are other Mistakes of Doctor <hi>Crisp</hi>'s, which I might instance; as, his Notion of the Nature of our Union with Christ, as if we were One Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with him: His Difinition of the New Creature, as if it stood only in our New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Christ. <hi>P.</hi> 90. The strange diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he makes between the way of Salvation before Christ's time, and since. <hi>P.</hi> 254, 255, 256, 258. Their Sins were pardoned, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Doing, not given for all Sins at once; much Dust left, and they were subject to Lashes for Sin; but now the Covenant is contrary in all these respects. How contrary to the Sense of the <hi>Assembly</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> ch. 11. a. 6. <hi>The Justification of Believers under the Old Testament, was in all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects one and the same with the Justification of Believers under the New Testament.</hi> He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets that most of his Proofs be fetch'd from the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16, &amp;c. <hi>Jacob loved in the Womb,</hi> &amp;c. and seems not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that of <hi>Peculiarity.</hi> But these, with other <hi>Errours,</hi> I pass by,</p>

            <head>THE <hi>APPENDIX.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Shall here repeat what I delivered in <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Hall-</hi>Lecture, which some Persons seemed greatly to resent; and I leave it to any impartial Man to judge, from what I have described as Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I charged Men of his Persuasion with Falshood.</p>
            <p>After I had fully acquitted Men of my Judgment, from <hi>Pelagianism, Socinianism,</hi> and <hi>Arminianism,</hi> which the <hi>Antinomians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us of; I added, with these Men, It's not enough that we hold, That we were from Eternity elected to Grace and Glory; unless we add, That we were actually United to Christ, and Justified from Eternity, and in the Womb. It's not enough, that we say, Christ did, in the Covenant of Redemption, undertake to save the Elect in his appointed way and time; unless we add, That there is no other Covenant for the Application of Christ's Benefits; wherein God requires Faith and Repentance, as the indispensible Means of our Pardon. It is not enough, that we own, That Christ absolutely Redeemed the Elect, so as to purchase Saving Graces, as well as Benefits, to be infallibly theirs; unless we add, That all others are in state of Devils; as having no real Offers of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41167:131"/>
Life on Gospel-Terms; nor is their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion possible, if they will repent and believe: It will not please them, that we affirm, The Punishment of our Sins; yea, the Guilt of them, as an Obligation to Punishment, were laid upon Christ, our Sponsor; unless we add, That our Sins themselves in their blot and filthiness, were also transacted on Christ. It is not enough, that we own, That the Righteousness of Christ avails us as much as if it were personally our own; yea, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intended for us, and is so imputed to us, as to be the Foundation of, and Security for our Pardon and Right to Life; and no Atonement for Sin, or purchasing Price of Life, can be demanded from us; unless we also add, That God esteemed us to have done and suffered, what Christ did and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. It sufficeth not, that we say, That we are Justified only by Christ's Merits, as the sole procuring Cause, or Righteousness for which we are Justified: unless we deny, That Faith and Repentance are the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly required Conditions or Qualifications of those Persons to whom the Merits of Christ are applied for Justification. It will not serve, that we assert, That Justifying Faith, must be a Reliance on Christ, as Priest, and sole Atonement: unless we deny, That Faith must be also a fiducial Acceptance of a whole Saviour; <hi>i. e.</hi> of Christ, as Prophet, Priest and King. It's not enough, that we say, We are upon Repenting and Believing, put into a Justified state, hefore any other Work: unless we add, That our Obedience to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41167:132"/>
Precepts do not benefit us; and that God doth not judicially approve of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Actings, as according to the Rule of the Gospel-Promises of those Benefits. It is not enough, that we say, The absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to Christ, for the be nefit of the Elect, and pleadable by him; unless we deny, That the Gospel is an authoritative Command on Men to Believe, and that under the Gospel-Sanction of Life and Death: So that he that believes, stall be saved; and he that believeth not, shall be damned. It will not please, that we say, That Christ pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased all Grace for us, and by his Spirit worketh all Grace in us; unless we add, That he Believed, Repented, and did all for us, so as we have nothing to do in order to Salvation. It's not sufficient, that we own, The Grace by which we do any Duty, is from Christ; and the Good promised to any Duty, is for the sake of Christ: unless we deny the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Connexion betwixt that Duty and that Benefit. They say, We set up Man's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, if we tell Men that they must be holy, and do good, and take comfort therein, as an Evidence of Grace, and of their Title to Christ, and as answering the Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Promises, though we assert, They must be Members of Christ, and accepted through him; or they cannot partake of any Saving Benefits thereby. It is not right, that we say, God sees no Sin in Believers, so as to cast them out of Covenant, nor out of a Justified-state, for it; unless we add, That God sees no Sin at all in them, as theirs, when they most offend.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41167:132"/>
It's not enough, that we affirm, That Sin committed, shall not eventually damn a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, because he shall by the Spirit be brought to Repentance; unless we add, God is never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with Believers for Sin; nor ever corrects them, as guilty of it. With these we are <hi>Legal Preachers,</hi> if we urge Faith and Repentance in order to Pardon, though we declare that Faith and Repentance are the Gifts of Christ; and Pardon is not the Effect of these Graces, but of the Promise in the virtue of Christ's Blood, or of his Blood applied for Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Promise. We are <hi>Legal Preachers,</hi> if we perswade to Holiness, as the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Ordination of Christ; though we affirm, that it is no way out of Christ; nor but with a respect to Christ, for whom it is accepted, as what answers the Rule of the Gospel-Promise. How are we decried as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> if we urge Threatnings, though as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to close with Christ, and to walk in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which being used to this end, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Evil being avoidable on Gospel-Terms, and pressed on fallen Man for his recovery; they are Gospel, and not Legal Threatnings. It's not enough, That we assert and press As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance; unless we affirm, That Justifying Faith, is nothing but Assurance. It's not enough, we say, That we need the Spirit, to discover to us our inherent Grace, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist Conscience in it's Sentence, That Grace is inherent; unless we add, That we must not try our State, and conclude of it by Gospel-Marks of Sanctification; but depend on an inward Voice of the Spirit, saying, <hi>Thy Sins</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:41167:133"/>
               <hi>are forgiven;</hi> which we must believe, if it agree but to the general Word, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ came to save Sinners; and believing this is all that Saving Faith the Gospel speaks of. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have, in part, described the state of the Case between them and us. It's true, there are some small Differences among the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, in Wording some of these things: But shall we hereby give Advantage to such Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours as overturn the Gospel and Dominion of Christ, under the abused Pretext of <hi>Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ,</hi> and <hi>Free Grace?</hi> Bear with this, which for the sake of Christ, and dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I have ventur'd to declare: not for the Irritation of any, but the Edification of all, especially some mistaken, well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Conscience binds me not to palliate, though I fore-see Reproach from some, who would do well to remember the Caution the Spirit of God thought needful to such as boasted of a Faith without Works, and still it appears too pertinent; <hi>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's rereligion is vain,</hi> Jam. 2. 26.</p>
