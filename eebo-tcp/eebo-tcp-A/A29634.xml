            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your projects are put down, and you'l take up no new: but what ſhall be (ſpectators) to pleaſe you. And you Poetick part induces you, t'appologize now for the Poet too, as they ha' done already, you to the Ladies, you to the Cavaliers and Gentry; you to the City friend, and all for the Poet, Poet, Poet, when alls but begging tho. I'le ſpeak to 'em all, and to my Countrey folkes too if here be any o'em: and yet not beg for the Poet tho', why ſhould we? has not he money for his doings? and the beſt price too? becauſe we would ha' the beſt: And if it be not, why ſo? The Poet has ſhewd his wit and we our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But to ſtand beg, beg for reputation for one that has no countenance to carry it, and muſt ha' money is ſuch a Paſtime!—If it were for one of the great and curious Poets that give theſe Playes as the Prologue ſaid, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney too, to have 'em acted; For them, indeed, we are bound to ply for an applauſe. Becauſe they look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and ſcorn to beg for themſelves. But then you'l ſay thoſe Playes are not given to you; you pay as much for your ſeats at them as at theſe, though you ſit nere the merrier, nor riſe the wiſer, they are ſo above common underſtanding; and tho' you ſee for your love you will judge for your money, why ſo for that too, you may. But take heed you diſpleaſe not the Ladies tho' who are their partiall judges, being brib'd by flattering verſes to commend their Playes; for whoſe faire cauſe, and by their powerfull voyces to be cry'd up wits o' Court, the right worſhipfull Poets boaſt to have made thoſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, when for ought you know they bought 'em of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie Scholars tho', and onely ſhew their own wits in owning other mens; and that but as they are like neither. As thus, do you like that Song? yes. I made it. Is that Scene or that Jeſt good? Yes, Twas mine; and then if all be good 'twas all mine. There's wit in that now. But this ſmall Poet vents none but his own, and his by whoſe care

and directions this Stage is govern'd, who has for many yeares both in his fathers dayes, and ſince directed Poets to write &amp; Players to ſpeak, till he traind up theſe youths here to what they are now. I ſome of 'em from before they were able to ſay a grace of two lines long to have more parts in their pates then would fill ſo many Dry-fats. And to be ſerious with you, if after all this, by the venemous practiſe of ſome, who ſtudy nothing more then his deſtruction, he ſhould faile us, both Poets and Players would be at loſſe in Reputation. But this is from our Poet agen, who tels you plainly all the helps he has or deſires; And let me tell you he has made prety merry Jigges that ha' pleas'd a many.
