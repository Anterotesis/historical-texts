         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AMong all the Creatures God hath
made (Devils only excepted)
Man is the most apt and able to
be his own tormentor; and of all
the Scourges with which he lasheth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth
both his Mind and Body, none is
found so cruel and intolerable as his own
fears. The worse the times are like to be,
the more need the mind hath of succour
and encouragement, to confirm and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it for hard encounters, but from the
worst prospect, Fear inflicts the deepest and
most dangerous wounds upon the mind of
man, cutting the very nerves of its passive
fortitude and bearing ability.</p>

would be light and easie, were it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
by Fear; Reason would do much,
and Religion more, to demulce and lenifie
our sorrows, did not Fear betray the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of both. And it is from <hi>things to
come</hi> that this prospecting Creature raiseth
up to himself vast Hopes, and Fears; If
he have a fair and encouraging Prospect of
Serene and prosperous day, from the
<hi>Scheme</hi> and Position of second causes, Hope
immediately fills his heart with cheariness,
and displaies the signals of it in his very
face, answerable to that fair benign Aspect
of things; but if the face of things to
come be threatning and inauspicious, Fear
gains the Ascendant over the mind, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
unmanly and unchristian faintness pervades
it, and among the many other mischiefs it
inflicts, this is not the least; that it brings
the evil of to morrow upon to day, and
so makes the duties of to day wholly unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the evils of to morrow; which
is much as if a man having an intricate
and difficult business cut out for the next
day, which requires the utmost intention
both of his Mind and Body, and (haply
might be prosperously managed if both were
duly prepared) should lie all the night
<pb facs="tcp:44184:4"/>
restless and disquieted about the event,
torturing and spending himself with his
own presaging Fears, so that when the day
is come, and the business calls for him; his
strength is no way equal to the burden of it,
but he faints and fails under it.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed an excellent use that God
makes of our Fears to stimulate our sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearts to greater vigilance, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for evils, and there is a mischievous
use <hi>Satan</hi> makes of our Fears, to cast us
under Despondency and vnbecoming Pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity;
and I reckon it one of the great
difficulties of Religion to cut by a thred
here, and so to manage our selves under
threatning or doubtful Providences, as to
be touched with so much sense of those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
evils, as may prepare us to bear
them; and yet to enjoy that constancy and
firmness of mind in the worst times, that
may answer the excellent principles we are
professedly governed by.</p>
                  <p>These last times are certainly the most
perillous times; great things are yet to be
acted upon the <hi>Stage</hi> of this World before
it be taken down, and the <hi>Scena ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penultima,</hi>
latter end, I say not the
<pb facs="tcp:44184:5"/>
last, will be a <hi>Tragedy.</hi> There is an
<hi>Ultima clades adhuc metuenda,</hi> a dismal
slaughter of the Witnesses of Christ, yet
to be expected: the last bite of the cruel
Beast will be deadly, and if we flatter not
our selves, all things seem to be disposing
themselves in the Course of Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words
it.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, if our Vnion with Christ be
sure in it self, and sure to us also; if Faith
give us the daily visions and Praelibations
of the World to come, what well composed
Spectators shall we be of these Tragedies!
Let things be tossed <hi>Susque, deque,</hi> and
the Mountains cast into the midst of the

sing his Song upon <hi>Alamoth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>With design to promote this blessed
frame in my own and others hearts in these
frightful times, I meditated, and now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
this small Tract, to which a dear

aim better than its performance. As for
you Sir, I hope Faith hath really placed
your Soul in that Serene and happy station

                     <argument>
                        <p>Wherein the Text and Context are opened,
the Doctrines propounded; and the general
method stated.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere is not more diversity found in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
features, than in the inward tempers
and dispositions of men: some are as timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as Hares and start at every sound, or
yelp of a dog: others are bold as Lions, and can face
dangers without trembling, Some fear more than
they ought, and some before they ought, and others
when they ought not at all. The carnal person fears
man, not God; the strong Christian fears God,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44184:9"/>
not man; the weak Christian fears man too much,
and God too little.</p>
                     <p>There is a Fear which is the effect of sin, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from guilt, and hurrying the soul into more
guilt; and there is a fear which is the effect of grace,
springing from our love to God and his interest, and
driving the soul to God in the way of duty. The
less fear any man hath the more happiness, except it
be of that fear which is our happiness and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be said of any man as it is said of <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,
Iob</hi> 41. 33. that he is made without fear,
those that have most fortitude, are not without some
fears: And when the Church is in the storms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
and almost covered with the waves, the
stoutest passengers in it may suffer as much from this
boisterous passion within, as from the Storm without;
and all for want of throughly believing, or not sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
remembring, <hi>That</hi> the Lord High Admiral
of all the Ocean, and Commander of all the winds
is on board the Ship, to steer and to preserve it in the
storm.</p>
                     <p>A pregnant instance hereof is furnished to our hands
in this Context, where you find the best men trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in expectation of the worst events both on the
Church in general, and themselves in particular.
<hi>Their hearts were moved like the trees of the wood sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the wind, Chap. 7. v. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed if their dangers were to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by sense only, their fears were not above the
value of the cause, yea their dangers seemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
their fears; for it was the invasion of a forein
and cruel enemy, even the <hi>Assyrian</hi> who were to
break in upon them like a breach of the Sea, and
overflow the land of <hi>Immanuel, v. 7. The Lord bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44184:9"/>
up upon them the waters of the river strong and
many; even the King of</hi> Assyria <hi>and all his glory, and
he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his
banks.</hi> And as the <hi>7. verse</hi> resembles the enemy to
waters which quickly drown the countrey into which
they break, so the 8 <hi>verse</hi> tells you how far they should
prevail, and how near it should come to a general and
total ruine. <hi>He shall pass through Iudah, he shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
and go over, he shall reach even to the neck, and
the stretching ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy
land</hi> O Immanuel. All the body should be under water,
except the capital City, which remained above water.</p>
                     <p>Having thus described the power and success of
the invading enemy, in the 9 and 10 <hi>verses</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
their plots and combinations, assuring them that
although God for just and holy ends would permit
them for a time to afflict his people, yet in the issue
all their councels and cruelties should recoyl upon
themselves, and end in their own ruine and confusion.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon <hi>Isaiah</hi> is commanded to encourage
the feeble and trembling hearts of such as feared God
in those distracted and frightful times, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13.
<hi>The Lord spake unto me with a strong hand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
me, that I should not walk in the way of this
people, saying, say ye not a confederacy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>God speaking to the Prophet by a strong hand,
imports the strong and mighty impression that was
made upon his heart by the Spirit of Prophecy:
Wherein the Lord did as it were lay his hand upon
him, as a man doth upon one to whom he is about to
impart some special secret in a familiar way, <hi>q. d.</hi>
Come hither <hi>Isaiah,</hi> (drawing him to him at the
same instant with a friendly hand) take deep notice
of what I am now to give thee in charge both with
respect to thy self, and my elect people that follow
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44184:10"/>
thee; say not you a confederacy to all them to whom
this people shall say a confederacy, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) let not
these frightful tidings work upon you, as they do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the common multitude with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
are so terrified and scared with the approching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that all their councels, thoughts and studies are
taken up in preventing it by making a confederacy
or league with the <hi>Assyrian;</hi> or if that cannot be, then
with some Forein power that may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them against the <hi>Assyrian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hos. 5. 13.</note> but
their eyes are not all to me for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and deliverance, they expect more from
<hi>Egypt</hi> than from Heaven; from a broken reed, than
from the rock of ages. Fear not you their fear;
Their fear drives them from God to the creature;
it first <hi>Distracts</hi> them, and then <hi>Ensnares</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary, see that thou, and all the
faithful in the land with thee do sanctifie me in your
hearts, and make me your fear, and your dread. (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
rely upon me by faith in this day of trouble, and see
that you give me the glory of my wisdom, power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and faithfulness; by relying intirely upon those my
attributes engaged for you in so many tried promises:
And do not betake your selves to such sinful and vain
shifts as those do that have no interest in me, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of me. This is the general scope and design
of the Text; wherein more particularly you have,
<list>
                           <item>1. An evil practice prohibited.</item>
                           <item>2. An effectual remedy prescribed.</item>
                           <item>3. A singular encouragement to apply that remedy.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. An evil practice prohibited, <hi>Fear not their
fear, neither be afraid.</hi> This is that sinful principle,
which was but too apt to incline them to do as others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44184:10"/>
did, <hi>scil.</hi> to say a confederacy. Sinful fears are apt to
drive the best men into sinful compliances, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
shifts to help themselves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Their fear</hi> may be understood two ways;
<list>
                           <item>1. Subjectively.</item>
                           <item>2. Effectively.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1. Subjectively,</hi> for the self same fear wherewith
the carnal and unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> feared: a fear that
enslaved them in bondage of Spirit; a fear that is the
fruit of sin, a sin in its own nature, the cause of much
sin to them, and a just punishment of God upon them
for their other sins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2. Effectively,</hi> Let not your fear produce in you
such mischievous effects as their fear doth; to make
you forget God, magnifie the creature, prefer your
own wits and policies to the Almighty power, and
unspotted faithfulness of God; if you say, but how
shall we help it?</p>
                     <p>2. Why in the next place you have, An <hi>Effectual
remedy prescribed, But sanctifie the Lord of hosts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and let him be your fear and your dread.</hi> The
fear of God will swallow up the fear of Man, a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential
awe and dread of God will extinguish the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
fear of the creature; as the Sun-shine puts out
fire; or as one fire fetches out another; so will this
fear fetch out that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By sanctifying the Lord of Hosts himself,</hi> is meant a
due ascription of the glory of his Sovereign power,
wisdom and faithfulness, not only in verbal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
acknowledgments thereof, but especially in
those internal acts of affiance, resignation, and intire
dependence on him, which as they are the choicest
respects of the creature towards its God, and give
him the greatest glory, so they are certainly the most
beneficial and comfortable acts we can perform for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44184:11"/>
our own peace and safety in times of danger.</p>
                     <p>If a man do really look to God in a day of trouble
and fear, as to the <hi>Lord of Hosts, (i. e.)</hi> one that governs
all the creatures, and all their actions; at whose beck
and command all the Armies of Heaven and Earth
are; and then can rely upon the care and love of this
God, as a child in danger of trouble reposes on, and
commits himself with greatest confidence to the care
and protection of his Father: O what peace, what
rest must necessarily follow upon this! Who would be
afraid to pass through the midst of Armed Troops
and Regiments, whilst he knows that the General of
that Army is his own Father? The more power this
filial fear of God obtains in your hearts, the less will
you dread the power of the Creature. When the
<hi>Dictator</hi> ruled at <hi>Rome,</hi> then all other <hi>Officers</hi> ceased;
and so in a great measure will all other fears where
the fear of God is <hi>Dictator</hi> in the heart. This is the
Remedy.</p>
                     <p>3. And to enable us to apply this remedy in the
worst and most difficult times, we have a singular
<hi>encouragement</hi> proposed. If we will thus sanctifie
the Lord of Hosts himself, by such an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, and child-like dependence on him in times
of danger,<note place="margin">Asyli loco.</note> then he will be to us for a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
(i. e.)</hi> he will surely protect, defend
and provide for us in the worst times and cases, then
will the Lord <hi>Create upon every dwelling-place of
mount</hi> Zion <hi>and upon her As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
<note place="margin">Praestabit vos inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessos, &amp; inviolabiles ab his regibus.</note> a cloud and smoke by
day, and the shining of a flaming
fire by night; for upon all the glory
shall be a defence, and there shall be a Tabernacle,
for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a
place of refuge and for a covert from the storm, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44184:11"/>
from rain.</hi> Let the winds roar, the rain beat, the
lightnings flash, you are in safety, and have a good
roof over your heads. Hence these two points of
Doctrine offer themselves.</p>

the fear of death, that he poured

all parts of his body.<note place="margin">Iuvenis ob levem cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam à Sixto V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> Another,
is of a Young man condemned
for a small matter by <hi>Sixtus
Quintus</hi> who was so vehemently
terrified with the fears of death,
that he shed a kind of bloudy
tears. These are strange and terrible effects of fear,
but vastly short of what Christ felt and suffered, who
grapled with a far greater evil than the Terrors of
death, even the wrath of an incensed God, poured
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44184:13"/>
out to the full, and that immediately upon him.</p>
                        <p>But yet evil, as evil, is rather the object of hatred,
than of fear, it must be an imminent or near approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
evil, which we see not how to escape or put by,
that provokes fear, and rouzes this Lion. And
therefore the Saints in glory are perfectly freed
from fear, because they are out of the reach of all
danger: Nor do we that are here in the midst of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
fear them till we see them approching us, and
we see not how to avoid them. To hear of Fire,
Plague, or the Sword in the <hi>Indies,</hi> doth not affright
us, because the evil is so remote from us: It's far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
off, we are in no danger of it; but when it
is in the Town, much more when within our own
dwellings, we tremble. Evil hurts us not by a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
apprehension of its nature, but of its union; and
all propinquity is a degree of union as
a learned Divine speaks.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Reynolds.</hi>
                           </note> And its worth
Observation that all carnal security is
maintained by putting evils at a great distance from
us. As it is noted of those secure Sensualists <hi>Amos
6. 3. they put far from them the evil day.</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not that they did, or could put the evil, one
minute farther from them in reality, but only by
imagination and fancy, they shut their own eyes
and would not see it, lest it should give an unpleasing
interruption to their mirth; and this is the reason why
death puts the living into no more fear, because it is
apprehended as remote, and at an undetermined di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
whereas if the precise time of death were
known, especially if that time were near, it would
greatly scare and terrifie.</p>
                        <p>This is the nature of natural Fear, the infelicity
of nature which we all groan under the effects of:
It is in all the creatures in some degree, but among
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44184:13"/>
them all none suffer more by it than man, for hereby
he becomes his own tormentor, nor is any torment
greater than this when it prevails in an high degree
upon us. Indeed all constitutions and tempers admit
not the same degrees of fear, some are naturally cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and stout like the <hi>Lyon</hi> for magnanimity and
fortitude, others exceeding timorous and faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like the <hi>Hare</hi> or <hi>Hart,</hi> one little dog will make
an hundred of them fear and flee before him. <hi>Luther</hi>
was a man of great courage and presence of mind in
dangers, <hi>Melancthon</hi> very timorous and subject to
despondency; thus the difference betwixt them is
expressed in one of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Letters to him, <q>I am
well nigh a secure spectator of things, and esteem
not any thing these fierce and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<hi>Melancthon</hi>'s grace had not the advantage of so stout

had. Thus briefly of natural Fear.</p>

                        <p>THere is a Fear which is formally and intrinsical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sinful, not only our infelicity, but our fault,
not our simple affliction and burden, but our great
evil and provocation; and such is the fear here dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
called <hi>Their Fear. (i. e.)</hi> the fear wherewith
carnal and unbelieving men do fear, when dangers
threaten them; and the sinfulness of it lies in five
things.</p>
                        <p>1. In the spring and cause of it, which is unbelief,
and an unworthy distrust of God, when we dare not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44184:14"/>
rely upon the security of a divine promise, nor trust
to Gods protection in the way of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> duty: This was
the very case of that people, <hi>Isai. 30. 15. Thus saith
the Lord, the holy one of Israel, in returning and rest
shall ye be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be
your strength; and ye would not, but ye said no, for we
will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and we will
ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you
be swift, one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thus stood the case, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> with a mighty
Host was ready to invade them, this puts them into
a fright, in this distress God assures them by the mouth
of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> That <hi>in returning and rest they should be saved, in quietness and confidence should be their
strength.</hi> The meaning is, never perplex your selves
with various councels and projects to secure your
selves under the wings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or any other <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
but with a composed, quiet, and calm temper
of mind rest upon my power by faith, take my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
for your security, this shall be your salvation,
and your strength, more effectual to your preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than Armies, Garisons, or any creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in the World; one act of faith shall do you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
service than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his forces can do.</p>
                        <p>But ye said no, <hi>q. d.</hi> we dare not trust to that, a
good <hi>horse</hi> will do us more service at such a time than
a good <hi>promise; Egypt</hi> is a better security in their eye
than <hi>Heaven.</hi> This is the fruit of gross infidelity.
And as wicked men do thus forsake God and cleave
to the creature in time of trouble, so there is found a
spice of this distrustfulness of God producing fear
and trouble in the best men. It was in the Disciples
themselves, <hi>Matth. 8. 26. Why are ye fearful O ye
of little faith?</hi> A Storm had befallen them at Sea,
danger began to threaten them, and presently you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44184:14"/>
find a storm within, their fears were more boisterous
than the winds, and had more need of calming than
the sea, and it was all from their unbelief, as
Christ tells them; the less their faith, the greater
their fear: If a man can but rely upon God in
a promise, so far as he is enabled to believe, so far
he will reckon himself well secured. <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Illyr. Cat. Test. lib. 19.</note>
in his Catalogue of the witnesses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
this remarkable passage of one <hi>Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Proles,</hi> a godly aged Divine who lived somewhat
before <hi>Luther,</hi> and taught many points soundly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his light then, he was called to a <hi>Synod</hi> at
<hi>Millain,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> where op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a proposition of the <hi>Pope</hi> about burdening the
Church with a new Holiday, he was brought into
much danger, and escaping very narrowly from
<hi>Rome,</hi> he bought him a <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Weapons,</hi> but as he
was riding, he began to bethink himself, That the
cause was not <hi>his</hi> but <hi>Gods,</hi> and not to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with sword and bow, and if it were, yet what could
such a decrepit old man do with weapons? Upon
which he threw away his weapons, committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his cause, and his journey to God, relied upon
his promises more than sword or bow, and came home
safe, and afterward died quietly in his bed.</p>
                        <p>2 The sinfulness of Fear lies in the excess and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderacy
of it, when we fear more than we ought;
for it may be truly said of our fears as the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
speaks of waters, <hi>difficilé suis terminis continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
'tis hard to keep them within bounds, every bush
is a Bear, every petty trouble puts us into a fright,
our fear exceeds the value and merit of the cause. 'Tis
a great sin to love or fear any creature above the rate
of a creature, as if they were Masters of all our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and eternal comforts. Thus when the men of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44184:15"/>
                           <hi>Israel</hi> heard of the confederacy and conjuction of
their enemies against them, the Text saith, <hi>their
hearts were moved, as the Trees of the wood are moved
with the wind, Isai.</hi> 7. 1. or as we use to say <hi>prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially,</hi>
like an <hi>Aspine leaf:</hi> 'tis a sad sight to behold
men shaking and quivering as the trees do in a windy
day, yet thus did the house of <hi>David,</hi> partly through
the remembrance of past calamities, but especially
through incredulity in Gods protecting care in their
present and future dangers; yea, this is too often the
fault of good men in creature fear, as well as in
creature love, to transgress the due bounds of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
'Tis noted of <hi>Iacob</hi> though a man of much
Faith, and one that had the sweetest encouragements
to strengthen it both from former experiences, and
Gods gracious promises to be with him; yet when
<hi>Esa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> was come nigh, he was <hi>greatly afraid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
Gen.</hi> 32. 7. It was but a little before that God
had graciously appeared to him, and sent a Royal
guard of Angels to attend him, even two hosts or
armies of Angels, <hi>verse 1, 2.</hi> and yet assoon as <hi>Esau</hi>
approched him, he was afraid, greatly afraid, yea,
greatly afraid and distressed, notwithstanding such an
encouraging vision as this was.</p>
                        <p>3. The sinfulness of our Fears lies in the inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them; to fear it more than we ought is bad
enough, but to magnifie its power above the power
of a creature; to exalt the power of any creature by
our fears, and give it such an Ascendent over us, as
if it had an Arbitrary and absolute dominion over us,
or over our comforts, to do with them what it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
this is to put the creature out of its own Class
and rank, into the place of God, and is therefore a
very sinful and evil fear.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>trust</hi> in any creature as if it had the power of a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44184:15"/>
God to <hi>help</hi> us, or to <hi>fear</hi> any creature, as if it had the
power of a God to <hi>hurt</hi> us, is exceeding sinful, and
highly provoking to God. This inordinate trust is
taxed and condemned in <hi>Isai.</hi> 31. 3. They would
needs go down to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, and trust in their
horses and horsemen, because they were strong <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
in their opinion they were able to secure them against
all those dangers the Prophet from the Lords own
mouth had threatned them with, but to take them off
from this sinful and inordinate dependence on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he tells them, <hi>v. 3. Now the</hi> Egyptians <hi>are men
and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit, when
the Lord shall stretch forth his hand, both he that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down; and
they shall fail together,</hi> q. d.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a sinful and dangerous mistake for one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to give that trust and dependence to another
creature, which is due only to God, to look upon men
as if they were Gods, and horses as if they were Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
All creatures, even the strongest, are but as the
Hop, the Vine, or the Ivy, if they clasp about the
pole, the wall, or the oak; they may be supported,
as you also may by leaning upon God, but if they
depend, and intangle themselves one upon another,
as you and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> do, you shall fail, and fall all
together.</p>
                        <p>And as one creature is apt inordinately and sinfully
thus to trust and lean upon another; so there is as great
a proness in the creatures inordinately to fear and
dread each other, as if the creature feared were rather
a God, than a man, rather a Spirit than flesh; and
thus our fear magnifies and exalts the creature, and
puts it as it were into the room and place of God. This
was the sin which God rebuked in his own people,
<hi>Isai 51. 12, 13. I even I am he that comforteth thee,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44184:16"/>
who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of man
that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made
as grass, and forgettest the Lord thy maker,</hi> &amp;c. See
how fear exalts man, and depresseth God, it thinks
upon the noxious power of men so much, that it
forgets the saving power of God, as if that stood for
nothing; thus a mortal worm that shall perish as the
grass, eclipses the glory of the great God, that stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
earth.</p>
                        <p>And this was the evil against which Christ caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own <hi>Disciples</hi> in <hi>Matth. 10. 28. Fear not them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul;
but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell.</hi> q. d. Have a care you never fear any
man, be he armed with never so much power, and
rage; as if the power of making or marring you for
ever were in his hands, as if you lay at the feet of his
will and pleasure to be saved or ruined for ever.
Fear not him that can only touch your bodies as if he
would damn your souls, invest not any creature with
the sovereign and incommunicable power of God.</p>
                        <p>4. The sinfulness of Fear consists in the distracting
influence it hath upon the hearts of men, whereby it
discomposeth and unfits them for the discharge of their
duties.</p>
                        <p>Fear sometimes puts men into such an hurry, and
their thoughts into such disorder, that for the present
they have scarce any succour or relief from their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or from their reason; for under an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fear both grace and reason like the wheels of a
watch wound above its due height, stand still, and
have no motion at all. It is rare to find a man of that
largeness and constancy of heart and mind in a day of
fear, that was found in <hi>Iehoshaphat, 2 Chro. 20. 2, 3.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44184:16"/>
Then there came some that told</hi> Jehoshaphat <hi>saying,
there cometh a great multitude against thee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

(<hi>i. e.</hi>) he composed and fixed his heart for Prayer
in the time of so great a fright, and terrible an Alarm:
But it is rare to find such constancy and eveness of
mind as this; in like cases it is with most in great frights,
as the <hi>Prophet</hi> describes the condition of the Jews,
<hi>Isaiah 22. 2, 3.</hi> when the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
and the enemy came under the walls of it; that
which a little before was the <hi>joyous City,</hi> or as some
read, the revelling City, is now in such a panick
fear, that it is full of stirs and tumults, some run up
to the tops of the houses either to hide or bewail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or take a view of the dreadful enemy without;
others prevent the sword of the enemy, and die by fear
before hand, their own apprehensions of misery killed
them before the sword of any other enemy once
touched them, but you read of none that ran into their
closets to seek the Lord; the city was full of stirrs,
but not of prayers; alas, Fear made them cry to the
mountains, rather than to God, <hi>ver. 5.</hi> The best
men find it hard to keep their thoughts from wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and their minds from distraction in the greatest
calm of peace, but a thousand times harder in the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and tumults of fear.</p>
                        <p>5. The sinfulness of Fear consists in the power it
hath to dispose and incline men to the use of sinful
means to put by their danger, and to cast them into
the hands and power of temptation. <hi>The fear of
man bringeth a snare, Prov.</hi> 29. 25. or puts and lays
a snare before him; Satan spreads the net, and Fear
like the stalking horse drives men right into it. It
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44184:17"/>
was fear which drew <hi>Abraham</hi> that great believer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the snare of dissimulation, to the great disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, for it was somewhat an odd sight
to see <hi>Abimelech</hi> an heathen so schooling an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
for it, as he did <hi>Gen</hi> 20. 9. And for the same
evil you find God chiding his people in <hi>Isaiah 57. 11.
And of whom hast thou been afraid, or feared that
thou hast lied, and hast not remembred me?</hi> There is a
double lie occasioned by Fear, one in <hi>words,</hi> another
in <hi>deeds:</hi> Hypocrisie is a lie done, a practical lie, and
our Church History abounds with sad examples of
dissimulation through fear: 'tis Satans great engine
to make his Tempations victorious and successful with
men.</p>

fear is a pure or simple passion of the Soul: Sinful
fear is the disordered and corrupt passion of the soul;
but this is the natural passion sanctified, and thereby
changed and baptized into the name and nature of a
Spiritual grace. This fear is also mentioned in my
Text, and prescribed as an Antidote against sinful
fears; it devours carnal fears as <hi>Moses</hi> serpent did
those of the <hi>Enchanters.</hi> It's one of the sorest judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                           <hi>This Fear is</hi> a gracious habit or principle planted by
God in the soul, whereby the soul is kept under an holy
awe of the eye of God, and from thence is inclined to
perform and do what pleaseth him, and to shun and
avoid whatsoever he forbids and hates.</p>
                        <p>1. It is planted in the soul as a permanent and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
habit, it is not of the natural growth and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of mans heart, but of supernatural infusion and
implantation. <hi>Ier. 32. 40. I will put my fear into

fear God is wholly supernatural.</p>
                        <p>2. This gracious fear puts the soul under the awe of
Gods eye, <hi>Psal. 119. 161. my heart standeth in awe
of thy word.</hi> 'Tis the reproach of the servants of men
to be <hi>eye-servants,</hi> but it is the praise and honour of
Gods servants to be so.</p>
                        <p>3. This respect to the eye of God inclines them to
perform and do whatsoever pleaseth him, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by him; hence fearing God, and working
righteousness are connected and linked together,
<hi>Acts.</hi> 10. 35. If we truly fear God, we dare not but
do the things he commands, and if his fear be exalted
in our hearts to an high degree, it will enable us to
obey him in duties accompanied with deepest self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,

all Societies must disband
and break up. We say, and the
observation is sure, he that fears not his own, may
easily be master of another mans life. 'Tis law, and
fear of punishment that keeps the World in order;
men are afraid to do evil, because they are afraid to
suffer it, they see the Law hath inseparably linked
penal and moral evils together, if they will presume
upon the one, they must necessarily pull the other
upon them too; and this keeps them in some order,
and decorum; there would be no order or security
without Law; but if Laws had no annexed penalties
to inforce them and give them their Sanction as
good there were no Laws; they would have no more
power to restrain the corruptions of mens hearts,
than the new cords or green withs had to bind <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
And yet if the severest penalties in the world,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44184:19"/>
were annexed to, or appointed by the Law, they
could signifie nothing to the ends of Government
without Fear. This is that tender sensible power or
passion on which threatnings work, and so brings
men under moral government and restraint, <hi>Rom. 13.
3, 4. Magistrates are a terror to evil works; wilt
thou not then be afraid of the power? but if thou do
that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the

we read in <hi>2 Kings</hi> 17. 25. that God sent Lyons

neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest, but the Lord
shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of

and shalt have no assurance of thy life; in the morning
thou shalt say, would God it were Even, and at Even
thou shalt say would God it were morning, for the fear
of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the
sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</hi> When fear hath
once seized the heart, you may see deaths colours
displayed in the face. What a dismal life do they live,
who have neither any peace by day, nor rest by night,
but wearisom days and nights are appointed to them.
The days of such men are tiresome days, they wish
for the night hoping it may give them a little rest,

and meditate terrour, and then, O that it were day

                           <head>3. The use of Religious Fear.</head>
                           <p>If God can make such fruit to grow upon such a
bramble as the sinful slavish fear of man is, what may
we expect from Religious Fear, a choice root of his
own spirits planting? The uses and benefits hereof
are innumerable, and inestimable, but I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
and will only instance in three special uses
of it.</p>
                           <p>1. By this Fear the people of God are excited to,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44184:21"/>
and confirmed in the way of their duty. <hi>Eccles. 12. 13.
Fear God, and keep his commandments.</hi> It is <hi>Custos
utriusque Tabulae,</hi> the keeper of both Tables; because
the duties of both Tables are influenced by it. 'Tis this
Fear of God that makes us have a due respect to all
his commands, and it is as powerful to confirm us in,
as it is to excite us to our duties, <hi>Ier. 32. 40. I will
put my fear into their inwards, and they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me.</hi> Look as he that soweth doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the winds, but goes on in his labour whatever
weather the face of Heaven threatens; so he that fears
God will be found in the way of his duty, let the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the times be never so lowring and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and truly, this is no small advantage in times
of frights and distractions. Slavish fear sets a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Devils ground, Religious fear upon Gods
ground; and how vast an odds is there in the choice
of our ground, when we are to endure a great fight of
affliction.</p>

the purity and peace of our Consciences, by

The fear of the Lord is to depart from evil.</hi> See how
it kept <hi>Ioseph, Gen.</hi> 39. 9. and <hi>Nehemiah, chap.</hi>
5. 15. And this benefit is invaluable, especially
in a day of outward calamity and distress; look in
what degree the fear of God prevails in our hearts,
answerable thereunto will the serenity, peace, and
quietness of our Consciences be; and proportionable
unto that will our strength and comfort be in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

they have no power against us, but what is given
them from above, and that it's usual with God to cramp
their hands, and clap on the bands of restraint upon
them when their hearts are fully set in them to do
mischief; did we see and consider them as they are in

policy, <hi>Isai.</hi> 45. 13.</p>
                           <p>5. But especially the fears of good men arise out of
their ignorance and inconsiderateness of the <hi>Covenant
of Grace.</hi> If we were better acquainted with the
nature, extent, and stability of the Covenant, our
hearts would be much freed thereby from these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

a universal remedy against all our fears, upon spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

                           <p>2. Another cause and fountain of Sinful Fear, is
guilt upon the Conscience: A servant of sin cannot
but first or last be a slave of Fear, and they that have
done evil, cannot chuse but expect evil, no sooner
had <hi>Adam</hi> defiled and wounded his Conscience with
guilt, but he presently trembles and hides himself,
so it is with his children, God calls to him not in a
threatning, but gentle dialect, not in a tempest,
but in the cool of the day, yet it terrifies him, there

Conscience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. 'Tis <hi>Seneca</hi>'s obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,

said, <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 21. That <hi>a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

noise of his own Conscience which sounds nothing in
his ears, but misery, wrath, and hell; we may say
of all wicked men in their frights as <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth of

that monster of wickedness would start at any
suddain noise, being haunted with the furies of his
own evil conscience. <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. after his bloudy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44184:24"/>
and barbarous Massacre of the Protestants, could
neither sleep nor wake without musick to divert his
thoughts. And our <hi>Richard</hi> the Third after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his two innocent Nephews, saw divers ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
or shapes like Devils in his sleep, pulling and
haling him. Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> tells of a <hi>Iesuit</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi>
who being followed by one that had found his
Glove, out of no other design but to restore it to him,
but being pursued by his own guilty Conscience also,
he leaped over the next hedge and was drowned. And
remarkable is that which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates of <hi>Cardinal
Cresentius</hi> who fancied the devil walking in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and sometimes couching under his Table as he
was writing Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> against the Protestants.
<hi>Impius tantum metuit, quantum nocuit,</hi> so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
as Conscience tells them they have done, so much
it bids them expect. <hi>Wolfius</hi> tells us of one <hi>Iohn
Hofmeister</hi> who fell sick with the very terrours of his
own Conscience in his Inn, as he was travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Auspurge</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and was frighted by his
own Conscience to that degree that they were fain to
bind him in his bed with chains, and all that they
could get from him was, I am cast away for ever, I
have grievously wounded my own Conscience.</p>
                           <p>To this wounded and trembling conscience is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

An evil and guilty Conscience foments fears and
terrours three ways.</p>
                           <p>1. by aggravating small matters and blowing them
up to the height of the most fatal and destructive evils;
so it was with <hi>Cain, Gen. 4. 14. Every one that meets
me will slay me.</hi> Now every child was a <hi>Giant</hi> in his
eye, and any body he met, his over-match. A guilty
Conscience gives a man no sight of his enemy, but
through a magnifying, or a multiplying glass.</p>
                           <p>2 It begets Fears, by interpreting all doubtful
cases in the worst sense that can befastened upon them;
<hi>Pessimus in dubiis Augur timor.</hi> If the <hi>Swallows</hi> do
but chatter in the chimney, <hi>Bessus</hi> interprets it to
be a discovery of his crime, that they are telling take
of him, and saying, <hi>Bessus</hi> killed a man. Nay,</p>
                           <p>3 If a guilty Conscience have nothing to aggravate,
and magnifie, nor any doubtful matter to interpret
in a frightful sense, it can and often doth create fears

                           <p>3. We see what a forge of Fears a guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is, and no less is the sin of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> the real and
proper cause of most distracting and afflictive fears;
so much as our Souls are empty of <hi>faith,</hi> they are in
times of trouble filled with <hi>fear:</hi> We read of some
that have died by no other hand but their own fears;
but we never read of any that died by fear, who were
once brought to live by faith: If men would but dig
to the root of their fears, they should certainly find
unbelief there, <hi>Matth. 8. 26. Why are ye fearful, Oye
of little faith?</hi> The less faith still the more fear: Fear
is generated by unbelief, and unbelief strengthened
by fear, as in nature there is an observable <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>
circular generation, vapours beget showers, and
showers new vapours; so it is in things moral, and
therefore all the skill in the world can never cure us of
the disease of fear, till God first cure us of our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44184:26"/>
Christ therefore took the right method, to rid
the disciples of their fear, by rebuking their unbelief.
The remains of this sin in Gods own people is the cause
and fountain of their fears, and more particularly to
shew how fear is generated by unbelief, let a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
be heedfully adverted.</p>
                           <p>1. Unbelief weakens and stumbles the assenting act
of Faith, and thereby cuts off from the soul in a
great measure its principal relief against dangers and
troubles. It is the use and office of Faith to reallize
to the Soul the invisible things of the world to come,
and thereby encourage it against the fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the present world: Thus <hi>Moses forsook Egypt,
not fearing the wrath of the King, for he endured, as
seeing him that is invisible, Heb.</hi> 11. 27. If this assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
act of Faith be weakned or staggered in the soul,
if once invisibles seem uncertainties, and visibles the
only realities, no wonder we are so scared and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when these visible and sensible comforts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and endangered, as they often are, and will be
in this mutable world. That man must needs be afraid
to stand his ground, that is not throughly perswaded
the ground he stands on is firm and good; 'tis not to
be wondred that men should tremble, who seem to
feel the ground shake and reel under them.</p>
                           <p>2. Unbelief shuts up the refuges of the Soul in the
Divine promises, and by leaving it
without those refuges,<note place="margin">multa fidem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa levant.</note> must needs
leave it in the hands of fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
That which fortifies and emboldens a Christian in
evil times, is his dependence upon God for protection,
<hi>Psal. 143. 9. I flie unto thee to hide me.</hi> The cutting off
of this retreat (which nothing but unbelief can do)
deprives the soul of all those succours and supports
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44184:27"/>
which the promises afford, and consequently fills the
heart with anxiety and fear.</p>
                           <p>3. Unbelief makes men negligent and careless in
providing for troubles before they come, and so brings
them by way of surprize upon them, and the more
surprizing any evil is, the more frightful it is always
found to be; we cannot think that <hi>Noah</hi> was so
affrighted at the Flood when it began to swell above
all the hills and mountains as all the rest of the world
was, nor was there any reason that he should, having
foreseen it by Faith, and made provision for it, <hi>Heb.
11. 7. By faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, prepared
an Ark.</hi>

and it was well there was not; for the <hi>Goths</hi> a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
people breaking into that City, like so many
Devils fell upon the prey, those that trusted to the
treasures which they had, were deceived and ruined
by them; for the rich were put to tortures to confess
where they had hid their moneys: This good <hi>Bishop</hi>
fell into their hands and lost all he had, but was scarce
moved at the loss, as appears by his prayer which my
<hi>Author</hi> relates thus, <hi>Lord let me not be troubled for my
gold and silver, thou knowest it is not my treasure, that
I have laid up in heaven, according to thy command.
I was warned of this judgment before it came, and
provided for it, and where all my interest lies. Lord

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44184:27"/>
to morrow you must be burned, and your

<hi>Lord I thank thee I have looked for this a great while,
it is not terrible to me, God make me worthy of such a

for sufferings.</p>
                           <p>4. Unbelief leaves our dearest interests and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
in our own hands, it commits nothing to God,
and consequently must needs fill the heart with distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
fears when eminent dangers threaten us. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if this be thy case, thou wilt be a <hi>Magor missabib</hi>
surrounded with terrours, whensoever thou shalt be
surrounded with dangers and troubles. Believers in
this as well as in many other things have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of thee, that they have committed all that is
precious and valuable to them, into the hands of God
by Faith, to him they have committed the keeping
of their souls, 1 Pet. 4. 19. and all their eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. And these being put into

Eccles.</hi> 9. 2. That when the sword is drawn, God
suffers it to cut off the righteous and the wicked, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
21. 3. The Sword makes no difference, where God
hath made so great a difference by grace, it neither
distinguishes faces, nor breasts, but is assoon sheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bowels of the best, as of the worst of men;
when we read how the same fire of Gods indignation,
devours the green tree and the dry tree, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.
47. How the basket of good figs (the Embleme of
the best men of those times) were carried into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
as well as the bad, <hi>Ier.</hi> 24. 5. How the flesh of
Gods Saints hath been given for meat to the fowls of
heaven, and to the beasts of the field, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 12.
and how the wicked have devoured the man that is
more righteous than himself as it is <hi>Habak.</hi> 1. 13. I
say when we observe such things in Scripture, and
find our observations confirmed by the accounts and
histories of former and later ages, when we reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the unspeakable miseries and butcheries of those
plain hearted and precious servants of Christ, the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenses</hi>
and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> how they fell as a prey to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44184:28"/>
their cruel adversaries notwithstanding the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
simplicity and holiness of their lives, and all their
fervent cries, and appeals to God, how the very
flower of the reformed Protestant interest in <hi>France</hi>
was cut off with more than barbarous inhumanity, so
that the Streets were washed, and the Canals of <hi>Paris</hi>
ran with their precious bloud.</p>
                           <p>What horrid and unparallelled tortures the servants
of God felt in that cruel Massacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a history
too tragical for a tender hearted Reader to stay long
upon: And how in our own Land, the most eminent
Ministers and Christians were sent to heaven in a fiery
chariot in those doleful <hi>Marian</hi> day: I say when we
read and consider such things as these, it rouzes our
fears, and puts us into frights when we see our selves
threatned with the same enemies and dangers; when
the feet of them that carried out the dear servants of
God in bloudy winding sheets to their graves, stand
at the door to carry us forth next, if providence loose
their chain, and give them a permission so to do; and
our fears on this account are heightned by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and revolving these four things in our thoughts,
which we are always more inclined to do, than the
things that should fortifie our faith, and heighten our
Christian courage; as,</p>
                           <p>1. We are very apt to consider that as the same
race and kind of men that committed these outrages
upon our brethren, are still in being and that their
rage and malice is not abated in the least degree, but
is as fierce and cruel as ever it was, <hi>Gal. 4. 29. As
then he that was born after the flesh, perseouted him
that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</hi> So
it was then, and just so it is still, the old enmity is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
upon all wicked men from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<hi>multi adhuc sunt qui clavum sanguine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44184:29"/>
Abelis rubentem adhuc circumferunt. Cain</hi>'s club is
to this day carried up and down the world stained with
the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> as <hi>Bucholtzer</hi> speaks; 'tis a rooted
antipathy, and it runs in a bloud, and will run as long
as there are wicked men from whom and to whom it
shall be propagated, and a devil in hell, by whom it
will not fail to be exasperated and irritated.</p>
                           <p>2. We know also that nothing hinders the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their wicked purposes against us, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
of providence; should God loose the chain,
and give them leave to act forth the malice and rage
that is in their hearts, no pity would be shewen by
them, or could be rationally expected from them,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 124. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We live among Lions, and
them that are set on fire of hell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 4. the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reason of our safety is this, that he who is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Lions is also the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
                           <p>3. We find that God hath many times let loose
these Lions upon his people, and given them leave
to tear his lambs in pieces, and suck the bloud of his
Saints; how well soever he loves them, yet hath he
often delivered them into the hands of his enemies,
and suffered them to perpetuate and act the greatest
cruelties upon them; the best men have suffered the
worst things, and the Histories of all ages have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
down unto us the most tragical relations of
their barbarous usage.</p>
                           <p>4. We are also conscious to our selves how fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than in them, and therefore have no reason to please
our selves with the fond imaginations of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exemptions. If we think these evils shall not come
in our days, 'tis like many of them thought so too,
and yet they did, and we may find it quite otherwise,
<hi>Lam. 4. 12. Who would have thought that the enemy
should have entered in at the gates of Ierusalem?</hi> The
revolving of these and such like considerations in our
thoughts, and mixing our own unbelief with them
creates a world of fears even in good men, till by
resignation of all to God, and acting faith upon the
promises that assure us of the sanctification of all our
troubles, as that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. Gods presence with us
in our troubles, as that <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 15. his moderation

they are supportable, <hi>Isai.</hi> 27. 8. And the safe and

                           <p>5. Our immoderate love of life, and the comforts
and conveniencies thereof may be assigned as a proper
and real ground and cause of our sinful fears, when
the dangers of the times threaten the one or other:
did we love our lives less, we should fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
less than we do. It is said of those renowned
Saints, <hi>Rev. 12. 11. They overcame by the blood of
the Lamb, and by the word of their Testimony, and
they loved not their lives unto the Death.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They overcame, not only the fury of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
without them, but their sinful fears within them;
and this victory was atchieved by their mortification,
to the inordinate and immoderate love of life, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44184:30"/>
their own fears had overcome them, if they
had not first overcome the love of life: It was
not therefore without very great reason that our
Lord injoyned it upon all his disciples and followers,
to <hi>hate their own lives, Luke</hi> 14. 26. not absolutely,
but in comparison and competition with him, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to
love it in so remiss a degree, as to slight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
it as a poor low thing in such a comparison, he
foresaw what sharp tryals and sufferings were coming
upon them, and he knew if the fond and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
love of life were not overcome and mortified in
them, it would make them warp and bend under such
temptations.</p>
                           <p>This was it that freed <hi>Paul</hi> from slavish fears, and
made him so magnanimous and undaunted; indeed
he had less fear upon his spirit though he was to suffer
those hard and sharp things in his own person, than
his friends had who only Sympathized with him, and
were not farther concerned than by their own love
and pity: He spake like a man who was rather a
spectator than a sufferer, <hi>Acts 20. 24, 25. none of
these things move me,</hi> saith he, Great soul! not moved
with bonds and afflictions? how did he attain so great
courage and constancy of mind in such deep and
dreadful sufferings? It was enough to have moved
the stoutest man in the world, yea, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
the resolutions of any that had not loved
Christ better than his own life; but life was a trifle to
him in comparison with Jesus Christ, for so he tells
us in the next words, <hi>I count not my life dear unto me;
q. d.</hi> 'Tis a low priz'd commodity in my eyes, not
worth the saving or regarding on such sinful terms:
O how many have parted with Christ, peace, and
eternal life, for fear of losing that which <hi>Paul</hi> regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not. And if we bring our thoughts closer to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44184:30"/>
matter, we shall soon find that this is a fountain o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>
fears in times of danger, and that from this excessive
love of life, we are rack'd and tortured with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
terrors. For,</p>
                           <p>1. Life is the greatest and nearest interest men
naturally have in this world, and that which wraps
up all other inferiour interests in it self, <hi>Iob 2. 4. Skin
for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his
life.</hi> It is a real truth, though it came from the
mouth of the father of lies; afflictions never touch
the quick till they touch the life; liberty, estates, and
other accommodations in this world receive their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and estimation from hence, if life be cut off these
accidents perish, and are of no account. <hi>Gen. 25. 32.
Behold, I am at the point to die, (said</hi> Esau) <hi>and
what profit shall this birthright do to me?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. Life being naturally the dearest interest of men
in this world, the richest treasure, and most beloved
thing on earth to a natural man; that which strikes
at, and endangers life, must in his eyes be the greatest
evil that can befall him; on this account death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
terrible to men, yea, as <hi>Iob</hi> calls it, the <hi>King
of Terrors, Iob</hi> 18. 14. The black prince or the
prince of clouds and darkness, as some translate those
words: Yea, so terrible is death upon this account,
that the very fear of it hath sometimes precipitated
men into the hands of it, as we sometimes observe in
times of pestilence,<note place="margin">Nonnullos ob timorem morte subitanea peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse refert Galenus. Quod igitur homo, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more mortis quae est terribilissima, ex sententia <hi>Aristotleis</hi> alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum<expan>

3. Though death be terrible in any shape, in the
mildest form it can appear in; yet a violent and
bloudy death by the hands of cruel and merciless men,
is the most terrible form that death can appear in; 'tis
now the King of terrors indeed, in the most ghastly
representation and frightful form, in its scarlet Robes,
and terrifying formalities. In a violent death all the
barbarous cruelty that the wit of our enemies can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
or their malice inflict, is mingled together;
in a violent death are many deaths contrived into one,
and it oftentimes approaches men by such slow and
deliberate paces, that they feel every tread of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

as it advanceth towards them. <hi>Moriatur, ut sentiat
se mori,</hi> Let him so die, (said the Tyrant) that he
may feel himself to die, yea, and how he dies by
inch-meal or slow and lingring degrees; this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
frightful, especially to those that are of a
more soft and tender nature and temper, who must
needs be struck through with the terrours of death,
except the Lord arm them against it with the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a better life, and sweeten these bitter appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
by the foretasts of it. This is enough of put
even sanctified nature into a consternation, and make
a very gracious heart to sink, unless it be so upheld by
Divine strength and comfort: And hence come ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
very many of our fears, and terrors, especially
when the same enemies that have been accustomed to

<hi>Iob</hi> 1. 19. He can raise the loftiest winds, pour
down roaring showers, rattle in the air with fearful
claps of thunder, and scare the lower world with
terrible flashes of lightning. And I doubt not but

and can raise more terrible storms and tempests within

leave from God approach our <hi>Phantasies,</hi> disturb
and trouble them exceedingly by forming frightful
Idea's there; for Satan not only works upon men
mediately by the ministry of their external senses,
but by reason of his Spiritual angelical nature, he
can have immediate access to the internal sense also,
as appears by diabolical dreams, and by practising
upon that power of the Soul, he influences the pasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, and puts it under very dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and consternations: Now if Satan can provoke
and exasperate the fury and rage of wicked men, as
it is evident he can do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. and so disturb
our Fansies and influence our passions, as there is
no reason to doubt but by leave from God he can do,
as well as he can go to the magazines and store-houses
of thunder, lightnings, and storms. O what inward
storms of Fear, can he shake our hearts withal, and
if God give him but a permission how ready will he be
to do it? seeing it is so conducible to his design: for by
putting men into such frights he at once weakens
their hands in duty as is plain from his attempt this
way upon Nehemiah, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 13. and if he prevail
there, he drives them into the snares, and trains of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44184:32"/>
his temptations, as the fisherman and fowler do the
birds and fishes into their nets, when once they have
flusht and frighted them out of their coverts. And
thus you have some account of the principal and true
causes of our Sinful Fears.</p>

                           <p>It is very remarkable, that when the Apostle was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to them a single life as most eligible; where it

upon the Lord without distractions, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 35. He
foresaw what streights, cares, and fears must unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
distract them in such times that were most clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and incumbred with families, and relations; when
a man should be thinking, O what shall I do now to
to get my doubts and fears resolved about my interest
in Christ? How may I so behave my self in my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44184:33"/>
to unfit us for our present duties, and destroy our
comfort therein; for if by frights and terrors of mind
he can but once distract our thoughts, he gains three
great points upon us, to our unspeakable loss.</p>
                           <p>1. Hereby he will cut off the freedom and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our communion with God in duties, and what
an empty shell will the best duties be, when this ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
is wormed out by such a subtle artifice? Prayer
as <hi>Damascen</hi> aptly expresses it, is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> the
ascension of the mind or soul to God; but distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
clips its wings; he can never offer up his soul and
thoughts to God, that hath not the possession of them
himself; and he that is under distracting fears pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
not himself. The life of all communion with
God in Prayer, consists in the harmony that is betwixt
our hearts and words, and both with the will of God,
this harmony is spoiled by distractions, and so Satan
gains that point.</p>
                           <p>2. But this is not all he gains, and we lose by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
fears; for as they cut off the freedom and
sweetness of our intercourse with God in prayer, so
they cut off the Soul from the succours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs
it might otherwise draw from the promises. We
find when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in great bondage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their minds were distracted with fears and sorrows,
they regarded not the supporting promises of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
sent them by <hi>Moses, Exod. 6. 9. David</hi> had
an express and particular promise of the Kingdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the mouth of God, which must needs include
his deliverance out the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> and all his stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems

is at the same point, <hi>Psal. 116. 11. All men are liars,</hi>
not excepting <hi>Samuel</hi> himself who had assured him of
the Kingdom. This is always the property and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of fear (as I shewed before) to make men distrust
the best security when they are in eminent peril: But
Oh what a mischief is this! to make us suspicious of
the promises which are our chief relief and support
in times of trouble: Our fears will unfit us for prayer,
they will also shake the credit of the promises with us,
and so great is the damage we receive both ways, that
it were better for us to lose our two eyes, than two such
advantages in trouble. But,</p>
                           <p>3. This is not all, by our present fears we lose the
benefit and comfort of all our past experiences, and
the singular relief we might have from all that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and goodness of God which our eyes have
seen in former streights and dangers, the present fear
clouds them all, <hi>Isai.</hi> 51. 12, 13. Men and dangers
are so much minded, that God is forgotten, even the
God that hath hitherto preserved us, though our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
fears told us, the enemy was daily ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us. All these sweet reliefs are cut off from us by
our distracting fears, and that at a time when we
have most need of them.</p>

                           <p>Dissimulation and Hypocrisie is the fruit of slavish
Fear; distraction you see is bad enough, but dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is worse than distraction, and yet as bad as it is,
fear hath driven good men into this snare; it will
make even an upright soul warp and bend from the
rules of that integrity and candor which should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
at all times from a Christian: Of whom
(saith God to his <hi>Israel</hi>) hast thou been afraid, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44184:34"/>
thou hast lied, and hast not remembred me? God
finds falshood, and charges it upon Fear, <hi>q. d.</hi> I know
it was against the resolutions of my peoples hearts
thus to dissemble, this certainly is the effect of a
fright; Who is he that hath scared you into this evil?
It was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fear that made him dissemble to the
reproach of his Religion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 2, 11. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was but an odd sight to see an heathen so
schooling and reproving great <hi>Abraham</hi> about it as he
there doth.</p>
                           <p>It was nothing but fear that drew his son <hi>Isaac</hi> into
the like snare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 7. And it was fear that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Peter</hi> against his promise as well as principle to
say concerning his dear Saviour, <hi>I know not the man,
Matth.</hi> 26. 69. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> at that time remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and acted his Faith freely upon what the Lord
said to him, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. Fear not</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy
shield,</hi> he had escaped both the sin and shame into
which he fell, but even that great believer was
foiled by his own fears; and certainly this is a great
evil, a complicated mischief. For,</p>
                           <p>1. By these falls and scandals, Religion is made vile
and contemptible in the eyes of the world, it reflects
with much reproach upon God and his promises, as
if his word were not sufficient security for us to rely
upon in times of trouble, as if it were safer trusting
to our wit, yea, to sin; than to the Promises.</p>
                           <p>2. It greatly weakens the hands of others, and
proves a sore discouragement to them in their trials, to
see their brethren faint for fear, and ashamed to own
their principles; sometimes it hath this mischievous
effect, but it is always improved by Satan and wicked
men to this purpose. And,</p>
                           <p>3. It will be a terrible blow and wound to our own
Consciences, for such flaws in our integrity we may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44184:34"/>
be kept waking and sighing many a night; O see the
mischiefs of a timorous and faint spirit!</p>

                           <p>Slavish Fears of the Creature exceedingly streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our temptations in times of danger, and make
them very efficacious and prevalent upon us. <hi>Prov.
29. 25. The fear of man brings a snare.</hi> Satan spreads
the net, but we are not within its reach, till our own
fears drive us into it; the recoyling of our spirits
from some eminent danger, may cause the pulse of a
true Christian to intermit and faulter, how regular
soever it beats at other times, this will cause great
trepidation and timidity in men that are sincere and
upright, and that is it that brings the snare over their
souls. <hi>Aaron</hi> was a good man, and Idolatry he knew
to be a great sin, yet fear prevailed with that good
man to give too much way to that great evil, <hi>Exod.
32. 22. Thou knowest the people that they are set upon
mischief,</hi> saith he in his own excuse, in the matter of
the golden calf, <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord I durst do no otherwise at
that time, the people were violently and passionately
set upon it; had I resisted them, it might have cost me
dear.</p>
                           <p>It was fear that prevailed with <hi>Origen</hi> to yield so
far as he did in offering incense to the <hi>Idol,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which fact brake his heart to pieces. It
was nothing but fear that made <hi>David</hi> play the fool,
and act so dishonourably as he did, <hi>I Sam.</hi> 21. 12.
Fear is a snare in which Satan hath caught as many
souls as in any other of his stratagems and toyls what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
It were easy to give instances, so many and
so sad, as would inlarge this head even to tediousness,
but I chuse rather to come to the particulars wherein
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44184:35"/>
the danger of this snare of the Devil consists. And,</p>
                           <p>1. Herein lies the ensnaring danger of sinful fear,
that it drives men out of their proper station, out of
their place and duty, beside which there is none to be
found but what is Satans ground. The subtle enemy of
our salvation is aware that we are out of Gun shot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his reach, whilst we abide with God in the way
of our duty, that the Lord is with us, whilst we are
with him, and there is no attempting our ruine under
the wings of his protection. If ever therefore he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to do any thing upon us, he must get us off that
ground, and from under those wings, and there is
nothing like fear to do this; then we are as the birds
that are wandring from their nests, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 8. or
like <hi>Shimei</hi> out of his limits.</p>
                           <p>2. Fear is usually the first passion in the soul that
beats a parley with the enemy, and treats with the
tempter about terms of rendition; and as the <hi>French</hi>
proverb is, <hi>The Castle that parlies, is half wone.</hi> 'Tis
fear that consults with flesh and bloud, whilst faith is
ingaged with God for the supply of strength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the siege; we have a sad and doleful instance of
this in <hi>Spira,</hi> he tells us how his own fears betrayed
him, by parlying with the tempter, for thus Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
in the History of his life records the occasion of his
fall. <q>Whilst <hi>Spira</hi> was tossing upon the restless
waves of doubts, without Guide to trust to, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to flee to for succour; on the sudden, Gods
spirit assisting, he felt a calm, and began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
with himself in this manner: Why wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
thou thus in uncertainties? Unhappy man!
cast away fear, put on thy shield of faith; where is
thy wonted courage, thy goodness, thy constancy?
Remember that Christs glory lies at the stake, suffer
then without fear, and he will defend thee, he will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44184:35"/>
tell thee what thou shalt answer; he can beat down
all danger, bring thee out of prison, raise thee from
the dead: consider <hi>Peter</hi> in the dungeon, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
in the fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>Now was <hi>Spira</hi> in reasonable quiet, being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to yield to those weighty reasons; yet holding
it wisdom to examine all things, he consults also
with flesh and bloud; thus the battel renews, and
the flesh begins in this manner: Be well advised,
fond man, consider reasons on both sides, and then
judge, how canst thou thus overween thine own
sufficiency, as thou neither regardest the examples
of thy progenitors, nor the judgment of the whole
Church; dost thou not consider what misery this
days rashness will bring thee unto? Thou shalt lose all
thy substance gotten with so much care and travel,
thou shalt undergo the most exquisite torments that
malice it self can devise, thou shalt be counted an
Heretick of all, and to close up all, thou shalt die
shamefully. What thinkest thou of the loathsome
stinking Dungeon, the bloudy Ax, the burning
Faggot? Are they delightful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus through
fear he first parlied with the Tempter, consulted
with flesh and bloud, and at last fainted and
yielded.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. 'Tis fear that makes men impatient of waiting
Gods time and method of deliverance, and so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates
the soul, and drives it into the snare of the next
temptation, <hi>Isai. 51. 14. The Captive exile hasteth
to be delivered out of the pit.</hi> any way or means of
escape that comes next to hand, saith Fear, is better
than to lie here in the pit; and when the soul is thus
prepared by its own fears, it becomes an easy
prey to the next temptation, by all which you see the
mischief that comes by fear in times of danger.</p>

faints and yields upon every slight assault; it extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
all Christian courage and magnanimity
where ever it prevails, and therefore you find it joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
frequently in the Scriptures with discouragement,
<hi>Deut. 1. 21. Fear not, neither be discouraged with
fainting and trembling. Deut. 20. 3. Let not your
hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble;</hi> with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayedness. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 6. and faint heartedness, <hi>Isai.
7.</hi> 4. these are the effects and consequents of sinful
fear: And how dangerous a thing it is to have our
courage extinguished, and faintness of heart prevail
upon us in a time when we have the greatest need and
use of courage and our perseverance, peace and eternal
happiness rely and depend so much upon it, let all seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christians judge. 'tis sad to us and dishonourable to
Religion to have the hearts of women, as it's said of
<hi>Egypt, Isai.</hi> 19. 16. when we should play the men as
the Apostle exhorts us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. We find in all
ages those that have manifested most courage for
Christ in time of trial, have been those whose Faith
hath surmounted Fear, and whose hearts were above all
discouragements from this world.</p>
                           <p>Such a man was <hi>Basil,</hi> as appears by his answer to
<hi>Valens</hi> the Emperor who tempting him with offers of
preferment, received this answer, Offer these things,
said he, to children; and when he threatned him with
grievous sufferings, he replied, threaten these things
to your purple gallants that give themselves to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and are afraid to die.</p>
                           <p>And this was the spirit of courage and magnanimity
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44184:36"/>
with which the generality of the Primitive Christians
were animated, they feared not the faces of Tyrants,
they shrunk not from the most cruel torments, and it
redounded not a little to the credit of Christianity,
when one of <hi>Iulians</hi> Nobles present at the tormenting
of <hi>Marcus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arethusa</hi> told the <hi>Apostate</hi> to
his face, We are ashamed O Emperor, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
laugh at your cruelty, and grow more resolute
by it. So <hi>Lactantius</hi> also testifies of them, our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children, saith he, not to speak of men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
their torments, and the fire cannot fetch so
much as a sigh from them. If carnal fear once get
the ascendant over us, all our courage and resolution
will flag, and melt away, we may suffer out of una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
necessity, but shall never honour Christ
and Religion by our sufferings.</p>

                           <p>Carnal fear is the very root of Apostacy, it hath
made thousands of professors to faint and fall away in
the hour of temptation, it is not so much from the
fury of our enemies without, as from our own fears
within, that temptations become victorious over us;
from the beginning of fears Christ dates the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
apostacy, <hi>Matth. 24. 9, 10. Then shall they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye
shall be hated of all nations for my name sake, and then
shall many be offended.</hi> When troubles and dangers
come to an height then fears begin to work at an
height too, and then is the critical hour; fears are
high, and faith is low; temptation strong, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
weak. Satan knocks at the door, and fear
opens it, and yields up the soul to him, except speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
aid and assistance come in seasonably from heaven,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44184:37"/>
so long as we can profess Religion without any great
hazard of life, liberty, or estates, we may shew much
zeal and forwardness in the ways of godliness, but
when it comes to the sharpes, to resisting unto
bloud, few will be found to own and assert it openly
in the face of such dangers. The first retreat is usually
made from a free and open to a close and concealed
practice of Religion; not opening our windows
as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, to shew we care not who knows
we dare worship our God and are not ashamed
of our duties, but hiding our principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with all the art and care imaginable, reckoning
it well if we can escape danger by letting fall our
profession which might expose us to it: But if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
go on, and we cannot be secured any longer
under this refuge, we must comply with false worship,
and give some open signal that we do so, or else be
marked out for ruine; then saith Fear, give a little
more ground and retreat to the next security, which
is to comply seemingly with that which we do not
allow, hoping God will be merciful to us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
us if we keep our hearts for him, though we are
forced thus to dissemble and hide our principles. <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ad communem errorem,</hi> said <hi>Calderinus,</hi> when
going to the Mass, Let us go to the common er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and as <hi>Seneca</hi> adviseth about worshipping the
<hi>Roman Gods, in animi religione non habeat, sed in
actibus fingat,</hi> let us make a semblance and shew of
worshipping them, though our hearts give no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
respect to them: But if still the temptation
hunt us further, and we come to be more narrowly
sifted, and put to a severer Test, by subscribing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Articles, or renouncing our former avowed

of all that is dear to us in this World; now nothing

in all the world hazards our eternal salvation, as our
own fears will do; this is like to be the rock on which
we shall split all, and make an horrible shipwrack both
of truth and peace: This was the case of <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
whose fears caused him to subscribe against the dictates
of his own Conscience, and cowardly to betray the
known truth, and indeed there is no temptation in the
world that hath overthrown so many as that which
hath been backt and edged with fear; the love of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
and honours hath slain its thousands, but fear
of sufferings its ten thousands.</p>

'Tis storied of <hi>Democles</hi> a flatterer of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the

abundance of all things: <hi>Dionysius</hi> sets the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in all his own pomp at a Table furnished with
all dainties, and attended upon as a King, but with
an heavy sharp sword hanging by a single Horse hair
right over his head, this made him quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
so that he could neither eat nor drink but desired
to be freed from that estate: The design was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him how miserable a life they live who
live under the continual terrors of impending death
and ruine. It was a sore judgment which God
threatned against them in <hi>Ier. 5. 6. A Lion out of the
forrest shall slay them, and a Wolf of the evening shall
spoil them, a Leopard shall watch over their Cities,
every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces.</hi>
What a miserable life must those people live, who
could not stir out of the City, but they presently were
seized by Lions, Wolves, and Leopards, that watch'd
over them, and lurked in all the Avenewes to make
them a prey, and yet this is more tolerable than for
a mans own fear to watch continually over him.</p>
                           <p>2. And yet I could wish this were the worst of it,
and that our Fears destroyed no better comforts than
the natural comforts of this life; but alas, they also
destroy our spiritual comforts which we might have
from Gods promises, and our own and others experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which are incomparably the sweetest pleasures
men have in this World: But as no creature comfort
is pleasant, so no promise relishes like it self to him that
lives in this bondage of Fear; when the terrors of

small.</p>

made ready to our hand and provided for a day of
trouble; but alas, to what purpose, if our own fears,
so transport us that we can neither apply them, nor
so much as calmly ponder and consider them.</p>
                           <p>3. To conclude, by these Fears we are deprived
of those manifold advantages we might gain by the
calm and composed meditations of our own death,
and the change it will make upon us; could we sit
down in peace, and meditate in a familiar way upon
death; could we look with a composed and well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
mind into our own graves, and not be scared and
frighted with the thoughts of death, and startle when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we take it, (though but in our thoughts) by the
cold hand: To what seriousness would those meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
frame us? And what abundance of evils would
they prevent in our conversations? The sprinkling
of dust upon new writing, prevents many a blot and
blur in our books or letters; and could we thus
sprinkle the dust of the Grave upon our minds, it
would prevent many a sin and miscarriage in our
words and actions: But there is no profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
redounding to us either from promises, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or death it self when the soul is discomposed
and put into confusion by its own fears. And thus
you see some of those many mischievous effects of your
own fears.</p>

are capable to improve the following Rules to their
advantage. The security of our souls is the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
used by Christ to extinguish our fears of them
that can kill the Body, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28. But if the
Soul must unavoidably perish when the Body doth,
if it must drop into hell before the Body be laid in the

cured; but whilst there is so much weakness in our
Faith, there will be too much strength in our Fears.</p>
                           <p>And for those who are naturally timorous, who have
more of this passion in their constitution than other
men have; and those in whom melancholy is a rooted

                           <p>The first Rule to relieve us against our Slavish
Fears, <hi>Is seriously to consider, and more throughly to
study the Covenant of Grace, within the blessed Clasp
and Bond whereof all believers are.</hi> I think the clear
understanding of the Nature, Extent, and Stability
of the Covenant, and of our interest therein, would
go a great way in the cure of our sinful and slavish
Fears.</p>
                           <p>A Covenant is more than a naked promise, in the
Covenant, God hath graciously consulted our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
fears, and doubts, and therefore proceeds with
us in the highest way of solemnity, confirming his
Promises by Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 17. and by Seals,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Putting himself under the most solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and engagements that can be, to his people, that
from so firm a ratification of the Covenant with us,
we might have strong consolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. He
hath so ordered it, that it might afford strong sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and the most reviving cordials to our faint and
and timorous Spirits, in all the plunges of trouble
both from within, and from without. In the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
God makes over himself to his people, to be
unto them a God, <hi>Ier. 31. 33. Heb.</hi> 8. 10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord bestows himself in all his Glorious Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
properties upon us, to the end that whatsoever
his Almighty power, Infinite wisdom, and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
mercy can afford for our protection,
support, deliverance, direction, pardon, or refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
we might be assured shall be faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to us in all the straits, fears, and exigencies
of our lives. This God expects we should improve
by Faith, as the most sovereign antidote against all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44184:41"/>
our Fears in this world. <hi>Isaiah 43. 1, 2. Thus saith
the Lord that created thee,</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and he that
formed thee,</hi> O Israel; <hi>fear not, for I have redeemed
thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine;
when thou passest through the waters, I will be with
thee, &amp;c.</hi> Isai. 41. 10. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee,
be not dismaied, for I am thy God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And if thou Reader, be within the bond of this
Covenant, thou mayest surely find enough there to
quiet thy heart, whatever the matter or ground of
thy fears be: If God be thy Covenant God, he will be
with thee in all thy streights, wants and troubles, he
will never leave, nor forsake thee. From the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it was that <hi>David</hi> encouraged himself against all
his troubles. 2. <hi>Sam. 23. 5. Although my house be
not so with God, yet hath he made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant, well ordered in all things and sure;
and this is all my salvation, and all my desire, though
he make it not to grow.</hi> He could fetch all reliefs, all
comforts, all salvations out of it, and why cannot we?
He desired no more for the support of his heart; <hi>this
is all my desire;</hi> and sure if we understood and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it as he did, we could desire no more to quiet and
comfort our hearts than what this Covenant affords
us. For,</p>
                           <p>1. Are we afraid what our enemies will do?
We know we are in the midst of Potent, Politick,
and enraged enemies; we have heard what they have
done, and see what they are preparing to do again;
we tremble to think what bloudy Tragedies are like
to be acted over again in the World by their cruel
hands: But O what heroick and noble acts of Faith
should the Covenant of thy God enable thee to exert
amidst all these fears? If God be thy God, then thou
hast an Almighty God on thy side, and that is enough
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44184:42"/>
to extinguish all these Fears, <hi>Psal. 118. 6. The Lord
is on my side, I will not fear what man can do unto
me.</hi> Your fears come in the name of man, but your
help in the name of the Lord: Let them plot, threaten,
yea, and smite too; God is a shield to all that fear
him, and if God be for us, who can be against us?</p>
                           <p>2. Are we afraid what God will do? Fear it not,
your God will do nothing against your good; think
not that he may forget you, it cannot be; sooner
may a tender mother forget her sucking child, <hi>Isai.
49.</hi> 15. no, no, <hi>He withdraweth not his eye from the
Righteous, Iob</hi> 36. 7. His eyes are continually upon
all the dangers and wants of your Souls and Bodies,
there is not a danger or an enemy stirring against
you, but his eye is upon it. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9.</p>
                           <p>Are you afraid he will forsake and cast you off?
'Tis true, your sins have deserved he should do so, but
he hath secured you fully against that fear in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>Ier. 32. 40. I will not turn away from them,
to do them good.</hi> All your fears of Gods forgetting
or forsaking you, spring out of your ignorance of the
Covenant.</p>
                           <p>3. Are you afraid what you shall do? 'Tis usual
for the people of God to propose difficult cases to
themselves, and put startling questions to their own
hearts; and there may be an excellent use of them,
to rouze them out of security, put them upon the
search and tryal of their conditions and estates, and
make preparation for the worst; but Satan usually
improves it to a quite contrary end, to deject, affright,
and discourage them. O if fiery trials should come,
if my liberty and life come once to be toucht in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
I fear I shall never have strength to go on a step
farther in the way of Religion: I am afraid I shall
faint in the first encounter, I shall deny the words of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44184:42"/>
the Holy One, make shipwrack of Faith and a good
Conscience in the first gust of temptation. I can
hear, and pray, and profess; but I doubt I cannot
burn, or bleed, or lie in a dungeon for Christ. If
I can scarce run with footmen in the land of peace,
how do I think to contend with Horses in the swellings
of <hi>Iordan?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But yet all these are but groundless fears, either
forged in thy own misgiving heart, or secretly
shuffled by Satan into it; for God hath abundantly
secured thee against fear in this very particular, by
that most sweet supporting and blessed promise, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the former, in the same Text, <hi>Ier. 32. 40.
I will put my fear into their hearts, and that they
shall not depart from me.</hi> Here is another kind of
Fear, than that which so startles thee, promised to
be put into thy heart, not a fear to shake and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
thy assurance as this doth, but to guard and
maintain it. And this is the fear that shall be enabled
to vanquish and expel all thy other fears.</p>
                           <p>4. Or are you afraid what the Church shall do?
And what will become of the <hi>Ark</hi> of God? Do you
see a storm gathering, the winds begin to roar, the
waves to swell; and are you afraid what will become
of that vessel the Church, in which you have so great
an interest?</p>
                           <p>It is an argument of the publickness and excellency of
thy spirit, to be thus touched with the feeling sense
of the Churches sufferings, and dangers. Most men
seek their own things, and not the things that are of
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. But yet it is your sin so to fear
as to sink and faint under a spirit of despondency, and
discouragement, which yet many good
men are but too apt to do.<note place="margin">Ep. ad Melanct. Anno 1549.</note> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

true; yea, that it is Christ's and Gods cause. I
am well nigh a secure spectator of things, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
not any thing these fierce and threatning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
I beseech thee by Christ, neglect not so
Divine promises and consolations where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith, Cast thy care upon the Lord, wait upon
the Lord, be strong, and he shall comfort thy
heart. And in another <hi>Epistle.</hi>
I much dislike those anxious cares,<note place="margin">Anno 1530.</note>
which as thou writest do almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
thee: 'Tis not the greatness of the danger,
but the greatness of thy unbelief. <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and
others were under greater danger than we; and if
it be great, he is great that orders it. Why do
you afflict your self? If the cause be bad, let us
renounce it; if it be good, why do we make him
a liar that bids us be still? As if you were able to do
any good, by such unprofitable cares. I beseech
thee, thou that in other things art valiant, fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy self, thine own greatest enemy that puts
weapons into Satans hand.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>You see how good men may be even overwhelmed
with publick fears, but certainly if we did well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the bond of the Covenant that is betwixt God
and his people, we should be more quiet and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For by reason thereof it is, 1. That God is in
the midst of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 1, 2, 3, 4. When any
great danger threatned the Reformed Church in its
tender beginnings in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, he would say, come,
let us sing the 46 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and indeed it is a lovely Song
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44184:43"/>
for such times, it bears the Title of <hi>A song upon
Alamoth,</hi> or a song for the hidden ones, God is
with them to cover them under his wings. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> 2. And
it is plain matter of Fact, evident to all the world,
that no people under the Heavens have been so long,
and so wonderfully preserved as the Church hath
been: It hath overlived many bloudy Massacres, terrible
persecutions, subtle and cruel enemies; still God hath
preserved and delivered it, for his promises oblige
him to it, amongst which those two are signal and
eminent ones, <hi>Ier. 30. 11. Isai.</hi> 27. 3. 3. And it
is obvious to all that will consider things, that there
are the self same motives in God, and the self same
grounds and reasons before him to take care of his
Church and people that ever were in him, or did
ever lie before him from the beginning of the world.
For, (1.) The relation is still the same: What
though <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> those renowned
believers be in their Graves, and those that succeed be
far inferiour to them in Grace and Spiritual excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
yet saith the Church, <hi>Doubtless thou art our
Father.</hi> There is the same tie and bond betwixt the
father and the youngest, weakest child in the family,
as the eldest and strongest. 2. His pity and mercy
is still the same, for that endures for ever: His bowels
yern as tenderly over his people in their present, as
ever they did in any past afflictions or streights.
3. The rage and malice of his and his peoples ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
is still the same, they will reflect as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
and dishonourably upon God now, should he
give up his people, as ever they did. <hi>Moses</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as good now as ever it was, what will the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> say? and so is <hi>Ioshuah</hi>'s too, <hi>What wilt
thou do unto thy great name?</hi> O if these things were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44184:44"/>

                           <p>1. The miseries and calamities that sinful Fear
brings upon men in this world, are unspeakable; this
is it that hath plunged the Consciences of so many
poor wretches into such deep distresses! this it is
that hath put them upon the <hi>Rack,</hi> and made them
roar like men in Hell, among the damned. Some
have been recovered, and others have perished in these
deeps of horror and despair. In the
year 1550.<note place="margin">Clarks examp. p. 27.</note> there was at <hi>Ferrara</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> one <hi>Faninus</hi> who by reading
good Books was by the grace of God
converted to the knowledge of the truth, wherein he
found such sweetness, that by constant reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
and prayer, he grew so expert in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that he was able to instruct others; and though
he durst not go out of the bounds of his calling to
preach openly, yet by conference and private exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
he did good to many. This coming to the
knowledge of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Clients, they apprehended
and committed him to Prison; where he renounced the
truth, and was thereupon released: But it was not long
before the Lord met with him for it: So as falling
into horrible torments of Conscience, he was near
unto utter despair, nor could he be freed from those
terrors, before he had fully resolved to venture his
life more faithfully in the service of Christ.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44184:44"/>
Dreadful was that voice which poor <hi>Spira</hi> seemed
to hear in his own Conscience assoon as ever his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
fears had prevailed upon him to renounce the truth.
<hi>Thou wicked wretch, thou hast denied me, thou hast
renounced the Covenant of thine obedience, thou hast
broken thy vow, hence Apostate, bear with thee the
Sentence of thine eternal damnation.</hi> Presently
he falls into a swoon, quaking and trembling, and
still affirmed to his death, that from that time, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found any ease or peace in his mind; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that he was captivated under the revenging
hand of the Almighty God, and that he continually
heard the sentence of Christ, the just Judge against
him, and that he knew he was utterly undone, and
could neither hope for grace, or that Christ should
intercede for him to the Father.</p>
                           <p>In our dreadful <hi>Marian</hi> days Sir <hi>Iohn Cheek</hi> who
had been Tutor to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, was
cast into the <hi>Tower,</hi> and kept close Prisoner; and
there put to this miserable choice, either to forego his
life, or that which was more precious, his liberty of
Conscience, neither could his liberty be procured by
his great friends at any lower rate, than to recant his
Religion; this he was very unwilling to accept of, till
his hard imprisonment, joyned with threats of much
worse in case of his refusal, at last wrought so upon
him whilst he consulted with flesh and bloud, as drew
from him an <hi>Abrenunciation</hi> of that truth which he
had so long professed, and still believed. Upon this
he was restored to his liberty, but never to his comfort;
for the sense of his own Apostasie, and the daily sight
of the cruel butcheries exercised upon others for their
constant adherence to the truth, made such deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
upon his broken spirit, as brought him to
a speedy end of his life, yet not without some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hopes at last.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="74" facs="tcp:44184:45"/>
Our own Histories abound with multitudes of such
doleful examples.</p>
                           <p>Some have been in such horror of Conscience, that
they have chosen strangling rather than life; they have
felt that anguish of Conscience that hath put them
upon desperate resolutions and attempts against their
own lives to rid themselves of it. This was the case
of <hi>Peter Moon,</hi> who being driven by his own fears to
deny the truth, presently fell into such horrour of
Conscience, that seeing a sword hanging in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
would have sheathed it in his own bowels. So
<hi>Francis Spira,</hi> before mentioned, when he was near
his end, saw a knife on the Table, and running to it
would have mischieved himself, had not his friends
prevented him; thereupon he said, <hi>O that I were above
God, for I know that he will have no mercy on me. He
lay about eight weeks</hi> (saith the Historian) <hi>in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
burning, neither desiring, nor receiving any thing
but by force, and that without digestion; till he became
as an Anatomy, vehemently raging for drink, yet
fearful to live long, dreadful of hell, yet coveting death,
in a continual torment, yet his own Tormentor; and
thus consuming himself with grief and horror, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and despair, like a living man in hell, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
an extraor dinary example of Gods justice and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and so ended his miserable life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Surely it were good to fright our selves by such
dreadful examples, out of our sinful fears; is any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
we can fear from the hands of man like this? O
Reader, believe it, it is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of God: Hadst thou ever felt the rage and
efficacy of a wounded and distressed Conscience, as
these poor wretches felt it, no fears or threats of men
should drive thee into such an Hell upon earth as
this is.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="75" facs="tcp:44184:45"/>
2. And yet though this be a doleful case, it is not
the worst case your own sinful fears will cast you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
except the Lord overcome and extinguish them
in you by the fear of his name, they will not only
bring you into a kind of hell upon earth, but into
hell it self for evermore: For so the righteous God
hath said in his word of truth, <hi>Rev. 21. 8. But the
fearful, and unbelieving, &amp;c. shall have their part in
the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which
is the second death.</hi> Behold here, the Marshal Law
of Heaven, executed upon Cowards and Renegadoes,
whose fears make them revolt from Christ in the time of
danger. Think upon this you timorous &amp; fainthearted
professors; you cannot bear the thoughts of lying in a
nasty Dungeon, how will you lie then in the lake of
fire and brimstone? You are afraid of the face and
frowns of a man that shall die, but how will you live
among Devils? Is the wrath of man, like the fury of
God poured out? Is not the little finger of God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than the loyns of all the Tyrants in the World?
Remember what Christ hath said, <hi>Matth. 10. 33.
But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
deny before my father which is in heaven.</hi> Reader,
The time is coming when he that spake these words
shall break out of Heaven with a shout, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with myriads of Angels, and ten thousands of his
Saints, the Heavens and the Earth shall be in dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conflagrations round about him: The last Trump
shall sound, the Graves shall open, the Earth and Sea
shall give up the dead that are in them. Thine eyes
shall see him ascend the awful throne of judgment, his
faithful ones that feared not to own and appear for
him in the face of all enemies and dangers, sitting on
the bench as Assessors with him; and then to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and renounced for ever by Jesus Christ in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44184:46"/>
face of that great assembly, and proclaimed a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
a Traitor to him, that deniedst his name, and
truths, because of the frowns of a fellow Creature long
since withered as the grass; O how wilt thou be able
to endure this! now put both these together in thy
serious consideration, think on the terrors of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

as a perboiling, that as a roasting in the flames of

touch the flesh, and for their duration, they are but for
a moment.</p>
                           <p>Think, and think again upon those words of Christ,
<hi>Mark 8. 35. He that will save his life shall lose it.</hi>
It may be a prolonging of a miserable life, a life worse

as they are, is their coming by way of surprize upon us.
Those troubles that find us secure, do leave us distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

scarecrows and vizors which children fear,
only out of ignorance; assoon as they are known they
cease to be terrible.</p>
                           <p>I know our minds naturally reluctate, and decline
such harsh and unpleasant subjects: 'Tis hard to bring
our thoughts to them in good earnest, and harder to
dwell so long as is necessary to this end upon them.
We had rather take a pleasant prospect of future
felicity and prosperity in this world; of multiplying
our days as the sand, and at last dying quietly in our
Nest, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks. Our thoughts run nimbly upon
such pleasant fancies like oyled wheels, and have
need of trigging, but when they come into the deep
and dirty ways of suffering, there they drive heavily
lik <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots, dismounted from their wheels.
But that which is most pleasant, is not always most
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44184:47"/>
useful and necessary; Our Lord was well acquainted
with griefs, though our thoughts be such great stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to them, he often thought and spake of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and of the bloudy Baptism, with which he
was to be baptized, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. and he not only
minded his own sufferings before hand, but when he
perceived the fond imaginations, and vain fansies of
some that followed and professed him, deluding them
with expectations of earthly prosperity and rest; he
gave their thoughts a turn to this less pleasing, but
more needful subject, the things they were to suffer
for his name; instead of answering a foolish and
groundless question, of sitting on his Right and Left
hand, like earthly <hi>Grandees,</hi> he rebukes the folly of
the <hi>Questionist,</hi> and asks a less pleasing question,
<hi>Matth. 20. 22. But Iesus answered and said, Ye know
not what ye ask, are ye able to drink of the cup that
I shall drink of? And to be baptized with the
baptism that I shall be baptized with? q. d.</hi> You do
but abuse your selves with such fond and idle dreams,
there is other imployment cut out for you in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God; Instead of sitting upon Thrones and
Tribunals, it would become you to think of being
brought before them as Prisoners to receive your
doom and sentence to die for my sake; these thoughts
would do you a great deal more service.</p>
                           <p>2. As such meditations would acquaint us better,
so they would prepare us better to encounter troubles
and difficult things when they come. Readiness and
preparation would subdue and banish our fears; we
are never much scared with that for which our minds
are prepared. There is the same difference in this
case, as there is betwixt a Souldier in compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and ready at every point for his enemy; and
one that is allarm'd in his bed, who hath laid his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44184:48"/>
cloaths in one place, and his Arms in another, when
his enemy is breaking open his chamber door upon
him. It was not therefore without the most weighty
reason, that the Apostle presses us so earnestly, <hi>Eph.
6. 13, 14. Take unto you the whole armour of God,
that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
having done all to stand. Stand therefore having your
loyns girt about with truth, and having on the breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
of Righteousness, and your feet shod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Gospel of peace.</hi> We see the benefit of
such previsions and provisions for sufferings in that
great example of courage and constancy, <hi>Acts 21. 13.
I am ready,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) not only to be bound, but to
die at</hi> Jerusalem. And the same courage and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
remained in him, when he was entering the
very Lists, and going to lay his very neck upon the
block, 2. <hi>Tim. 4. 6. I am ready to be offered up, and
the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> The word
<gap reason="foreign">

heart was brought to that frame, that he could with
as much willingness pour out his bloud for Christ, as

in the world made by us, are not sufficient in
themselves to carry us through such difficult services,
'tis one thing to see death as our fancy limnes it out at
a distance and another thing to look death it self in the
face. We can behold the painted Lyon without fear,
but the living <hi>Lyon,</hi> makes us tremble; but yet
though our suffering-strength comes not from our
own preparations, or forethoughts of Death; but from

found waiting upon God for strength, patience, and
resolutions to suffer as it becomes Christians, in the
daily serious use of those means whereby he is pleased
to communicate to his people.</p>

                           <head>4. Rule.</head>
                           <p>If ever you will subdue your own slavish fears, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your selves, and all that is yours into the hands of
God by Faith.</p>
                           <p>This Rule is fully confirmed by that Scripture,
<hi>Prov. 16. 3. Commit thy works unto the Lord, and
thy thoughts shall be established.</hi> The greatest part of
our trouble and burden in times of danger, arises
from the unsetledness and distraction of our own
thoughts, and the way to calm and quiet our thoughts
is to commit all to God. This Rule is to be applied
for this end and purpose when we are going to meet
Death it self, and that in all its terrible formalities, and
most frightful appearances, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 19. Let them
that suffer according to the will of God, commit the
keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a
faithful Creator.</hi> And if this committing act of
Faith be so useful at such a time, when the thoughts
must be supposed to be in the greatest hurry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
fears in their full strength; much more will it esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the heart, and calm its passions in lesser troubles,
you know what ease and relief it would be to you, if
you had a Trial depending in Law for your Estates,
and your hearts were overloaded and distracted with
cares and fears about the issue of it: If one whom you
know to be very skilful and faithful, should say to you
at such a time, trouble not your self any further
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

for this matter; be you as an unconcerned Spectator,
commit it to me, and trust me with the management
of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will make it my own concernment, and save
you harmless. O what a burden, what an heavy load
would you feel y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>r selves eased of, assoon as you had
thus transferred, and committed it to such a hand!
then you would be able to eat with pleasure, and sleep
in quietness: Much more ease and quietness doth your
committing the matter of your fears to God give,
even so much more, as his power, wisdom, and
faithfulness is greater than what is to be found in men.
But to make this Rule practicable, and improveable
to peace, quietness of heart in an evil day, it will be
necessary that you well understand,
<list>
                                 <item>1. What the committing act of Faith is.</item>
                                 <item>2. What grounds and encouragements Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have for it.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>1. Study well the nature of this committing act of
Faith, and what it supposes or implies in it, for all
men cannot commit themselves to God, 'tis his own
people only that can do it; nor is it every thing they
can commit to God, they cannot commit themselves
to his care and protection in any way, but only in his
own ways. Know more particularly,</p>
                           <p>1. That he who will commit himself to God, must
commit himself to him in well doing, as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
limits it in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. and in things agreeable to his
will; else we would make God a Patron and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of our sins, <hi>Let t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>m that suffer according to the
will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls to him
in well doing.</hi> We cannot commit our sins, but our
duties to Gods protection: God is so great a friend to
truth and righteousness, that in such a case he will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44184:49"/>
not take your part, how dear soever you be to him,
if truth be found on your enemies part, and the
mistake on yours. Think not to entitle God to your
errors or failings, much less to any sinful designs:
You may commit a doubtful case to him to be decided,
but not a sinful case to be protected. It is in vain to
shelter any cause of your own under his wings, except
you can write upon it as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal. 74. 22.
Thine own cause, O Lord, thine own, as well as mine.</hi>
Lord plead thine own cause.</p>
                           <p>2. He that commits his all to God, supposes and
firmly believes that all events and issues of things are
in Gods hands; that he only can direct, over rule, and
order them all as he pleaseth. Upon this supposition,
the committing acts of Faith in all our fears and
distresses are built, <hi>I trusted in thee, O Lord, I said,
thou art my God, my times are in thy hand, deliver
me from the hands of my enemies, and from them that
persecute me.</hi> His firm assent to this great truth, that
his times were in Gods hands, was the reason why he
committed himself into that hand. If our times, ourlives,
or comforts were in our enemies hands; it were to little
purpose for us to commit our selves into Gods hands.
And here the contrary sences and methods of Faith
and unbelief, are as conspicuous as in any one thing
whatsoever: Unbelief perswades men that their lives
and all that is dear to them, is in the hands of their
enemies, and therefore perswades them the best way
they can take to secure themselves, is by complyance
with the will of their enemies, and pleasing them.
But Faith determines quite contrary, it tells us we
and all that is ours is in Gods hand, and no enemy can
touch us or ours till he give them a permission; and
therefore it is our duty and interest to please him, and
commit all to him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="84" facs="tcp:44184:50"/>
3. The committing of our selves to God implies
the resignation of our wills to the will of God, to be
disposed of as seems good in his eyes: So <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to God the event of that sad and doubtful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which made him flie for his life from a strong
conspiracy, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 25. And the King said unto
Zadock, Carry back the Ark of God into the City; if
I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord; he will bring
me again, and shew me both it and his habitation, but
if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold here
am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him: q. d.</hi>
Lord, the conspiracy against my life is strong, the
danger great, the issue exceeding doubtful: but I
commit it all into thy hand, if <hi>David</hi> may yet be used
in any further service for his God; I shall see this City
and thy lovely <hi>Temple</hi> again, but if not, I lie at thy
foot to be disposed either for life or death, for the
earthly or the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as seemeth best in
thine eyes: This submission to Divine pleasure is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the committing act of Faith. Christian,
what sayest thou to it? Is thy will content to go back,
that the will of God may come on, and take place of
it? It may be thou canst refer a difficult case to God,
provided that he will determine and issue it according
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>o thy desires, but in truth that is no submission or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
at all, but a sinful limiting of, and prescribing
to God. It was an excellent reply that a choice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
once made to another; when a beloved and only
Child lay in a dangerous sickness at the point of death;
a friend asked the mother, what would you now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of God in reference to your Child? Would you
beg of him its life, or death, in this extremity it is
now in? The Mother answered, I refer that to the
will of God. But said her friend, if God would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to you, what would you chuse then? Why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44184:50"/>
said she, if God would refer it to me, I would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
refer it to God again.</p>
                           <p>This is the true committing of our selves, and our
troublesome concerns to the Lord.</p>
                           <p>4. The committing act of Faith, implies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
and disclaiming all confidence and trust
in the arm of flesh, and an expectation of relief
from God only: If we commit our selves to God, we
must cease from man. <hi>Isai.</hi> 2. 22. To trust God in
part, and the Creature in part, is to set one foot upon
a Rock, and the other in a Quick-sand: Those acts
of Faith that give the intire glory to God, give real
relief and comfort to us.</p>
                           <p>2. Let us see what grounds and encouragements the
people of God have to commit themselves and all the
matters of their fear to God, and so to enjoy the peace
and comfort of a resigned will; and there are two
sorts of encouragements before you, let the case be as
difficult and frightful as it will; you may find suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
encouragements in God, and somewhat from
your selves, <hi>viz.</hi> your relation to him, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of him.</p>
                           <p>1. In God there is all that your hearts can desire to
encourage you to trust him over all, and commit all
into his hands. For,</p>
                           <p>1. He is able to help and relieve you, let the case
be never so bad, yet <hi>let</hi> Israel <hi>hope in the Lord, for
with the Lord is plenteous redemption Psal.</hi> 130. 7, 8.
Plenteous redemption (<hi>i. e.</hi>) all the stores of power,
choice of methods, plenty of means, abundance of
ways to save his people, when they can see no way
out of their troubles: Therefore hope <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. As his Power is Almighty, so his Wisdom is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44184:51"/>
Infinite and unsearchable, <hi>He is a God of judgment,
blessed are all they that wait for him, Isa.</hi> 30. 18. When
the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> had related the wonderful preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Deluge, and of <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom;</hi>
one in a general destruction of the world by Water,
and the other in the overthrow of those Cities by
Fire: He concludes, and so should we, <hi>The Lord
knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,
2 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Some men have much Power, but little
wisdom to manage it, others are wise and prudent,
but want ability; in God there is an infinite fulness
of both.</p>
                           <p>3. His love to and tenderness over his people, is
transcendent, and unparallelled; and this sets his
wisdom and power both a work for their good, hence
it is that his eyes of providence run continually
throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong
in the behalf of them whose hearts are perfect <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
upright towards him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. Thus you
see how he is every way fitted as a proper object of
your trust.</p>
                           <p>2. Consider your selves and you shall find encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to commit all to God. For,</p>
                           <p>1. You are his children, and to whom should chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
commit themselves in dangers and fears but to
their own father? <hi>Doubtless thou art our father,</hi> saith
the distressed Church, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 15, 16. Yea, Christian,
<hi>Thy maker is thy husband, Isai.</hi> 54. 5. Is not that a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground to cast thy self upon him? What! a
Child not trust its own Father? A wife not commit
her self to her own husband?</p>
                           <p>2. You have trusted him with a far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
already than your estates, liberties, or lives;
you have committed your souls to him, and your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and doubt him for earth?</p>
                           <p>3. You have ever found him faithful in all that you
trusted him with, all your experiences are so many
good grounds of confidence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10. Well then,
resolve to trust God over all, and quietly leave the
dispose of every thing to him; he hath been with
you in all former streights, wants, and fears, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he hath helped you, and cannot he do so again, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you tell him how? O trust in his wisdom, power,
and love, and lean not to your own understandings.
The fruit of resignation will be peace.</p>

                           <p>The more you are mortified, the less you will be

                           </p>
                           <p>1. Get mortified and cooled hearts to your Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Estates in the world. The poorest age afforded
the richest Christians, and noblest Martyrs. Ships deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
laden are not best for encounters. The believing
Hebrews <hi>took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in themselves that they had in heaven a better, and
induring substance, Heb.</hi> 10. 34. They carried it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like unconcerned <hi>Spectators,</hi> than the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors:</hi>
They rejoyced when rude Souldiers carried
out their goods, as if so many friends had been bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in: And whence was this? But from an
heart fixed upon Heaven, and mortified to things on
Earth. Doubtless they esteemed and valued their
Estates as the good providences of God, for their
more comfortable accommodation in this world;
but it seems they did, and O that we could look upon
them as mercies of the lowest and meanest rank and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The substance laid up in Heaven was a better
substance, and as long as that was safe, the loss of
this did not afflict them.</p>
                           <p>They could bless God for these things which for a
little time did minister refreshment to them, but they
knew them to be transitory enjoyments, things that
would make to themselves wings and flee away, if their
enemies had not toucht them; but the substance laid
up for them in Heaven, that was an <hi>enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi>
So far as those earthly things might further
them towards Heavenly things, so far they prized and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44184:52"/>
valued them, but if Satan would turn them into
snares and temptations to deprive them of their better
substance in Heaven, they could easily slight them,
and take the spoiling of them joyfully. In a stress of
weather when the Ship is ready to sink and founder in
a Storm, all hands are readily imployed to throw the
richest goods over-board: No man faith it's pity to
cast them away, but reason dictates to a man in that
case, better these perish, than I perish with and for
them. These be the wares that some will not cast
overboard, and therefore they are said to drown men
in perdition. 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 9. Demas</hi> would rather perish
than part with these things. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. But Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
consider seriously what comfort they can yield
thee, when thou must look upon them as the price
for which thou hast sold Heaven, and all the hopes
of glory; even as much as the price of bloud yielded
<hi>Iudas;</hi> and so they will ensnare thee if thy unmortified
heart be overheated with the love of them as his
was.</p>
                           <p>2. Be mortified to your liberty, and take heed of
placing too great an esteem upon it, or necessity in
it. Liberty is a desirable thing to the very birds of the
air, accommodate them the best you can in your cages,
feed them with the richest fare, they had rather be
cold and hungry with their liberty in the woods, than
fat and warm in your houses. But yet as sweet as it
is, there may be more sweetness and comfort in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it, than in keeping it, as the case may stand.
The doors of a Prison can lock you in, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lock the comforter out. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> lost their
liberty for Christ, but not their comfort with it; they
never were so truly at liberty as when their feet were
made fast in the stocks; they never fared so deliciously,
as when they fed upon Prisoners fare. God spread a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44184:53"/>
Table for them in the Prison, sent them in a rich
feast, yea and they had musick at their feast too, and
that at midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25.</p>

place designed for banished persons;<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 9, 10.</note>
it lay in the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, not far from
the coast of the Lesser <hi>Asia:</hi> it was inhabited by none
because of the exceeding barrenness of it, but such
who were appointed to it for their punishment; so
that here <hi>Iohn</hi> could meet with no more earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment,
than what the barren rocks, or wild and
desperate persons condemned to live upon it, could
afford: Ay, but there, there it was that Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to him in unexpressible glory; there it was that
he had those ravishing visions, and saw the whole
Scheme of Providence in the Government of this
world, there he saw the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> coming
down from God out of heaven, as a bride prepared
for her husband; This made a <hi>Patmos</hi> become a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice:</hi>
never did any place afford him such comfort as
this did. So that Christians may not think there is so
strict and necessary a connection betwixt Liberty and
Comfort, that he that takes away the first, must needs
deprive them of the other.</p>
                           <p>Again, Suppose we should be so fond of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as to exchange truth and a good Conscience
for it; cannot God so imbitter it to you, yea, hath
he not so imbittered it to many, that they were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weary of it, and glad of an opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
it for a Prison. Our own <hi>Martyrology</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
us with many sad examples of it: O What will
yo do with your bitter dear bought Liberty, when
peace is taken away from the inner man? When God
shall clap up your souls in Prison, and put your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
into his bonds and fetters; then you will
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44184:53"/>
say as the Martyr did, <hi>I am in Prison, till I be in
Prison.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. Be mortified to the inordinate and fond love of
life, as ever you expect relief against the fears of
death. Reason thy self into a lower value of thy
life: Methinks you have arguments enough to cure
your fondness in this point: Have you found it such
a pleasant life to you, for so much of it as is past?
You know how the Apostle represents it, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 4.
We that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
And is a burthened and a groaning life so desirable?
You know also as he speaks in the next Verse, that
whilst you are at home in the body, you are absent
from the Lord; and is a state of absence from Jesus
Christ so desirable to a soul that loves him? Can
you find much pleasure so far from home? You
may fancy what you will, but upon serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
you will be able to tell your selves, that
till you be dead you will never be out of the reach
of Satans temptations, never freed from your own
in-dwelling corruptions, these conflicts cannot have
an end till life be ended. You also stand convinced
that till you be dead, your Souls cannot be satisfied,
nor your desires be at rest; have what comforts soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from God in the way of faith, and course of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
your hearts are still off the center, and will still
gravitate and gasp heaven-ward. You also know
that die you must, and the time of your departure is
at hand, and of all deaths, if you might have your
choice, none is more honourable to God, or like
to be so evidential and comfortable to you as a
violent death for Christ; therein you come to him
by consent and choice, not by necessity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
therein you give a publick testimony for
Christ, which is the highest use that ever our bloud
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44184:54"/>
can be put to, or honoured by; and for the pain and
torment, as the <hi>Martyr</hi> said, He that takes away
from my torment, takes away from my reward. But
even in that point, God can make it easier to you than
a natural death would be; he will be with you in your
extremity, and administer such reviving cordials as
other men must not look to taste, at least not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
they being prepared and reserved for such, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such an hour.</p>
                           <p>O then, work out the inordinate love of life by
working in such mortifying considerations upon your
own hearts, and if once you gain but this point, you
will quickly find all your pains and prayers richly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in the ease and rest of your hearts, in the
most scaring and frightful times.</p>

The Courage and undauntedness of <hi>Luther</hi> is trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted
abroad throughout the Christian world, it
would swell this small <hi>Tract</hi> too much, but to note
the most eminent instances of his courage for Christ;
The last he gave was by his sorrow in his last sickness,
that he must carry his bloud to the Grave. The like
Heroick Spirit appeared in divers persons of Honour
and eminency, who zealously espoused the same cause
of reformation with him. Remarkable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is that famous Epistle written by <hi>Ulricus ab Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
a German Knight, in defence of <hi>Luther</hi>'s cause
against the Cardinals and Bishops assembled at <hi>Wormes.</hi>
                              <q>I will go through (said he) with what I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
against you, and will stir up men to seek
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44184:55"/>
their freedom: Such as yield not to me at first,
I will overcome with importunity; I neither care
nor fear what may befal me, being prepared for
either event; either to ruine you, to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of my Countrey, or my self to fall with a good
Conscience; therefore that you may see with what
confidence I contemn your threats; I do profess
my self to be your irreconcilable enemy, whilst
ye persecute <hi>Luther</hi> and such as he is. No power
of yours, no injury of fortune shall alter this mind
in me; though you take away my life, yet this
well deserving of mine towards my countries liberty
shall not die. I know that my endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
such as you are, and to place worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in your room, is acceptable to God; and in
the last judgment, I trust it will be safer for me

                           <p>It was also a brave Heroick spirit by which <hi>Iohn</hi>

                           <p>1. Make use of them to obviate the prejudice of

have been accomplished in the rest of your brethren in

creatures which have been carried honourably and
comfortably through the cruellest and difficultest
sufferings for Christ. Our Women and Children, not

trials? Why, doubtless so were many of them too,
they were men of like fears, troubled with a bad heart,

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44184:57"/>
of all our labours and duties, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8, 9. As much
therefore as the reaping time is better than the sowing
and plowing time, so much better is the death than
the life of a believer.</p>
                           <p>2. A Believers living time is his fighting time, but
his dying time is his conquering and triumphing time,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56. The conflict is sharp, but the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
is sweet; and as much as victory and triumph
is better than fighting, so much is death better than
life, to him that dieth in Jesus.</p>
                           <p>3 A Believers living time is his tiresome and weary
time, but his dying time is his resting and sleeping
time. <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 2. Here we spend and faint, there
we rest in our beds, and as much as refreshing rest in
sleep is better than tiring and fainting; so much is a
Believers death better than his life.</p>
                           <p>4. A Believers living time is his waiting and longing
time, but his time of dying is the time of enjoying
what he hath long wished and waited for, <hi>Phil. 1.
23.</hi> Here we groan and sigh for Christ, there we
behold and enjoy Christ, and so much as vision and
fruition is better and sweeter than hoping and waiting
for it; so much is a believers death better than his life.</p>
                           <p>2. As the advantage a Believer makes of death is
great to him by dying only in Christ; so it is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the richest improvement that can be made of
death to die for Christ as well as in Christ: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them in a few particulars and you shall find,</p>
                           <p>1. That though a natural death hath less <hi>horrour,</hi>
yet a violent death for Christ hath more <hi>honour</hi> in it.
To him that dies united with Christ the grave is <hi>a bed
of rest;</hi> but to him that dies as a Martyr for Christ,
the grave is a bed of honour. <hi>To you</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
<hi>it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe, but also to suffer for his sake, 1 Phil.</hi> 29.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44184:58"/>
To you it is granted as a great honour and favour
to suffer for Christ; all that live in Christ have not
the honour to lay down their lives for Christ. It was
the great trouble of <hi>Ludovic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>2. By a natural death we only submit our selves to
the unavoidable consequence of sin, but in dying a
violent death for Christ, we give our testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evil of sin, and for the precious truths of
Jesus Christ. The first is the payment of a debt of
justice due by the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> the second is the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a debt of thankfulness and obedience due to
Christ, who redeemed us with his own bloud. Thus
we become witnesses for God, as well as sufferers upon
the account of sin: In the first, sin witnesseth against
us, in this we witness against it; and indeed it is a great
testimony against the evil of sin: We declare to all
the world that there is not so much evil in a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in a bloudy Ax, or consuming flames; as there
is in sin: That it is far better to lose our carnal friends,
estates, liberties, and lives, than part with Christs
truths and a good Conscience,
as <hi>Zuinglius</hi> said,<note place="margin">Quas non oportet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis praeeligere, quod non supplicium potius ferre, imo inquam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum inferni Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum non intrare, quam contra conscientiam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

death should not a Christian
chuse, what punishment should
he not rather undergo; yea into
what vault of hell should he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

against truth &amp; Conscience.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="101" facs="tcp:44184:58"/>
3. A natural death in Christ may be as safe to our
selves, but a violent death for Christ, will be more
beneficial to others; by the former we shall come to
heaven our selves, but by the latter we may bring
many souls thither. The bloud of the Martyrs is
truly called the seed of the Church. Many waxed
confident by <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds, his sufferings fell out to
the furtherance of the Gospel, and so may ours: In
this case a Christian, like <hi>Samson,</hi> doth greater service
against Satan and his cause, by his death, than by his
life.</p>
                           <p>If we only die a natural death in our beds we die
in possession of the truths of Christ our selves; but if
we die Martyrs for Christ, we secure that precious
inheritance to the generations to come, and those
that are yet unborn shall bless God, not only for his
truths, but for our courage, zeal, and constancy
by which it was preserved for them, and transmitted
to them.</p>
                           <p>By all this you see that death to a Believer is great
gain, it's great gain if he only die in Christ, it's all
that, and a great deal more added, if he also die for
Christ: And he that is assured of such advantages
by death either way, must needs feel his fears of
death shrink away before such
assurances; yea,<note place="margin">potius nobis deliciae quam tormenta sunt. <hi>Basil.</hi>
                              </note> he will rather
have life in patience, and death
in desire? he will not only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
quietly but rejoyce exceedingly to be used by
God in such honourable imployment. Assurance
will call a bloudy death a safe passage to <hi>Canaan</hi>
through the Red Sea. It will call <hi>Satan</hi> that insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
these his instruments, and all that are imployed
in such bloudy work by him, so many <hi>Balaams</hi> brought
to curse, but they do indeed bless the people of God,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44184:59"/>
and not curse them. The assured Christian, looks
upon his death as his wedding day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. And
therefore it doth not much differ whether the horse
sent to fetch him to Christ be pale, or red, so he may
be with Christ his love as <hi>Ignatius</hi> call'd him.</p>
                           <p>He looks upon death as his day of enlargement out
of Prison, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and it is not much odds what
hand open the door, or whether a friend or enemy
close his eyes, so he have his liberty, and may be with
Christ.</p>
                           <p>O then, give the Lord no rest till your hearts be
at rest by the assurance of his love, and the pardon
of your sins; when you can boldly say, the Lord <hi>is
your help,</hi> you will quickly say what immediately
follows, <hi>I will not fear what man shall do unto me,
Heb.</hi> 13. 6. And why, if thy heart be upright, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou not attain it? Full assurance is possible, else
it had not been put into the command, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.
The sealing graces are in you, the sealing spirit is
ready to do it for you, the sealing promises belong
to you; but we give not all diligence, and therefore
go without the comfort of it: Would we pray more,
and strive more, would we keep our hearts, with a
stricter watch, mortifie sin more throughly, and
walk before God more accurately; how soon may
we attain this blessed assurance, and in it, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
cure for our distracting and slavish fears.</p>

                           <p>Let him that designs to free himself of distracting

and integrity of his ways in the whole course of

Uprightness will give us boldness, and purity will
yield us peace. <hi>Isa. 32. The work of righteousness
shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness,
and assurance for ever.</hi> Look as fear follows guilt
and guile, so peace and quietness follows Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sincerity, <hi>Prov. 28. 1. The wicked flee when
none pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a Lyon.</hi>
His confidence is great, because his Conscience is
quiet, the peace of God guards his heart and mind.
There are three remarkable steps by which Christians
rise to the height of courage in tribulations. <hi>Rom. 5.
1,</hi> 2, 3, 4. First they are justified and acquitted from
guilt by faith, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Then they are brought into a
state of favour and acceptation with God, v. 2. Thence
they rise one step higher, even to a view of Heaven,
and the glory to come, <hi>V.</hi> 3. and from thence they
take an easy step to glorying in tribulations, v. 4.</p>
                           <p>I say, 'tis an easy step, for let a man once obtain
the pardon of sin, the favour of God, and a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
view and prospect of the glory to come, and it is
so easy to triumph in tribulation, in such a station as
that is, that it will be as hard to hinder it, as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a man from laughing when he is tickled.</p>
                           <p>Christians have always found it a spring of courage
and comfort. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. This is our rejoycing,
even the testimony of our Consciences, that in all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and godly simplicity, not with fleshly wisdom, but
by the grace of God; we have had our conversation in
this world.</hi> Their hearts did not reproach them with
by-ends in Religion; their Consciences witnessed
that they made not Religion a cloak to cover any
fleshly design, but were sincere in what they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and this enabled them to rejoyce in the midst of
sufferings. An earthen vessel set empty to the fire
will crack and fly in pieces, and so will an hypocritical,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44184:60"/>
formal, and meer nominal Christian: but he that
hath such substantial and real principles of courage as
these within him, will endure the trial, and be never
the worse for the fire.</p>
                           <p>The very Heathens discovered the advantage of
Moral integrity, and the peace it yielded to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Consciences in times of trouble.</p>

And it was richly worth his labour, it repayed him ten
thousand fold in the peace, courage, and comfort it
gave him in all the troubles of his life, which were
great and many.</p>
                           <p>Conscience must be the bearing shoulder on which
the burden must lie, beware therefore it be not galled
with guilt, or put out of joynt by any fall into sin, 'tis
sad bearing on such a shoulder: Instead of bearing
your burdens, you will not be able to bear its pain and
anguish. To prevent this, carefully observe these rules.</p>
                           <p>1. Over-awe your hearts every day and in every
place with the eye of God; this walking as before God
will keep you upright, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. If you so speak and
live as those that know God sees you, such will be your
uprightness, that you will not care if all the world see
you too. An Artist came to <hi>Drusius</hi> and offered to
build him an house so contrived, that he might do
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44184:60"/>
what he would within doors and no man see him; nay
said <hi>Drusius,</hi> so build it that every one may see.</p>
                           <p>2. Do no action, undertake no design that you dare
not preface with Prayer; this is your rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.
Touch not with that you dare not pray for a blessing
upon; if you dare not pray, dare not to engage: If
you cannot send your prayers before, be confident
shame and guilt will follow after.</p>
                           <p>3. Be more afraid of grieving God, or wounding
Conscience, than of displeasing or losing all the friends
you have in the world besides; look upon every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
upon sin to escape danger, to be the same thing
as if you should sink the Ship to avoid one that you
take to be a Pirate; or as the fatal mistake of two vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
wherein there is poyson and physick.</p>
                           <p>4. What counsel you would give another, that
give your selves, when the case shall be your own; your
judgment is most clear, when interest is least felt. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
judgment was very upright, when he judged
himself in a remote parable.</p>
                           <p>5. Be willing to bear the faithful reproofs of your
faults from men, as the reproving voice of God; for
they are no less when duly administred: This will be
a good help to keep you upright, <hi>Psal. 135. 23, 24.
Let the Righteous smite me, &amp;c.</hi> It is said of Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
Cope,</hi> that he shamed none so much as himself
in his family Prayers, and desired the Ministers of his
acquaintance not to favour his faults; but tell me,
said he, and spare not.</p>
                           <p>6. Be mindful daily of your dying day, and your
great Audit day, and do all with respect to them.
Thus keep your integrity and peace, and that will
keep out your fears and terrors.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>1. Experience greatly abates the terror of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and makes them less formidable and scaring
than otherwise they would be; fear saith, they are
deep waters, and will drown us; experience saith,
they are much shallower than we think, and are
safely fordable: Others have, and we may pass
through that Red sea, and not be overwhelmed. Fear
saith the pains of death are unconceivable sharp and

and to lie in a stinking Prison in continual expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

contradicts all these false reports which make

it self, so long as they were in sight and hearing able
by words or signs to contradict our false Notions of it.

                           <p>So Blessed Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> our own Martyr, in one of
his sweet encouraging Letters, O how my heart leaps,
(saith he) that I am so near to eternal bliss, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me my unthankfulness and unworthiness of so
great glory; I have so much joy of the reward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for me, the most wretched sinner, that though
I be in the place of darkness and mourning, yet I
cannot lament, but am night and day so joyful as
though I were under no cross at all; in all the days
of my life I was never so joyful, the name of the Lord
be praised.</p>
                           <p>Others have given the signals agreed upon betwixt
them and their friends in the midst of the flames, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to the last confirming this truth, that God makes the
inside of sufferings quite another thing what the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44184:62"/>
and outside of them is to sense. Thus the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of others abates the terrors of sufferings to
you; and all this is fully confirmed by the personal
experience you your selves have had of the supports
and comforts of God, wherein soever you have consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ientiously
suffered for his sake.</p>
                           <p>2. And this cannot but be a singular assistance to
your faith, your own and others experiences; just like
<hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> stay up the hands of Faith on the
one side and the other that they hang not down,
whilst your fears like those <hi>Amalekites</hi> fall before you
For what is experience, but the bringing down of the
Divine promises to the test of sense and feeling? It is
our duty to believe the promises without tryal and
experiments, but it is easier to do it after so many
trials; so that your own and others experiences care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
recorded and seasonably applied; would be
food to your faith, and a cure to many of your fears in
a suffering day.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44184:62"/>
Our enemies are apt to over-rate their own power in
their pride, and we are as apt to over-rate it too in
our fears. <hi>Knowest thou not,</hi> saith <hi>Pilate</hi> to Christ,
<hi>that I have power to crucifie thee, and I have power

impotent creature, who hast no power at all, but
what is given thee from above; I know thee, and
therefore do not fear thee. But we are apt to take
their own boasts for truth, and believe their power to
be such as they vainly vogue it to be; whereas in
truth all your enemies are sustained by Christ. <hi>Colos.

do, but their wills as well as their hands are ordered
by God. <hi>Iacob</hi> was in <hi>Laban</hi>'s and in <hi>Esau</hi>'s hands;

which he so much opposed and hated.</p>
                           <p>O Christian, if ever thou wilt get above thy fears
settle these things upon thy heart by faith:</p>
                           <p>1. That the reins of Government are in Christs
hands; enemies like wild horses may prance and tramp
up and down the world, as though they would
tread down all that are in their way; but the bridle
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44184:63"/>
of Providence is in their mouths, and upon their
proud necks, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 28. And that bridle hath
a strong curb.</p>
                           <p>2. The care of the Saints properly pertains to
Christ; he is the head of the body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23.
Our consulting head: And it were a reproach and
dishonour to Christ, to fill our own heads with distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
cares and fears, when we have so wise an head
to consult and contrive for us.</p>
                           <p>3. You have lived all your days upon the care of
Christ hitherto, no truth is more manifest than this, that
there hath been a wisdom beyond your own, that hath
guided your ways, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 23. A power above your
own, that hath supported your burdens, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 26.
A spring of relief out of your selves that hath supplied
all your wants, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 35. He hath performed all
things for you.</p>
                           <p>4. Jesus Christ hath secured his people by many
promises to take care of them how dangerous soever
the times shall be, <hi>Eccles. 8. 12. Psal. 76. 10. Amos
9. 8, 9. Rom.</hi> 8. 28. O if these things were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed and well improved! fears could no more
distract or afflict our hearts, than storms or clouds
could trouble the upper Region: But we forget his
providences and promises and so are justly left in the
hands of our own fears to be afflicted for it.</p>

we are prone to blieve, because its dictates are

                           <p>2. The confident dictates of reason are frequently
confuted by experience all the world over; 'tis every

                           <p>Nothing then can be better for us, than to resign

                           <p>1. Doth the knowledge and application of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace cure our fears? The fear of God is both
a part of that Covenant, and an evidence of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
                           <p>2. Doth sinful fear plunge men into such distresses
of Conscience? Why, the fear of God will preserve
your ways clean and pure, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 9. and so those
mischiefs will be prevented.</p>
                           <p>3. Doth foresight and provision for evil days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
distracting fears when they come? Nothing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44184:64"/>
like the fear of God enables us to such a prevision,
and provision for them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
                           <p>4. Do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all to God? Surely 'tis the fear of God that
drives us to him as our only <hi>Asylum,</hi> and sure refuge,
<hi>Malachi</hi> 3. 16. They feared God, and thought upon
his name, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) they meditated his name which
was their refuge, his Attributes their chambers of rest.</p>
                           <p>5. Must our affections to the world be mortified,
before our fears can be subdued? This is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mortification, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                           <p>6. Do the worthy examples of those that are gone
before us, tend to the cure of our cowardise and fears?
Why, the fear of God will provoke in you an holy self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jealousie,
lest you fail of the grace they manifested,
and come short of those excellent patterns, <hi>Hebrews</hi>
12. 15.</p>
                           <p>7. Is the assurance of Interest in God, and the pardon
of sin, such an excellent Antidote against slavish fear?
Why, he that walks in the fear of God, shall walk in the
comforts of the Holy Ghost also, <hi>Acts</hi> 9 31.</p>
                           <p>8. Is integrity of heart and way such a fountain of
courage in evil times? Know Reader, no grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
this integrity and uprightness more than the
fear of God doth, <hi>Prov. 16. 6. Prov.</hi> 23. 17.</p>
                           <p>9. Do the reviving of past experiences suppress
sinful fears? no doubt this was the subject which the
fear of God put them upon, for mutual encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                           <p>10. Are the providences of God in the world such
cordials against fear? The fear of God is the very
character and mark of those persons over whom his
providence shall watch in the difficultest times, <hi>Eccles.</hi>
8. 12.</p>
                           <p>11. Doth our trusting in our own reason, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44184:65"/>
making it our rule and measure, breed so many fears?
Why, the fear of God will take men off from such
self-confidence, and bring them to trust the faithful

are sufferings such strangers to you? Why did you
not cast upon them in the days of peace, and reckon
that such days must come? Did you not covenant
with Christ to follow him whithersoever he should go,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44184:66"/>
to take up your cross and follow him? And did not
the Word plainly tell you, that <hi>All that will live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

12. And that we must through much tribulation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of God, Acts</hi> 14. 22. Did we
fall asleep in quiet and prosperous days, and dream
of Halcyon days all our time on earth? that the

should never be moved? That we should die in our
nest, and multiply our days as the sand; <hi>Babylon</hi>'s

tried before them. In the Seventh
Persecution under <hi>Decius,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Anno 250.</note> there were
standing before the Tribunal, certain
of the Warriours or Knights, <hi>viz. Ammon, Zenon,
Ptolomeus, Ingenuus,</hi> and a certain aged man called
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> who all standing by as Spectators when
a certain Christian was examined, and there seeing
him for fear, ready to decline, and fall away, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
burst for sorrow within themselves; they made
signs to him with their hands, and all gestures of the
body to be constant; this being noted be all the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by, they were ready to lay hold upon them; but
they preventing the matter, pressed up of their own
accord, before the bench of the Judge, professing
themselves to be Christians, insomuch that both the
<hi>President</hi> and the <hi>Benchers</hi> were all astonished, and
the Christians which were judged, the more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Such damping spectacles the Christians of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages had frequently set them before them.</p>
                           <p>And it was no small trial to some of them, to hear the
faintings &amp; abnegation of those that went before them,
pleaded against their constancy; as in the time of <hi>Valens</hi>
it was urged by the Persecutors: Those that came to
their trial before you, have acknowledged their errors,
begged our Pardon, and returned to us; and why
will you stand it out so obstinately? But the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
answered, <hi>Nos hac potissimum ratione viriliter
stabimus, For this very reason we will stand to it the

                           <p>3 And if presidents and experiences of others to
break the Ice before you, be so great an advantage,
surely we that live in these latter times have the most
and best helps of that nature that ever any people in
the world had. You have all their examples record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for your encouragement, and therefore <hi>Think it
not strange concerning the fiery trial, as though some
strange thing had happened to you,</hi> as the Apostle

tenderness and weakness Divinely assisted, cannot
bear the heaviest burden that ever God laid upon the
shoulders of any sufferer for Christ. Our suffering
and bearing abilities are not from Nature but from
Grace. We find men of strong bodies and resolute
daring minds, have fainted in the time of trial. Dr.
<hi>Pendleton</hi> in our own story was a man of a robust
and massie body, and a resolute daring mind; yet
when he came to the trial, he utterly fainted and fell
off. On the other side, what poor feeble bodies have
sustained the greatest torments! and out of weakness
been made strong, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34. The Virgin <hi>Eulalia</hi>
of <hi>Emerita</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> was young and tender, but
Twelve years old, and with much indulgence and
tenderness brought up in an honourable family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a person of considerable quality; yet how coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
did she sustain the most cruel Torments for
Christ! when the Judge fawned upon her with this
tempting language, Why wilt thou kill thy self, so
young a flower, and so near those honourable Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
and great Dowries thou mightest enjoy: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of returning a retracting or doubtful answer,
<hi>Eulalia</hi> threw down the Idol, and spurnt abroad with
her feet the heap of incense prepared for the censers:
And when the Executioner came to her, she enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him with this language, Go to thou Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
burn, cut, mangle thou these earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
it is an easie matter to break a brittle substance,
but the inward mind thou shalt not
hurt.<note place="margin">Acts and Mon. v. 1. p. 120.</note> And when one joynt was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from another, she said, Behold,
what a pleasure it is for them O
Christ, that remember thy triumphant victories, to
attain unto these high dignities. So that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional
strength is not to be made the measure of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44184:68"/>
our passive fortitude: God can make the feeblest and
tenderest person stand, when strong bodies and
blustering, resolute, daring minds faint and fall.</p>
                           <p>2. Are our bodies so weak, and hearts so tender
that we can bear no sufferings for Christ? Then we are
no way fit to be his followers. Christianity is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and Christians must endure hardship, 2 <hi>Tim. 2.
3.</hi> Delicacy and tenderness is as odd a sight in a
Christian, as it is in a Souldier: And we cannot be
Christs disciples, except we deliberate the terms, and
having considered well what it is like to cost us, do
resolve in the strength of God to run the hazard of all
with him and for him. 'Tis in vain to talk of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that we think not worthy the suffering and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
any great matter for.</p>
                           <p>3. And if indeed Reader, thy constitution be so
delicate and tender, that thou art not able to bear the
thoughts of torments for Christ; how is it thou art
not more terrified with the torments of hell, which
all they that deny Christon earth must feel and bear
eternally. O what is the wrath of man in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with the wrath of God, but as the bite of a flea
to the rendings of a Lyon. This is the consideration
propounded by Christ in <hi>Matth. 10. 28. Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell.</hi> The infinite and insupportable
wrath of the great and terrible God should make our
souls shrink and shake at the thoughts of it, rather than
the sufferings of the flesh which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>4. Know that the wisdom and tenderness of thy
father, will proportion the burden thou must bear,
to thy back that must bear it; he will debate in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and not overload thy feeble shoulders: Thou
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44184:68"/>
shalt find those things easie in trial, that now seem
insupportable in the terrible prospect; a way of
escape or support will certainly be opened that thou
mayest be able to bear it.</p>

                           <p>1. We are strong or weak in all our Trials, be
they great or small, according to the assisting grace
we receive from above; if he leave us in a common
and light trial to our own strength, it will be our
over-match, and if he assist us in great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
trials we shall be more than Conquerours.
At one time <hi>Abraham</hi> could offer up his only son to
God with his own hand; at another time he is so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of his life, that he acts very unsuitable to the
character of a Believer, and was shamefully rebuked
for it by <hi>Abimelech.</hi> At one time <hi>David</hi> could say,
Though an Host encamp against me I will not fear:
At another time he feigns himself mad, and acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
himself, both as a man, and as a man enriched
with so much faith and experience. At one time
<hi>Peter</hi> is afraid to be interrogated by a Maid; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44184:69"/>
time he could boldly confront the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and own Christ and his truths to their faces. In
extraordinary trials, we may warrantably expect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
assistances, and by them we shall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
through the greatest, how often soever we have
failed in smaller trials.</p>
                           <p>2. The design and end of God in giving us expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of our own weakness in lesser troubles, is not
to discourage and daunt us against we come to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(which is the use <hi>Satan</hi> here makes of it) but to
take us off from self-confidence and self-dependence;
to make us see our own weakness, that we may more
heartily and humbly betake our selves to him in the
way of faith and fervent supplication.</p>

                           <p>But some will object that they cannot help their
fears and tremblings when any danger appears; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
fear is the disease, at least the sad effect and
Symptome of a disease with which God hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them; a deep and fixed melancholy hath so far
prevailed, that the least trouble overcomes them:
If any sad afflictive providence befal, or but threaten
them; their fears presently rise, and their hearts
sink, sleep departs, thoughts tumultuate, the bloud
boyls, and the whole frame of nature is put into disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
If therefore the Lord should permit such great
and dreadful trials to befal them, they can think of
nothing less than dying by the hand of their own fears,
before the hand of any enemy touch them; or which
is a thousand times worse, be driven by their fears
into the net of temptation, even to deny the Lord
that bought them.</p>

                           <p>This I know is the sad case of many gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and I have reason to pity those that are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised;
O 'tis an heavy stroke, a dismal state, a deep
wound indeed: But yet the wisdom of God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
this affliction upon his people for gracious ends
and uses; hereby they are made the more tender and
watchful, circumspect and careful in their ways, that
they may shun and escape as many occasions of trouble
as they can, being so unable to grapple with them. I say
not but there are higher and nobler motives that
make them circumspect and tender, but yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of our own quietness is useful in its place,
and 'tis a mercy if that or any thing else be sanctified
to prevent sin, and promote care of duty. This is
your clog to keep you from straying.</p>
                           <p>2. And when you shall be called forth to greater
trials, that which you now call your snare, may be
your advantage, and that in divers respects.</p>
                           <p>1. These very distempers of body and mind serve
to imbitter the comforts and pleasures of this world to
you, and make life it self less desirable to you than it
is to others, they much wean your hearts from, and
make life more burdensome to you than it is to others
who enjoy more of the pleasure and sweetness of it
than you can do. I have often thought this to be one
design and end of Providence in permitting such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
to seize so many gracious persons as labour
under it, and providence knows how to make use
of this effect to singular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and advantage to you,<note place="margin">It was common with the Martyrs to sweeten death to themselves by reckoning what infirmities it would cure them of, one of his blindness, another of his lameness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

a call to suffering shall come; this may have its place
and use under higher and more spiritual considerations
to facilitate death, and make your separation from this
world the more easie to you; for though it be a more
noble and raised act of faith and self denial to offer up
to God our lives, when they are made most pleasant
and desirable to us upon natural accounts, yet it is
not so easie to part with them as it is when God hath
first imbittered them to us. Your lives are of little
value to you now, because of this burdensome clog
you must draw after you, but if you should increase
your burden by so horrid an addition of guilt, as the
denying of Christ, or his known truths would do, you
would not know what to do with such a life; it would
certainly lie upon your hands as a burthen. God
knows how to use these things in the way of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to your great advantage.</p>
                           <p>2. Art thou a poor melancholy and timorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Certainly if thou be gracious as well as timorous
this will drive thee nearer to God; and the greater thy
dangers are, the more frequent and fervent will thy
addresses to him be: Thou feelest the need of
everlasting arms underneath thee to bear thee up
under, and to carry through smaller troubles;
that other persons make nothing of, much more in
such deep trials, that put the strongest Christians to
the utmost of their faith and patience.</p>
                           <p>And 3dly. What if the Lord will make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
out of your weakness, to display more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his own power in your support? you know what
the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 9, 10. And he said unto
me, my grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is
made perfect in weakness: most gladly therefore will I
glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
rest upon me—for when I am weak, then am I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44184:70"/>
strong.</hi> If his infirmities might serve as a foil to set
off the grace of God with a more bright and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
lustre, he would rejoyce in his infirmities,
and so should you: Well then, let not this discourage
you, the infirmity of nature you complain of may
make death the less terrible; it served to that purpose
to blessed <hi>Basil</hi> (as you heard before) when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
threatned to tear out his Liver, he thought it a
kindness to have that Liver torn out that had given
him so much trouble. It may drive thee nearer to
God, and minister a fit opportunity for the display
of his grace in the time of need.</p>

                           <p>1. So far as the fears of such a misery awaken you
to prayer for the prevention of it, it may be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to your souls, but when it only works distraction
and despondency of mind, it is your sin, and Satans
snare. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> made a good use of
such a supposed evil by way of deprecation, <hi>Ier.
17. 17. Be not a terror unto me, thou art my hope in
the day of evil. q. d.</hi> In the evil day I have no place
of retreat or refuge, but thy love and favour; Lord,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44184:71"/>
that is all I have to depend on, and relieve my self
by: I comfort my self against trouble with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that if men be cruel, yet thou wilt be kind;
if they frown, thou wilt smile; if the world cast me
out, thou wilt take me in; but if thou shouldest be
a terror to me instead of a comforter, if they afflict
my body, and thou affright my soul with thy frowns
too; what a deplorable condition shall I be in then!
Improve it to such an end as he did, to secure the favour
of God, and it will do you no harm.</p>
                           <p>2. It is not usual with God to estrange himself
from his people in trouble, nor to frown upon them
when men do. The common experience of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
stands ready to attest and seal this truth, that
Christians never find more kindness from God, than
when they feel most cruelty from men for his sake;
consult the whole cloud of witnesses, and you will
find they have still found the undoubted verity of
that tried word in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. That <hi>the Spirit of
glory and of God resteth upon sufferers.</hi> The expression
seems to allude to the Dove that <hi>Noah</hi> sent forth out
of the Ark, which flew over the watry world, but
could not rest self any where till she returned to
the Ark. So the Spirit of God, called here the Spirit
of Glory, from his effects and fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> his chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sealing and reviving influences which makes
men glory and triumph in the most afflicted state.
This spirit of God seems like that Dove to hover up
and down, to flee hither and thither, over this person
and that, but resteth not so long upon any, as those
that suffer for righteousness sake, there he commonly
takes up his abode and residence.</p>

3. And what if it should fall out in some respect
according to your fears? that heaven and earth
should be both clouded together, yet it will not be
long before the pleasant light will spring up to you
again, <hi>Psal. 112. 4. Unto the upright there ariseth
light in the darkness.</hi> You shall have his supporting
presence till the comforter do come. When Mr.

their pains as well as you, they had the same thoughts

weak and tender persons to endure them patiently
and chearfully? some singing in the midst of flames,
others clapping their hands triumphantly, and to the
last sight that could be had of them in this world,
nothing appeared but signs and demonstrations of
joy unspeakable. Ah friends! we judge of sufferings
by the outside, and appearance, which is terrible, but
we know not the inside of sufferings which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comfortable. O when shall we have done with
our unbelieving <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>buts,</hi> our questionings and
doubtings of the power, wisdom and render care of
our God over us, and learn to trust him over all. Now
the just shall live by faith, and he that lives by faith,
shall never die by fear. The more you trust God,
the less you will torment your selves. I have done;
the Lord strengthen, stablish, and settle the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

been so seasonably offered for their relief by a weak
hand. <hi>Amen.</hi>

so lofty a spirit and sweet

                  <p>That the days are evil is a truth preached
to us by the convincing voice of sence, and
that they are like to be worse, few can doubt
that look into the moral causes of evil times,
the impudent height of sin, or into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
relating to these latter days; for
whom the sharpest sufferings are appointed,
to make way for the sweetest mercies. A
faithful Watchman of our own hath given us
fresh and late warning in these words of
truth. <hi>Hath God said nothing? Doth

your eyes Christians, stand, and look
through the land, Eastward, and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

tell me what you see? Behold a flood

of many unprovided souls for the misery
that is coming on them, and not knowing
how short my useful time will be to any,
(for I know it cannot be long) I have
endeavoured once more the assistance of
poor Christians in these two small Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

tremble at his word, to redeem their
time with double diligence, because the
days are evil. To clear up their interest
in Christ and the promises, lest the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                        <p>My Friends, a sound of trouble is in our ears, the
clouds gather and blacken upon us more and more:
Distress of Nations with perplexity seems to be near,
our day hastens to an end, and the shadows of the
night are stretching forth upon us. What greater
service therefore can I do for your souls, than by the
light of this Scripture (as with a Candle in my hand)
to lead you to your Chambers, and shew you your
Lodgings in the Attributes and promises of God,
before I take my leave of you, and bid you good
night.</p>
                        <p>O with what satisfaction should I part with you,
were I but sure to leave you under Christs wings! It
was Christs lamentation over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44184:77"/>
would not be gathered under his wings, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Eagle was ready to hover over that City; and
you know how dear they paid for their obstinacy and
infidelity. Be warned by that dreadful example, and
among the rest of your mercies bless God heartily
for this, That so sweet a voice sounds from Heaven
in your ears this day, this day of frights and troubles;

                        <p>This Chapter contains a lovely song fitted for the
lips of Gods <hi>Israel,</hi> notwithstanding their sad capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
for their God was with them in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
heard their hearts there with many promises of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and in the mystical sence, it relates to the New

truths, will be too long to Analize; it shall
suffice to search back only to the 17 <hi>verse,</hi> where
you find the poor captived Church under desponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

that in 2 <hi>Kings 19. 3. The children are come to the birth

                        </p>
                        <p>Against this discouragement a double relief is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the following Verses, the one is a <hi>Promise</hi>
of full deliverance at last; the other an <hi>Invitation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sure Sanctuary and place of defence for present,
until the time of their full deliverance came. The
promise we have in <hi>verse 19. Thy dead men shall live,
together with my dead body shall they arise; awake
and sing ye that dwell in the dust,</hi> &amp;c. Their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
was a civil death, and <hi>Babylon</hi> as a grave to them,
So it is elsewhere described, <hi>Ezek. 37. v. 1, 3, 12.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44184:78"/>
I will open your graves and cause you to come up out
of your graves and bring you into the land of</hi> Israel.
And therefore their deliverance is carried under the
notion of a resurrection in that promise.</p>

                           <hi>Objection.</hi> Yea, (might they reply) the hopes
of deliverance at last is some comfort, but alas,
that may be far off: How shall we subsist till then?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Well enough, for as you have in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
a sure ground of deliverance at last, so in the
interim here is a gracious Invitation into a place of
security for the present, <hi>Come my people, enter thou
into thy chambers.</hi> In which invitation Four things
call for our close attention.</p>
                        <p>1. The <hi>Form</hi> of the invitation, including in it
the qualified subject, <hi>Come my people.</hi> Gods own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people, who have chosen God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

covered with the shadow of death, <hi>Psal. 44. 18, 19,
20.</hi> These are the people invited to the chambers of
security. And the form of invitation is full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
compassion, <hi>Come my people;</hi> like a tender father
that sees a storm coming upon his children in the fields,
and takes them by the hand, saying, Come away
my dear children, hasten home with me le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Deluge, Come thou and all thy house into
the Ark, and God shut him in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. 16. This
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44184:78"/>
is the form of the invitation, <hi>Come my people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The priviledge invited to; <hi>Enter thou into thy
chambers.</hi> There is some variety, and indeed varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
rather than contrariety in the exposition of these
words.</p>
                        <p>In this all are agreed, that by their
Chambers,<note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 14.</note> is not meant the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their own houses; for alas,
their houses were left unto them desolate; and if not,
yet they could be no security to them now, when
neither their own houses nor their fortified city was
able to defend them before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it of the Grave,
and makes these Chambers the same <hi>Grot. in loc.</hi>
with the Chambers of death. <hi>Ite in
cubiqula, h. e. sepulchra vestra.</hi> The grave indeed
is a place of security where God sometimes hides some
of his people in troublesome times, as is plain in <hi>Isa.
57.</hi> 1, 2. but I cannot allow this to be the sence of
this Text; God doth not comfort his captives with a
natural against a civil death, but with protection in
their troubles upon earth, as is evident from the scope
of the whole Chapter.</p>
                        <p>By Chambers therefore, others understand the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Divine providence, where the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ints are hid
in evil days. So our <hi>Annotatons</hi> on the place, and
no doubt but this is in part the special intendment of
the Text.</p>
                        <p>Others understand the <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> of
God to be here meant, as well as his providences.
And I conceive all three make the sence of the Text
full, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Divine Attributes engaged in the
promises, and exercised or actuated in the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God; these are the sanctuaries and refuges
of Gods people in days of trouble.</p>

                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:44184:79"/>
                           <hi>Calvin</hi> understands it of the quiet repose of the
Believers mind in God, but that is rather the effect of
his security, than the place of it. It's Gods Attributes

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> The answer is easie, though they be Gods
Properties, yet they are his peoples priviledges, and
benefits; for when God makes over himself to them
in Covenant to be their God, he doth as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
to them the Keys of all his Attributes for their
benefit and security; and is as if he should say, my
wisdom is yours, to contrive for your good; my
power is yours, to protect your persons; my mercy
yours, to forgive your sins; my all-sufficiency yours,
to supply your wants; all that I am, and all that I
have is for your benefit and comfort. These are the
Chambers provided for the Saints lodgings and into
these they are invited to enter. <hi>Enter thou into thy
chambers.</hi> By entring into them understand their
actual faith exercised in acts of affiance, and resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God in all their dangers. So <hi>Psal. 56. 3. At
what time I am afraid</hi> (said <hi>David) I will trust
in thee. q.. d.</hi> Lord, if a Storm come I will make
bold to shelter my self from it under thy wings by
faith; look as unbelief shuts the doors of all Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes

all to the Soul, and so much of the priviledge invited
to, which is the second thing.</p>
                        <p>3. We have here a needful caution for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this priviledge to our selves in evil times, <hi>shut

Care must be taken that no passage be left
open to the Devil to creep in after us and drive us out
of our refuge; for so it falls out too often with
Gods people, when they are at rest in Gods name or
promises, <hi>Satan</hi> creeps in by unbelieving doubts and
puzling objections, and beats them out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
back again into trouble; it is therefore of great
concernment in such times especially, <hi>not to give
place to the Devil,</hi> as the phrase is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17. but

                        <p>4. Lastly, we are to note with what Arguments
or motives they are prest to betake themselves to this
refuge. There are two found in the Text, the one
working upon their <hi>fear,</hi> the other upon their <hi>hope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That which works upon their <hi>fear,</hi> is a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a storm coming, the indignation of God will
fall like a tempest; this is supposed in the Text, and
plainly expressed in the words following, <hi>For the
Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of
the earth, ver.</hi> 21.</p>
                        <p>2. The other is fitted to work upon their <hi>hope,</hi>
though his indignation fall like a Storm, yet it will
not continue long; it shall be but for amoment, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

From all which the general observation is this.</p>

                           <p>That the Attributes, Promises, and Providences of

18. 10. And his Attributes are his name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 5.
For by them he is known as a man is known by his
name, and this his name is a strong Tower for his
peoples security; now what is the use and end of a
Tower in a City, but to receive and secure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
when the outworks are beaten to the
ground, the walls scaled, and the houses left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate?</p>
                           <p>And as it is here resembled to a Tower, so in <hi>Isa.
33.</hi> 16. Its shadowed out unto us by a munition of
rocks, <hi>His place of defence shall be a munition of rocks.</hi>
How secure is that person that is environed with rocks
on every side? Yea you will say, but yet a rock is
but a cold and barren refuge, though other enemies
cannot, yet hunger and thirst can invade and kill him
there. No, in this rock is a store-house of provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as a magazine for defence; so it follows,
<hi>Bread shall be given him and his water shall be sure.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And sometimes it is resembled to us by the wings of
a fowl, spread with much tenderness over her young
for their defence, <hi>Psal. 57. 1. Yea, in the shadow of
thy wings will I make my refuge until these calamities
be overpast.</hi> So <hi>Psal. 17. 8. Keep me as the apple of
thine eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings.</hi>
No part of the body hath more guards upon it, than
the apple of the eye God is as careful to preserve his
people, as men are to preserve their eyes; <hi>and he
that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eyes.</hi>
But we need not go from one Metaphor to another,
to shew you where the Saints refuge is in time of
danger, you have a whole bundle of them lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in that one Scripture, <hi>Psal. 18. 2. The Lord is
my rock and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God,
my strength in whom I will trust, my buckler, and
the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</hi> Where
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44184:80"/>
you find all kinds of defence, whether natural, or
artificial, under a pleasant variety of apt Metaphors,
ascribed to God for the security of his people.</p>
                           <p>Now for the casting of this great point into as easie

                        <p>THis is plainly implyed in the Text, that there
are times of indignation appointed to befal the
world; yea, and more than this; not only that such
times shall come, but the duration and continuance
is also under an appointment. <hi>Hide thy self for a

Prophet tells us in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 2. that these Stormy times are
under a decree, and that decree is there compared to a

months, and then to travel and bring forth: Even so
it is in the judgments God brings upon the world.
We see them not in the days of provocation, <hi>sed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc

shall become visible to the world. As there are in

Kingdoms, Families, and particular persons, like

sees it necessary to purge the world by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<hi>When thy judgments are in the earth, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

of his Ministers could ever do: Those that
slept securely under our Ministry, will fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
under his rods; those that are without faith are

                        <p>BUt of what use soever these National Judgments
are to others, to be sure they shall be beneficial
to Gods own people; when others die by fear, they
shall live by faith: If they be baneful poison to the
wicked, they shall be healthful physick to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For,</p>
                        <p>1. By these calamities God will mortifie and
purge their corruptions; this Winter weather shall
be useful to destroy and rot those rank weeds, which
the Summer of prosperity bred, <hi>Isa. 27. 9. By this
therefore shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
in its own nature is griping and unpleasant; but
very useful and necessary to purge the body from
noxious and malignant humours, which retained
may put life it self in hazard; and it is with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politick, as with the body Natural.</p>
                        <p>2. National Judgments drive the people of God
nearer to him, and one to another, they drive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God to their knees, and make them pray more
frequently, more fervently, and more feelingly than
they were wont to do; in this posture you find them
in <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. of this Chapter. <hi>Yea, in the way of thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
O Lord, have we waited for thee, the desire
of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of
thee. With my soul have I desired thee in the night, yea,
with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In a word, by these distractions and distresses
of Nations, the people of God are more weaned from
the world, and made to long more vehemently after
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44184:82"/>
heaven; being now convinced by experience that
this is not their rest. When all things are tranquil
and prosperous, Gods own people are but too apt
to fall asleep and dream of pleasure and rest on earth,
to say as <hi>Iob</hi> in his prosperity, <hi>I shall die in my nest,
I shall multiply my days as the sand.</hi> And then are
their heads and hearts filled with many projects and
designs; to promote their comforts, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for their accommodations on earth: The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of earthly cares and comforts take up their
time and thoughts, too much, and make them that
they mind death and eternity too little. But saith
God, this must not be so, things must not go on at
this rate, the prosperous world must not thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
my people; I must imbitter the earth that I
may thereby sweeten heaven the more to them; when
they find no rest below, they will surely seek it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                        <p>These and such like are the gracious designs and
ends of God in shaking the world by his terrible
judgments; but yet, though National troubles must
necessarily come, the wisest of men cannot positively
determine the precise time of those judgments; we
may indeed by the signs of the times discern their
near approach; yet our judgment can be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and conjectural, seeing there are tacite condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the dreadfullest threatnings, <hi>Ier. 18. 7, 8.
Ionah</hi> 3. 9, 10. And such is the merciful nature of
God, that he oft times turns away his anger from his
people, when it seems ready to pour down upon them,

security, but encourages to repentance, and
greater fervency in Prayer.</p>

                           </gap>ce is above all hazards, but
creature enjoyments and comforts are not. The
sins of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> involve not only their own
houses and estates, but <hi>Lots</hi> also, in the ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow;
wicked men often fare the better for the
company of the godly, and the godly often fare the
worse for the company of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>And it is not to be wondered at, if we consider
that even the Saints themselves have an hand in the
provocation of these judgments, as well as others,
<hi>Deut. 32. 19. And when the Lord saw it he abhorred
them, because of the provoking of his sons and of his
daughters.</hi> We have contrihuted to the common heap
guilt, and therefore must justifie God if we partake
with others in the common calamity.</p>
                        <p>2. They are greatly concerned in such judgments
upon a Religious and Christian account, for it is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for the floud of Gods judgments not only to sweep
away our civil and natural, but our spiritual and best
enjoyments and comforts. Thus the Ordinances of
God ceased in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there the faithful bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their misery upon that account, <hi>Ps. 137. per totum;
we wept when we remembred thee, O Zion.</hi> Not only
<hi>Israel</hi> flies, but the <hi>Ark</hi> is taken prisoner by the enemy,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 11. And you find the people of God
more deeply concerned upon this account, than for
all their outward losses and other sufferings, <hi>Zeph. 3.
18. I will gather them of thee that are sorrowful for
the Solemn assemblies, to whom the reproach of it was
aburthen.</hi> For by how much our souls are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than our bodies, and the concerns of Eternity
over ballance those of time; by so much more are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44184:84"/>
we concerned in the loss of our spiritual, more than
of our temporal mercies and enjoyments.</p>
                        <p>Grace indeed cannot be lost, but the means and
instruments by which it is begotten may; the golden
candlestick is one of the moveables in Gods house,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see a twofold concernment that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
God have in the effects of National Judgments.</p>

                        <p>THis being So, how should all that fear God be

the cause and inlet of many other sins: But to a due
sense both of the evils of misery that will befal the
Nation when Gods indignation comes upon it; and
the evils of sin that have incensed it; and to such a
fear of both as may seasonably awaken us to the use
of all preventing remedies. And first,</p>
                        <p>1. O that all would lay to heart the National
miseries that Gods indignation threatens upon us. It
is said, <hi>Psal. 107. 34. A fruitful land is turned into
barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>

all the Passengers: Or if you were sure, that for
your parts you might be safe; would it not be a
bitter thing, to stand upon the shore, and see such

To see this glorious Land defaced, the blessed Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

dream of exemption, but by so much the greater will
our distress be, when it shall surprise us.</p>
                        <p>2. You that are the people of God ought to be
deeply affected with the spiritual miseries that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us in the day of Gods indignation: do you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what the removing the Candlestick out of its place
is? A departing Gospel, the going down of the Sun up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Gospel Feasts, and the gross darkness of Popery to fill

to him that year.</p>
                        <p>3. But especially labour to affect your hearts with
the sins that have incensed Gods indignation: So did
the Saints in <hi>Ierusalem, Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. they sighed and
mourned for all the abominations committed in it.
So did <hi>Lot, 2 Pet. 2. 7. He vexed his righteous soul
from day to day.</hi> So did <hi>David, Psal. 119. 136.
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because men kept
not thy law.</hi> O who that loves God can refrain
tears, to see the God of pity, the God of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

of Gods indignation as may quicken you to the use of
preventing duties. So <hi>Amos 4. 12. Because I will

                        <p>1. Scripture <hi>Emblems,</hi> and among many, I will
upon this occasion single out two or three principal
ones. In <hi>Ezek. 5. 1, 2, 3. And thou son of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                              </gap>, and
cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard,
then take the balances to weigh and divide the hair;
thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of
the City, when the days of the siege are fulfilled, and
thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a
knife, and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind;
and I will draw out a sword after them: Thou shalt
also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in
thy skirts.</hi> You find this truth shadowed out in this
excellent Emblem; <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the capital City is the
head, the numerous inhabitants are the hair, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44184:86"/>
King of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Razor, the weighing it in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances,
is the exactness of Gods procedure in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them; the fire, knife, and wind, are the
various judgments to which the people were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the hiding of a few in the Prophets skirt, is the
care of God for the preservation of his own remnant
in the common calamity, this is one Emblem clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this point. And then, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 3, 4. the same
truth is presented to us in another Emblem, as lively
and significant as the former. <hi>And behold, six men
came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth
toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon
in his hand, and one among them was cloathed in linnen
with a writers ink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>orn by his side, and they went in
and stood before the brazen Altar; and the glory of
the God of Israel was gone up from the Cherub, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was, to the threshold of his house, and he
called to the man cloathed with linnen, which had
the writers inkborn by his side, And the Lord said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, go through the midst of the City, through the
midst of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and set a mark upon the foreheads
of the men that sigh, and cry for all the abominations
that be done in the midst thereof.</hi> The men that had
charge over the City are the <hi>Angels</hi> appointed for
that Service, some with slaughter weapons whose
work it was to destroy, but one among them had a
writers inkhorn by his side, and he was imployed to
take the names, and mark the persons of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ones among them, whom the Lord intended to
preserve and hide in that common overthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of the City, and these were to be all marked
man by man before the destroying Angel was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
his bloudy work. Oh see the tender care of
God over his upright mourning servants! Once
more, the same truth is represented in a third Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44184:87"/>
                           <hi>Mal. 3. 17. And they shall be mine, saith the
Lord, in the day that I make up my jewels, and I
will spare them as a man spareth his own son that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
him.</hi> Where the world is compared to an house
on fire; God to the master, and father of the family;
the wicked to the useless lumber therein; the Saints to
the children and jewels in the house; about these his
first and principal care of preservation is exercised,
these he will be sure to save, whatever become of the
rest. Thus you have the chosen Emblems that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this comfortable truth.</p>
                        <p>2. As these Scripture Emblems illustrate it, so there
are many excellent Scripture Promises to confirm it,
<hi>Isa. 32. 2. A man shall be for an hiding place from the
wind, and a covert from the tempest: as rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in a dry place.</hi> This man is the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
the tempest spoken of, are the miseries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
of War, which make the land on which it
talls, an hot, dry, and weary land; in the midst and
rage whereof, Christ shall be to his faithful ones a
covert for protection, a river of water for supply;
and a shadow for refreshment, that is to say, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall be necessary either for their safety or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Christ is not only a shadow to his people from
the wrath of God, but also from the rage of men.
Again, <hi>Zech. 2. 5. I will be a wall of fire round about.</hi>
Alluding to Travellers in the desert, who to prevent
danger from wild beasts in the night, use to make a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fire round about the place where they lie down
to rest, and this fire was as a wall to secure them.
You have the like gracious promise also made to the
poor captived Church in <hi>Ezek. 11. 16. Although I
have cast them far off among the heathen, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them among the countreys, yet will I be to them

                        <p>3. And all these promises have in all ages been
faithfully fulfilled to the Saints; you have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Scripture for this, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. when the
floud was brought upon the old world, there was
one <hi>Noah</hi> a righteous man in it, and for him God
provided an Ark. When <hi>Sodom</hi> was overthrown,
there was one <hi>Lot</hi> in it, a just man, and God secured
him out of danger; upon which that comfortable
conclusion is built, <hi>ver. 9. The Lord knows how
to deliver the godly.</hi> When <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
a <hi>Pella</hi> was provided as a refuge for the godly
there. Remarkable is that place to this purpose, <hi>Isa.
25. 4. Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a
shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible
one is as a storm against the wall.</hi> And this hath God
been not only once or twice, but in all ages, <hi>Psal.
90. 1. Lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all

                        <p>YEt we must remember, that all who are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in common calamities are not the people
of God; nor are all that are indeed his people prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
He hath people enough to divide into two
ranks, as the Husbandman his corn, some for the
mill, and some to reserve for seed. There be stars
enough in the heaven to shine in both <hi>Hemispheres,</hi>
and there are Saints enough in the world, some to
shine in heaven, and some to preserve the Church
on earth.</p>
                        <p>1. All that are preserved are not the people of
God; in the Ark a wicked <hi>Cham</hi> was preserved and
those that were preserved in <hi>Egypt,</hi> many of them
were afterwards destroyed for their unbelief. <hi>Iud.</hi> 5.
So in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s vision, a part even of those hairs which
were spared, were afterwards cast into the fire, <hi>Ezek
5.</hi> 4. Preservation from the dominion of sin, and the
wrath to come, is peculiar to Gods own people;
but as for temporal deliverances we cannot infer that
conclusion.</p>
                        <p>2. Nor yet can we say that all Gods people shall
be preserved; that promise <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. leaves it upon
<hi>a may be,</hi> many a precious Christian hath fallen in
the common calamity, they have been preserved
in, but not from trouble.</p>
                        <p>But it is usual with God to preserve some in the
sorest judgments: And the grounds of it are,</p>
                        <p>1. Because, some must be left as a seed to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and preserve the Church, which is perpetual
and can never fail; he never so overthrows nations
as <hi>Sodom</hi> was overthrown, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 9. this was the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44184:88"/>
ground of that promise, <hi>Ier. 30. 11. For I am with
thee, saith the Lord, to save thee, though I make a
full end of all nations, whither I have scattered thee,
yet will I not make a full end of thee.</hi> And of that plea,
<hi>Amos 7. 2. O Lord God, forgive I beseech thee; by
whom shall Iacob arise? for he is small.</hi> Except the
Lord had left a small remnant, we had been as <hi>Sodom.</hi>
Remarkable to this purpose, is that Scripture, <hi>Isa. 6.
13. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return,
and shall be eaten: As a Teyl-tree, and as an Oak
whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves.
So the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</hi> This
preserved remnant is the holy seed, by which the
Church is propagated and continued, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 28.</p>
                        <p>2. Because, God will even in this world own and
reward the fears and sorrows of his people for the
sins of the times, and sufferings of the Church, with
the joy and comfort of better times, and a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of <hi>Sions</hi> consolation; so <hi>Isa. 66. 10. Rejoyce
ye with</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>ye that have mourned for her.</hi>
They that have sown in tears, do sometimes live to
reap in joy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 6. they shall say as <hi>Isa. 25. 9.
Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he
is come to save us.</hi> And those that live not to reap
down in this world the harvest of their own Prayers
and tears, shall be no losers; a full and better reward
shall be given them in heaven, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 22</p>
                        <p>3. Because the preserved remnant of Saints are
they that must actually give unto God the glory of
all his providential administrations in the world, both
of judgments and mercies upon others, and towards
themselves. <hi>They that go down to the pit do not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his praise, the living, the living they praise him,
Isa.</hi> 38. 18, 19. Thus when God turned back
<hi>Sion</hi>'s captivity, the Remnant of Saints that were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44184:89"/>
preserved, were they that recorded his praise, <hi>Psal.
126. 1, 2. Then was our mouth filled with laughter.</hi>
And fully to this sense is that Scripture, <hi>Psal. 102.
19, 20, 21. He delivers those that are appointed to
death, i. e.</hi> That men had doomed to death, <hi>That
they may declare the name of the Lord, in Sion, and
his praise in</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>4. The hiding of the Saints in evil days, is the
greatest discovery of the hand of God in the world;
when he <hi>hides</hi> them he <hi>shews</hi> himself, and that,
both to the Saints and to their enemies.</p>
                        <p>It is one of the most glorious mysteries of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that ever the world beheld, <hi>viz.</hi> the strange and
wonderful protection of poor helpless Christians from
the rage and fury of their mighty and malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
though they walk visibly among them, yet
they are, as it were, hid from their hands, but not from
their eyes. <hi>So Ier.</hi> 1. 18. You find God made that
Prophet among the envious Princes, and against an
enraged and mighty King, <hi>As a defenced City, and
as an iron pillar, and as a brazen wall.</hi> And indeed
it was easier to them to conquer and take in the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Fort or Garison, than that single Person, who
yet walked day by day naked and open among them
So <hi>Luther</hi> a poor Monk was made invincible, all the
Papal power could not touch him, for God hid him
All the world against one <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and yet not able
to destroy him, for God hid him. This is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
of the glorious power of God in the world, and
he hath much honour by it.</p>
                        <p>Well then, if there be a God that takes care of
his own in evil days, do not you be distractingly
careful what shall become of you in such times; you
cannot see how it is possible for you to escape, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. the Lord knows how to deliver
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44184:89"/>
when you do not. Little did <hi>Lot</hi> know the way and
manner of his preservation, till God opened it to
him, nor <hi>Noah</hi> till God contrived it for him: There
was no way to be contrived by them for escape. He
that knew how to deliver them, can deliver you
also.</p>
                        <p>Leave your selves to Gods dispose, it shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be to your advantage; the Church is his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
care, <hi>Isa. 27. 3. I the Lord do keep it, I will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it every moment lest any hurt it, I will keep it night
and day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The more you commit your selves to his care, the
more you engage it, <hi>Isa. 26. 3. Thou wilt keep him
in prefect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because
he trusteth in thee.</hi> He will certainly find a place of
safety for his people under or in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Neither be too much dejected when the number
of visible professors seems but small, think not the
Church will perish, when it is brought so low:
This was <hi>Elijah</hi>'s case, he thought he had been left
alone, that Religion had been preserved in his single
person, as the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of the world; but see 1 <hi>Kings
19.</hi> 18. God hath enough left if we were in our

him more than you to look to that.</p>

Iosephus</hi> also tells us that a
little before the execution of this
judgment upon them,<note place="margin">Iosephus de bel. Iud. lib. 7. c. 2. Tac. lib. 21.</note> a voice was
heard in the temple, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi>
let us go hence, which voice <hi>Tacitus</hi> also in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
mentions, <hi>Audita major humana vox, excedere
Deos, simul ingens motus excedentium.</hi> It was more
than an humane voice, telling them God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from them, and withal there was heard the
rushing noise as of some that were going out of the
Temple.</p>
                        <p>And as there were extraordinary premonitions of
approaching judgments by revelation to the Prophets
of old, and signs from heaven; so there still are stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and ordinary rules by which the world may be
admonished of Gods judgments before they come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
                        <p>And the general rule, by which men may discern
the indignation of God before it comes, is this;
☞ <hi>When the same provocations, and evils are
found in one Nation, which have brought down
the wrath of God upon another nation; this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
sign of Gods judgment at the door.</hi> For God is
unchangeably holy and just, and will not favour that
in one people, which he hath punished in another;
nor bless that in one age, which he hath cursed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And therefore that which hath been a sign
of Judgment to one, must be so to all.</p>
                        <p>Here it is that the carcases of those sinners whose
sins had cast them away, are as it were cast up upon
the Scripture shore, for a warning to all others that
they steer not the same ill course they did. 1 <hi>Cor.
10. 6. Now these things were our examples.</hi> The
<hi>Israelites</hi> are made examples to us, plainly intimating
that if we tread the same path, we must expect the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44184:91"/>
same punishment. Let us therefore consider what
were the evils that provoked Gods judgments against
his ancient people, whom he was so loth to give up,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 8. and so long ere he did give up, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 6.
and we shall find by the concurrent accounts that the
Prophets give,</p>
                        <p>1. That Gods worship among them was generally
mixed and corrupted with their own inventions, for
so it is said, <hi>Psal. 106. 40, 41. they went a whoring
with their own inventions.</hi> And this so inflamed the
wrath of God, who is a jealous God, and tender over
his own honour, that he abhorred his own inheritance;
yea, he expresses himself as a man doth whose heart
is broken by the unfaithfulness of his wife, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 9.
Upon this account his professing people became the
generation of his wrath, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 29, 30.</p>
                        <p>2. Incorrigible obstinacy under gentler correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Scarcity, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews,
Pestilence, and Sword had been upon them;
and still these that remained, though saved as a
brand out of the fire, in which their fellow sinners
perished, would not return to God; and this hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the general ruine, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. This presages the
ruine of Nations indeed.</p>
                        <p>3. Stupidity and senselesness of Gods hand was a
sad Omen, and cause of that peoples ruine; So <hi>Isa. 26.
10, 11. Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not
see.</hi> No nor yet when his hand is laid on, <hi>Isa. 42.
24,</hi> 25. It is not some small drop of Gods anger that
passes without observation, but the <hi>fury of his anger;
not some light skirmish of his judgments with them,
but the strength of battel:</hi> Not in a corner upon
some particular person, or family, but that which set
him on fire round about; yet all this could not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them. <hi>He hath poured upon him the fury of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44184:91"/>
anger, and the strength of battel, and it hath set him
on fire round about, yet he knew it not, and it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> Prodigious stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity!
to be in the midst of flames, yea, to be seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, and destroyed sooner than awakened.
So you find again in <hi>Hos. 7. 9. Gray hairs were here
and there upon</hi> Ephraim, <hi>yet he knew it not.</hi> Youth
and Age are easily distinguished, and gray hairs
do plainly distinguish them, being the plain tokens of
a declining State, yet they took no notice of them.
Such stupidity is ever more the forerunner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                        <p>4. Persecution of Gods faithful Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was another forerunning sign of their ruine,
2 <hi>Chron. 36. 16. They mocked the messengers of God,
and despised his words, and misused his Prophets until
the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there
was no remedy.</hi> There were also a number of upright
Souls among them, that desired to worship God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own prescription, but a snare was laid for
them in <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and a net spread upon <hi>Tabor;</hi> and
therefore was judgment towards that people, <hi>Hos. 5. 1.
Mizpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor</hi> were places in the way lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the true worship
of God was, and there were <hi>Informers</hi> or Spies set by the
Priests to intercept such as would venture to serve
God at Jerusalem according to his own prescription,
this also foreboded the judgments of God upon that
nation.</p>
                        <p>5. The decay of the life and power of Godliness
among them plainly foreshewed their ruine at hand,
<hi>Hos. 4. 18. Their drink is sour,</hi> where under the
<hi>Metaphor</hi> of dead and sour drink which hath lost its
spirit and is become flat; their formal, heartless, and
perfunctory duties are severely taxed and condemned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="168" facs="tcp:44184:92"/>
6. To conclude, the mutual animosities, and feuds
among that professing people, evidently shewed
judgment to be at the door. <hi>Hos. 9. 7. The days of
visitation are come, the days of recompence are come,</hi>
Israel <hi>shall know it: the Prophet is a fool, the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity,
and the great hatred.</hi> This great hatred was one of
the greatest sins, and saddest signs upon them. This
Spirit of enmity sowed by the Devil among them
hastened their calamity. If <hi>Ephraim</hi> will envy <hi>Iudah,</hi>
and <hi>Iudah</hi> vex <hi>Ephraim</hi> the common enemy shall
part the fray: when the whole Nation was under
water, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies under the very walls
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their own Historians tell us, what
bitter contentions and sharp conflicts continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to the very last. These things must be
looked upon by all Wise and considerate men, no
otherwise than we look upon Glazing Meteors, and
Blazing Comets, portending judgment and ruine at
the door. We have had indeed terrible Signs in
Heaven, a dreadful rod of God shaken over us of
late, which all men ought to behold with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
Yet I must say those Moral Signs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
forementioned, are much more terrible and
portentous. According therefore to the evidence
of these signs among us; let all upright hearts
be affected and awakened with expectations of
Gods righteous judgments. It is indeed below faith
to expect evil days with despondency and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
but surely it is a noble exercise of Faith, so
to expect them, as to make due preparation for
them.</p>

                        <p>ANd if we enquire for what End God gives such
warnings to the world, and premonishes them
from Heaven, of the judgments that are coming on
the earth, know that he doth it upon a threefold
account.
<list>
                              <item>1. To prevent their Execution.</item>
                              <item>2. To leave the Careless inexcusable.</item>
                              <item>3. To make them more tolerable and easie to his
own people.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Warning is given with design to prevent the
execution of judgments; this is plain from <hi>Amos 4.
12. Therefore will I do this unto thee;</hi> there is warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given; <hi>and because I will do this, prepare to meet
thy God O Israel:</hi> There is the gracious design of
preventing it, by bringing them seasonably upon
their knees at the foot of an angry God: You see
the Lord expects it from all his Children, that they
fall at his feet in deep humiliation, and fervent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
whenever he goes forth in the way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
What else was the design of God in sending
<hi>Ionah</hi> to <hi>Nineveh</hi> with that dreadful message but to
excite them to repentance, and prevent their ruine?
This <hi>Ionah</hi> guessed at, and therefore declined the
message to secure his credit, well knowing, that if they
took warning and repented, the gracious nature of
God would soon melt into compassion over them:
Free grace would make him appear as a liar among
the people; for to that sense his own words sound,
<hi>Ionah 4. 2. Was not this my saying when I was yet in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44184:93"/>
my Countrey, Therefore I fled before unto</hi> Tarshish,
<hi>for I knew that thou art a gracious God. q. d.</hi> I
thought before hand it would come to this; I
knew how willing thou art to be prevented by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
therefore to secure my credit, I fled to
<hi>Tarshish.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. He forewarns of judgments to leave the Incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wholly inexcusable, that those who have neither
sense of Sin, nor fear of Judgment before, might have
no cloak for their folly, nor plea for themselves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<hi>What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?
Ier. 13. 21, 22. q. d.</hi> What Plea or Apology is left thee
after so many fair warnings? You cannot say you were
surprized, before you were admonished, or ruined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you were warned.</p>
                        <p>3. God warns of Judgments before they come to
make them the more easie to his people when they
come indeed; thus in <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 4. Christ foretold his
Disciples of their approaching sufferings, that when
they came, they should not be found amazed at them,
or unprovided for them; for unexpected miseries are
astonishing to the best men, and destructive to wicked
men, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26, 27, 28.</p>
                        <p>Well then if it be so, let all that are wise in heart
consider the Signs of the times, and seasonably heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to Gods warnings. <hi>The Lords voice crieth to the

'Tis our wisdom to way-lay our troubles, and provide
for the worst estate, whilst we enjoy the best: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is he that is at once believing, and praying
for good days, and preparing for the worst. <hi>Noah</hi>'s

with fear, prepared an Ark.</hi> Preventing mercies
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44184:93"/>
are the most ravishing mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 10. And
preventing calamities are the sorest calamities, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos
9.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>And let us heartily bewail the supiness and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of the world in which we live, who take no
notice of Gods warnings, but put the evil day far from
them, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3. who will admit no <hi>fear,</hi> till they
are past all <hi>hope;</hi> they see God housing his Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace,
yet will not see the evil to come from which
God takes them, <hi>Isa. 57. 1, 2. The righteous perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men
are taken away, none considering that the righteous
is taken away from the evil to come; he shall enter
into peace, they shall rest in their beds each one walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his uprightness.</hi> They hear the cry of sin which
is gone up to heaven, but cry not for the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are committed, nor tremble at the judgments
that they will procure.</p>
                        <p>O careless Sinners drowned in Stupidity, and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like <hi>Ionah</hi> under the Hatches, when others are
upon their knees and at their wits end! do Saints
tremble, and are you secure? Have not you more
reason to be afraid than they? If judgments come,
the greatest harm it can do them, is but to hasten them
to Heaven; but as for you, it may hurry you away
to Hell: They only fear tribulation in the way; but
you will not fear damnation in the end. Believe it
Reader, in days of common calamity both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                        <p>HAving more briefly dispatched the foregoing
preliminary Propositions it remains that we
now more fully open this fifth Proposition, which
contains the main subject matter of this Discourse;
here therefore our meditations must fix and abide,
and truly such is the deliciousness of the subject to
Spiritual hearts, that I judge it wholly needless to
offer any other motive besides it self to engage your
affections. Let us therefore view our <hi>Chambers,</hi>
and see how well God hath provided for his Children
in all their distresses that befal them in this world; it
is our fathers voice that calls to us, <hi>Come my people,
enter thou into thy chambers.</hi> And the</p>

                           <p>Which comes to be opened as a Refuge to distressed
Believers in a stormy day, is that most secure and
safe Attribute of <hi>Divine Power;</hi> into this let us first
enter by serious and believing meditation, and
see how safe they are whom God hides under the
protection thereof in the worst and most dangerous

<list>
                                 <item>1. In its own Nature and Property.</item>
                                 <item>2. With respect to the Promises.</item>
                                 <item>3. As it is actuated by Providence on the behalf
of distressed Saints.</item>
                              </list>
And then give you a comfortable prospect of their
safe and happy condition, who take up their lodgings
by Faith in this Attribute of God.</p>
                           <p>1. Let us consider the Power of God in it self, and
we shall find it represented to us in the Scriptures in
these three lovely Properties, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <list>
                                 <head>Power.</head>
                                 <item>1. Omnipotent</item>
                                 <item>2. Supreme</item>
                                 <item>3. Everlasting</item>

                           </p>
                           <p>1. As an Omnipotent and All-sufficient Power,
which hath no bounds or limits, but the pleasure and
will of God, <hi>Dan. 4. 34, 35. He doth according to
his will in the armies of Heaven; and among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the earth, and none can stay his hand,
or say unto him, What dost thou?</hi> So <hi>Psalm
135. 6. Whatsoever the Lord pleased that did he,
in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Seas, and all deep
places.</hi> You see Divine pleasure is the only rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which Divine Power exerts it self in the
world; we are not therefore to limit and restrain it in
our narrow and shallow thoughts, and to think in this
or in that the Power of God may help or secure us;
but to believe that he is able to do exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
above all that we can ask or think. Thus those
Worthies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17. by Faith exalted the power
of God above the order and common rule of second
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44184:95"/>
causes. <hi>Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us
out of thine hand, O King.</hi> Their faith resting it self
upon the Omnipotent power of God, expected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from it in an extraordinary way; 'tis true,
this is no standing rule for our faith ordinarily to
work by; nor have we ground to expect such
miraculous Salvations, but yet when extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
difficulties press us, and the common ways,
and means of deliverance are shut up, we ought
by faith to exalt the Omnipotency of God, by
ascribing the glory thereof to him, and leave our
selves to his good pleasure, without straitning or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
his Almighty power, according to the mold
of our poor low thoughts and apprehensions of it: For
so the Lord himself directeth our faith in difficult
cases. <hi>Isa. 55. 8, 9. For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the
Lord; for as the Heavens are higher than the earth;
So are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts.</hi> He speaks there of his pardoning
mercy which he will not have his people to contract;
and limit according to the model, and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of their own desponding, misgiving and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
thoughts; but to exalt and glorifie it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its unbounded fulness; as it is in the thoughts
of God, the fountain of that mercy; so it ought to
be with respect to his power, about which his thoughts
and ours do vastly differ; the power of God as we
cast it in the mould of our thoughts, is as vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and disproportionate from what it is in the
thoughts of God the fountain thereof; as the earth is
to the heavens, which is but a small inconsiderable
point compared with them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44184:95"/>
2. The power of God is a Supreme and Sovereign
power, from which all creature power is derived,
and by which it is over-ruled, restrained, and limited
at his pleasure. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
he ruled over other Kings, yet he held his
Kingdom from God; it was God that placed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Crown upon his head, but his head upon his
shoulders. <hi>Dan. 2. 37. Thou O King art a King of Kings;
for the God of Heaven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ath given thee a Kingdom, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and strength, and glory.</hi> Hence it follows, that no
creature can move tongue or hand against any of
Gods people, but by vertue of a Commission or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from their God, albeit they think not so.
<hi>Knowest thou not,</hi> saith <hi>Pilate</hi> unto Christ, <hi>that
I have power to crucifie thee, and power to release
thee?</hi> Proud worm! what an ignorant, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
boast was this of his own power! and how doth
Christ spoil and shame it in his answer? <hi>Iohn 19. 10.
Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except
it were given thee from above.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wicked men like wild horses would run over and
trample under foot all the people of God in the world,
were it not that the bridle of Divine providence had a
strong curb to restrain them: <hi>Ezek. 22. 6. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of</hi> Israel <hi>every one were in thee, to their power to
shed bloud.</hi> And it was well for Gods <hi>Israel</hi> that their
power was not as large as their wills were; this world
is a raging and boisterous Sea, which sorely toffes the
passengers for heaven that sail upon it, but this is
their comfort and security: <hi>The Lord stilleth the noise of
the sea, the noise of the waves, and the tumult of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Ps.</hi> 65. 7. Moral as well as natural waves, are checked
and bounded by Divine power. <hi>Surely the wrath
of man shall praise thee, and the remainder of wrath
thou shalt restrain, Psal.</hi> 76. 10. As a man turns so
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44184:96"/>
much water into the channel as will drive the mill,
and turns away the rest in another sluce.</p>
                           <p>Yea, not only the power of man, but the power
of Devils also is under the restraint and limitation of
this power, <hi>Rev. 3. 10. Satan shall cast some of you into
prison, and ye shall have tribulation ten days.</hi> He would
have cast them into their graves, yea, into hell if he
could, but it must be only into a Prison: He would
have kept them in prison, till they had died and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there, but it must be only for ten days. Oh glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sovereign power! which thus keeps the reins of
Government in its own hand!</p>
                           <p>3. The power of God is an everlasting power;
time doth not weaken or diminish it, as it doth all
creature powers, <hi>Isa. 40. 28. The Lord, the Creator
of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary,
Isa. 59. 1. The Lords hand is not shortened (i. e.)</hi> He
hath as much power now as ever he had, and can do
for his people as much as ever he did; time will decay
the power of the strongest creature, and make him fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and feeble; but the Creator of the ends of the eart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
fainteth not. <hi>Thou,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>abidest for
ever, thy years flee not, Psal.</hi> 102. 27. In Gods
working there is no expence of his strength. he is
able to do as much as ever he did, to act over again
all the glorious deliverances that ever he wrought for
his people from the beginning of the World; to
do as much for his Church now as he did at the Red
sea; and upon this ground the Church builds its
Plea, <hi>Isa. 51. 9, 10. Awake, awake, put on strength,

no creature hath any jurisdiction. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 29.
God bound up the Spirit of <hi>Laban,</hi> and becalmed it

The Debtor did but desire patience, and the Creditor

so in <hi>Temporals,</hi> the Church confesses the Lord <hi>did
things they looked not for, Isa.</hi> 64. 3. And in both
Spirituals and Temporals this power moves in an
higher Orb than our thoughts, <hi>Isa. 55. 8, 9. My

so are my thoughts above your thoughts,</hi> The earth

See an excellent instance in <hi>Gen. 48. 11. I had not

thy seed.</hi> A surprizing providence; and thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power works in a Sphere above all the thoughts,
prayers and expectations of men.</p>
                        <p>3. It works beyond all probabilities, and rational

deliverances for the people of God when things
have been brought to the lowest ebb, and all the
means of salvation have been hid from their eyes.
We have diverse famous instances of this in Scripture,
wherein we may observe a remarkable <hi>gradation</hi> in
the working of this Almighty power: It is said in the
2 <hi>Kings 14. 26, 27. The Lord saw the affliction of</hi>
Israel, <hi>that it was very bitter, for there was not any
shut up, nor any left; nor any helper for</hi> Israel. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
state; how inevitable was their ruine to the
eye of sense? Well might it be called a bitter affliction;
Yet from this immediate power arose for them a sweet
and unexpected Salvation; and if we look into
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10. we shall find the Apostles and choicest
Christians of those times, giving up themselves as
lost men, all ways of escape being quite out of sight;
for so much those words signifie, <hi>We had the sentence
of death in our selves; i. e.</hi> We yielded our selves for
dead men. But though they were sentenced to death,
yea, though they sentenced themselves, this power
which wrought above all their thoughts, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conjectures, reprieved them. And yet one step
farther in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 4, 5, 6, 7. The people of God
are there represented as actually dead, yea as in their
graves, yea as rotted in their graves, and their very
bones dry, like those that are dead of old; so utterly
improbable was their recovery: Yet by the working
of this Almighty power which subdueth all things
to it self, their graves in <hi>Babylon</hi> were opened,
the breath of life came into them, bone came to bone,
and there stood up a very great Army; it was the
working of this power above the thoughts of mans
heart, which gave the ground of that famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Gen. 22. 14. In the Mount of the Lord it shall

14. 7. At evening time it shall be light; i. e.</hi> Light
shall unexpectedly spring up, when all men according

                        <p>LEt us view the power of God in its relation to the
promises, for so it becomes our Sanctuary in the
day of trouble; if the <hi>Power</hi> of God be the <hi>Chamber,</hi>
'tis the <hi>Promise</hi> of God which is that Golden <hi>'Key</hi> that
opens it. And if we well consult the Scriptures in
this matter, we shall find the Almighty power of God
made over to his people by promise, for many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ends and uses in the day of their trouble.
As,</p>
                        <p>1. To uphold and support them, when their own
strength fails, <hi>Isa. 41. 10. Fear thou not, for I am with
thee, be not dismayed for I am thy God: I will strengthen
thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the
right hand of my righteousness.</hi> And which of the Saints
have not sensibly felt these everlasting arms, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
their spirits, when afflictions have pressed them
above their own strength? So runs the promise to
<hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. My grace is sufficient for thee,
for my strength is made perfect in weakness; i. e.</hi> It is
made known in thy weakness. Our weakness adds
nothing to Gods power, it doth not make his power
perfect, but it hath the better advantage of its disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and puts forth it self more signally and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously
in our weakness; as the stars which never
shine so gloriously, as in the darkest night.</p>

2. To preserve them in all their dangers, to which
they lie exposed in Soul and Body. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. You
are kept</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>by the mighty power
of God.</hi> Kept as in a Garison; this is their arm every
morning, as it is <hi>Isa. 33. 2. O Lord be gracious unto
us, we have waited for thee, be thou their arm
every morning, our salvation also in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
The Arm is that member which is fitted for the
defence of the body, and for that end so placed by the
God of Nature, that it may guard every part above
and below it; but as good they were bound behind
our backs, for any help they can give us in some
cases: It is Gods Arm that defends us, and not our
own. This invisible power of God makes the Saints
the worlds wonder. <hi>Psal. 71. 7. I am as a wonder to
many, but thou art my strong refuge.</hi> To see poor
defenceless Creatures preserved, in the midst of furious
enemies, that is just matter of wonder; but God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their invisible refuge, that solves the wonder; to
this end the Power of God is by promise engaged to
his people, <hi>Isa. 27. 3. I the Lord do keep it, I will
water it every moment, lest any hurt it, I will keep it
night and day.</hi> And thus they subsist in the midst of
dangers and troubles; as the burning Bush (the
Emblem of the Church) did amidst the devouring
flames, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>To deliver them out of their distresses, so runs
the Promise,</hi> Psal. 91. 14, 15. Because he hath set
his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will
set him on high, because he hath known my name: he
shall call upon me and I will answer him, I will be
with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour
him. <hi>And</hi> Ier. 30. 7. Alas, for that day is great,
so that none is like it: It is even the time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
trouble, but ye shall be saved out of it. <hi>And surely
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44184:99"/>
there can be no distress so great, no case of Believers
so sorlorn; but,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It's easie with God to save them out of it. Are
they to the eye of Sense lost, as hopeless as men in
the grave? Yet see <hi>Ezek. 37. 12. O my people, I
will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of
your graves, and bring you into the land of</hi> Israel. And
he doth whatever he doth easily, with a word, <hi>Ps. 44. 4.
Thou art my king, O God, command deliverances for</hi>
Jacob. And it requireth no more violent motion to
do it, than he that swimeth in the water uses,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 11. A gentle easie motion of the hand doth
it.</p>
                        <p>2. And as the power of God can deliver them
easily, so speedily. Their deliverance is often wrought
by way of surprizal, <hi>Isa. 17. 14. Behold, at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tide trouble, and in the morning he is not.</hi> So the
Church prays, in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

as the streams in the South.</hi> The Southern Countreys
are dry, the streams there come not in a gentle and
slow current, but being occasioned by violent sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
spouts of Rain, they presently overflow the
Countrey, and as soon retire: So speedily can the
power of God free his people from their dangers and
fears.</p>
                        <p>3. Yea, such is the excellency of his delivering po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that he can save alone without any contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Creature aids. So <hi>Isa. 59. 16. He wondered
that there was no intercessour; therefore his hand
brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness
sustained him.</hi> We read indeed <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 23. Of
helping the Lord, but that is not to express his <hi>need,</hi>
but their <hi>duty;</hi> we have continual need of God, but
he hath no need of us; he uses instruments, but not
out of necessity, his arm alone can save us, be the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44184:99"/>
danger never so great, or the visible means of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
never so remote.</p>
                        <p>4. Once more, let us view this Chamber of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power, as it is continually opened by the hand
of providence, to receive and secure the people of
God in all their dangers. 'Tis said, 2 <hi>Chro. 16. 9. The
eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole
earth, to shew himself strong in behalf of them, whose
heart is perfect towards him.</hi> Where you have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
account of the immediacy, universality,
and efficacy of Divine Providence, as it uses and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
this Divine power for the guard and defence of
that people, who are its charge; he doth not only
set Angels to watch for them, but his own eyes keep
<hi>Sentinel,</hi> even those seven eyes of Providence men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 9. which <hi>never sleep nor slumber;</hi> for
they are said to run continually to and fro, and that
not in this or that particular place only, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of some more eminent and excellent persons;
but through the whole earth. 'Tis an encompassing and
surrounding providence which hath its eye upon all,
whose hearts are upright; all the Saints are within
the line of its care and protection; the eye of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
discovereth all their dangers, and its arm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
them, for he shews himself strong in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                        <p>The secret, but Almighty efficacy of Providence is
also excellently described to us in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 8. where the
Angels are said to have their hands under their wings,
working secretly and undiscernibly, but very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the Saints committed to their charge. <hi>Like</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which is that in <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 4. where it is said of God,
that <hi>He had horns coming out of his hands, and there
was the hiding of his power.</hi> The hand is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of action, denoting Gods active power, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44184:100"/>
the horns coming out of them are the glorious raies,
and beams of that power shining forth in the salvation
of his people: O that we could sun our selves in those
chearful and reviving beams of Divine power, by
considering how gloriously they have broken forth,
and shone out for the salvation of his people in all
Ages. So it did for <hi>Israel</hi> at the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 6.
So for <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> in that great streight, 2 <hi>Chron.
20.</hi> 12, 15. And so in the time of <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Kings
19.</hi> 3. 7. Yea in all ages from the beginning of the
World the Saints have been sheltered under these
wings of Divine Power, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 9. 10. Thus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath hanged and adorned this Chamber of
Divine power with the delightful Histories of the
Churches manifold preservations by it.</p>

                        <p>HAving taken a short view of this glorious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gods power absolutely in it self, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in relation to his promises and providences, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
now, that I press and perswade all the people
of God under their fears and dangers according to
Gods gracious invitation to enter into it, shut their
doors, and to behold with delight this glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
working for them in all their exigencies and
distresses.</p>
                        <p>1. Enter into this Chamber of Divine power, all
ye that fear the Lord, and hide your selves there in
these dangerous and distressful days; let me say to
you as the Prophet did to the poor distressed <hi>Iews,
Zech. 9. 12. Turn ye to your strong hold, ye prisoners
of hope.</hi> Strong holds might they say; Why, where
are they? The walls of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are in the dust, the
Temple burnt with fire, <hi>Sion</hi> an heap, what meanest
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44184:100"/>
thou then in telling us of our strong holds? Why, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all this, yet there is <hi>Satis praesidii in uno Deo,</hi>
Refuge enough for you in God alone, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
notes upon that place. Christian, art not
thou able to fetch a good subsistence for thy Soul by
Faith, out of the Almighty power of God? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Saints of old did so, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
met with as many difficulties and plunges of
trouble in their time, as ever you did or shall meet
with; yet by the exercise of their faith upon this
Attribute, they lived comfortably, and why cannot
you? <hi>Exod. 6. 3. I appeared</hi> (saith God) <hi>unto</hi>
Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>by the name of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi>
They kept house and feasted by Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this name of mine; O that we could do as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> 4. 21. We have the same Attribute,
but alas, we have not such a Faith as his was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it. It is easie to believe the Almighty power of
God in a calm, but not so easie to resign our selves to
it, and securely rest upon it in a Storm of adversity:
But oh what peace and rest would our Faith procure
us by the free use and exercise of it this way, to assist
your faith in this difficulty wherein we find the
faith of a <hi>Moses</hi> sometimes staggered. Let me briefly
offer you these four following encouragements.</p>
                        <p>1. Consider how your gracious God hath engaged
this his Almighty power by Promise and Covenant
for the security of his people, God pawned it as it
were to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that famous promise, <hi>Gen. 17. 1.
I am the Almighty God, walk thou before me, and
be perfect.</hi> And <hi>Gen. 15. 1. Fear not</hi> Abraham, <hi>I
am thy shield.</hi> Say not, this was <hi>Abraham's</hi> peculiar
priviledge, for if you consult <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 4. and <hi>Heb.
13.</hi> 5, 6. you will find that Believers in these days,
have as good a title to the promises made in those
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44184:101"/>
days, as those worthies had to whom they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
made.</p>
                        <p>2. If you be Believers, your relation to God strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engageth his power for you, as well as his own
promises, <hi>Surely</hi> (saith God) <hi>they are my people,
children that will not lie; so he became their Saviour,
Isa.</hi> 63. 8. We say Relations have the least of <hi>Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
but the greatest of <hi>efficacy;</hi> you find it so in your
own experience, let a wife, child, or friend be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger, and it shall engage all the power you
have to succour and deliver them.</p>
                        <p>3. This glorious power of God is engaged for you
by the very malice and wickedness of your enemies,
who will be apt to impute the ruine of the Saints to
the defects of power in their God; from whence
those excellent arguments are drawn, <hi>Numb. 14. 15,
16. Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man
then the nations which have heard the fame of thee,
will speak, saying, because the Lord was not able to
bring this people into the land, which he sware unto
them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</hi>
And again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 26, 27. you shall find the
Lord improving this argument for them himself; if
they do not plead it for themselves, he will. <hi>I would
scatter them into corners, I would make the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them to cease from among men, were it not
that I feared the wrath of the enemy, left their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
should behave themselves strangely and lest they
should say, our hand is high, and the Lord hath not
done all this.</hi> O see how much you are beholding to
the very rage of your enemies for your deliverances
from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. To conclude, the very reliance of your Souls
by faith upon the power of God, your very leaning
upon his arm engages it for your protection, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44184:101"/>
3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind
is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.</hi> Puzle
not your selves therefore any longer about qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but know that the very acting of your faith on
God, the recumbency of your Souls upon him, is that
which will engage him for your defence, how weak
and defective soever thou art in other respects.</p>
                        <p>2. Having thus entered by Faith into this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Divine power, the next counsel the Text
gives you is, to shut the door behind you, <hi>i. e.</hi> after
the acting of your faith, and the quiet repose of your
Souls upon Gods Almighty power, then take heed
lest unbelieving fears and jealousies creep in again
and disturb the rest of your Souls in God, you find a
sad instance of this in <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 11. 21, 23.
After so many glorious acts and triumphs of his Faith,
how were his heels tripped up by diffidence which
crept in afterwards; good men may be posed with
difficult providences and made to stagger. The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>aelites</hi>
had lived upon miracles many years, yet
<hi>Psal. 78. 20. Can he give bread also?</hi> Good <hi>Martha</hi>
objects difficulty to Christ. <hi>Ioh. 11. 39. By this time
he stinketh.</hi> O 'tis a glorious thing to give God the
glory of his Almighty power, in difficult cases that we
cannot comprehend. See <hi>Zech. 8. 6. If it be marvellous
in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days,
should it be also marvellous in mine eyes? saith the
Lord of hosts.</hi> Difficulties are for men, but not for
God; because it is marvellous in your eyes, must it be
so in Gods: Various objections will be apt to arise
in your hearts to drive you out of this your refuge.
As,</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Objection.</hi> O but the long continuance of our
troubles and distresses will sink our very hearts, <hi>Isa.
40. 27. Why sayest thou,</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and speakest,</hi> O Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44184:102"/>
                           <hi>my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is
passed over from my God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sol. <hi>But O wait upon God without fainting,</hi> Heb.
2. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at
the end of it shall speak and not lie: though it tarry,
wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not
tarry.</p>
                        <p>2. Objection. <hi>O but our former hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of deliverance are frustrated,</hi> Ier. 8. 15.
We looked for peace, but no good came: and for a time
of health, and behold trouble.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> O but yet be not discouraged, see how the

it with <hi>triumph;</hi> the husbandman waiteth, and so
must you.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Objection.</hi> But there is no sign or appearance
of our deliverance.</p>
                        <p>Sol. <hi>What then, this is no new thing,</hi> Psal. 74. 9.
We see not our signs, there is no more any Prophet,
neither is there any among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

long.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Objection.</hi> But all things work contrary to
our hope.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Why, so did things with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet see
<hi>Rom. 4. 18. against hope, he believed in hope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Observe further with delight the out goings and
glorious workings of Divine power for you, and for
the Church in times of trouble; this is sweet enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for your Souls, 'tis food for Faith, <hi>Psal. 74.
14. Thou breakest the heads of</hi> Leviathan <hi>in pieces, and
gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi>
and here I beseech you behold and admire,</p>
                        <p>1. It's mysterious and admirable protection of the
Saints in all their dangers. They feed as Sheep in the
midst of Wolves, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 3. they lie among them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44184:102"/>
that are set on fire, <hi>Psal. 57. 4. Their habitation is in the
midst of deceit. Ier.</hi> 9. 6. Yet they are kept in safety
by the mighty power of God.</p>
                        <p>2. Behold and admire it in casting the bonds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon your enemies, that though they would,
yet they cannot hurt you; our dangers are visible,
and our fears great, but our security and safety ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
<hi>Isa. 51. 13. Thou hast feared continually
every day, because of the fury of the oppressour, as if
he were ready to destroy; and where is the fury of the
oppressour?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Behold its opening unexpected, and unlikely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges
and securities for the Saints in their distresses,</hi>
Isa. 16. 4. Let mine out-casts dwell with thee, <hi>Moab,</hi>
he thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler;
for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth,
the oppressors are consumed out of the land. Rev. 12.
16. the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened
her mouth, and swallowed up the floud which the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
cast out of his mouth.</p>
                        <p>4. Behold it frustrating all the designs of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
against us, <hi>Isa. 54. 17. no weapon that is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall
rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I have created the Smith, Isa. 54. 16. q. d.</hi> He
that created the Smith, can order as he pleaseth the
weapon made by him; hence our enemies are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of their own designs.</p>
                        <p>O then depend upon this power of God, for it is
your security; there is a twofold dependence, the
one Natural and necessary, the other Elective.</p>
                        <p>1. Natural dependance, so all do and must depend
upon him.</p>
                        <p>2. Elective and voluntary, and so we all ought

Chamber</hi> of Heaven, where all things are contrived
in deepest wisdom, which are afterwards wrought in
the world by power, <hi>Eph. 1. 11. He worketh all
things after the counsel of his own will.</hi> Counsel in
the Creature implies weakness and defect; we are
not able at one thought to fathom the depth of a
business, and therefore must deliberate and spend
many thoughts about it, and when we have spent
all our own thoughts we are oft times at a loss, and
must borrow help, and ask counsel of others; but in

God it notes the perfection of his understanding, for as
those acts of the creature which are the results of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of the natures of things, which in the creature is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Science.</hi> 2. Knowledge how to govern,
order and dispose them, which in the Creature is
called <hi>Prudence;</hi> these things in man are but faint
shadows of that which is in God in the most Absolute
perfection; he fully knows himself, for his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is infinite, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 5. And the thoughts
he thinks towards us, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 11. and as he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>And as he perfectly knows all things, so he fully
understands how to govern and direct them to the

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44184:104"/>
104. 24. Rom. 11. 36. for of him, and through him,
and to him are all things.</hi> Of him, as the <hi>efficient
cause;</hi> through him, as the <hi>conserving cause;</hi> and to
him as the <hi>final cause.</hi> And in this wise disposition
of all things, he hath a gracious respect to the
good of his chosen, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things shall
work together for good to them that love God.</hi> More
particularly, the wisdom of God is to be considered
by us in its excellent properties, amongst which
these four following are eminently conspicuous, as
it is the,
<list>
                              <item>1. Original.</item>
                              <item>2. Essential.</item>
                              <item>3. Perfect, and</item>
                              <item>4. Only wisdom.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The wisdom of God is the Original Wisdom,
from which all the Wisdom found in Angels or men
is derived, and unto that fountain we are directed to
go, for supplies of Wisdom, <hi>Iam. 1. 5. If any man
lack wisdom, let him ask it of God.</hi> There is indeed
a spirit in man, but it is the inspiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that giveth understanding, <hi>Iob</hi> 32. 8. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
faculty is ours, but the illumination thereof is
Gods; the understanding of the Creature is as the
<hi>Dial</hi> which signifies nothing, till the Sun shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                        <p>2. Gods Wisdom is Essential Wisdom. Wisdom
in the Creature is but a quality separable from the
subject; but in God it is his Nature, his very Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he can as soon cease to be God, as to be most
wise.</p>
                        <p>3. The Wisdom of God is perfect wisdom, full
of it self, and exclusive of its contrary; the wisest of
men are not wise at all times, the greatest wits are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44184:104"/>
not without some mixture of madness; it is an high
attainment in humane wisdom to understand our own
weakness and folly; the deepest heads are but shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
but the wisdom of God is an unsearchable deph,
<hi>Rom. 11. 33. O the depth of the riches, both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are
his judgments, and his ways past finding out?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. To conclude, The wisdom of God is the only
wisdom; there is no wisdom without him, none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, he is the only wise God, <hi>Iude v. 25.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Wisdom of God must be considered <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
and that in a double respect:
<list>
                              <item>1. To his Promises.</item>
                              <item>2. To his Providencs.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="section">
                        <head>SECT. II.</head>
                        <p>LEt us view it in its relation to the Promises,
where you shall find it made over by God to
his people for divers excellent uses and purposes in
times of distress and danger. As,</p>
                        <p>1. It is made over to them in Promises for their
direction and guidance when they know not what to
do, or which way to take. So <hi>Psal. 25. 9. The meek
will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach
his way, And Isa. 58. 11. The Lord shall guide thee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi>
And <hi>Psal. 32. 8. I will guide thee with mine
eye.</hi> And with this the <hi>Psalmist</hi> encourages himself,
<hi>Psal. 73. 24. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
and afterwards receive me to glory.</hi> O what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable
mercy is this! we should make Shipwrack
both of our Temporal and Eternal mercies quickly,
were it not for the guidance of Divine Wisdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:44184:105"/>
2. To Extricate them when involved in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
So <hi>2 Pet. 2. 9. The Lord knoweth how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the godly out of temptation.</hi> They know not
how, but their God doth; they are often at a lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>,
but he is never: So <hi>1 Cor. 10. 13. There hath no
temptation taken you, but such as is common to man,
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above that ye are able, but will with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also make a way to escape that ye may be able to
bear it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. To over-rule and order all their troubles to their
good, and real advantage: So runs that most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
promise, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things shall work
together for good to them that love God.</hi> In the faith
whereof Paul concludes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. Even this shall
work for his Salvation. Thus the people of God
were sent into captivity for their good, <hi>Ier.</hi> 24. 8.
and <hi>Ioseph</hi> into <hi>Egypt, Gen. 50. 20. Ye thought evil
against me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to
pass as it is this day, to save much people alive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Let us view the Wisdom of God in its Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Providences, for there it shines forth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 18. The wheels were full of eyes,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the motions and Providential revolutions in this
lower world, are very Judicious and advised motions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <hi>Non caeco impetu volvuntur rotae,</hi> It hath a fetch and
design which no man understands till it open it self in
the event.</p>
                        <p>The enemies of the Church are oft times men of
the finest brains, and deepest policies: <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox
for subtilty, <hi>Luke 13. 32. Iulian</hi> and <hi>Ahithophel</hi>
with many others, who have digged as deep as Hell
in their counsels, and laid their designs so sure, that
they doubted not but to be masters of it, yet their
hands could not perform their enterprize.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44184:105"/>
The wisdom of Providence hath still befooled them,
and baffled the cunningest head-pieces that ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
any design against the Church, as fast as ever
they arose; and here the Wisdom of Providence is
remarkable in three things especially.</p>
                        <p>1. In revealing and discovering the secret conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
and counsels of the Churches enemies, and
thereby frustrating their designs, <hi>Gen. 27. 41, 42.
Providence</hi> (as one calls it) is the Bird of the air
that carries tidings, and whistles deeds of darkness,
<hi>Iob 12. 22. He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</hi> And
this God hath done both <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>mediately.</hi>
1. Immediately, <hi>2 Kings</hi> 6. 11. What counsel so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the King of <hi>Syria</hi> took in his Bed-chamber was
still discovered by the Lord to the Prophet. So true is
that <hi>Iob 34. 22. There is no darkness nor shadow of
death where the workers of iniquity may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
Thus the design of <hi>Herod</hi> is revealed to <hi>Ioseph</hi>
in a dream.</p>
                        <p>But commonly he doth it by means; as</p>
                        <p>1. By giving knowledge of it to some that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
obligations of duty, or affection to reveal it to
these that are concerned in the danger. So <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Sisters Son, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 16. revealed the conspiracy
against his life, and so the Plot miscarried by reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it before it was ripe for execution.</p>
                        <p>2. By the failure of some circumstance, the whole is
brought to light; there be many fine threds upon
which the designs of Politicians hang, if one break
the whole design is unravelled. Thus the Wisdom
of God sometimes prevents his peoples ruine, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the speech of the trusty from him, and
making their own tongues to fall upon themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="196" facs="tcp:44184:106"/>
3. <hi>By their own confession; So</hi> Psal. 64. 5, 6, 7, 8.
<hi>where you have the Plot laid,</hi> ver. 5. They encourage
themselves in an evil matter, they commune of laying
snares privily, they say, who shall see them? <hi>The deep</hi>
contrivance <hi>of it,</hi> ver. 6. They search out iniquity,
they accomplish a diligent search; both the inward
thoughts of every one of them, and the heart is deep.
<hi>Their Plot</hi> destroyed, ver. 7. But God shall shoot at
them with an arrow, suddenly shall they be wounded.
<hi>The</hi> method <hi>or way of Providence in destroying it,</hi>
ver. 8. So they shall make their own tongue to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves, all that see them, shall flee away. <hi>Thus
hath the Wisdom of our God wrought for us this
day beyond all the thoughts of our hearts; and oh
that it might make such impressions upon all our
hearts, as follow in the 9, and 10.</hi> verses, All men
shall fear, and shall declare the work of God, for they
shall wisely consider his doing. The righteous shall be
glad in the Lord and shall trust in him, and all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in heart shall glory.</p>
                        <p>2. The Wisdom of God discovers it self in behalf
of that people who are his own, in diverting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from them, and putting by the deadly thrusts
their enemies make at them; thus it spoils their game
by an unforeseen rub in the green, and that especially
three ways.</p>
                        <p>1. By making their counsels to jar among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in which jars is the sweetest harmony of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
thus the counsel of <hi>Ahithophel</hi> jars with the
counsel of <hi>Hushai, 2 Sam. 17.</hi> 5. 7. by which means
<hi>David</hi> escaped: the <hi>Pharisees</hi> clashed with the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,
Acts</hi> 23. 7. and by that means <hi>Paul</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
                        <p>2. By cutting out other work, and starting some
new design which like a fresh scent puts the dogs to a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44184:106"/>
loss. Thus the people of God in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by a diversion, <hi>2 Kings 19. 7. Behold, I will
send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour and
shall return to his own land, and I will cause him to
fall by the sword in his own land, so</hi> Rabshakeh <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</hi>
By this means also was <hi>David</hi> delivered
from the hand of <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 23. 27. And in this
method of Providence, that Scripture is often ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<hi>Prov. 21. 18. The wicked shall be a ransom
for the Righteous, and the transgressour for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. By cutting off the capital enemies of his Church,
by whose seasonable destruction they are delivered.
Thus fell <hi>Iulian,</hi> that bitter enemy of the Christians,
when he was preparing to put his last and most blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
design against them in execution. And thus fell
<hi>Haman, Nero,</hi> and many more in the very height
and heat of their designs against the Church.</p>
                        <p>3. The Wisdom of God gloriously displays it self
in causing the designs of the wicked, like a surchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
gun to recoil upon and destroy themselves: It
often falls out with the undermining enemies of the
Church, as it sometimes doth with them that dig deep
<hi>Mines</hi> in the Earth, who are destroyed and buried in
their own work; <hi>Psal. 9. 15, 16. The heathen are
sunk down in the pit that they made, in the net which
they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known
by the judgments which he executeth, the wicked is
snared in the work of his own hands. Higgajon,
Selah.</hi> There is a double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ercy in this providence,
one in delivering the Saints from the danger, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in causing it to fall upon the contrivers, and is
therefore celebrated with a double note of attention;
in these observable strokes, the righteousness of God
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44184:107"/>
shines forth, in repaying his peoples enemies in their
own coin.

Thus <hi>Haman</hi> did eat the first-fruits of that tree which
his own hands planted, and thus <hi>Ierusalem</hi> becomes
a burthensome stone to all that burthen themselves
with it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                        <p>4. Admire and adore the Wisdom of your God in
those great and unexpected advantages, which arise
to you out of those very dangers and designs of your
enemies that threatened your ruine; the very hands
of your very enemies are sometimes made the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your advancement and enlargement; your
persecutions become your priviledges, the Motto of
the <hi>Palm</hi> tree fitly becomes yours, <hi>Suppressa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In three things the Wisdom of God makes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
out of your troubles.</p>
                        <p>1. In fortifying your Souls and Bodies with suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
strength, when any eminent trial is intended for
you: So it was with the Apostles, <hi>2 Cor. 1. 5. As
the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
by Christ.</hi> God lays in suitably to what men lay on mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesly:
Christ would not draw the poor timorous
disciples out of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> unto hard encounters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
first he had endued them with power from on high,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49.</p>
                        <p>2. The Wisdom of your God can and often doth
make your very troubles and sufferings instead of so
many ordinances to strengthen your Faith and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
your Patience. So the heads of <hi>Leviathan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
meat to his people inhabiting the Wilderness,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 14. And so the Plots of <hi>Balak</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
                           <pb n="199" facs="tcp:44184:107"/>
were designed by God to be as a standing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
ordinance for the encouragement of his
peoples Faith in future difficulties, <hi>Micah 6. 5. O
my people remember now what</hi> Balak <hi>King of</hi> Moab
<hi>consulted, and what</hi> Balaam <hi>the son of</hi> Beor <hi>answered
him from</hi> Shittim <hi>unto</hi> Gilgal <hi>that ye may know the
righteousnes of the Lord. q. d.</hi> You cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how those your enemies courted me with
multitudes of Offerings to deliver you up into their
hands, and how faithfully I stood by you in all those
dangers; that Plot discovered at once the policy of
your enemies, and the righteousness of your God.</p>
                        <p>3. His Wisdom is discovered to your advantage
in permitting your dangers to grow to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
on purpose to magnifie his goodness, and
increase your comfort in your deliverance from it.
<hi>Psal. 126. 1. When the Lord turned our captivity we
were as them that dreamed.</hi> Proportionable to the
greatness of your dangers will your joys be.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p>WEll then, if the Wisdom of God shines forth
so gloriously in the times of his peoples
trouble; be perswaded by Faith to enter into this
Chamber also; it is a Chamber where a believing
Soul may enjoy the sweetest rest, and quietness in the
most hurrying and distracting times; shut the door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
you, and improve this Attribute to your best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                        <p>1. Enter into this Chamber by Faith, believe
firmly that the management of all the affairs of this
world, whether publick or personal, is in the
hands of your All wise God; more particularly, exercise
your faith about the Wisdom of God in these things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:44184:108"/>
1. Believe that the Wisdom of God can contrive
and order the way of your escape and deliverance,
when all doors of hope are shut up to sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
we know not what to do, said good <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
but our eyes are unto thee. <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord
though I am at a loss and see no way of escape, thou
art never at a loss. The Lord (saith <hi>Peter)</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to deliver the Godly out of temptation: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
wisdom hath infinite methods and ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
unknown to man, till they are opened in
the event.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe that the Wisdom of God can turn your
greatest troubles and fears into the choicest blessings
and mercies to you: I know (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) that this
shall turn to my Salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. meaning his
bonds and sufferings for Christ. Divine wisdom can
give you honey out of the carcase of the Lyon, cause
you to part with those afflictions, admiring and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God for them, which you met with fear and
trembling, as suspecting your destruction was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in them.</p>
                        <p>3. In consideration of both these, resign up your
selves to the wisdom of God, and lean not to your own
understandings; <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, and
thy thoughts shall be established, Prov.</hi> 16. 3. When
<hi>Melancthon</hi> was oppressed with cares and doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the distracting affairs of the Church in his time,
<hi>Luther</hi> thus chides him out of his despondency, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinet
Philippus esse rector mundi,</hi> do not thou presume
to be the Governour of the world; but leave the
reins of Government in his hand that made it, and
best knows how to rule it: Let God alone to chuse
thy lot and portion, to order thy condition, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
all thy affairs, and let thy Soul take its rest in this
quiet Chamber of Divine wisdom. But then,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="201" facs="tcp:44184:108"/>
2. Be sure to shut thy door behind thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest unbelief, anxieties, fears, and doubts creep
in after thee to disturb thy rest, and shake thy faith
in this point; we are apt in two cases to be stumbled
in this matter.</p>
                        <p>1. When subtle and cunning enemies are engaged
against us; this was <hi>Davids</hi> case, <hi>2 Sam. 15. 31.
One told</hi> David, <hi>saying,</hi> Ahithophel <hi>is among the
conspirators with</hi> Absalom; <hi>and</hi> David <hi>said, O Lord.
I pray thee turn the counsel of</hi> Ahithophel <hi>into foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
When he heard <hi>Ahithophel</hi> was with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
it greatly puzled him. Though a whole
Conclave of <hi>Politicians</hi> be against us, yet if God be
with us let us not fear.</p>
                        <p>2. When our own reason intrudes too far, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
its dictates too boldly in the case, we are apt to
say in the arrogancy of our own reason, we cannot
be delivered; but O that we would learn to resign
it up to the Wisdom of God. The Lord knows
how to deliver the godly. When the question was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 3. Can these dry bones
live? He answers, Lord thou knowest. That's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
counsel, <hi>Prov. 3. 5. Trust in the Lord with all

                        <p>3. Improve the Wisdom of God for your selves in
all difficult and distressful cases.</p>
                        <p>1. Beg of God to exercise his wisdom for you
when enemies conspire against you: So did <hi>David,
2 Sam. 15. 31. Lord turn the counsel of</hi> Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel
<hi>into foolishness!</hi> O 'tis the noblest and surest way
to vanquish an enemy; it was but asked and done.</p>
                        <p>2. Comfort your selves with this whenever you
are at a loss in your own thoughts and know not what
to do, then commit all to Divine conduct; let God
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44184:109"/>
Steer for you in a Storm; he loves to be trusted,
<hi>Psal. 37. 5. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

                        <p>3. Encourage your selves from this when the
Church is in the greatest danger, and most sorely
shaken; O that is a blessed promise, <hi>Zech. 3. 9. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one stone shall be seven eyes.</hi> Meaning Christ, and
the Church built on him as the chief corner stone;
the seven eyes are the seven eyes of Providence which
are never all asleep.</p>

                        <p>HAving viewed the Saints Refuge in the Power
and Wisdom of God, we next proceed to a
third Chamber of Safety for the Saints refuge. <hi>viz.</hi>
The <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of God.</p>
                        <p>In this Attribute is our Safety and Rest amidst the
confusions of the world and daily disappointments we
are vexed withal through the vanity and falsenes of
the Creature: As to Creatures, the very best of
them they are but vanity, yea, vanity of vanity,
the vainest vanity, <hi>Eccles. 1. 2. Every man in his best
estate is altogether vanity, Psal.</hi> 39. 5. Yea, those
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44184:109"/>
that we expect most from, give us most of trouble,
<hi>Micah</hi> 7. 5. Nearest Relations bring up the rear of
sorrows, <hi>Iob 6. 15. My brethren have dealt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as a brook.</hi> Especially their deceit appears most
when we have most need of their help, <hi>Psal.</hi> 142. 4.
How great a mercy is it then to have a refuge in the
Faithfulness of God, as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>I looked on my
right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
would know me, refuge failed me, no man cared for
my soul.</hi> And likewise the Church, <hi>Micah. 7. 7. I
will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my
salvation, my God will hear me.</hi> A time may come
when you shall not know where to trust in all this
world: Let me therefore open to you this Chamber
of rest in the Faithfulness of God, against such a day,
and this I shall do in a two sold consideration of it. <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <p>1. Absolutely, and so the Faithfulness of God is
his sincerity, firmness, and constancy in performing
his word to his people in all times and cases. So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
describes him to <hi>Israel, Deut. 7. 9. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Lord thy God he is God, the faithful
God.</hi> And <hi>Ioshua</hi> appeals to their experience for the
vindication of it, <hi>Iosh. 23. 14. Ye know in all your
hearts, and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
failed of all the good things which the Lord your God
spake concerning you; all are come to pass, and not
one thing hath failed thereof.</hi> And it is also fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
<hi>Ier. 31. 35, 36, 37.</hi> and greatly admired
even in the darkest day, <hi>Lam. 3. 23. Great is thy
faithfulness.</hi> And it is well for us that his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44184:110"/>
is great, for great is that weight that leans upon
it, even all our hopes for both worlds, for this world,
and for that to come, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of eternal life
which God that cannot lie promised before the world
began.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was a very dishonourable character that <hi>Suidas</hi>
gave of <hi>Tiberius, Eorum quae appetebat ne quicquam
prae se ferebat, &amp; eorum quae dicebat, ne quicquam
facere volebat. i. e.</hi> He never made shew of having
what he desired to have, nor ever minded to do what
he promised to do: But God is faithful, and that will
appear by these following Evidences of it.</p>

                           <p>By his exact fulfilling of his Promises of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

years were run out before the Promise of <hi>Israel</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was accomplished, yet <hi>Acts</hi>
7. 17. when the time of the Promise was come, God
was punctual to a day: Seventy years in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and at the expiration of that time they returned, <hi>2
Chron.</hi> 36. 21. Men may forget, but God cannot,
<hi>Isa. 49. 15, 16.</hi>

                           <p>By making way for his Promise through the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

<hi>Abraham</hi> when old, <hi>Gen. 18. 13, 14. Is there any

                           <p>By fulfilling promises to his people, when their

37. 11. Our bones are dry, our hopes lost, we are

                           <p>By Gods appealing to his people and referring the
matter to their own judgments, <hi>Micah 6. 3, 4, 5.
O my people, what have I done unto thee, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have I wearied thee? Testifie against me, for I
brought thee up out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee out of the house of servants, and I sent before
thee</hi> Moses, Aaron, <hi>and</hi> Miriam. <hi>O my people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
now what</hi> Balak <hi>King of</hi> Moab <hi>consulted,
and what</hi> Balaam <hi>the son of</hi> Beor <hi>answered him from</hi>

So <hi>Ier. 2. 31. O generation, see ye the word of the

                        <p>ANd if we enquire into the grounds and reasons
why God is, and ever must be most Faithful in
perfoming his Promises, we shall find it is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stable and unshaken pillars: <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. The Holiness of his Nature.</item>
                              <item>2. The All-sufficiency of his Power.</item>
                              <item>3. The Honour of his Name.</item>
                              <item>4. The Unchangeableness of his Nature.</item>

                        </p>

                           <pb n="207" facs="tcp:44184:111"/>
1. The Faithfulness of God is built upon the perfect
Holiness of his Nature, by reason whereof it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for God to lie, <hi>Tit. 1, 2. Heb.</hi> 6. 18. The
deceitfulness of men flows from the corruption of the
Humane Nature, but <hi>God is not as man that he
should lye, neither as the son of man that he
should repent; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>hath he said, and shall he not do it?
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
Numb.</hi> 23. 19. If there be no defect in his Being,
there can be none in his working; if his Nature be
pure Holiness, all his ways must be perfect Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
                        <p>2. It is built upon the All-sufficiency of his Power,
whatsoever he hath promised to his people, he is able
to perform it; men sometimes falsifie their promises
through the defects of ability to perform them; but
God never out-promised himself; if he will work
none can lett, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 13. He can do whatsoever he
pleaseth to do, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 6. The Holiness of his
Nature engageth, and the Almightiness of his Power
enables him to be Faithful.</p>
                        <p>3. The glory and Honour of his Name may assure
us of his Faithfulness in making good the Promises,
and all that good which is in the promises to a tittle;
for wherever you find a Promise of God, you also
find the Name and Honour of God given as security
for the performance of it; and so his name hath ever
been pleaded with him by his people, as a mighty
argument to work for them, <hi>Ioshuah 7. 9. What wilt
thou do to thy great name? q. d.</hi> Lord thine Honour
is a thousand times more than our lives, it is no such
great matter what becomes of us; but ah Lord it is
of infinite concernment that the glory of thy Name be
secured, and thy faithfulness kept pure and unspotted
in the world. So again, <hi>Exod. 32. 11, 12. And</hi>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:44184:112"/>
Moses <hi>besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord why
doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou
hast brought out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>with great
power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should
the</hi> Egyptians <hi>speak and say, for mifchief did he bring
them out to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the tongues of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to fall upon thy
Name.</p>
                        <p>4. The unchangeableness of his Nature gives
us the fullest assurance of his Faithfulness in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<hi>Mal. 3. 6. I am the Lord, I change not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not consumed.</hi> Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness
is his peoples indempnity, and best
security in the midst of dangers; whilst there is not
yea and nay with God, there should be no ups and
downs, offs and ons in our faith; that which gives
steadiness to the Promises, should give steadiness also
to our expectations for the performance of them; and
so much briefly of the Faithfulness of God absolutely
considered in the Nature and grounds of it.</p>
                        <p>2. Next let us view the Faithfulness of God, as it
relates to the many great and precious Promises made
unto his people for their security both in their,
<list>
                              <head>Concernments.</head>
                              <item>1. Temporal</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We find the Faithfulness of God pawned and
pledged for the security of his people in their Spiritual
and eternal concernments, against all their dangers
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44184:112"/>
and fears, threatning them on that account, and that
more especially in these three respects.</p>
                        <p>1. It is given them as their great and best security

danger comes from sin; Guilt is a fountain of
Fears, a pardoned Soul only can look other troubles
in the face boldly: As Guilt breeds fear, so Pardon
breeds Courage, and Gods Faithfulness in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is as it were that Pardon-office from whence
we fetch our discharges and acquittances, <hi>Isa. 43. 25.
I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy transgressions
for mine own sake.</hi> The promises of remission are
made for Christs sake, and when made, they must be
fulfilled for his own, that is his Faithfulness sake.</p>
                        <p>2. It is engaged for the perseverance of the Saints,
and their continuance in the ways of God in the most
hazardous and difficult times; this was the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given them, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 8, 9. Who shall also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the
day of our Lord Iesus Christ; God is faithful by
whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Lord.</hi> Ah Lord! might those <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
say, the Powers of the World are against us,
Suffering and Death before us, a Treacherous and
fearful heart within us. Ay, but yet fear not, Christ
shall confirm you, whosoever opposes you; though
the World and your own hearts be deceitful, yet
comfort your selves with this, your God is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                        <p>3. The Faithfulness of God is given by promise
for his Peoples security in, and encouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all their sufferings and afflictions in this World,
<hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and
keep you from evil.</hi> He prays they may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from absurd, treacherous and unfaithful men,
who would trapan and betray them to ruine;
but this is proposed as their relief, that when the
treachery of men shall bring them into trouble, the
Faithfulness of God shall support them under, and
deliver them out of those troubles; they shall have
Spiritual supports from God, under their deepest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
from men, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                        <p>2. Gods Faithfulness is engaged for his peoples
indempnity and security amidst the Temporal and
outward evils whereunto they are liable in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that either to preserve them from troubles, <hi>Psal.
91. 1, 2, 3, 4.</hi> or to open a seasonable door of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of trouble, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 13. In both or

in this troublesome world; for what need those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

                        <p>HAving taken a short view of Gods Faithfulness
in the Promises, it will be a lovely sight to take
one view of it more as it is actuated, and exerted in his
Providences over his people; believe it Christians,
the Faithfulness of God runs through all his works of
providence, whenever he goes forth to work in the
World, <hi>Faithfulness is the girdle of his loins, Isa. 11.
5.</hi> It is an allusion to workmen who going forth in
the morning to their labour, gird their loins or rein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
with a girdle, now there is no work wrought by God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44184:113"/>
in this world, But his faithfulness is as the Girdle of
his Loins. The consideration whereof should
make the most despondent believer, <hi>gird up the
Loins of his mind,</hi> that is, encourage and strengthen
his drooping and discouraged heart. Those works
of God which are wrought in Faithfulness and in
pursuit of his eternal purposes and gracious promises,
should rather delight, than affright us, in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. It pluckt out the Sting of <hi>David</hi>'s
affliction when he considered it was in very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
that God had afflicted him, <hi>Psal. 119. 89,
90.</hi> But more particularly, let us behold with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the faithfulness of God, making good six
sorts of Promises to his People, in the days of their
affliction and trouble, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. There are promises in the word for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
from ruine, and what you read in those
promises you dayly see the same fulfilled in your
own experiences. You have a promise in <hi>Psal. 57.
3. He shall send from Heaven, and save me from the
reproach of him that would swallow me up.</hi> Selah.
<hi>God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</hi>

its unbelieving fears to distract and sink you, hath
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44184:114"/>
not your God sent forth also his mercy and his truth
to save you? Hath not his truth been your shield
and buckler? <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 4. May you not say with
the Church it is of his mercy you are not consumed,
his mercies are new every morning, and great is his
faithfulness, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
                        <p>2. As you have seen it actually fulfilling the
promises for your preservation, so you may see it
making good all the promises in his word for your
support in troubles. That is a sweet promise, <hi>Psal.
91. 15. I will be with him in trouble: I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him,</hi> you have also a very supporting promise
in <hi>Isa. 41. 10. Fear not thou, for I am with thee:
be not dismayed for I am thy God: I will strengthen
thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with
the right hand of my righteousness.</hi> O, how evidently
hath the faithfulness of God shone forth in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his word to you in this respect! you are
his witnesses, you would have sunk in the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of trouble if it had not been so. So speaks <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal. 73. 26. My heart and my flesh faileth, but
God is the strength of my heart; and my portion for
ever.</hi> Have you not found it so with you as it is
in <hi>2 Cor. 12. 10. Therefore I take pleasure in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then
am I strong.</hi> God's strength hath been made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in your weakness, by this you have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
through all your troubles; hitherto hath he
helped you.</p>
                        <p>3. As you have seen it faithfully fulfilling the
promises for your preservation, and support; So
you have seen it in the direction of your ways. So

                           </gap>uns that promise, <hi>Psal. 32. 8. I will instruct thee
and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go: I will
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44184:114"/>
guide thee with mine eye.</hi> Certain it is <hi>That the way
of man is not in himself,</hi> Jer. 10. 23. O how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
hath your God guided you, and stood by you
in all the difficult cases of your Life! Is not that
promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. faithfully fulfilled to a tittle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee?</hi> Surely
you can set your seal to that in <hi>Ioh. 17. 17. Thy
word is truth:</hi> had you been left to your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
you had certainly perished; as it is said of them,
in <hi>Psal. 81. 12. I gave them up unto their own hearts
lusts: and they walked in their own counsels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. As there are promises in the word for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
support, and direction; So in the fourth
place there are promises for your <hi>provisions,</hi> as in
<hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 9. the Lord hath promised that <hi>They that
fear him shall not want.</hi> When they are driven to
extremity, he will provide, <hi>Isa. 41. 17. When the
poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their
tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them,
I the God of</hi> Israel <hi>will not forsake them.</hi> And is not
this faithfully performed? <hi>He hath given meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of
his Covenant,</hi> Psal. 111. 5. In all the exigencies of
your lives, you have found him faithful to this day;
you are his witnesses that his providences never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, his care hath been renewed every morning
for you; how great is his faithfulness?</p>
                        <p>5. You also find in the word some reviving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
for your deliverances. You have a very sweet
promise in <hi>Psal. 91. 14. Because he hath set his love
upon me, therefore will I deliver him:</hi> and again,
<hi>Psal. 50. 15. Call upon me in the day of trouble; I
will deliver thee;</hi> you have done so, and he hath
made a way to escape. Our lives are so many
monuments of mercy, we have lived among Lyons,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44184:115"/>
yet preserved, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 4. The burning Bush
was an embleme of the Church miraculously preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                        <p>6. There are promises in the word for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and directing all the occurrences of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to your great advantages; so it is promised,
<hi>Rom. 8. 28. That all things shall work together for
good, to them that love God.</hi> Fear not Christians,
however you find it now, whilst you are tossing to
and fro upon the unstable waves of this world; you
shall find to be sure when you come to heaven,
that all the troubles of your lives were guided as
steddily by this promise, as ever any Ship at Sea was
directed to its Port, by the Compass or North-Star.</p>
                        <p>And now what remains, but that I press you as
before,

                              <item>1. To enter into this Chamber of Divine Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Enter into this Chamber of God's faithfulness
by faith, and hide your selves there. Every man is a
Lye, but God is True, eternally and inchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
faithful; O exercise your faith upon it, be at rest
in it!</p>
                        <p>Now there are two great and weighty Arguments
to press you to enter into this Chamber of divine
faithfulness.</p>
                        <p>1. Arg. <hi>Is fetched from the nature of God who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye,</hi> Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s 1. 2. He is not as man, that he should

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ye. <hi>Numb. 23, 19.</hi> Neither the son of man that
the should repent: hath he said, and shall he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ot
do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44184:115"/>
it good? <hi>Remember upon what everlasting steddy
grounds the faithfulness of God is built. These
are immutable things,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. <hi>This</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>built upon.</hi> Rom. 4. 21. Being fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that what he had promised, he was able also to
perform. <hi>He accounted him faithful that promised.
What would you expect or require in the person
that you are to trust? You would,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Expect a clear promise, and lo, you have a
thousand all the Scripture over; fitted to all the
cases of your Souls and Bodies. This you may
plead with God, as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 49. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the word unto thy Servant, upon which thou hast
caused me to hope.</hi> So <hi>Iacob</hi> pleaded, <hi>Gen. 32. 12.
Thou saidst, I will surely do thee good.</hi> These are
Gods Bonds and Obligations.</p>
                        <p>2. You would expect sufficient power to make
good what he promiseth. This is in God as a fair
foundation of faith, <hi>Isa. 26. 4. Trust ye in the Lord
for ever: for in the Lord Iehovah is everlasting
strength;</hi> Because of thy strength we will wait on
thee. Creatures cannot, but God can do what he
will.</p>
                        <p>3. You would expect infinite goodness and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
inclining him to help and save you; why?
So it is here, <hi>Psal. 130. 7. Let Israel hope in the
Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with
him is plenteous redemption.</hi> So <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 33.
18. <hi>I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</hi> The request
was a view of God's Glory. The answer is, my
goodness shall pass before thee, which hints to us,
that though all God's Attributes be glorious, yet
that, he most glories in, is his goodness: And
then,</p>
                        <p>4. You would expect that none of his Promises
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44184:116"/>
were ever blotted or sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ed by his unfaithfulness at
any time, and so it is here, <hi>Iosh. 23. 14. not one thing
hath failed,</hi> all are come to pass, all ages have seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this conclusion, <hi>Thy word is truth, thy word is truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> Besides all this you have the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all former experiences both others and your
own, as a second Argument to press you to enter into
this Chamber of Safety, the Faithfulness of God.</p>
                        <p>1. You have the experiences of others. Saints have
reckoned the experiences of others that lived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years before them, as excellent arguments to
quicken their Faith. So <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 4. He had power
over the Angel and prevailed, he found him in <hi>Bethel</hi>
and there he spake, Remember there was a <hi>Ioseph</hi> with
us in Prison, a <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the Dungeon, a <hi>Daniel</hi> in
the Den, a <hi>Peter</hi> in Chains, an <hi>Hez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>kiah</hi> upon the
brink of the Grave; and they all found the help of
God most faithfully protecting them and saving them
in all their troubles. Suitable so this is that in <hi>Psal.
22. 4. 5. Our fathers trusted in thee; they trusted
and thou deliveredst them, they cried unto thee and
were delivered, they trusted in thee and were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Your own experiences may encourage your
faith: So <hi>Davids</hi> did, <hi>1. Sam. 17. 37. The Lord
that delivered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and
out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out
of the hand of this Philistine.</hi> So did <hi>Paul</hi>'s experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
encourage his Faith, in <hi>2 Cor. 1. 10. Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us from so great a death, and doth deliver; in
whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.</hi> Thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Faithfulness of God by Faith.</p>
                        <p>2. Let me beg you to be sure to shut the doors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
you, against all unbelieving doubts, jealousies,
and suspicions of the faithfulness of God; the best
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44184:116"/>
men may find temptations of that nature; so did good
<hi>Asaph</hi> though an eminent Saint, <hi>Psal. 77. 78. Will
the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable
no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
fail for ever more?</hi> These jealousies are apt to
creep in upon the minds of men, especially when,</p>
                        <p>1. God delays to answer our Prayers as soon as we
expect the return of them, we are all in hast for a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
answer, forgetting that seasons of Prayer are our
seed-times; and when we have sown that precious
seed, we must wait for the Harvest, as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
doth. Even a precious <hi>Heman</hi> may find a faint
qualm of unbelief and despondency seizing him by
the long suspension of Gods answers, <hi>Psal. 88. 9,
10, 11.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Twill be hard to shut the door upon unbelief,
when all things in the eye of our sense and reason seem
to work against the Promise. It will require an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Faith at such a time to glorifie God by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in hope against hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. If ever thou
hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>st to enjoy the sweet repose and rest of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
in evil times, thou must resolve whatever thine
eyes do see, or thy senses report, to hold fast this as a
most sure conclusion; God is faithful, and his word
is sure, and that although <hi>Clouds and darkness be round
about him, yet righteousness and judgment are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of his throne, Psal.</hi> 97. 2.</p>
                        <p>O that you would once learn to keep house upon
Gods Faithfulness, and fetch your daily reliefs and
supports thence, whensoever you are pressed and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
either,</p>
                        <p>1. By Spiritual troubles. When you walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and have no light, then you are to live by acts of
trust and recumbency upon the most faithful one, <hi>Isa.</hi>
50. 10. Or,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:44184:117"/>
2. By Temporal distresses, so did the People of
God of old, <hi>Hab. 3. 17, 18.</hi> He lived by Faith on
this Attribute when all visible comforts and supplies
were out of sight.</p>
                        <p>But especially let me warn and caution you against
five principal enemies to your repose upon the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of God, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Distracting cares, which divide the mind, and
eat out the peace and comfort of the heart, and which
is worst of all, they reflect very dishonourably upon
God, who hath pledged his Faithfulness and Truth
for our security; against which I pray you bar the
door by those two Scriptures, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
known unto God.</hi> And that in <hi>1 Pet. 5. 7. Casting
all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Bar the door against unchristian despondency,
another enemy to the sweet repose of your Souls in
this comfortable and quiet Chamber of Divine Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;
you will find this unbecoming and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
distemper of mind, insinuating and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in upon you, except you believe and reason i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
out, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal. 42. 11. Why art thou cast
down O my soul, and why disquieted within me? Hope
thou in God for I shall yet praise him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Bar the door of your heart against carnal poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and sinful shifts, which war against your own
Faith, and Gods Faithfulness, as much as any other
enemy whatsoever. This was the fault of good <hi>David</hi>
in a day of trouble, <hi>1 Sam. 27. 1. And</hi> David <hi>said in his
heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of</hi> Saul;
<hi>there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily
escape into the land of the</hi> Philistines. Alas poor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
nothing better than this? Time was when thou
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44184:117"/>
couldst think on a better way, when thou couldst say
<hi>at what time I am afraid I will trust in thee.</hi> How
dost thou forget thy self in this strait? Doth thy old
refuge in God fail thee now? Can the <hi>Philistines</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
thee better than the <hi>Promises?</hi> Wilt thou fly
from thy best friend, to thy worst enemies? But what
need we wonder at <hi>David</hi> who find the same distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
almost unavoidable to our selves in like cases?</p>
                        <p>4. Shut the door against discontents at, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
against the dispositions of Providence, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you feel or fear; I perswade you not to a <hi>Stoical
Apathy,</hi> and senselesness of the evils of the times, that
would preclude the exercise of Patience: If the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
had all had the dead Palsie before they came to
the fire, their Faith and Patience had not triumphed
so gloriously as they did; but on the contrary, beware
of grudgings against the ways and will of God, than
which nothing militates more against your Faith and
the peace and quietness of your hearts.</p>
                        <p>5. To conclude, shut the door against all suspicions
and jealousies of the firmness and stability of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
when you find all sensible comforts shaking
and trembling under your feet; have a care of such
dangerous questions as that, <hi>Psal. 77. 8. Doth his

                        <p>IT is said, <hi>Prov. 9. 1. Wisdom hath builded her

She hath raised her whole building upon solid and
stable foundations, for indeed the strength of every
building is according to the ground work upon

The Wisdom and Love of God have built an house
for a Refuge and Sanctuary to Believers in tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

till the calamities be over-past; three of them have
been already opened, <hi>viz.</hi> The Power, Wisdom, and

                        <p>The last of which leads into a fourth much like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, namely the <hi>Unchangeableness</hi> of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his people may find as much rest and comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the vicissitudes of this unstable World, as in
any of the former. This World is compared, <hi>Rev.</hi>

and fiery trials, with which the Saints are
exercised here below. The only support and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we have against the fickleness and instability of
the Creature, is the Unchangeableness of God. There
is a two-fold changeableness in the Creature:

Children, Estates, like the Gourd in which <hi>Ionas</hi>
so delighted himself, may wither in a night; Sin rings
these changes all the world over.</p>
                        <p>2. Sinful, from the falseness, inconstancy, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Creature; <hi>Solomon</hi> puts a hard questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which may pose the whole World to answer it,
<hi>Prov. 20. 6. A faithful man who can find?</hi> The

is Negative; but though the believer despair of
finding an unchangeable man, it is his happiness
and comfort to find an Unchangeable God.</p>
                        <p>The Unchangeableness of God will appear three

is that place, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. where God is called
<hi>The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning.</hi> No variableness the word
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, an Astronomical term, commonly
applyed to the Heavenly Bodies which have their
<hi>Parallaxes, i. e.</hi> their Declinations, Revolutions, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes,
Eclipses, Increases and Decreases; but
God is a Sun that never rises nor sets, but is everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and unchangeably one and the same; with him
is no variableness nor shadow of turning, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.
The Sun in its <hi>Zenith</hi> casts no shadow,
it is the <hi>Tropick,</hi> or turning of its course, that
causes the shadow; the very <hi>substance</hi> of turning is
with man; but not the least <hi>shadow</hi> of turning with
God. And in <hi>Deut. 32. 4. Moses</hi> tells us, <hi>God is a
rock, and his work is perfect.</hi> And indeed perfect
working necessarily follows a perfect Being: Now
there is nothing found in Nature more solid, fixed,
and immutable, than a rock; the firmest buildings
will decay, a few ages will make them a ruinous
heap; but though one age pass away and another
comes, the rocks abide where, and what they were;
<hi>Our God is the rock of ages;</hi> and yet one step higher,
in <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 1. His decrees and purposes are called
Mountains of Brass, that is, most firm, durable, and
unchangeable purposes: Thus the Immutability
of God is shadowed forth to us in Scripture Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

2. The same also you will find in plain positive
Scripture Assertions; such are these that follow, <hi>Mal. 3.
6. I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye sons of</hi>
Jacob <hi>are not consumed.</hi> And <hi>Iob 23. 13. He is
in one mind, and who can turn him?</hi> Men are in one
mind to day, and another to morrow; the winds are
not more variable than the minds of men: But God is
in one mind, the purposes of his heart never change.
<hi>Thou art the same,</hi> or as some translate, <hi>Thou art
thy self for ever, Psal.</hi> 102. 27. Thus when <hi>Moses</hi>
desired to know his name that he might tell <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
from whom he came; the Answer is, <hi>I am hath sent
me, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. not I was, or I will be, but <hi>I am
that I am,</hi> nothing the Absolute unchangeableness
of his Nature.</p>
                        <p>3. The Unchangeableness of God is fully proved
by convincing arguments which Divines commonly
draw from such <hi>Topicks</hi> as these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. The Perfection of his Goodness.</item>
                              <item>2. The Purity of his Nature.</item>
                              <item>3. The Glory of his Name.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> From the Perfection of his Goodness and
Blessedness, God is <hi>Optimus, maximus,</hi> the best and
chiefest good, and in that sense, <hi>There is none good
but one, which is God, Mark</hi> 10. 18. From whence
it is thus argued, If there be any change in God, that
change must either be for the better, or for the
worse, or into a State equal with that he possessed
before.</p>
                        <p>But not for the better, for then he could not be the
chief good; nor for the worse, for then he must cease
to be God, the perfection of whose Nature is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
exclusive of all defects; nor into an equal state
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44184:120"/>
of goodness with that he possessed before; that notion
would involve <hi>Polytheism,</hi> and suppose two First
and equal Beings, besides the vanity of such a change
would be absolutely repugnant to the Wisdom of
God.</p>
                        <p>Therefore with the Father of lights can be no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
nor shadow of turning.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> The Unchangeableness of God may be
evinced from the Purity, sincerity, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundedness
of his Being, in which there neither is,
nor can be the least mixture, he being a pure act. From
whence it is thus argued;</p>
                        <p>If there be any change in God, that change must
be made either by something without himself; or by
something within himself, or by both together.</p>
                        <p>But it cannot be by any thing without himself; for
in him all created dependent Beings live and move,
and enjoy the Beings they have; and all the changes
that are among them, are from the pleasure of this
unchangeable Being, he changeth them, but it is
not possible for him, upon whose pleasure they so
intirely and absolutely depend, both as to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and workings, to suffer any change himself from,
or by them.</p>
                        <p>Nor can any such change be made upon God by
any thing within himself; for that would suppose
action and passion, <hi>movens &amp; motum</hi> a mixture and
composition in his Nature, which is absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and excluded by the simplicity and purity
thereof: seeing therefore it can neither be from any
power without him, nor any mixture within him,
there can be no change at all made on him.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> That is by no means to be ascribed to
God, which at once eclipses the glory of his name,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44184:120"/>
and overthrows the hopes and comforts of all his
people.</p>
                        <p>But so would the supposition of mutability in God
do, this would level him with the vain changeable
creature; whereas it is a principal part of his glory,
that <hi>He is not as man that he should lie, neither the
son of man that he should repent, Numb.</hi> 23. 19. This
also would overthrow the hopes and comforts of all his
people, which are built upon this Attribute as upon
their stable and solid foundation: Among divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we find three principal priviledges of the people
of God, built upon his Immutability, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Their Perseverance in Grace.</item>
                              <item>2. Their Comfort in the Promises.</item>
                              <item>3. Their Hopes of Eternal life.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Their Perseverance in Grace is built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Gods unchangeableness; one main reason
why Christians never repent of their choice of Christ
and the ways of Godliness, is because the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.
Should God but once repent of the gifts of grace he
hath bestowed on us, and alter in his love towards
us, how soon would our love to God, and delight
in God vanish, as the image in the glass doth when
the man that looked upon it hath once turned away
his face?</p>
                        <p>2. All their comfort in the promises is built upon
Gods unchangeableness. The promises are the springs
of consolation; should they fail and dry up, the
whole world could not afford them one drop of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
comfort to refresh their thirsty Souls; the
strength of our consolation immediately results from
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44184:121"/>
the stability and firmness of the Scripture promises,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
                        <p>3. Their hopes of eternal life depends upon the
unchangeableness of God that hath promised, <hi>Tit. 1. 2.
In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie,
promised before the world began.</hi> Take away then
the Immutability of God, and you at once darken and
eclipse his Glory, and overturn the perseverance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
and hopes of all his people; but blessed be
God these things are built upon firm foundations.</p>
                        <p>1. His Nature is unchangeable, <hi>Thou art the same
for ever, Ps.</hi> 102. 27. The Heavens though they be
the purest, and therefore the most durable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
part of the creation; yet they shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and wax old, and be changed as a vesture, but our
God is the same for ever.</p>
                        <p>2. His power is unchangeable, <hi>Isa. 59. 1. The Lords
hand is not shortened.</hi> Time will enfeeble the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
creature, and cut short the Power of the hands of
the mighty, they cannot do in their decrepit age as
they were wont to do in their youthful and vigorous
age; but the Lords hand never is, nor can be shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</p>
                        <p>3. The counsels and purposes of his heart are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
<hi>Psal. 33. 11. The counsel of the Lord
standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The goodness, truth, and mercy of God are
Unchangeable, <hi>Psal. 100. 5. The Lord is good, his
mercy is everlasting, and his truth endureth to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. The word of God is Unchangeable. Though
all flesh be as grass, and the goodliness thereof as the
flower of the field, yet the word of our God shall stand
for ever; all the Promises contained therein are sure
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44184:121"/>
and stedfast: Not yea and nay, but yea and Amen for
ever, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                        <p>6. The love of God is an Unchangeable love, <hi>Ier.
31. 3. Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting
love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In a word, all the gracious Pardons of God
are unchangeable, as they are full without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so they are final Pardons without any revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and
their iniquities and sins will I remember no more, Heb.</hi>
8. 12. And thus much briefly of Gods unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
absolutely considered in it self.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Immutability of God gives down its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to Believers through the Promises, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way by which they can have a comfortable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into this Chamber or Attribute of God; and
there are six sorts of promises in the word, by which
it is highly improveable to their support and comfort
in an evil day. For,</p>
                        <p>1. The unchangeable God hath engaged himself
by Promise to be with his people in all times and in
all streights, <hi>Heb. 13. 5. I will never leave thee, nor
forsake thee.</hi> The life, joy, and comfort of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
lies in the bosom of that Promise, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44184:122"/>
of Faith from thence is sweet and sure; If I shall
never be forsaken of my God, let Hell and Earth do
their worst, I can never be miserable.</p>
                        <p>2. The Unchangeable God hath promised to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their graces, and thereby his interest in them for
ever, <hi>Ier. 32. 40. And I will make an everlasting
Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from
them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> Where
the Lord undertakes for both parts in the Covenant,
his own and theirs; I will not turn away from them,
O unexpressible mercy! Yea, but Lord, may the
poor Believer say, that is not so much my fear, as
that my treacherous heart will turn away from thee.
No, saith God, I will take care for that also; I will
put my fear into thy heart, and thou shalt never depart
from me.</p>
                        <p>3. The Unchangeable God hath promised to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Covenant with them for ever; so that those
who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> taken into that gracious Covenant shall
never be turned out of it again, <hi>Isa. 54. 10. The
mountains shall depart, and the Hills be removed, but
my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall
the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that
hath mercy on thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The Unchangeable God hath secured his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindness to his people by Promise under all the
trials, and smarting rods of affliction, with which
he chastens them in this world; he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to himself the liberty of afflicting them, but
bound himself by promise never to remove his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from them, <hi>Psal. 89. 33, 34. I will visit their
transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with
siripes, nevertheless my loving kindness will I not take
from them, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="229" facs="tcp:44184:122"/>
5. The Promises of a joyful resurrection from
the dead are grounded upon the Immutability of
God, <hi>Matth. 22. 32. I am the God of</hi> Abraham,
<hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob; <hi>God is not
the God of the dead, but the God of the living.</hi> Death
hath made a great change upon them, but none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their God; though they be not, he is still the
same, therefore they are not lost in death; but shall
assuredly be found again in the resurrection.</p>
                        <p>6. To conclude, the promises of the Saints eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happiness with God in Heaven, are founded in his
Immutability, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 8, 9. Tit.</hi> 1. 2. By all
which you see what a pleasant lodging is prepared
for the Saints in the unchangeable promises of God,
amidst all the changes and alterations here below.</p>
                        <p>2. Once more, let us view the unchangeableness
of God in his Providences towards his people, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                        <p>1. It must needs be so, considering the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of his decree, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 19. The foundation
of God standeth sure.</hi> Providences serve, but never
frustrate, execute but cannot make void the decree;
so that you may say of the most afflicting Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

                        <p>2. The Wisdom of God proves it, he will not
suffer his works or permissions to clash with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and purposes; Divine Wisdom shews it self in
the steddy direction of all things to the ultimate end.
To open this in some particulars, consider,</p>
                        <p>1. Doth the Lord permit wicked men to rage, and
insult, persecute, and vex his people? Yet all this
while Providence is in its right way, it walks in as
direct a line to your good, as when it is in a more
pleasant path of Peace. <hi>Ier. 24. 5. Thus saith the
Lord the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of</hi>
Judah, <hi>whom I have sent out of this place into the

to <hi>Babylon</hi> for their good. This improves your faith

2. Doth the Lord in his Providence order many
and frequent, close and smarting afflictions for you?
Why lo, here is the same design managing as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as if all the peace and prosperity in the World
were ordered for you: The face of Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is not the same, but the love of God is still the
the same, he loves you as much when he smites, as
when he smiles on you; for what are his ends in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
you, and what the sanctified fruits of your
afflictions? Is it not?</p>
                        <p>1. To purge your iniquities, <hi>Isa. 27. 9. By this
therefore shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this
is all the fruit to take away his sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. To reduce your hearts to God, <hi>Psal. 119. 67.
Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept
thy word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. To quicken you to your duties, let the best man
be without afflictions and he will quickly grow dull
in the way of his duty.</p>
                        <p>3. Doth God let loose the chain of Satan to tempt
and buffet you? Yet is he still the same God to you as
before; for do but observe his ends in that permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and you will find, that by these things the Lord
is leading you towards that desired assurance of his
love which your Souls long after. Few Christians
attain to any considerable settlement of Soul, but by
such shakings and combates; the end of these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
is to put you to your knees, and blow up a
greater flame and fervour of Spirit in Prayer, <hi>2 Cor.</hi>
12. 8. So that eventually these permissions of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
prove singular advantages, and blessings to
you.</p>

                        <p>WHat remains then, seeing God is Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his love to his People, pursuing the
the great ends of all his gracious promises in a steddy
course of Providence wherein he will never effect,
or permit any thing that is really repugnant to his
own glory or their good; but that we enter also into
this Camber of Rest, shut the doors about us, and
comfortably improve the unchangeableness of God,
while we see nothing but changes and troubles here
below.</p>
                        <p>1. Enter into Gods Unchangeableness by Faith,
take up your lodgings in this sweet Attribute also;
and to encourage your Faith thereunto, seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
a few particulars.</p>
                        <p>1. Consider how constant, firm, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
God hath been to his people in all times and
streights; not one among the many thousands of his
people that are passed on before you, but by frequent
and certain experience have found him so. What a
singular encouragement should this be to our Faith
in the case before us? <hi>Psal. 9. 10. They that know
thy name, will put their trust in thee, for thou Lord
hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</hi> So <hi>Isa. 25. 4.
Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones
is as the storm against the wall.</hi> Neither is there any
thing in your experience contradictory to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
reports others have made of God; you must
acknowledge, that notwithstanding your own chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableness
who have hardly been able to maintain
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44184:124"/>
your hearts in any Spiritual frame towards God for
one day together, yet his mercies towards you have
been new every morning, and great hath been his
Faithfulness: You have often turned aside from the
way of your duty, and have not followed God in a
steddy course of obedience, and yet for all that, his
goodness and mercy have followed you all the days of
your life, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 6.</p>
                        <p>2. Consider how often you have doubted and
mistrusted the unchangeableness of God, and been
forced with shame and sorrow to retract your folly
therein; God hath many times convinced you that
his love to you is an unchangeable love, how many
changes soever in the course of his Providence have
passed over you; consult <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14. and <hi>Psal. 77,
78.</hi> and see how the cases parallel both in respect of
Gods constancy to them and you, and the inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his peoples Faith then, and yours now; your
fears and doubts are the same with theirs; though
his goodness and love have been as unchangeable to
you as ever it was towards them.</p>
                        <p>3. Consider the Advocateship and intercession of
Jesus Christ in Heaven for you; by vertue whereof
the favour and love of God becomes unalterable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people. If any thing can be supposed to
cool or quench the love of God towards you, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world is more like to do it, than your
sin, and this indeed is that, which you fear will
estrange and alienate the heart of your God from
you. But Reader, if thou be one that sincerely
mournest for all the grief and dishonour of God by
thy sin, appliest the bloud of sprinkling to thy Soul
by Faith, and makest mortification and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thy daily business; comfort thy self against that
fear from that singular encouragement given thee
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44184:125"/>
in this case, <hi>1 Iohn 2. 1, 2. My little children, these
things write I unto you that ye sin not, and if any
man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for
our sins.</hi> Look as the death of Christ healed the great
breach betwixt God and thy Soul, by thy reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
at first; so the powerful Intercession of Christ
in Heaven effectually prevents all new breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and thy Soul afterwards, so that he will
never totally and finally cast thee off again.</p>
                        <p>2. Shut the door behind you against all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
scruples, and questionings of Gods immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and by a resolved and steddy Faith, maintain the
the honour of God in this point by thy constant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to it and dependence upon it, and especially
see that thou give him the glory of his unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p>1. When thou shalt see the greatest alterations and
changes made by his Providence in the World.
What though thou shouldest live to see all things
turned upside down, the foundations out of course,
all things drawing into a Sea of confusion and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Yet in the midst of those publick distractions and
distress of Nations: Encourage thou thy self in this,
thy God and his love to his people is the same for
ever. <hi>Psal. 46. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. God is our refuge and
strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore
will we not fear, though the earth be moved, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
sea. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Live by Faith upon Gods unchangeableness
under the greatest changes of your own condition in
this world: Providence may make great alterations
upon all your outward conforts, it may cast you
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44184:125"/>
down, how dear soever you be to God, from riches
into poverty, from health into sickness, from honour
into reproach, from liberty into bondage! thou
mayest overlive thy comfortable relations, and of a
<hi>Naomi</hi> become a <hi>Marah. Thou hast lifted me up,
and cast me down,</hi> said as good a man as you, <hi>Psal.</hi>
102. 10. Yet still it is your duty, and will be your
great priviledge in the midst of all these changes, to
act your faith upon the never changing God, as that
holy man did, <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Although the Fig-tree
shall not blossom, neither fruit be in the vine; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no
meat; the flocks shall be cut off from the fold, and
there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet will I rejoyce in
the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. q. d.</hi>
Suppose a thousand disappointments of my earthly
hopes, yet will I maintain my hope in God. O
Christian, with how many yets, notwithstandings,
and neverthelesses, must thy faith bear up in times of
trouble, or thou'l sink?</p>
                        <p>3. See thou live upon Gods unchangeableness,
when age and sickness shall inform thee, that thy
great change is at hand; though thy heart and thy
flesh fail, comfort thy self with this, thy God will
never fail thee, <hi>Psal. 73. 16. O God,</hi> saith
<hi>David, thou hast taught me from my youth, and
hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works, now
also when I am old and gray headed, forsake me not,
Psal. 71, 17, 18.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Live upon the unchangeableness of God under
the greatest and saddest changes of your Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
God may cloud the light of his countenance
over thy Soul, he may fill thee with fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and the comforter that should relieve thee, may
seem to be far off; yet still maintain thy faith
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44184:126"/>
in the unchangeableness of his loves; trust in the
name of the Lord, stay thy self upon the God when
thou walkest in darkness and hast no light, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10.
Thus shut thy door.</p>
                        <p>3. Improve the unchangeabless of God to thy
best advantage in the worst times, by drawing thence
such comfortable conclusions as these:</p>
                        <p>1. If God be an uchangeable God in his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and in his love to his people, what should hinder
but the people of God may live happily and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
in the saddest times, and greatest troubles upon
earth. <hi>As sorrowful, yet always rejoycing, as poor,
yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet
possessing all things, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 10. Certainly nothing
ought to quench a Christians mirth that is not
able to separate him from the love of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 35.</p>
                        <p>2. If God be an unchangeable God in his love to
his people; then it becomes all that have special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in this God, to be unchangeable and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the ways of their obedience towards him:
God will not cast you off, see that you cast not off
your duties, no not when they are surrounded with
difficulties; he loves you, though you often grieve
him by sin; see that you still love him, though he
often grieve and burden you by affliction: he will
own you for his people under the greatest contempts
and reproaches of the World; see that you own and
honour his ways and truths when you are under most
reproach from a vile World.</p>

                        <p>CAre in the general Notion of it, as it is applyed
to the Creature, imports the studiousness, and
solicitousness of our thoughts, for the safety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of our selves, or those we love, and highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
Now though there be no such thing properly
in God, at whose dispose and pleasure all events are,
and to whose counsels and appointments all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
must give way, yet he is pleased to accommodate
himself to our weakness, and express his regard and
love to his people, by such things, as one creature
doth to another to which it is endeared by relation
or affection. To this purpose we find many significant,
Synonomous expressions in Scripture, all importing
the careof God over his people in a pleasant variety of
notion and expression, as <hi>Nah. 1. 7. The Lord is
good, a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he
knoweth them that trust in him.</hi> He knoweth them,
<hi>i. e.</hi> he hath a special, tender, and careful eye upon
them, to see their wants supplyed, and to protect
them in all their dangers; for in the common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
sense, he knoweth them that trust not in him, as
well as those that do; and further to clear this sence of
the place, it is said, <hi>Ps. 40. 17. The Lord thinketh on
them.</hi> Importing not only simple cogitation, but the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44184:127"/>
immoration or abiding of his thoughts upon them,
as our thoughts are wont to do, upon that which we
highly esteem, especially when any danger is near
it. And yet farther to clear this sense, it is said,
<hi>Iob 36. 7. He withdraweth not his Eye from the
righteous.</hi> As when <hi>Moses</hi> was exposed in the <hi>Ark</hi> of
Bulrushes, where his Life was in eminent hazards
by the <hi>waters of Nilus</hi> upon one side, and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Cut-Throats</hi> on the other; his Sister <hi>Miriam</hi>
kept watch at a distance, to see what would be done
to him. Her eye was never off that <hi>Ark</hi> wherein
her dear Brother lay; fear and care engaged her eye
to keep a true watch for him. Thus the Lord
withdraweth not his eye from the righteous. To
the same purpose is that expression, <hi>Deut. 33. 3. Yoa
he loved the People; all his Saints are in thy hand.</hi>
That which we dearly love and prize above ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we keep in our own hands for its security, as not
thinking it safe enough in any other hand or place.
And once more, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 16. God is said to engrave
them upon the Palms of his Hands, alluding to
what is customary among men, who when they
would charge their memories with something of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
concernment, use to change a Ring, or bind a
Thred about the Finger, to put them in mind of
it. Thus is the care of our God expressed to us in
Scripture notions. The amount of all which, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us in that one proper and full expression of the
Apostle, <hi>1 Pet. 5. 7. He careth for you.</hi> To open
this Chamber of <hi>Divine care</hi> as a place of sweetest
rest, to our anxious and perplexed minds, in times
of difficulty and hazard, it will be necessary that
you seriously ponder;

people; which are,</p>
                        <p>1. The strict and dear Relations in which he is
pleased to own them. Believers are his children,
and you know how naturally children engage and
draw forth the Fathers care for them. This is the
argument Christ uses, <hi>Matth. 6. 31, 32. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take no thought, saying what shall we eat? Or
what shall we drink? Or wherewithal shall we be
cloathed? For your heavenly Father knoweth that
ye have need of all these things.</hi> Children, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when young, disquiet not themselves about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vions
for back or belly, but leave that to the care
of their Parents, from whom by the tye and Bonds
of Nature and Love, they expect provision for all
those wants: Every one takes care for his own;
much more doth God for his own Children, and
indeed he expects his children should live upon his
care; as our children in their minority, do upon
ours.</p>
                        <p>2. Gods precious estimation and value of them,
engages his constant care for them. Believers are
his Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. his peculiar people, <hi>1 Pet.</hi>
2. 6. his special portion or treasure in this world,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. and as such he prizes and esteems
them above all the people of the earth, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
exerciseth his special care in all the dangers
they are here exposed to. Special love engageth
peculiar care.</p>
                        <p>3. The dangers and fears of the people of God,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44184:128"/>
in this world, are many and great, and were it not
for the Lords assiduous and tender care over them,
they must necessarily be ruined, both in soul and
body, by them. The Church is God's Vineyard,
its Enemies as so many wild Boars to root it up:
Upon this account, he saith, <hi>Isa. 27. 3. I the Lord
do keep it, lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and
day.</hi> And indeed it is well for <hi>Israel,</hi> that he that
keepeth it, never slumbereth nor sleepeth, <hi>Psal.</hi>
121. 4. that our houses are in peace, that we and
our dear relations fall not as a prey, into cruel and
bloody hands, skilful to destroy, that we find any
rest, or comfort in so evil and dangerous a world,
it is wholly and only to be ascribed to the care of
God over us, and ours.</p>
                        <p>4. Jesus Christ hath solemnly recommended all
the people of God, to his particular care. It was
one of the last expressions of Christ love to them at
the parting hour, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more in the world, but these are in the world; and
I come to thee: Holy Father, keep through thine
own name those whom thou hast given me, q. d.</hi>
While I have been personally present with them,
I took the same care of them; as a Shepheard doth
of his Flock, or a tender Father of his Children:
But now I must leave them in the world, and in
the midst of a world of dangers, fears and troubles,
against which they can make no provision or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
themselves. Father remember them, look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, when I shall be removed from them, they
are thine, as well as mine; and I recommend them
with my last breath to thy care and protection.
This is a special ground also of Gods care for
them.</p>
                        <p>5. Believers dayly cast themselves upon the care
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44184:128"/>
of God, and resign themselves unto it in their dayly
Prayers. And by their often renewed acts of Faith,
than which no act is found more engaging from the
creature upon its God; though there be nothing of
merit, yet there is much of engaging efficacy in it,
<hi>Isa. 26. 3. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in
thee.</hi> We find it so among our selves, the more
firmly and entirely any one trusteth to us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
upon us, the more he engageth us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
or relieve him. Now this is the dayly work
of Christians to trust God over all, and put all their
concernments into his hand, which very trust and
dependance draws forth the care of God for them.</p>
                        <p>6. In a word, the many promises God hath made
to his people to preserve, support and supply them
in all the times of need, engageth the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re of God
for them, as often as such wants, or dangers befal
them; for indeed herein, he at once takes care for
their necessity, and for his own honour and glory.
They trust to his word, and rely upon his promises
which therefore he will be careful to make good.
This was the argument, which the Church pleaded
in the time of eminent danger, to engage the care
of God for them, <hi>Psal. 74. 20. Havs respect unto
the Covenant: for the dark places of the Earth are
full of the habitations of cruelty. q. d.</hi> O Lord, thy
people are in the midst of cruel enemies, take care
for their protection, and though there be no worth in
them, to which thou shouldest have respect, yet
have respect unto thine own Covenant: let the
glory of thy Name draw forth thy care to thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                        <p>WE have seen the grounds and reasons of Gods
care over his people, let us next view the
extent and compass of this Divine care; and here
methinks the Lord saith to his people as he said to
<hi>Abraham, Gen. 13. 14, 15. Lift up now thine eyes
from the place where thou art, northward, and south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and eastward, and westward, for all the land
which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed
for ever.</hi> So here, poor timorous, dejected Believer,
lift up thine eyes from the place where thou art,
and take a view of all the promises in the
Scriptures of truth; promises of supports under
all burthens, supplies of all wants, deliverances
out of all dangers, assistances in all distresses;
to thee have I given them all as a portion for
ever. This care of God walks the round, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
the Souls and Bodies of them that fear him, day
and night. There is no interest or concern of either
found without the line of his all-surrounding Care,
and every one of his children are enfolded in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
arms, <hi>Deut. 33. 3. All his Saints are in thy
hand.</hi> All and every one of their wants and streights
are observed by this Care, in order to their supply,
<hi>Phil. 4. 19. My God shall supply all your wants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Great is the Care of God over the Bodies of his
people, and all the dangers and necessities of them as
they daily grow; your meat and drink are daily
provided for you by your Fathers Care. <hi>Psal. 111. 5.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he
will ever be mindful of his Covenant.</hi> It is from this
Care of thy Heavenly Father, that necessary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44184:129"/>
have been made for thee, of which it may be
thou hast had no foresight: This is the God that hath
fed thee all thy life long, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 15. It is from the
same care thy body hath been cloathed, <hi>Matth. 6.
28. How much more shall he cloath you, O ye of little
faith?</hi> It is through this Care, you sleep in peace,
and your rest is made sweet unto you, <hi>Prov. 3. 24.
When thou lyest down thou shalt not be afraid; yea,
thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</hi> In
a word, thou owest all thy recoveries from dangerous
diseases, and narrow escapes from the grave, to this
Care of thy God over thee, <hi>He is the Lord that heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

thee, Exod.</hi> 15. 26. That the incensed humours of
thy body had not overflowed their banks, like an
inundation of the Sea, when they raged in thy
dangerous diseases, is only because thy God took the
care of thee, and set them their bounds.</p>
                        <p>2. Divine Care extends it self to the Souls of all
that fear God, and to all the concernments of their
Souls; and manifestly discovers it self in all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
provisions it hath made for them. More
particularly, it is from this tender Fatherly care
that,</p>
                        <p>1. A Saviour was provided to redeem them when
they were ruined and lost by sin, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. Rom.</hi>
8. 32.</p>
                        <p>2. That Spiritual cordials are provided to refresh
them in all their sinking sorrows, and inward distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 19.</p>
                        <p>3. That a door of deliverance is opened to them,
when they are sorely pressed upon by temptations,
and ready to be overwhelmed, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
                        <p>4. That a strength above their own comes in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to support them, when they are almost
overweighed with inward troubles, when great
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44184:130"/>
weights are upon them, the everlasting arms are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
them, <hi>Psal. 138. 3. Isa.</hi> 57. 16.</p>
                        <p>5. That their ruine is prevented when they are
upon the dangerous and flippery brink of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and their feet almost gone, <hi>Psal. 73. 12. Hos. 2. 6.
2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                        <p>6. That they are recovered again after dangerous
falls by sin, and not left as a prey and Trophy to their
enemy, <hi>Hos. 144.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. That they are guided and directed in the right
way, when they are at a loss, and know not what
course to take, <hi>Psal. 16. 11. Psal.</hi> 73. 24.</p>
                        <p>8. That they are established and confirmed in
Christ in the most shaking and overturning times of
trouble and persecution; so that neither their heart

                              <desc>••</desc>

<hi>Ier. 32. 40. Ioh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
                        <p>9. That they are upheld under Spiritual deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and recovered again out of that dismal darkness
into the chearful light of Gods countenance, <hi>Isa.</hi>
57. 16.</p>
                        <p>10. That they are at last brought safe to Heaven
through the innumerable hazards and dangers all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
their way thither, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. In all these
things the care of their God eminently discovers
it self for their Souls.</p>
                        <p>3. Once more let us consider the Care of God for
his people in the lovely properties thereof. As,</p>
                        <p>1. It is a Fatherly care, than which none is more
great or tender, <hi>Matth. 6. 8. Your father knoweth
that you have need of all these things.</hi> And indeed the
greatest and tenderest care of an earthly Father is but
a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>int shadow of that tender care which is in the
heart of God over his Children; for to that end we
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44184:130"/>
find them compared, <hi>Matth. 7. 11. If ye then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your father which
is in heaven, give good things to them which
ask him.</hi> The care of Patents is carelesness it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>elf, compared with that care which God takes of
his.</p>
                        <p>2. The care of God is a universal care, watching
over all his people in all ages, places and dangers,
<hi>2 Chron. 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro
through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in
behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him.</hi>
This was applyed by way of reproof to <hi>Asa,</hi> who
out of a sinful distrust of the care of God, relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the help of <hi>Syria,</hi> as if there had not been a God
in Heaven to take care of him and the people.</p>
                        <p>3. Gods care over his, is assiduous and continual;
<hi>his mercies are new every morning, great is his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Lam. 3. 22, 23. He keeps his people night
and day, Isa.</hi> 27. 3. Could Satan, or his instruments
find such an hour wherein the seven eyes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should be all asleep, that would be the fatal
hour to our Souls and Bodies; but he that keepeth
<hi>Israel</hi> slumbereth not.</p>
                        <p>4. Gods care over his, is exceeding tender, far
beyond the tenderness that the most affectionate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever felt in her heart towards the child that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her breast, <hi>Isa. 49. 15. Can a mother forget her
sucking child,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they may, yet will not I forget thee.</hi>
The birds of the air are not so tender of their young
in the nest, as God is of his people in the world, <hi>Isa.</hi>
31. 5. Mercy fills the heart of God, yea, tender
mercy, yea, multitudes of tender mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="246" facs="tcp:44184:131"/>
5. The care of God is a seasonable care, which is
always sure to nick the opportunity and proper season
of relieving his people; in the mount of the Lord it
shall be seen: The beauty of Providence is much
seen in this thing, wherever you feel a want, this care
finds a supply; and thus much briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the care of
God absolutely considered in it self.</p>

                        <head>SECT. III.</head>
                        <p>IT remains that we also consider the care of God
in its twofold respect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. To his Promises.</item>
                              <item>2. To his Providences.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. There are multitudes of Promises found in the
Scriptures, exactly fitted as so many keys to open the
door of this comfortable Chamber to receive, and
secure all that fear God, whatever their wants, fears,
or distresses are. These are reducible into two
Classes, or ranks. <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. More general and comprehensive.</item>
                              <item>2. More particular Promises.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The general and more comprehensive Promises
are found in the general expressures of the Covenant,
as that to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 1. I am God Almighty,
walk thou before me and be perfect. q. d.</hi> Let it be
thy care to walk exactly in the paths of obedience
before me, and I will take care to supply all thy
wants from the never failing fountain of my al-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency;
and of the same tenour is that, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 6. 18.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44184:131"/>
I will be to them a Father, and they shall be my
sons and daughters, <hi>i. e.</hi> Expect your provisions and
protections from my care, as children do from their
father. More particularly, there are six sorts of
Promises, wherein the care of God is particularly
made over to his people in the greatest hazards and
difficulties in this life. <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It is assigned and made over to them to supply
all their needs, so far as the Glory of God and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Spiritual and eternal good shall require it,
<hi>Ps. 34. 9. They that fear the Lord shall not want any good
thing.</hi> All your livelihood is in that Promise; thence
comes your daily bread; your own and your families
meat is in that cupboard.</p>
                        <p>2. It is made over to the Church and people of
God for their defence against all dangers, <hi>Isa. 54. 17.
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.</hi>
This promise wards off all the deadly blows, and puts
by all the mortal thrusts that are made at you; here
the care of God forms it self into a shield for your
defence.</p>
                        <p>3. The care of God is engaged by promise for
the moderation and mitigation of your afflictions,
that they may not exceed your abilities to bear them,
<hi>Isa. 27. 8, 9. in measure when it shooteth forth, thou
wilt debate with it; he stayeth the rough wind in the
day of the east-wind.</hi> If the wind blow from a cold
corner, this Promise moderates it, that it blow not
a storm; all the sparing mercies and sweetning cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which gracious Souls thankfully note
in the sharpest trials come from this promise, wherein
the care of God is ingaged for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>4. Divine care is put under the bond of a promise,
for the direction and guidance of all their troubles
and trials to an happy issue, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44184:132"/>
shall work together for good.</hi> From what quarter so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the wind bloweth, God will take care that it
shall be useful to drive you to your Port; the very
Providences that cast you down, by vertue of this
promise prove as serviceable and beneficial as those
that lift you up.</p>
                        <p>5. The care of God stands engaged in the promise
for the help and aid of his people in all the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and exigencies of their lives, <hi>Psal. 46. 1. God is
our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</hi>
Never is the care of God more visible and conspicuous,
than in such times of need.</p>
                        <p>6. Lastly, the care of God is ingaged to carry
his people safe through all the dangers of the way,
and bring them all home to glory at last, <hi>Ioh. 10.
28. I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my
hand.</hi> This care of God thus engaged for you is
your convoy to acompany and secure you till it see
you safe into your harbour of eternal rest.</p>
                        <p>2. You have heard how the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the delights of this life. Sit down Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in this Chamber also, and make but such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
upon the care of thy God as follow, and

and delights can give thee such an other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                        <p>1. Reflect upon the constant, sweet, and suitable
provisions that from time to time have been prepared
for thee and thine, by this care of thy God; From
whence soever thy wants did come, I am sure from
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44184:132"/>
hence came thy supplies, it hath enabled thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the same answer the disciples did to that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Luke 22. 35. Lacked ye any thing, and they said
nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Reflect with admiration upon the various diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of your lives, wherein your thoughts have
been entangled, and out of which you have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated
and delivered by the care of God over you:
How oft have your thoughts been like a ravelled
skeyn of silk, so entangled and perplexed with the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and fears before you, that you could find no end,
but the longer you thought, the more you were
puzled, till you have left thinking, and fell to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and there you have found the right end to wind
up all your thoughts upon the bottom of peace and
sweet contentment, according to that direction, <hi>Psal.
37. 5. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in
him, and he shall bring it to pass.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Observe with a melting heart how the care of
thy God hath disposed and directed thy way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen
advantages; had he not ordered thy steps
when, and as he did, thou hadst not been in possession
of those Temporal and Spiritual mercies that sweeten
thy life at this day. Surely the steps of good men are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Lord; and as for thee Christian, what
reason hast thou with an heart overflowing with love
and thankfulness to look up and say, <hi>My father thou
art the guide of my youth?</hi> It is sweet to live by faith
upon Divine care. Oh what a Serene life might we
live, careful for nothing, but making known our
request unto God in every thing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. casting
all our care on him that careth for us, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 5. 7.
perplexing our thoughts about nothing, but rolling
every burthen upon godly Faith. Thus lived holy
<hi>Musculus</hi> when reduced to extreme poverty, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44184:133"/>
danger at the same time; then it was that he solaced
his Soul with that comfortable <hi>Distich,</hi> a good lesson
for others,
<q>
                              <l>Est Deus in coelis, qui providus omnia curat,</l>

                           </q>
The Provident care of his heavenly father, made
his heart as quiet as the child at the breast Christian,
thou knowest not what distressful days are coming
upon the earth, nor what personal trials shall befal thee
in this world; but I advise thee as thou valuest the
tranquility and comfort of thy life: Shut up thy self
by Faith in this Chamber of Divine Care, it is thy
best security in this world: Reflect frequently and
thankfully upon the manifold supports, supplies, and
salvations thou hast already had from this fountain of
mercies, and be not discouraged at new difficulties.
When an eminent Christian was told of some that
way-laid him to destroy him; his answer was, <hi>Si
Deus mei curam non habet, quid vivo?</hi> In like
manner thou mayest say, if God had not taken care
for thee, how couldst thou have lived till now? How
couldest thou have overlived so many troubles, fears,
and dangers as thou hast done?</p>

Of this room it may be said as it was of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s royal

love.</hi> In this Attribute the glory of God is signally

this foundation the hopes and comforts of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers

In this Attribute Gods people by Faith entrench
themselves, and of it a Believer saith, <hi>Hic murus

in the day of trouble, and well may we so esteem and
reckon it, if we consider,</p>
                        <p>1. That wherever the special love of God goes,
there the special presence of God goes also, <hi>Iohn 14.
23. He shall be loved of my father, and we will come
unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And O
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44184:134"/>
how secure and safe must those be (however times
govern) with whom God himself maketh his abode!
For as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psal. 91. 1. He that
dwells in the secret place of the most high, shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty.</hi> And he that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed
by an Almighty power, needs not fear how
many mighty enemies combine against him.</p>
                        <p>2. Wherever the special love of God is placed, that
person becomes precious and highly valuable in the
eyes of God; he appretiates and estimates such a man
as his peculiar treasure, which naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
draws and spreads the wing of Divine care
over him for his protection, <hi>Deuteron. 33. 12.
The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him, and
the Lord shall cover him all the day long.</hi> Things
of greatest value are always kept in safest cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody.</p>
                        <p>3. Upon whosoever the special love of God is se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,
there all events and issues of troubles are sure to be
over ruled to the eternal advantage of that Soul,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. Which consideration alone is sufficient
to unsting all the troubles in the world, and make
the beloved of the Lord shout and triumph in the midst
of tribulations.</p>
                        <p>But let us enter yet further into this glorious
Chamber of Divine love, and more particularly
view the admirable properties thereof, though when
all is done, it will be found a love passing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
our thoughts may admire, but can never
measure it.</p>
                        <p>1. And first you will find it an ancient love, whose
spring is in eternity it self. Believer, God is thine
ancient friend, who foresaw and loved thee, before
thou, yea, before this world was in being; the fruits
and effects thereof thou gatherest in time, but the root
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44184:134"/>
that produces them was before all times, <hi>Prov. 8. 22,
23. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,
before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting,
from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> Thus
was the love of God contriving, and providing the
best of mercies in Christ for us; while as yet there
were no such creatures in the world, nor a world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to receive us.</p>
                        <p>2 The love of God to his people is a free, and
altogether undeserved love; it must needs be so see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it prevented our very being, which had it not
done, yet no motives had been found in us, to allure
it to us more than others, <hi>Deut. 7. 7. The Lord did
not set his love upon you, nor chuse you, because ye were
more in number than any people, (for ye were the
fewest of all people) but because the Lord loved you.</hi>
So that we cannot find one stone of our own merit
in the foundation of this love; for those whom it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth
in its arms are, <hi>Immerentes, &amp; malè meren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
ill deserving as well as undeserving, we were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of God, before we were lovely in our selves; it is
freely pitched upon us, not purchased by us, <hi>Isa.</hi>
43. 24.</p>
                        <p>3. The love of God to Believers is a bountiful
love, streaming forth continually mercies both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
and invaluable to their Souls and Bodies,
<hi>2 Pet.</hi> 1. 3. Christian, it would quickly weary thine
arm, yea, let me say the arm of an <hi>Angel;</hi> but to
write down the thousandth part of the mercies which
have already flowed out of this precious fountain to
thee; though all thou hast received, or shalt receive
in this world, are but the beginnings of mercy, and
first-fruits of the love of God to thee; 'tis the love of
God which daily loads thee with benefits, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19. And if thou art daily loaded
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44184:135"/>
with mercies, what an heap of mercies will the mercies
of thy whole life be.</p>
                        <p>4. The love of God to believers is a distinguishing
love, not the portion of all, no, nor yet of many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
thee, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 1. 26. The generality of the world
dwell in the Room of common Providence, not in
the Chamber of special love into which God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thee; this consideration should make thee break
out in admiration, as it is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 22. Lord, how
is it that thou wilt manifest thy self to me, and not to
the world.</p>
                        <p>5. The love of God to believers, is a love tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
to all creature love, it moves in an higher
Sphere than the love of any creature doth, <hi>Rom. 5.
6, 7, 8.</hi> We read of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s love to <hi>Rachel,</hi> which is
so celebrated in the Sacred story for the fervour of it,
and yet all that it enabled him to suffer was but the
Summers heat and the Winters cold; a trifle to what
the love of Christ engaged, and enabled him to suffer
for thy sake. We read also of the love of <hi>David</hi> to
<hi>Absalom</hi> which made him wish, would God I had
died for thee, <hi>O Absalom,</hi> my son, my son. This
love was only manifested in a wish, which haply might
have been retracted too, had there been an exchange
to be made indeed; but the life of Christ, wort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
millions of his life, was actually and willingly staked
down for thy Soul. We read of the love of one
Disciple manifested to another Disciple in a cup of
cold water; but Christ hath manifested his love to
thee in pouring out his warmest heart bloud for thy
redemption. Oh what a transcendent love is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
love!</p>
                        <p>6. To conclude, (though alas little is said of the
love of God,) it is an everlasting and unchangeable
love. Hills and moutains shall sooner start from their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44184:135"/>
                           <hi>Bases,</hi> than his loving kindness depart from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 10. Though he afflict us, still he loves
us, <hi>Psal 89. 32, 33.</hi> Nay, though we grieve him,
yet still he loves us, <hi>Mark 16. 7. Tell the Disciples,
and tell</hi> Peter. <hi>Peter</hi> had grieved Christ, denied
Christ, yet will he not renounce nor cast off <hi>Peter.</hi>

                        <p>WEll then, if God have opened to your Souls
such a Chamber of love, where your Souls
may be ravished with daily delights, as well as secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from danger and ruine: O that you would enter
into it by Faith, and dwell for ever in the love of
God! I mean, clear up your interest in it, and then
solace your Souls in the delights of it. Need I to use
an Argument, or spend one Motive to press you to
enter into such an Heaven upon Earth? If the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thy heart doth need it, take into consideration,
Reader, these few that follow.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Motive.</hi> Ponder with thy self how sad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
the case will be with thee in the days of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and distress, if the love of God shall then be
clouded to thy Soul; in those days such as love thee
will either be absent from thee, or impotent to help
thee, all thy friends and familiars may be removed
far off, and whither then wilt thou turn should God
be far off too? This was that evil which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> so
vehemently deprecated, <hi>Chap. 17. v. 17. Be not a
terrour unto me, thou art my hope in the day of evil.
q. d.</hi> O Lord my Soul depends upon refreshment,
and comfort from thee, when all the springs of earthly
comfort are dried up. Shouldest thou be a te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rour
to me in the day of evil, it will be the most terrible
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44184:136"/>
disappointment that ever befel my Soul; if thou be
kind, I care not who be cruel if I have the love of
God, I value not the hatred of men; but if God be
a terrour, who or what can be a comforter? The love
of God is the alone refuge to which the gracious Soul
retreats upon all creature disappointments, and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
This therefore is the main thing to be feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evil day.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Mot.</hi> The knowledge and assurance of the love
of God is a mercy attainable by a gracious Soul, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the imperfections of Grace. <hi>Peter</hi> had
his falls and failings as well as other Christians,
yet when Christ puts the question home to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
21. 15. Simon <hi>son of</hi> Jonas <hi>lovest thou me more than
these,</hi> he was able to return a clear positive answer;
<hi>Yea, Lord thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> Study thy
heart Christian, and study the Scriptures; if thou
canst find the sincere love of God in thy heart, that
Scripture will clear the love of God to thy Soul, 1
<hi>Iohn 4. 19. We love him because he first loved us.</hi> If
thou lay thine hand upon a stone wall, and feel it
warm, thou mayest conclude the Sun beams have
shone upon it; for warmth is not naturally in dead
stones. Our love to God is but the reflex beam of
his love to us, and we know there can be no reflex
without a direct beam. Thousands of Christians do
at this day actually possess the ravishing sense of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
love, whose fears and complaints have been the
same that thine now are; that God who indulged this
favour to them, can do as much for thee.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Mot.</hi> Think how well thou wilt be provided
for the worst and difficultest times, when the love of
of God shall be well secured to thy Soul; when the
love of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the sense of his love is once shed
abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, which for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44184:136"/>
that end, among others, is given unto us, we shall
then be able to glory in tribulation, <hi>Rom. 5. 3, 5.</hi>
We may then bid defiance to all the adverse powers
of hell, and earth, and say, Now do your worst:
we are out of your reach, and above all your terrors
and affrights. Be advised then to sit close to this
work: clear but this point once, and the worst is
past. O lye at the feet of God night and day, give
him no rest, take no denial from him, fill thy mouth
with pleas and arguments; tell him, Lord, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Corn nor Wine that I seek thee, but only for
thy love; bestow thy other gifts upon whom thou
wilt, only seal up thy love to my soul.</p>
                        <p>And Lastly, I advise thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
careful, when God admits thee into the sense of
his love, to shut the door behind thee, lest thy soul
be soon expelled thence, by the subtlety of Satan,
who envies nothing more, than such an happiness as
this: that envious Spirit totally despairs of the least
drop of such a mercy, and therefore swells with envy
at thine enjoyment of it; but if ever thou fasten thy
hand of faith upon this mercy, loose not thy hold
by every objection with which he will rap thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                        <p>1. If he object the many sharp afflictions, and
manifold rods of God upon thee, call not the Love
of God in question for that; but remember what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he saith, <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Whom the Lord loveth, he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</hi>
Fatherly Corrections are so far from being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the love of God, that his love is rather
questionable without them, than for them; they
are love tokens, not marks of hatred.</p>
                        <p>2. Yield not up thy claim and title to the love of
God, because he sometimes hides away his face
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44184:137"/>
from thee; thou knowest the sun is up, and going
on in its regular course, in the darkest and closest day.
<hi>My God, my God,</hi> saith Christ himself, <hi>Why hast
thou forsaken me?</hi> believe he is still thy God, and
his love immutable, when the sense and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof do fail.</p>
                        <p>3. Call not the Love of God into question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of thy great vileness and unworthiness; say
not when thou most loathest thy self, God must needs
loath thee too; he can love where thou loathest.
<hi>Return, return,</hi> O Shulamite, <hi>return, return, that
we may look upon thee: what will ye see in the</hi> Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite?
<hi>as it were the company of two armies.</hi> The
Spouse was exceeding beautiful in the eyes of others,
when most base and vile in her own: What would

me, at the best, but Conflicts, and Wars, betwixt
Grace and Corruption, as it were betwixt two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
                        <p>4. Quit not thy claim to the Love of God, because
he seems to shut out thy Prayers, and delays to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the long continued desires and importunities of
thy soul in some cases. <hi>David</hi> would neither cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
his God, no nor call in question his interest in
him, because of such a delay and silence, <hi>Psal. 22. 1, 2.
My God, my God.</hi> The claim is doubled, <hi>ver. 1.</hi> and
yet in the next breath he saith, <hi>I cry in the day time,
but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am
not silent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus I have offered you some advice and assistance,
how to secure your selves in these Divine Attributes,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Power, Wisdom, Faithfulness, Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableness,
Care, and Love of God, as in so many
Sanctuaries, and comfortable Refuges in the days
of Common Calamity. It is noted even of the

                           <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when the storm of Hail was coming upon

servants and his cattle flee into the houses.</hi> Let not an

of their Souls. Stormy days are coming, God
hath provided you a Refuge, and given you season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Praemonitions, and Calls from Heaven, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
into them, before Desolations come. The Lord
help us to hear his Calls, and comply with them,
which will be as much our Priviledge, as it is our
Duty. And so much of the <hi>Fifth Proposition,</hi> viz.
That God's Attributes, Promises, and Providences,
are prepared for the security of his people in the
greatest distresses that befal them in the world.</p>

                        <p>THis <hi>Proposition</hi> describes and clears the qualified
subject of this Priviledge. God's own People,
and none but such can warrantably claim special
protection in evil times, and this is consonant to the
current account of Scripture, <hi>Isa. 3. 10, 11. Say ye
unto the righteous, it shall be well with him. Wo to
the wicked, it shall be ill with him.</hi> He speaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44184:138"/>
the day of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s ruin, and <hi>Iudah</hi>'s fall,
as appears, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> So great a difference will God
make even in this world, betwixt the righteous, and
the wicked. In <hi>Nah. 1.</hi> you have also a terrible day
described, wherein <hi>Bashan, Carmel,</hi> and <hi>Lebanon,</hi>
the most pleasant and fruitful places of the land shall
languish. <hi>ver. 4.</hi> The mountains shall quake, the
hills melt, the earth, and those that dwell therein
burnt up. <hi>ver. 5.</hi> The indignation and fury of God
poured out like fire. <hi>v. 6.</hi> The priviledged people in this
terrible day are God's own people, they only are taken
into security. <hi>ver. 7.</hi> The Lord is good, a strong
hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them
that trust in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> he so knoweth them, as to care
and provide for them in that evil day, and so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Scripture, you shall find the Promises
of protection still made to the people of God. When
the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, like a devouring fire, was ready to
seize upon the Land, the sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> were afraid,
fearfulness surprised the hypocrites, for who among
us (say they) shall dwell with devouring fire, and
everlasting burning. Yes, saith God, some there
are that shall abide that day, <hi>viz. He that walketh
righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he shall dwell on
high, his place of defence shall be the munition of
rocks. i. e.</hi> God will be a sanctuary to them, when
others shall be as stubble before the flames, <hi>Isa. 33.
14, 15, 16.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But for the right stating of this Proposition, three
things must be heedfully adverted.</p>
                        <p>1. That all good men are not always exempted
from the stroke of outward Calamities; in that sense
the righteous may perish, and merciful men be taken
away, yea, they may perish in love, and be taken
away in mercy from the evil to come, <hi>Isa. 57. 1. 2.
Mica. 7. 1, 2.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="261" facs="tcp:44184:138"/>
2. That all wicked men are not all always exposed
to external miseries, but <hi>a just man may perish in his
righteousness, and a wicked man prolong his life in his
wickedness,</hi> Eccles. 7. 15.</p>
                        <p>3. But in this sense, we are to understand the
Proposition, That none, but the people of God, have
right, by promise, to his special protections in evil
days, and that all such shall either be preserved from
the stroke of calamities, or from the deadly sting,
namely Eternal Ruin, by them; though they should
fall by the hands of enemies, yet they die, as <hi>Iosiah</hi>
did, in peace, <hi>2 King. 22. 19, 20.</hi> If they be taken
away, it is but out of the way of greater mischiefs;
death doth but lay the Saints in their beds of rest,
when it hurries away others into everlasting miseries:
if they be not excused from troubles, yet their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are sure to be sanctified to their eternal good,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And the Lord will be with them in their
troubles, <hi>Psal. 91. 15. Isa.</hi> 41. 10.</p>
                        <p>Two things remain to be considered, before we
finish this last Proposition: <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Who the People of God are?</item>
                              <item>2. Why this Priviledge is peculiar to them?</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Who are the People of God? The Scripture
describes them two ways; Negatively, and Positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Negatively, in opposition to those who are not
the people of God, but are (1.) the servants of sin,
obeying it in the lust of it, which the people of God
neither are, nor dare to do, <hi>Rom. 6. 11, 12. &amp;c.</hi>
(2.) The men of this world, who have the portion
in this life, savouring, and minding the things of the
world only, whereas the people of God are called
out of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 16. and principally
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44184:139"/>
study, and labour after the higher concernments of
the world to come, <hi>Rom. 8. 5. (3.)</hi> The vassals of
Satan doing his lust, and in subjection to his power,
<hi>Acts 26. 18. Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. from which bondage the
people of God are made free. (4.) Nor yet are
they their own, living wholly to themselves, and
seeking only their own ends, as others do, <hi>1 Cor. 6.
19, 20.</hi> These, all these are not the people of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God will not own them for such; they but deceive
themselves in thinking, and calling themselves so:
but then <hi>Positively.</hi> They are (1.) a people regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and born again, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 13. Their regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gives them both the essence and denomination
of the people of God: it is as impossible to be the
children of God, without regeneration, as it is to be
the children of men without generation. (2.) They
are a people in covenant with God, <hi>Ezek. 16. 8. I
entered into a covenant with thee, and thou becamest
mine.</hi> For in this Covenant they give themselves to
the Lord, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 8. 5. They avouch the Lord to be
their God, and make over themselves to him to be
his people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. devoting unto God all that
they are, their souls, and bodies, with every faculty
and member inclusively, <hi>Rom. 12. 1. Luk.</hi> 10. 27.
All that they have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. all is dedicated,
and devoted to the Lords use and service, and these only
are the people of God.</p>
                        <p>2. The last thing to be cleared is, Why the people
of God, and none beside them, have this peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of an hiding place in the day of trouble; and
the grounds of it are:</p>
                        <p>1. Because they only have special interest in God,
and propriety is the ground on which they claim
and expect protection, I am thine, save me, <hi>Ps. 119. 94</hi>
Upon this very ground it was, that <hi>David</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44184:139"/>
himself in one of his greatest plunges, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
of his whole life, <hi>1 Sam. 30. 6. But</hi> David
<hi>encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The people of God only are at peace with
God; and where there is no peace, there can be no
protection: the Harbours and Garrisons of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
never receive into their Protection, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of another Kingdom, that are in open Hostility
against them. Now there is open War betwixt God,
and the wicked, <hi>Psal. 7. 11. Zech.</hi> 11. 8. Till they
have peace with God, they can claim no protection
from God.</p>
                        <p>3. The promises of protection are made only to
Gods people, and where there is no promise, there
can be no warrantably claim to protection, <hi>2 Cor. 1. 20.
2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Common providence may shelter them
for a time, but the Saints only have the keys of the
promises which open the Chambers, or Attributes of
God, to them.</p>
                        <p>4. None but the people of God walk in the ways
of God, and none but those that walk in his way
can groundedly expect his protection; for so runs
the promise, <hi>2 Chron. 15. 2. I am with you, whilest
you are with me. i. e.</hi> I am with you, by way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
Direction, Supportation, and Salvation:
whilest you are with me in the duties of Obedience,
and exercises of your Graces, see that you love, fear,
and obey me; and then depend upon it, I will look
after, and take care of you.</p>
                        <p>5. To conclude, The people of God only flee
to God for sanctuary, and cast themselves upon him
for protection, <hi>Psal. 56. 3. At what time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee, Psal. 18. 2. The Lord is my rock,
and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my
strength, in whom I will trust, my buckler, and the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44184:140"/>
horn of my salvation, and my high-tower.</hi> This
their confidence in God, and reliance upon him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
him to protect them in their dangers, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 3.
All others put themselves out of God protection, by
making flesh their arm, and so giving the honour of
God to the creature, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5. And thus much for
clearing this last Proposition also. All that remains,
will be dispatched in brief and close Application of
the Point thus opened and confirmed.</p>

                           <hi>Consect.</hi> 1. FRom the whole of this Discourse, we
may be informed, <hi>What a miserable,
and shiftless People all those will be, in times of trouble,
who have no special interest in God or the Promises.</hi>
Sad and lamentable was the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> as it is by
himself expressed, <hi>1 Sam. 28. 15. I am sore distressed,
for the</hi> Philistines <hi>make war against me, and God is
departed from me, and answereth me no more.</hi> It is
a wonderful, and unaccountable thing, how carnal
men and women subsist, and bear up, when their
earthly props, and hopes, sink under, and fail them;
so long as any creature-comfort is left, thither they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44184:140"/>
will retreat, for relief, and succour; but if all fail, as
quickly they may, Whither will they turn for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
having not a God, nor a Promise to flee to?
which the people of God can do, when all things
else fail them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 17. Their different conditions
in the day of trouble, is clearly expressed in <hi>Zeph. 2.
3, 4. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth,
which have wrought his judgment, seek righteousness,
seek meekness, it may be ye shall be hid in the day of
the Lords anger.</hi> There is Gods <hi>may be,</hi> which is
better security than mans <hi>shall be,</hi> for their temporal
deliverance; But what shall become of others, that
have no refuge, but in the creature? Why, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and shiftlessness of their condition, follows in the
next words; Gaza <hi>shall be forsaken, and</hi> Ashkelon <hi>a
desolation, they shall drive out</hi> Ashdod <hi>at noon-day,
and</hi> Ekron <hi>shall be rooted up. i. e.</hi> All their earthly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
shall fail them; their strong hold shall not
secure them, they shall find no shelter in the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat of the day of trouble. <hi>Moab, Ashdod,</hi> and
<hi>Ekron,</hi> have no more benefit, by the Promises made
to <hi>Sion,</hi> than the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> can claim by
the Charter of <hi>London.</hi> If a wicked or hypocritical
person cry to God in his distress, he will not hear him,
<hi>Prov. 1. 25, 26. Iob</hi> 27. 9. but will bid him go to
his earthly refuges, which he hath chosen; if he go
to the promises, knock at those doors of hope, they
cannot relieve him, being all made in Christ to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
if to the Name and Attributes of God, all
the dores are shut against them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 16. There
are Seven dreadful Aggravations of a wicked man's
troubles; (1) When troubles come upon him, the
Curse of God follows him into his carnal refuges,
<hi>Ier. 17. 5. Cursed be the man, that trusteth in man,
and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44184:141"/>
from the Lord.</hi> Trouble is the Arrow, and this curse
the venom of the Arrow, which makes the Wound
incurable.</p>
                        <p>2. When troubles fall upon him from without,
a guilty conscience will terrifie him from within.
So that the mind can give no relief to the body;
but both sink under their own weights; it is not so
with the people of God, they have inward relief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
outward pressures, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                        <p>3. The gusts and storms of wicked mens troubles
may blow them into Hell, and hurry them into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
destruction: if Death march towards them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pale Horse, hell always follows him, <hi>Rev.</hi>
6. 8.</p>
                        <p>4. If troubles and distresses overwhelm their hearts,
they can give them no vent or ease by prayer, faith
and resignation to God, as his People use to do, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
1. 18.</p>
                        <p>5. When their troubles and distresses come, then
comes the hour, and power of their temptation, and
to shun sorrow they will fall into sin, having no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be kept in the hour of temptation, as the
Saints have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                        <p>6. When their troubles come they will be left
alone in the midst of them; these are their burthens,
and they alone must bear them. Gods gracious,
comfortable supporting presence, is only with his
own people,</p>
                        <p>7. If trouble or death come upon them as a storm,
they have no Anchor of Hope to drop in the Storm,
<hi>The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but
the righteous hath hope in his death, Prov.</hi> 14. 32.
by all which it appears that a Christless person is a
most helpless, and shiftless creature in the day of
trouble.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="267" facs="tcp:44184:141"/>
2. <hi>Consect.</hi> Secondly, Hence it follows, <hi>That
Christians ought not to droop like other men in the
day of trouble.</hi> A Wicked mans boldness, and a
Christians cowardliness in times of affliction, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ungrounded and uncomly; Why should thy heart
Christian despond and sink at this rate, upon the
prospect of approaching troubles? Are there not
safe and comfortable Chambers taken up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for thee against that day? Is not the name of
the Lord a strong Tower into which thou mayest
run and be safe? The heart of a good man, saith
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> should at all times be like the higher
Heavens, serene, tranquil and clear, whatever Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Lightnings, Storms and Tempests, trouble
and terrifie the lower World. If a man have a
good Roof over his head, where he can sit dry and
warm, what need he trouble himself, to hear the
Winds roar, the Lightnings flash, and the Rains pour
down without doors? Why, this is thy priviledge,
Christian, <hi>A man</hi> (to wit, the man Christ Jesus)
<hi>shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
from the tempest: as rivers of water in a dry
place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land,</hi>
Isa. 32. 2. Art thou in Christ and in the Covenant,
give me then one good reason for thy dejections in
a day of trouble, or if thou hast none to give, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to these Reasons against it.</p>
                        <p>1. If thou be in Christ, thy Sins are forgiven
thee, and why should not a pardoned Soul he a
chearful Soul in adversity? Afflictions may buz and
hum about thee, like Bees that have lost their Sting,
but they can never hurt thee.</p>
                        <p>2. If thou be in Christ, thy God is with thee in
all thy troubles, and how can thy heart sink or faint
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44184:142"/>
in such a presence? Let them that are alone in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
fail under them, but don't thou do so, that art
surrounded with Almighty Power, Grace and Love,
<hi>Isa. 43. 1, 2.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. If thou be in Christ, thy greatest afflictions
shall prove thy best Friends and Benefactors, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 28. Sure then, thou art more afraid than hurt,
thou mistakest thy best Friends, for thy worst Enemies;
thou and thy Afflictions shall part more comfortably
than you met.</p>
                        <p>4. If thou be in Christ, thy Treasure is safe, thy
eternal happiness is out of the reach of all thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>Luk. 12. 4. Luk.</hi> 10. 42. And if that be safe thou
hast no cause to be sad; to droop, and tremble at the
hazard of earthly comforts, whilest heavenly and
eternal things are safe, is as if a man that had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Pardon from the King, and had it safe in his
Bosom, should be found weeping upon the way
home, because he hath lost his Staff or Glove. These
reasons are strong against the dejections of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under outward troubles; but yet I am sensible
that all the reasoning in the world will not prevent
their dejections, except they will take pains to clear
up their Interest in God against such a day, <hi>Psal.</hi>
18. 2. and will act their faith, by way of adherence
and dependance upon God in the want of former
light and evidence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10. And lastly, that
they keep their consciences pure and inviolate,
which will be a spring of comfort in the midst of
troubles, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Consect.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>It hence appears to be the
greatest folly, and vanity in the world to make any
thing but God, our refuge in the day of trouble.</hi> This
practice as you heard but now, is under Gods curse,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44184:142"/>
and that which is cursed of God, can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to us. It is an honour peculiar to God, the
right of Heaven, and therefore cursed Sacriledge to
bestow it on the Creature. We read of some that
make lies their refuge, and hide themselves under
Falshood, thinking when the overflowing Scourge
comes it shall not come nigh unto them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15.
They will trust to their wits and policies, they will
fawn and flatter, lye and dissemble, cast themselves
into a thousand shapes and forms to save themselves;
but all in vain, the Flood shall sweep away their
refuge of lyes. Others make Riches their trust and
confidence, <hi>Prov. 10. 15. The rich mans wealth is
his strong city.</hi> If Enemies come their money shall
be their ransom; but oh, what a poor refuge will
this be? It may betray but cannot secure them,
<hi>Behold, saith God, I will stir up the</hi> Medes <hi>against
them, which shall not regard silver, and as for gold,
they shall not delight in it,</hi> Isa. 13. 17. Riches profit
not in the day of wrath, <hi>Prov. 11. 4. Iob</hi> blessed
God in the day of his adversity, that he had not
made Gold his Hope, or the fine Gold his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>Iob</hi> 31. 24. Bless not thou thy self that thou
hast such things to bestow thy hope and trust upon.
Others make Men their Refuge, especially great
and powerful Men, but to how little purpose is it!
<hi>Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man,
in whom there is no help,</hi> Psal. 146. 3, 4. They
cannot keep their Crowns upon their Heads, no,
nor their Heads upon their Shoulders, the greatest
Men are but Dust, and what can Dust do to Dust?
Three things aggravate their misery, who misplace
their Confidence by bestowing it on any Creature.
1. That Creature will certainly deceive them,
men are deceitful men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 9. Riches are
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44184:143"/>
deceitful, riches, <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17. Every thing you
lean on, beside God, will start aside, like a deceitful
bow, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 57. (2.) The disappointment of
your hopes from the creature, will enflame your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and greatly aggravate your sorrow, <hi>2 King.</hi>
18. 21. The broken reeds of <hi>Egypt</hi> will not only
fail, but pierce you. (3.) In a word, God will take
none into his protection, who make any thing besides
himself their hope and confidence; if we fly from
God to the creature, God will say to the creature,
thou shalt go, except I have thy dependence, thou
shalt never have my protection; where I have no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
thou shalt have no comfort.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Consect.</hi> Fourthly, The former discourse,
yields us also this comfortable conclusion, <hi>That what
ever confusions, desolations, and troubles be in the
earth, the Church and People of God can never be
wholly exterminated, and destroyed, seeing such a secure
refuge is prepared for them of God,</hi> Psal. 102. 28.
<hi>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their
seed shall be established before thee.</hi> Which is assigned
as the true reason of its perpetuity and safety,
<hi>Psal. 48. 3. God is known in her palaces, for a refuge.</hi>
The Church's Enemies have tried the utmost of their
policies and powers in all Ages against it, but to no
purpose: whilest they have been plotting and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting,
the preserved Remnant have been singing
their Song upon <hi>Alamoth,</hi> even praises to their great
preserver; though they have no external visible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
yet are they as safe, as salvation it self can
make them, <hi>for salvation will God appoint for walls
and bulwarks,</hi> Isa. 26. 1, 2. Four things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
remarkable in the Churches preservation:
(1.) No people were ever so fiercely opposed by the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44184:143"/>
powers of this world, <hi>The Kings of the earth have
set themselves, and the Rulers have taken counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
Psal. 2. 2. All methods and artifices have
been tryed, sometimes to jeer and scoff them out of
the Religion: so did the Apostate <hi>Iulian,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by cruel tortures, to affright them from their
Religion; the variety and more than barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity,
whereof the Church Histories give us a
sad and amazing account. (2.) Under these cruel
Persecutions, they have seemed to be utterly lost, to
the eye of sence and reason; <hi>I am left alone,</hi> said
<hi>Elijah, and they seek my life,</hi> 1 King. 19. 10. <hi>By
whom, Lord, shall</hi> Jacob <hi>arise, said</hi> Amos, <hi>for he is
very small?</hi> Amos 7. 2. (3.) Notwithstanding all
which, the Church hath overlived all its dangers; it
is the true <hi>Phoenix,</hi> which hath outlived the Deluge.
(4.) Such deliverances are proper and peculiar to
the Church alone: no people, besides the people of
God, have such salvations upon record. The great
and famous Monarchies of the world, have dashed
one another to pieces, like earthen Potsheards

                        <p>5. <hi>Consect.</hi> Fifthly, to conclude: If this be so,
<hi>then it is a deep and dangerous policy of Satan, to shut
up our refuge in God against us, as much as may be in
times of trouble.</hi> Satan, like a cunning Fowler, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs
of getting the birds in his net, except he can
beat them out of their coverts; it is therefore his
great Design, to estrange and alienate the Saints
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44184:144"/>
from their God, as much as he can, thereby to cut
off their retreat to him in times of trouble; a mischief
which the people of God have always vehemently
deprecated, <hi>Psal. 102. 2. Ier.</hi> 17. 17. And O that
we would be ware of it! and shun this mischief, by
our seasonable preventing watchfulness. There are,
among others, Three special Projects of Satan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he manages this mischievous design against the
people of God.</p>
                        <p>1. By drawing their Consciences under guilt, on
purpose to destroy the liberty, freedom, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
confidence of their souls, in their addresses to God.
This, if any thing in the world, will do it, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.
14, 15. What a loss will that poor soul be at, in times
of trouble, whose grumbling and condemning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will not suffer him to look up chearfully and
believingly in the face of its God, and Father,

grace?</p>
                        <p>2. By prevailing with them to neglect and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the course of their daily duties, and thereby to
let down their communion with God, and in a great
measure lose their acquaintance with him. This is
a dangerous policy of the Devil, and an unspeakable
prejudice to the soul: Oh Christian, take heed of a
lazy sloathful spirit, or a vain and earthly heart,
which will easily suffer the duties of Religion to be
jostled aside, and put by for every trivial occasion;
especially beware of slight, formal, superficial,
and dead-hearted performances of duty, which is
little better than the intermission of them, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
prevent the scandal, but can never give thee the
comfort of Religion.</p>
                        <p>3. By beclouding their interest in God, and
darkening their titles and evidences, by thick clouds.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44184:144"/>
of doubts and fears. This is the sad case of many a
poor Christian, in a day of trouble, with out-fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with in-fears. Brethren, I beseech you, think
often what those things are, which usually put men
into such frights and streights, when eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
stare them in the face, what it is that daunts and
damps the hearts of Christians at such times; and as
you value the peace and freedom of your souls with
God, give not matter for your consciences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you with mis-spent time, indulged sins, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
duties, formality or hypocrisie in duties, sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and by-ends in your transactions with God or
man: preserve the purity and peace of your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
as you would preserve your two eyes; if by
such wiles the Devil cannot bar you from your God,
or shut up your refuge in him, your outward troubles
can do you no hurt.</p>

                        <p>1. Betake your selves to God by fervent Prayer

Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> did of his, <hi>Non sunt ista litigandi, sed oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di

briefly offer a little Direction here: <hi>viz.</hi>

                              <head>of Prayer.</head>

                              <item>2. As to the manner</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. As to the matter of Prayer, I mean such as the
state and condition of the times, now more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
suggests.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Unite your Prayers, and cry mightily to the
Lord, that if it be his good pleasure, this cup of
wrath which seems to be mingled and prepared, may
pass from his people. Now cry to God, as they are
directed to do, <hi>Ioel 2. 17. Spare thy people, O Lord,
and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
should rule over them: wherefore should they say
among the people, Where is their God?</hi> O pray, That
<hi>England</hi> may not be delivered into the hands of
blood-thirsty <hi>Papists,</hi> that the golden Candlestick
may not be removed, that Idolatry may not return
into those places where God hath been so sweetly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped;
that a Land so peculiarly blessed with
Gospel-Light, wherein so many thousand sons, and
daughters, have been born to God, may not at last
become an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a great Shambles, to quarter
out the Limbs of his dear Saints; that the pleasant
Plant of Reformation, planted with his own right
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44184:146"/>
hand, and watered with so many tears, yea with so
much blood, may not at last be rooted up by the wild
Boar out of the Forrest!</p>
                        <p>(2.) Pray indesinently, That you may be kept
from the sins and temptations of the times. O watch
and pray, that you enter not into temptation; if you
cannot prevail with God, to turn away his anger,
yet be importunate with him, that you may be kept
from sin, that if you lose your outward peace, you
may be able to keep inward peace, that you may
never sacrifice your consciences, to save your flesh,
that you may never fall under the displeasure of
God, to avoid the rage of men. Ah friends, we
little think what a fearful havock an hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will make in such a professing Nation as this is;
then shall many be offended, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 10. O
pray, that you may never give offence to others by
scandal, or take offence your selves at the ways of
God, whatever sufferings and sharp tryals shall
come.</p>
                        <p>(3.) Pray earnestly for the sanctification of all
your troubles, to your eternal good; an unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
comfort never did any man good, and a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
trouble never did any man hurt; be more earnest
therefore with God, rather to have your troubles
sanctified, than prevented; to get the blessing,
than to avoid the smart of them; if they cannot be
turned away from you, pray they may be turned to
your salvation.</p>
                        <p>2. Betake your selves to God your refuge by Faith,
resigning and committing all into his hands, <hi>Now
the just shall live by faith, Heb.</hi> 10. 38. The more
you can trust God, the more you secure your selves
from danger; he that can live by <hi>Faith,</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44184:146"/>
die by <hi>Fear,</hi> and be sure to inform your selves
well in two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. What it is to trust God over all.</item>
                              <item>2. What grounds you have so to do.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Be well instructed in the Nature of this duty, there
are six things imported in such acts of Resignation.</p>
                        <p>1. An awakened sense of our dangers and hazards.
<hi>At what time I am afraid I will trust in thee, Psal.</hi> 56. 3. Suffering times are resigning times, <hi>1 Pet. 4.
19. Let them that suffer according to the will of God,
commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing;
as unto a faithful creator.</hi> And the greater and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
our dangers are, the more frequent and vigorous
should the actings of our faith this way be; Be not
far from me, for trouble is near.</p>
                        <p>2. Resignation to God necessarily implies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
and disclaiming of all other refuges.
Ashur <hi>shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses
neither will we say any more to the work of our hands,
ye are our Gods, for in thee the fatherless findeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Hos.</hi> 14. 3. He that relies upon God, must cease
from Man; resignation to God excludes not the use
of lawful means, but it doth exclude dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
                        <p>3. Resignation to God is always grounded upon
an interest in God, we have no warrant, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to expect protection from him in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
except we can come to him as Children to a
Father: It is the filial relation that gives encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to this fiducial resignation, and the clearer that
relation and interest is, the more bold and confident
those acts of Faith will be, <hi>Psal. 86. 2. Preserve my
soul, for I am holy, O thou my God save thy servant
that trusteth in thee.</hi> And again, <hi>Psal. 119. 94. I
am thine, save me.</hi> I speak not here of the first act
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44184:147"/>
of Faith, which flows not from an interest; but
gives the Soul an interest in God. Nor do I say that
poor doubting and timorous Believers whose interest
in him is dark and dubious, have no warrant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
themselves and their concernments into his hands,
for it is both their right and duty to do it: But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the clearer our interest is, the more facile and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
will those acts be.</p>
                        <p>4. The committing acts of Faith imply a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
and owning of Gods power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
us, be the danger never so imminent, <hi>Psal. 31.
15. My times are in thy hand, deliver me from the
hands of mine enemies, and from them that persecute
me. q. d.</hi> O Lord I am fully satisfied, my life is
not at the dispose of mine enemies, 'tis not in their
hands, but in thine; all the traps and snares they
lay for it shall not shorten one minute of my time, I
know thine hand is fully able to protect me, and
therefore into thine hands I resign my self, and all I
have.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Resignation involves in it an expectation of
help and safety from God, when we see no way of
security from men.</hi> O Lord, <hi>saith</hi> Iehoshaphat, We
have no might nor no strength, neither know we what
to do, but our eyes are unto thee, 2 Chron. 20. 12.
<hi>So</hi> David, Psal. 62. 5, 6. My soul wait thou only
upon God, for my expectation is from him, he only is
my rock and my salvation, he is my defence I shall not
be moved.</p>
                        <p>6. Resignation to God implies the leaving of our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>elves and our concernments with him to be disposed
of according to his good pleasure; the resigning Soul
desires the Lord to do with him what he will, and is
content to take what lot Divine pleasure shall cast for
him, <hi>2 Sam. 15. 25. And the King said unto</hi> Zadok,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44184:147"/>
                           <hi>carry back the Ark of God into the city, if I shall find
favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again
and shew me both it and his habitation; but if he thus
say, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let
him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</hi> And so
much of the Nature of this Duty, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what to do.</p>
                        <p>2. Next let me shew you what encouragements
you that are the people of God, have to this duty, and
they will appear to be great and many.</p>
                        <p>1. The Sovereignty and Absolute Dominion of
God over all Creatures, is a singular encouragement
to commit our selves into his hands and trust him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all, <hi>Psal. 59. 9. Because of his strength will I
wait upon thee, for God is my defence.</hi> If a man were
in danger amidst a great Army of rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Souldiers, and were to put himself under the
protection of any one, it should be the <hi>General</hi>
of that Army, to chuse in such a hand he cannot but
be safe, all the Souldiers being at his beck. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the God into whose hands thou committest thy
self, is Lord General of all the Hosts and Armies in
Heaven and Earth; how safe must thou then be in
his hands?</p>
                        <p>2. The unsearchable and perfect Wisdom of God
is a mighty encouragement to commit our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands, <hi>with him is plenteous redemption, Psal.
130. ult. i. e.</hi> Choice and variety of ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to save his people; we are, but God never is
at a loss to find a door for our escape, <hi>2 Pet. 2. 9.
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
temptation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The infinite tenderness and compassionateness
of our God is a sweet encouragement to resign and
commit our selves and all we have into his hands,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44184:148"/>
his mercy is incomparably tender towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
infinitely beyond whatever any creature felt
stirring in its own bowels towards another that came
out of its bowels, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 15. This compassion of
God engageth the two forementioned Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi>
his Power and Wisdom, for the preservation and relief
of his people: as often as distresses befall them. Yea,</p>
                        <p>4. The very distresses his people are in, do, as it
were, awaken the Almighty power of God for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and rescue; our distresses are not only proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but powerful motives to his saving power, <hi>Deut.
36. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent
himself for his servant, when he seeth that their power
is gone, and there is none shut up or left.</hi> God makes
it an argument to himself and his people, <hi>Plead it
as an argument with him, be not far from me, for
trouble is near, for there is none to help.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. We have already committed greater and
weightier concernments into his hand than the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
interest we have in this World, we have intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our souls with him, <hi>1 Pet. 4. 19. 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 12.
Well therefore may we commit the lesser, who have
intrusted the greater with him; what are our lives,
liberties, estates, and relations, compared with our
Souls, and the eternal safety and happiness of them?</p>
                        <p>6. The committing act of Faith is the great and
only expedient to procure and secure the peace and
tranquillity of our minds, amidst the distractions and
troubles of the present World; the greatest part of
our affliction and trouble in such days, is from the
working of our own thoughts; these torments from
within are worse than any from without; and
the resignation of all to God by Faith is their
best and only cure, <hi>Proverbs 16. 3. Commit thy
works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</hi>
                           <pb n="281" facs="tcp:44184:148"/>
A blessed calmness of mind, a sweet tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and settlement of thoughts follows immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hereupon, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 19. Oh then, leave all with God,
and quietly expect a comfortable issue; and for the
better settlement, and security of thy peace in times
of distraction and trouble, I beseech thee Reader,
carefully to watch and guard against these two evils.</p>

and face of trouble; it is a promise made unto
the righteous, <hi>Psal. 112. 7. He shall not be afraid of
evil tidings, his heart is fixes trusting in the Lord.</hi>
The trusting of God fixes the heart, and the fixing of
the heart, fortifies it against Fear, but I know what
many poor Christians will say in this case, their timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness
and despondency arises not so much from the
greatness of outward evils, as from the darkness and
doubtfulness of their Spiritual and inward condition,
which doubtless in the very truth of the case, which
brings me to the last use of this point.</p>

                        <p>Search and examine your hearts Christians, whether
those graces and qualifications to which God hath
promised protection in evil times may not be found
upon an impartial search in your hearts, amongst
which I will single out three principal ones as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
matters of your self examination, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Uprightness of Heart and Way.</item>
                              <item>2. Humiliation for your own and others sins.</item>
                              <item>3. Righteousness in doing and meekness in
suffering the Will of God.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Uprightness and Integrity of heart and way.
To this qualification belong many sweet promises of
protection, such is that <hi>Prov. 2. 7. He is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly, Psal. 7. 10. My defence
is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</hi> If your
hearts be true to God, these promises shall be truly
performed to you, but beware you deceive not your
selves in so great a point as this is; thy heart cannot
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44184:152"/>
be an upright heart, except 1. it be a renewed
heart; the Natural heart is always a false heart, 'tis
only regeneration that gives the heart a right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and frame; all the duties and labours in the
world can never keep that heart right in its course,
which is not first set right for God by a principle of
renovation. (2.) We cannot judge our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
except uprightness be the setled frame and
standing bent of our hearts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 112, 117.
It is not our integrity in one or two single actions,
but in the general course, and complex frame of
our lives and ways, that will prove our integrity to
God. (3.) Then may we reckon our selves upright,
when the dread and awe of God's all-seeing eye
keeps our hearts and steps from turning aside to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<hi>Gen. 39. 9. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 17. That's a sincere
and upright heart indeed, that finds it self at all times,
and in all places overawed from sin, by the eye of God
upon him. (4.) That man's heart also is upright
with God, who purely aims at and designs the glory
of God, as the scope and end of his life and actions,
who lives not to himself, neither acts ultimately and
principally for himself, but lives to God as a person
dedicated and devoted to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7. (5.) That
heart also is upright with God, which governs it self
and its ways by the directions and rules of the
Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 11, 24, 133. Happy is that
soul that finds such evidences of integrity in it self,
when it is brought to the trial of it at the Bar of the
Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. At the bar of conscience, <hi>2 Cor.
1.</hi> 12. at the bar of afflictions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 87. and
at the bar of strong temptations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. The
eyes of the Lord shall run to and fro through the
whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf
of such whose hearts are thus perfect towards him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="284" facs="tcp:44184:153"/>
2. Another gracious qualification, intitling the
soul to God's special protection in the worst and
most dangerous times, is the true humiliation for our
own and other mens sins; <hi>Go, set a mark,</hi> saith
God, <hi>upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and
cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst
thereof,</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. These that thus mourn, when
others laugh, shall laugh when others mourn. <hi>Lot</hi>
was the only mourner in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and he was the only
person exempted from destruction in the ruine and
overthrow thereof, <hi>2 Pet.</hi> 2. 7. That's a sweet and
blessed priviledge, mentioned in <hi>Isa. 66. 10. Rejoyce
ye with</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and be glad with her all ye that
love her, rejoyce for joy with her, all ye that mourn
for her, that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>reasts of her consolations, that ye may milk out, and
be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</hi> Be
contented, Christians, to bear your part in <hi>Sions</hi>
groans and sorrows, you may live to bear your part
in her triumphs and songs of deliverance; it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the true publickness, and tenderness of
your spirits for present, and as sweet a sign as can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon your souls, That you are reserved for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
days.</p>
                        <p>3. Righteousness in doing, and meekness in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the will of God, is another mark or note, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
and describing those persons whom God
will preserve in the evil day. You have both these
together, in <hi>Zeph. 2. 3. Seek ye the Lord, all ye
the meek of the earth, which have wrought his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
seek righteousness, seek meekness, it may
be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> The
eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
are open unto their Prayers, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 3. 12. If righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
bring you into danger, the righteous God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44184:153"/>
will take care of you in that danger, and bring you
out of it. O 'tis a singular comfort, when a man
can say, it was not my sin, but my duty, that brought
me into trouble; this affliction met me in the path
and way of my duty; 'tis for thy sake, O Lord, that
I am in trouble: as the <hi>Martyr</hi> that held up the Bible
at the stake, saying, <hi>This hath brought me hither.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, Manage all your Sufferings for
Christ, with Christian meekness; as righteousness must
bring you into them, so meekness must carry you
through them: if you avenge your selves, you take
the cause out of God's hand, into your own, but the
meek Christian leaves it to the Lord; and shall never
have cause to repent of his so doing. If thou have
an upright heart with God, a tender and mournful
heart for sin, and thou suffer with meekness, for
righteousness sake, thou art one of these souls to
whom that sweet Voice is directed in my Text,</p>
                        <p>Come, my People, enter thou into thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and shut thy doors about thee; hide thy
self, as it were, for a little moment, until the
indignation be over-past.</p>
