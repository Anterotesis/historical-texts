         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yet there are two specious Arguments which this Remonstrant brings to perswade this desired re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Originall and Confirmation of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</p>
               <p>For the first, he tels your <hi>Honours,</hi> it was <hi>selected out of ancient Models not</hi> ROMAN <hi>but</hi> CHRISTIAN,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63410:7"/>
in it. But it is wholly selected out of pure <hi>Ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> as the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of them all. Whereas alas the originall of it, is published to the world, in that Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt.</p>
               <p>And though here they please to stile the Composers of it, <hi>holy Martyrs, and contrivers of the blessed Reformation:</hi> yet there are <hi>of the Tribe for whom he pleads,</hi> not a few that have called them <hi>Traitors</hi> rather then <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His other Argument for the Liturgie is taken from that <hi>supply of strength, it hath received from the recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of foure most Religious Princes, &amp; your own Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary establishments:</hi>

                  <hi>and more especially from the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of King</hi> Iames <hi>of famous memory:</hi> the validity of which plea, your Honors are best able to judge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we leave it at your Bar; yet these two things we know: first, that this <hi>form</hi> was never <hi>established</hi> to be so <hi>punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed,</hi> so <hi>rigorously pressed,</hi> to the <hi>casting out of all that scruple it, or any thing in it</hi> (as many of his Majesties Subjects now doe) to the (<hi>almost</hi>) justling out of the <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word,</hi> and <hi>Conceived Prayer altogether.</hi>

                  <p>Whether the first reformers of Religion did ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the use of a Liturgie further, then to be an help, in the want, or to the weaknesse of a Minister.</p>
                  <p>All other reformed Churches, though they use Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yet doe not binde their Ministers to the use of them.</p>

                  <p>The Homilies which are appointed to be read, are left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> free either to be read or not, by preaching Ministers, and why not then the Liturgie? especially considering that the ability to offer up the peoples wants to God in prayer is part of the Ministeriall office, as well as preaching. And if it can be thought no lesse than sacriledge, to rob the people of the Ministers gift in preaching, and to tie them to Homilies, it can be no lesse, to deprive them of their gift in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The ground of the first binding of it upon all to use,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> was not to tie godly men from exercising their gift in prayer; but the old popish Priests, that by a seeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our Religion, did through indulgence retaine their places; from returning to the old Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That which makes many refuse to be present at our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Church service, is not only the Liturgie it selfe, but the imposing of it upon Ministers.

               <p>In which words he speakes two things, which deserve just censure. First, that the Hierarchicall Government hath continued for fifteene hundred yeares, therefore should not now be altered, which may well be called, as <hi>Hierome</hi> in another Case; <hi>Argumentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Galeatum, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment calculated for the Meridian of Episcopacy, and may indifferently serve for all Religions in the world:</hi> For thus the Iewes might have pleaded against Christ the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of more then so many hundred years; and thus the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did plead against the Christian Religion, which <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> in his Apology answers.

               </p>
               <p>By your favour Sir, we will tell you notwithstanding the supposed strength of your argumentation, there is one scruple yet remaining, and if you would know upon what ground, it is this, because we finde in Scripture (which by your own Confession is <hi>Originall Authority</hi>) that Bishops and Presbyters were <hi>Originally</hi> the same,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</note> though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they came to be distinguished: and in processe of time, Episcopacy did swallow up all the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery</hi>; as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine did the fat.</p>
               <p>Their Identity is discernable; first, from the same names given unto both; secondly from the same office, designed unto both in Scripture. As for the names, are not the same names given unto both in sacred Writ? Let the fifth, sixth, and seventh verses of the first Chapter to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> testifie: in the fifth verse, the Apostle shews that he left <hi>Titus</hi> in Creet to ordaine Elders in every City: in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63410:13"/>
sixth verse, he gives a delineation of the persons that are capable of such Ordination: and in the seventh, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why the person to be ordained, must be so qualified; <hi>for a Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Bishop and Elder be not here the same, but names of distinct office and order, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles reason rendred in the seventh verse of his direction in the fift and sixt verses, is (with reverence be it spoken) inconsequentiall, and his demand unjust. If a Chancellor in one of the Vniversities should give Order to his Vice-chancellour to admit none to the decree of Batchelour in Arts, but such as were able to <hi>preach,</hi> or keepe a Divinity Act; <hi>For Batchelours in Divinity must be so</hi>; what reason or equity were in this? So if <hi>Paul</hi> leaving <hi>Titus</hi> as his <hi>Locum teneus,</hi> as it were in Creet for a season, should give order to him not to admit any to be an <hi>Elder</hi> but one thus and thus qualified, because a Bishop must be so: Had a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop been an Order or Calling distinct from, or superiour to a Presbyter, and not the same, this had been no more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall or equall then the former; therfore under the name of Bishop in the seventh verse the Apostle intends the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, mentioned in the fift verse. Consonant to this is the Language of the same blessed Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. verse 17.18. where such as in 17 verse he calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the examination of this Glosse, to avoyd need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Controversie.

               <p>Yet in this we differ; that they say, this <hi>Impropriation</hi> of name, and <hi>Imparity of place, is of Divine Right and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Institution:</hi> we affirme both to be occasionall, and of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention; and undertake to shew out of Antiquitie, both the <hi>occasion upon which,</hi> and the <hi>Persons by whom this Imparity</hi> was brought into the Church.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the occasion of this Imparity and Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Bishops above Elders, was the divisions which through the Devils instinct fell among the Churches; <hi>Post quam verò Diaboli instinctu.</hi>

                  <hi>Saravia</hi> would take advantage of this place, to deduce this Imparity as high as from the Apostles times, because even then they began to say, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos:</hi> but sure S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was not so weake as this man would make him, to speake Inconsistencies; and when <hi>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds</hi> it to himselfe, to prove that <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi> the same, to let fall words that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his own proposition: whereas therefore S. <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, that <hi>after men began to say, I am of Paul, and I of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, &amp;c. it was decreed that one of the Presbyters should be set over the rest, &amp;c.</hi> This is spoken indeed in the <hi>Apostles phrase,</hi> but <hi>not of the Apostles times,</hi> else to what purpose is that coacervation of texts that followes?</p>
               <p>But suppose it should be granted to be of Apostolicall antiquity (which yet we grant not, having proved the contrary) yet it appeares: it was not of <hi>Apostolicall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but of <hi>Diabolicall occasion</hi>: And though the Divell by kindling Divisions in the Church, did minister <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to the invention of the primacy or prelacy or one for the suppressing of Schisme; yet there is just cause to thinke, that the Spirit of God in his Apostles was never the author of this Invention.</p>
               <p>First, because we reade in the Apostles dayes there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> were Divisions, <hi>Rom</hi> 16.7. and Schismes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. &amp; 11.18. yet the Apostle was not directed by the holy Ghost to ord<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine Bishops for the taking away of those Divisions; Neither in the rules hee prescribes for the healing of those breaches, doth hee mention <hi>Bishops</hi> for that end: Nor in the Directions given to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63410:17"/>
for the <hi>Ordination of Bishops or Elders,</hi> doth he mention this as one end of their <hi>Ordination,</hi> or <hi>one peculiar duty of their office.</hi> And though the Apostle saith, <hi>O portet haereses inter vos esse, ut qui probati sunt manifesti fiant inter vos</hi>; yet the apostle no where saith, <hi>Oportet Episcopos esse, ut tollantur haereses, quae mainifestae fiunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because as Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy devised hath proved worse then the disease, which doth never happen to that remedy whereof the holy Ghost is the author.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because the holy Ghost, who could foresee what would ensue thereupon, would never ordaine that for a remedy, which would not onely be ineffectuall to the cutting off of evill, but become a stirrup for Antichrist to get into his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> affirming Bishops to differ from Presbyters in the power of Ordination; seeme to imply, that that power is soly theirs: Here we desire it may be observed;</p>
               <p>First, that these Fathers put all the difference that lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Bishops and Presbyters, to be in point of Ordination. <hi>Quid facit Episcopus, quod non facit Presbyter exceptâ Ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> And therefore <hi>Chrysostome</hi> himselfe confesseth, that in his dayes there was little or no difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That this difference is not so to be understood, as if these Fathers did hold it to be by divine right (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and our Episcopall men would make us beleeve) but by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane constitution. And therefore they doe not speak <hi>De jure,</hi> but <hi>de facto, Quid facit, &amp;c.</hi> not <hi>quid debet facere.</hi> And this <hi>Hierom</hi> confesseth.<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, we answer that this very humane difference was not in the Primitive Antiquity. It was not so in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, as we even now shewed. And when it did prevaile, it was but a particular custome (and sometimes usurpation) of some Churches. For it was otherwise appointed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Carthage, and in Egypt, and other places, as is declared in the former part of this Section; And even in <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> time, it was so little approved of, that it was one great accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation against <hi>Chrysostome</hi> himselfe, <hi>That hee made Ordinations without the Presbytery, and without the consent of his Clergie.</hi> This is quoted by Bishop <hi>Downam, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 176.</p>

               <p>Adde, thirdly, that the very name <hi>Angell</hi> is sufficient to prove, that it is not meant of one person alone, because the word <hi>Angell</hi> doth not import any peculiar jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or preheminence, but is a common name to all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and is so used in Scripture. For all Ministers are Gods Messengers and Embassadours, sent for the good of the Elect. And therefore the name being common to all Ministers, why should wee thinke that there should bee
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63410:29"/>
any thing spoken to one Minister, that doth not belong to all? The like argument wee draw from the word <hi>Starres,</hi> used <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The seven Starres are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the seven Churches.</hi> Now it is evident, that all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers are called Starres in Scripture, whose duty is to shine as lights unto the Churches, in all purity of doctrine and holinesse of conversation. And in this sence, the word is used, when it is said, that <hi>the third part of the starres were darkened,</hi> Revel. 8.12. and that the <hi>Dragons taile drew the third part of the starres of Heaven, &amp; cast them to the Earth,</hi> Revel. 12.4. Which is meant not onely of Bishops, but of other Ministers, unlesse the Bishops will appropriate all corruption and Apostacy unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Adde, fourthly, out of the Text it selfe, It is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that our Saviour in opening the mystery of the Vision, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20. saith; <hi>The seven Candlestickes which thou sawest, are the seven Churches,</hi> but hee doth not say. The seven starres are the seven Angels of the same Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>But the Angels of the seven Churches</hi>; wherein not without some mystery the number of the Angels in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, least we should understand by Angell, one Minister alone, and not a company. And yet the septenary number of Churches is twice set down.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though but one Angell bee mentioned in the forefront, yet it is evident, that the Epistles themselves are dedicated to all the Angels and Ministers in every Church, and to the Churches themselves. And if to the whole Church, much more to the Presbyters of that Church. This is proved <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.11. <hi>What thou seest write in a Book and send it to the seven Churches which are in Asia.</hi> And also by the Epiphonema of every Epistle; <hi>He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare what the Spirit saith to the Churches.</hi> Upon which words, <hi>Ambrosius Ausbertus</hi> in his second booke upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> saith thus; <hi>Vnâ ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, threatnings, commendations, and reproofes, are directed to all the Ministers of all the Churches. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The devill shall cast some of you into prison, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 2.16. <hi>I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth,</hi> Rev. 2.24. <hi>I will put upon you no other burden, &amp;c.

And if God should take this course, in what wofull and miserable condition should the Church of <hi>England</hi> be, which groaneth under so many corrupt Prelates?

               <p>If it be here demanded (as it is much by the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall side) that if by angell bee meant the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Presbyters, why Christ did not say, to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the plurall number, but to the angell in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular?</p>
               <p>Wee answer, that though this question may savour of a little too much curiosity, yet wee will make bold to subjoyn three conjecturall reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this phrase of speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63410:30"/>First, It is so used in this place, because it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon language of other Scriptures in types and visions to set down a certaine number for an uncertaine, and the singular number for the purall. Thus the Ramme, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.3. is interpreted vers. 20. to be the Kings of Media and Persia And the enemies of Gods Church are set out by foure ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes. And the deliverers by foure Carpenters, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.18 20. And the wise and foolish Virgins are said to be five wise and five foolish. And many such like. And therefore as we answer the Papists, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand why Christ if he meant figuratively when he saith, <hi>this is my body,</hi> did not speake in plaine language, <hi>this is the signe of my body?</hi> We say, that this phrase of speech is proper to all Sacraments: So we also answer here, this phrase of speech, <hi>Angell</hi> for <hi>Angels,</hi> is common to all types and visions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, angell is put, though more be meant, that so it may hold proportion with the Vision which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chap, 1.12.20. <hi>He saw seven golden Candlestickes, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Starres.</hi> And therefore to hold proportion, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are directed to seven angels, and to seven Churches. And this is called a mystery, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20, <hi>The mystery of the seven Starres, &amp;c.</hi> Now a mystery is a secret, which comprehends more then is expressed; and therefore though but one angell be expressed, yet the mystery im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes all the angels of that Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to signifie their unity in the Ministeriall function, and joynt commission to attend upon the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing of one Church, with one common care, as it were with one hand and heart. And this is more fitly declared by the name of one angell, then of many. Wee often finde the name of (one) Prophet or Priest to be put for the generall body of the Ministery, or whole multitude of Prophets or Priests, in the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iudah,</hi> when the Spirit of God intendeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, threaten, or admonish them. Thus it is <hi>Iere.</hi> 6.13.18.18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Neither should it seeme strange, that a multitude or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63410:31"/>
company of Ministers should bee understood under the name of one angell, seeing a multitude of Heavenly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (implyed in one service for the good of Gods Saints) is sometimes in the Scripture shut up under one angell in the singular number, as may be gathered from <hi>Gen.</hi>

And also a multitude of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils or evill angels, joyntly labouring in any one worke, is set forth under the name of one evill or uncleane spirit, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21, 22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1 23, 24. <hi>Mark<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now let us suppose (which yet notwithstanding we will not grant) that the word <hi>Angell</hi> is taken individually for one particular person, as Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> seemes to interpret it, together with Master <hi>Beza,</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, there will nothing follow out of this acception, that will any wayes make for the upholding of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishop, with sole power of Ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as a distinct superior to Presbyters. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <p>First, because it never was yet proved nor ever will (as we conceive) that these angels were Diocesan Bishops, considering that Parishes were not divided into Diocesses in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> dayes. And the seven starres are said to bee fixed in their seven Candlestickes or Churches, not one starre over divers Candlestickes. Neither can those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be thought to be Diocesan, when not only <hi>Tindall</hi> and the old translation, calls them seven Congregations, but we reade also <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that at <hi>Ephesus</hi> which was one of those Candlesticks, there was but one flock.</p>
               <p>And secondly, we further finde that in <hi>Ephesus</hi> one of those seven Churches, there were many Presbyters, which are all called Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and we finde no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any superintendency or superiority of one Bishop over another. To them in generall the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be fed by them without any respect had to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> who stood at his elbow and had beene with him in Macedonia, and was now waiting upon him to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:63410:31"/>
This is also confirmed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who writing of the Heresies of the <hi>Meletians,</hi> saith, that in ancient times this was peculiar to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it had but one bishop, whereas other Cities had two. And hee being bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Cypres, might well be acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which were so nigh unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is nothing said in the seven Epistles that implyeth any superiority or majority of rule or power that these angels had over the other angels that were joyned with them in their Churches. It is written indeed, in commendation of the angell of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, that he could not beare them that were evill, and that he had tryed them which say they were Apostles and are not, &amp; had found them lyars.</hi> And it is spoken in dispraise of the angell of <hi>Pergamus, that he suffred them which held the doctrine of Balaam, &amp;c.</hi> But these things are common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, requirable at the hands of all Ministers, who have the Charge of Soules.</p>
               <p>But suppose that there were some superiority and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency insinuated by this individuall angell, yet who knoweth not that there are divers kinds of superiority; to wit, of Order, of dignity, of gifts and parts, or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Ministery, or in charge of power and jurisdiction. And how will it be proved that this angell if he had a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, had any more then a superiority of order, or of gifts and parts? Where is it said, that this angell was a superior degree or order of Ministery above Presbyters? In which Epistle it is said that this angell had sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction? and therefore as our learned Protestants prove against the Papists, that when Christ directed his speech to <hi>Peter</hi> in particular and said, <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of the kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> That this particularization of <hi>Peter</hi> did not import any singular preheminence or majority of power to <hi>Peter</hi> more then to the other apostles. But that though the promise was made to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet it was made to him in the name of all the rest, and given to all as well as one. And

that therefore it was spoken to one person, and not to all, that so Christ might fore signifie the unity of his Church, as <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:63410:32"/>That these two Postscripts (and so all the rest) are no part of Canonicall Scripture. And therefore our former and ancienter English translations, though they have these Postscripts, yet they are put in a small character different from that of the text, that all men might take notice they were no parts of the text. Although our Episcopall men of late in newer impressions have inlarged their Phylacteries, in putting those Postscripts in the same full character with that of the text, that the simple might beleeve they are Canonicall Scripture. The Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (<hi>Baronius, Serrarius,</hi> and the Rhemists) confesse that there is much falsity in them.

Besides, the Epistle is said to be writ from <hi>Loadicea,</hi> whereas <hi>Beza</hi> in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations proves apparently, that it was written from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>; to which opinion <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Serrarius</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. It is added, <hi>Which is the chiefest City of Phrygia Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiana.</hi> But this Epithete is no where read in the Writers of those ages, saith <hi>Beza, Sed apud recentiores illos, qui Romani imperii jam inclinantis provincias descripserunt.</hi> So that by this place it is evident, that the subscription was added a long while after the writing of the Epistles by some men, for the most part <hi>vel indoctis,</hi> saith <hi>Beza, vel certe non satis attentis,</hi> Either by a learned, or negligent man.</p>
               <p>The second Epistle is thus subscribed; <hi>the second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle unto Timothy ordeined the first Bishop of the Church of the Ephesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.</hi> Now these words <hi>Ordained the first Bishop,</hi> is wanting, saith <hi>Beza, in quibusdam vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis codicibus, in veteri vulgat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> is thus subscribed: <hi>Written to Titus, ordained first Bishop of the Church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.</hi> Here it is said that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle was written from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> whereas it is cleare that <hi>Paul</hi> was not at <hi>Nicopolis</hi> when he wrote it, <hi>Tit,</hi> 3.12. <hi>Be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined there to winter.</hi> He doth not say, <hi>Here to winter,</hi> but <hi>there</hi>; Where note, for the present hee was not there. And besides, it is said, that <hi>Titus was ordained the first Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> And who was the second? or was there ever a second? And also <hi>He is said to be Bishop,</hi> not onely of a Diocesse, <hi>but of all Creet.</hi> Was there ever such a second Bishop? Adde, lastly, that it is said, <hi>Bishop of the Church of the Cretians</hi>; Whereas it would bee said of the <hi>Churches of the Cretians.</hi> For the Christian Churches of any Nation are called <hi>Churches</hi> by <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> not <hi>Church.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Codex Claremontanus</hi> subscribes; <hi>Here ends the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to Titus,</hi> and no more. So the Syriack; <hi>Finitur Epistola ad Titum quae scripta fuit è Nicopoli.</hi> The old Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Edition hath nothing of the Episcopacy of <hi>Titus.</hi> By all this it appeares, that if the Bishops had no more authority to urge us to subscribe to their Ceremonies, then they have authority for their Episcopall dignity by these Subscriptions, there would be no more Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Ceremonies in the Churches of England.</p>
               <p>But some will say, that there is one objection out of Scripture yet unanswered, and that is from the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that was betweene the twelve Apostles, and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Disciples.</p>
               <p>To which we answer;</p>
               <p>First, that it cannot bee proved that the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had any superiority over the seventy, either of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63410:33"/>
or Jurisdiction. Or that there was any subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the seventy unto the twelve. But suppose it were yet we answer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a superiority and inferiority betweene Officers of different kindes, will not prove that there should be a superiority and inferiority betweene Officers of the same kinde. No man will deny but that in Christs time, there were Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and teachers, and that the apostles were superior to Evangelists and Pastors. But it cannot bee proved, that one apostle had any superiority over another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, or one Evangelist over another. And why then should one Presbyter be over another? Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that though we should grant a superiority betweene the twelve and the seventy, yet this will not prove the question in hand. Because the question is concerning Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the same kinde, and the instance is of Officers of different kinds, amongst whom no man will deny but there may be a superiority and inferiority, as there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us between Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
               <p>And now let your <hi>Honours</hi> judge (considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses) how farre this Episcopall government is from any <hi>Divine right,</hi> or <hi>Apostolicall institution.</hi> And how true that speech of <hi>Hierome</hi> is, that a bishop as it is a superior Order to a Presbyter, is <hi>an Humane praesumption,</hi> not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance.</p>
               <p>But though Scripture failes them, yet the indulgence and Munificence of <hi>Religious Princes</hi> may support them, and to this the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> makes his next recourse, yet so as he acknowledgeth here, <hi>Ingagements to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onely for their accessory dignities, titles, and Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; not at all for their stations and functions,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet the author plainely acknowledgeth a difference betweene our <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Bishops of old</hi> by such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions.)</p>
               <p>For our parts, we are so farre from envying the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Munificence of pious Princes, in collating honourable maintenance upon the Ministers of Christ,</hi> that we beleeve,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63410:34"/>
that <hi>even by Gods owne Ordinance, double Honour</hi> is due unto them.</p>
               <p>And that by how much the <hi>Ministery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi> is more <hi>honourable</hi> then that of <hi>the Law</hi>; by so much the more ought all that embrace the <hi>Gospell,</hi> to bee carefull to provide, that the <hi>Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi> might not onely live, but maintaine Hospitalitie, according to the Rule of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> And that <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman</hi> spake as an Oracle, that said; <hi>That scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Maintenance is a great cause of a scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet wee are not ignorant, that when the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry came to have <hi>Agros, domos, locationes, vehicula, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quos, latifundia,</hi> as <hi>Chrysost. Hom.</hi> 86. <hi>in Matth.</hi> That then <hi>Religio peperit divitias, &amp; filia devoravit Matrem,</hi> religion brought forth riches, and the Daughter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Mother; and then there was a voyce of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels heard from Heaven; <hi>Hodie venenum in Ecclesiam Christi cecidit,</hi> this Day is poyson shed into the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>And then it was that <hi>Ierome</hi> complained, <hi>Christi Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia postquam ad Christianos principes venit, potentiâ qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp; divitiis major, sed virtutibus minor facta est.</hi> Then also was that Conjunction found true; That when they <hi>had woodden Chalices,</hi> they had <hi>golden Priests</hi>; but when their <hi>Chalices were golden, their Priests were wooden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though we doe not thinke, there is any such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compossibility,</hi> but that <hi>large Revenues may be happily mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with an humble sociablenesse,</hi> yet it is very rare to finde. History tells us, that the superfluous revenues of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> not onely made them neglect their <hi>Ministery,</hi> but further ushered in their stately and pompous attendance; which did so elevate their Spirits, that they insulted over their brethren, both <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to others to hate and abhorre the Christian Faith, Which <hi>Eusebius</hi> sets forth fully in the pride of <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus,</hi> who notwithstanding the meannesse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity

                  <hi>Presbyters, and Deacons, as three distinct subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate callings, with an evident specification of the duty belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each of them: Let this claimed Hierarchie be for ever rooted out of the Church:</hi> We beseech you let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how we have proved, out of the <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable writings of the Apostles themselves</hi>: that these

               <p>First, <hi>that pleading the Divine right of Episcopacy, is to the prejudice of Soveraignty:</hi> Secondly, <hi>that it casts a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imputation upon all those reformed Churches that want this Government.</hi>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63410:36"/>But doe they not plucke all this envie upon themselves, who in their <hi>Conferences, Writings, Pulpits, Vniversities, Disputes, High Commission, Declamations, have disclaimed them us no Churches, that have disclaimed the Prelats?</hi> and have honoured the most <hi>glorious Lights</hi> of <hi>those Reformed Churches, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and others with no better titles than of <hi>Rascalls, Blasphemers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the pith of his answer after a few good words is this: that no such consequent can be drawne from their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their <hi>Ius divinum</hi> pleads only for a <hi>Iustifiablenesse of this holy calling:</hi> Not for an absolute necessity of it, <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting it where it is, and requiring it where it may be had; but not fixing upon the Church that wants it, the defect of any thing of the Essence of a Church, but only of the glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it</hi>; neither is it their sin, but their misery.</p>
               <p>And is it so, doth not this <hi>Ius divinum</hi> argue a <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> but onely a <hi>Iustifiablenesse</hi> of this calling; nor is the want of it a want of any thing of Essence, but onely of perfection? wee had thought, that page the twentieth, where this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> strives to fetch the <hi>pedegree of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie</hi> from no lesse than <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and in that right <hi>Divine institution</hi> he had reckoned it among those things, which the Apostles ordained for the succeeding admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Church <hi>in essentiall matters:</hi> but here it seemes he is willing to retract what there fell from him: there it was to his advantage to say, this government was a thing essentiall to the Church, and here it is no lesse advantage to say, it is not essentiall.</p>
               <p>But if it be not Essentiall, then what is the reason that when a <hi>Priest</hi> who hath received orders at <hi>Rome</hi> turnes to us, they urge not him to receive ordination among us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but when some of our brethren, who flying in Queene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And if this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> should leave Bishop <hi>Mountague</hi> to answer for himselfe, yet notwithstanding he stands bound to give us satisfaction to these two questions, which arise from his owne Booke.</p>
               <p>First, whether <hi>that Office,</hi> which by <hi>divine right</hi> hath the <hi>sole power of Ordaining,</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi> all other <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church, (as he saith Episcopacy hath) belong not to the being, but onely to the glory and perfection of a Church. Secondly, there being (in this mans thoughts) the same <hi>Ius divinum</hi> for Bishops, that there is for <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> seemes to know so much of the minde of those Churches, that <hi>if they might have their option, they would most gladly embrace Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In which harmony of these Confessions, see how both Churches agree in these five points:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, That there is in the Word of God, an exact forme
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63410:37"/>
of Governement set downe, <hi>Deus in verbo suo edocuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That this forme of Governement Christ established in his Church; <hi>Iesus Christus in Ecclesiâ san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this forme of Government is by Pastors,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Elders, and Deacons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the true Church of Christ ought to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thus governed; <hi>Veram Ecclesiam debere regi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, That all true Ministers of the Gospell are of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> equall power and Authority.</p>
               <p>For the reason he assignes, why those Churches should make this Option, wee cannot enough admire that such a passage should fall from his pen, as to say, there is <hi>Little difference betweene their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and our Episcopacie, save onely in perpetuity and lay Elders,</hi> for who knowes not that between these two, there is as vast a difference as between the <hi>Duke of Venice</hi> and an <hi>absolute Monarch.</hi> For, 1. the Moderator in <hi>Geneva</hi> is not of a superiour order to his Brethren; nor 2. hath an ordination differing from them; nor 3. assumes power of sole Ordination or Jurisdiction; nor hath he 4. maintenance for that office above his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; nor 5. a Negative voyce in what is agreed by the rest; nor 6. any further power then any of his Brethren. So that the difference betweene our Bishops and their Moderators is more then <hi>Little:</hi> But if it be so little as this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> here pretends; then the <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Abrogation</hi> of <hi>Episcopacie</hi> will be with the lesse <hi>difficultie,</hi> and <hi>occasion the lesse disturbance.</hi>

               <head>SECT. XV.</head>
               <p>BUt there is another thing, wherein our <hi>Episcopacie differs</hi> from the <hi>Geneva Moderatorship,</hi> besides the perpetuity; and that is the <hi>exclusion of the Lay Presbytery,</hi> (which if we may beleeve this <hi>Remonstrant</hi>) <hi>never till this age had footing in the Christian Church.</hi>

               <p>But he upbraides us with <hi>our Divisions and Subdivisions,</hi> and so doe the Papists upbraid the Protestants with their <hi>Lutheranisme, Calvinisme, and Zuinglianisme.</hi> And this is that the Heathens objected to the Christians, their Fractures were so many, they knew not which Religion

to chuse if they should turn Christians: And can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Church in any age should be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, when the times of the Apostles were not free? and the Apostle tells us, it must needs be that there be divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in <hi>Greg.

               <p>But as for the Divisions of the Antiprelaticall party, so odiously exaggerated by this Remonstrant: Let us as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your Honours, they have beene much fomented by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> whose pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is no wonder considering the pathes our Prelates have trod, that there are Divisions in the Nation. The wonder is our Divisions are no more, no greater; and wee doubt not but if they were of that gracious spirit, and so intirely affected to the peace of the Church as <hi>Greg.

               <p>A second thing, wee cannot but take notice of, is the pains this <hi>Author</hi> takes to advance his <hi>Prelaticall Church:</hi>

               <p>And whereas they pretend, that they differ from us onely in a Ceremony or an Organ pipe, (which however is no contemptible difference) yet it will appeare that our differences are in point of a superiour Alloy. Though this Remonstrant braves it in his multiplyed Quere's.

               <p>First, if he ask what are the bounds of this Church, we answer him out of the sixt of their late founded Canons: where we find the limits of this Prelaticall Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as farre as from the high and lofty Promontory of Archbishops, to the <hi>Terra incognita</hi> of an, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If what new Creed</hi> they have, or what grounds of Faith differing from their Neighbours, we answer; Episcopacy by divine right is the first Article of their Creed Absolute and blinde obedience to all the commandements of the Church (that is the Bishop and his Emissaries) election upon faith foreseene, the influence of works into <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> falling from grace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If what Scripture,</hi> we answer; the Apocrypha and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If what Baptisme</hi>? a Baptisme of absolute Necessity unto salvation; and yet insufficient unto salvation: as not sealing grace to the taking away of sinne after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If what Eucharist</hi>? an Eucharist that must be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred upon an Altar or a Table set Altar-wise, rayled in an Eucharist in which there is such a presence of Christ, (though <hi>Modum nesciunt</hi>) as makes the place of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration the <hi>throne of God,</hi> the place of the <hi>Residence of the Almighty</hi>; and impresseth such a holinesse upon it as

makes it not onely capable, but worthy of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If what meanes of salvation?</hi> we answer, confession of sinnes to a Priest as the most absolute, undoubted, necessary, infallible meanes of Salvation.</p>

                  <p>Why should England that is one of the chiefest King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> in Europe, that seperates from Antichrist, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend a discipline different from all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, which stand in the like Separation? And whether the continuance in this discipline will not at last bring us to communion with Rome from which wee are separated, and to separation from the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, unto which wee are united.</p>
                  <p>Whether it bee fit that the name Bishop, which in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Scripture is common to the Presbyters with the Bishops (and not onely in in Scripture, but also in Antiquitie for some hundreds of yeeres) should still bee appropriated to Bishops, and ingrossed by them, and not rather to bee made common to all Presbyters; and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause:</p>
                  <p>First we finde by wofull experience, that the great Equivocation that lyeth in the name Bishop hath beene and is at this day a great prop &amp; pillar to uphold Lordly Prelacy, for this is the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> the master-peece, and indeed the onely argument with which they thinke to silence all opposers.

For Bishops in the Apostles time were the same with Presbyters in name and office and so for a good while after. And when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they came to bee distinguished. The Bishops of the primitive times differed as much from ours now, as Rome ancient from Rome at this day, as hath beene sufficiently declared in this Booke.

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:63410:48"/>Secondly, because wee finde that the late Innovators which have so much disturbed the peace &amp; purity of our Church, did first begin with the alteration of words; and by changing the word Table into the word Altar; and the word Minister, into the word Priest; and the word Sacrament into the word Sacrifice, have endevoured to bring in the Popish Masse. And the Apostle exhorts us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>To hold fast the forme of sound words:</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.20. <hi>to avoid the prophane novelties of words.</hi> Upon which text we will onely mention what the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists have commented, which wee conceive to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy consideration.

And yet notwithstanding we doe much dislike the humour of those, that crie up those dayes as a compleat patterne of reformation, and that endeavour to reduce our Religion to the first times of King <hi>Edward,</hi> which wee conceive were comparatively very imperfect, there being foure impediments which did much hinder that blessed work.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The three rebellions.

Christ, which wee require, yea, which the salvation of us all requireth, may in no wise bee expected to come from the Bishops, seeing there be so few among them which doe understand the power and proper Offices of this Kingdome; and very many of them by all meanes (which possibly they can and dare) either oppose themselves against it, or deferre and hinder it.</p>
            <p>The deficiencie of zeale and courage even in those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> who afterwards proved Martyrs, witnesse the sharp contention of <hi>Ridley</hi> against <hi>Hooper,</hi> for the ceremonies.

            <p>The inhumane butcheries, blood-sheddings, and cruelties of <hi>Gardiner, Bonner,</hi> and the rest of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, are so fresh in every mans memory, as that we conceive it a thing altogether unnecessary to make mention of them. Onely wee feare least the guilt of the blood then shed, should yet remaine to be required at the hands of this Nation, because it hath not publikely endeavoured to appease the wrath of God by a generall and solemne humiliation for it.</p>
            <p>What the practises of the Prelats have beene ever since, from the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to this present day, would fill a volume (like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> roule) with lamentation, mourning, and woe to record. For it hath beene their great designe to hinder all further reformation; to bring in doctrines of Popery, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme, and Libertinisme, to maintaine, propagate and much encrease the burden of humane ceremonies: to keepe out, and beate downe the Preaching of the Word, to silence the faithfull Preachers of it, to oppose and persecute the most zealous professours, and to turne
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63410:55"/>
all Religion into a pompous out-side. And to tread downe the power of godlinesse. Insomuch as it is come to an ordinary Proverb, that when any thing is spoyled wee use to say, <hi>The Bishops foot hath beene in it.</hi> And in all this (and much more which might be said) ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling Bishop <hi>Bonners</hi> Prophesie, who when hee saw that in King <hi>Edwards</hi> reformation, there was a reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ceremonies and Hierarchy, is credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have used these words; <hi>Since they have begun to tast of our Broath, it will not be long ere they will eat of our Beefe.</hi>
