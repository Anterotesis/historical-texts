            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And because their hardie seruice and painefull trauell in the lowe Countrie of Flaunders, all the time of these daungerous warres maye bee knowne among you, I haue thought it good to declare the names as well of those Captaines that be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

slaine, as of suche which yet beeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, with the number of those whiche vnfaithfully are fled to the enimie, to their euerlasting shame and eternall reproch for euer.</p>
            <p>First therfore of the number of those notable and worthy Captaines which yet are liuing,<note place="margin">Captains liuing.</note> the right hardye &amp; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Gentleman M. <hi>Notrice</hi> is chéefe, whiche at this presente is Generall of the Englishe Armie, whose renowned déedes is by fame sounded through the whole Worlde, and whose presence procureth the enimies payne, of whom they stande so much in dread, that his onely sighte causeth them to shake, yea if they may knowe or perceyue that hee is in place, then doe they seeke by all meanes possible to escape the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of his fiste, for rather then they will come vnder his clawes, they will desperatly drowne or slea themselues, suche rough reuenge dooth hee take on all his foes, and accursed enimies. So that there is fewe or none that dare approch his presence being in battell,
<pb facs="tcp:26270:4"/>
in so much that in <hi>Flaunders</hi> he beares the palme of praise from all the rest.</p>
            <p>Nexte vnto him is our Coronall <hi>Morgan,</hi> whose couragious stomacke and prudent pollicie, hath had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent triall in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> where he hath fought many a cruell battayle, and sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped manie a harde brunte, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Countrie, and his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glorie.</p>
            <p>After him is Coronall <hi>North,</hi> who also amongst the spitefull <hi>Spanyardes</hi> hath giuen many a bloodie blow, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe at all times a right hardy and valiaunt Captaine, inforcing his enimies to flie before him for feare of death and daunger.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Willyams</hi> also hath not shrunke to shewe himselfe at all times to the vtter dismaying of those whiche came against him, casting them to the ground, and scatering them before him like chaffe against the wind.</p>
            <p>There is moreouer that gallaunt Captaine M. <hi>
                  <unclear>Edward</unclear> Yorke,</hi> whose seruice since his comming hath got no
<pb facs="tcp:26270:4"/>
small credite: and also that woorthie man Captaine <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who hath with sworde and shield cut in péeces so many thousand Spanyards.</p>
            <p>Then there is an other <hi>Norrice,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring as braue a minde as the best, and being as curteous to his frends, as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to his foes.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Wilson</hi> also for his good seruice is sufficiently knowen to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie, whose bloody strokes hath put them to manie a hard brunt.</p>
            <p>And amongst all other, M. Captaine <hi>Martin</hi> shall neuer bée forgotten, for that his manhoode and mighte hath not seldome been tryed, but in many a hard and cruell assault, he hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a moste worthie and couragious Captaine, inforcing his stoutest enimy to retire, or els to bide the brunt of his deadly bloes, vnto his immortal praise, &amp; endles glory. He was borne in <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-shire,</hi> and for 9. yéeres hath béene &amp; remained in the warres, séeking by dinte of sword to win him honour and fame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26270:5"/>Then is there Captaine <hi>Morgan</hi> deseruing great praise for his prowes, and also Captaine <hi>Bannister</hi> in good credit and estimation.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Hauers</hi> likewise very wel thought of, and Captaine <hi>Huddy</hi> of no lesse account then the others.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Morrice</hi> the elder hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so continued in good credit.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Hammon,</hi> Captaine <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Tannor,</hi> all thrée worthie captaines, and such as haue &amp; will spende both life and lande, for the honour of their Prince and country.</p>
            <p>And according to the example of the reste, Captaine <hi>Androwes</hi> hath at no time spared his paine for the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of his honor and credit.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Huntly</hi> in like manner hath not bene found inferiour to any of the aforenamed in declaring his good will. And captaine <hi>Price</hi> in the face of the enemie, hath at all times shewes himselfe of gallant courage &amp; might.</p>
            <p>Also to the vtter spoile of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worthy man captaine <hi>Salisbury</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26270:5"/>
hath full often bene found in the field.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Marchant</hi> in like maner for his approued deedes of armes hath purchased to himselfe the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both of friendes and foes.</p>
            <p>And to make vp the number of thys gallant companie of couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, captaine <hi>Lettelton</hi> is esteemed as one, who although hee be the last in number, yet is his faithful heart ready with the formost in anye maner of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, being by his iust desertes estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a most worthie man. And all these aforenamed being yet liuing, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore made themselues worthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples for others to followe the like valiaunte actes and honourable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploytes. And notwithstanding theyr great payne and trauell in defence of those countries, yet is their pay so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly performed that oftentimes they haue not wherewith to prouyde for their present necessities, whose want and neede is not vnknowne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and althoughe they sustayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a hard brunt, many a sharpe shower
<pb facs="tcp:26270:6"/>
and manie a hungrie meale, yet will they not be found selfe to their frends, nor vnkinde to the Country, although pinching néede doth often times dryue them thereunto, yet had they rather valiantly venter upon their cruel foes, to pluck the bread out of their mouths, then contrariwise to become cruell to the Countrie, whose parte they take.</p>
            <p>But if it should chance through their harde dealing with our Englishmen, that therevpon they shoulde worthely leaue them to their owne defence, alas full soone would the enimie make a ioyfull tryum ꝯhe of their wofull Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie, then might the babe vnborne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the losse of such a sort of valiant Captaines, who hath spente their blood for their benefite. If they should seeke for succour of other straunge nations, whose frendshippe is very fickle, then might they soone make account of their cursed estate. Therefore may they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pray for the prosperitie &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie raigne of the good Quéene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who hath alwaies béene their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:26270:6"/>
comfort in all calamitie, against all such spitefull enimies as do daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and inuade the Country: against whom many of our worthie Captains haue withstood, vntill their hart bloods were shed on the colde ground. Whose names I haue thought also good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse.</p>
            <p>First Coronall <hi>Cotton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">English Captains slaine.</note> most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and like a hardy man of courage resisting the foe, after manie a cruell skirmish, and bloodie battell, and after he had giuen manie a man his deadlie wounde, hee was himselfe vnhappily slaine, to the great gréefe of all his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie companie, and the residue of his frends, and well willers.</p>
            <p>Then Captaine <hi>Leggins</hi> in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fighting in fielde against his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and putting many of them vnto deadly foyle, was at the last so gréeous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, that in the end he lost his life among them.</p>
            <p>Likewise that hardie and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Captain M. <hi>Bingham,</hi> after manie a cruell conflicte, and bloodie broyle,
<pb facs="tcp:26270:7"/>
wherein he had manfully declared his force against his foes, was at length laid in the dust by deathe: whose well approued deeds shall neuer dye so long as the world doth last.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> also was in <hi>Nonny</hi> fielde, moste worthely founde a right stought, and bould Champion, whiche had well shewed his seruice against the enemy, by whose force they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten constrained to flie the fielde, and hide their heades, for feare of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and yet in the ende was most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately slaine.</p>
            <p>Also Captayne <hi>Chambernowne</hi> a hardy man of courage, was brought in battell to his vntimely end.</p>
            <p>And in like sorte captaine <hi>Cobham</hi> by whome the enemy hadde receaued many a shrewde assault, and brought oftentymes to many a hard plunge, at last like a Lyon fighting among the thickest of them, he receaued his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, captaine <hi>Marckham</hi> like a valiaunt souldiour among his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:26270:7"/>
foes fought so long, till it cost hym his dearest bloud.</p>
            <p>And in like honourable sorte dyd captayne <hi>Poole</hi> spende hys life to the great griefe of all his Souldiours and friendes.</p>
            <p>And captaine <hi>Gill,</hi> whose welfare his foes coulde hardly affourd, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his manhoode: was at last slaine in skirmish, to the reioycing of al those that before had tasted of his deedes.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Weedon</hi> also moste man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lost his lyfe among them, of whose good seruice the Spanyardes are able to report.</p>
            <p>Likewise captaine <hi>Iones,</hi> after good seruice done of his side, did worthely end his life among them.</p>
            <p>Also Captayne <hi>Corne,</hi> Captayne <hi>Floud,</hi> and Captayne <hi>Ellice</hi> to the hard escaping of some, and the deathe of a number was at length slaine in the field.</p>
            <p>And Captaine <hi>Browne</hi> whose val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lientnes, and hardines of courage made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie to muse, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last, to the honor

of his Cuntry, and his continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and credite, most valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended his life in the warres.</p>
            <p>Also there was slaine in sundry skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, these worthie and valiant men following: Captaine <hi>Almond,</hi> captain <hi>Woodshawe,</hi> captaine <hi>Morehouse,</hi> and captaine <hi>Blunt,</hi> whose losse Flaunders hath good cause to lament.

            </p>
            <p>All these notable and famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, so long as life indured, spared no paine nor trauell for the defence of the lowe countries, but like Lyons in the fielde, they enforced their foes to beare the brunt of their deadly blowes
<pb facs="tcp:26270:8"/>
so that the spanyardes to their <unclear>paine</unclear> can report, the inuincible courage of our english-men, whiche alwaies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselues for the succour of the poore distresses countrey of Flanders being neither procured thereunto by Lucar, wealth, or riches, but onely for the good desire they haue for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the trueth, in which cause they haue spent and lost their liues.</p>
            <p>There is also slaine of notable and worthie Liefetenants these following,<note place="margin">Liefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts slain in the low countries.</note> 
               <hi>Foster, Harding, Turner, Smith, Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, they died so honourable to their cuntrie, that thereby they haue purchased to them selues immortall fame, and endles glorie. But as these
<pb facs="tcp:26270:9"/>
before mentioned lost their liues to the credite of their countrey, and the defence of the oppressed, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of pelfe and transitorie riches, so there are some whiche to the shame of themselues, and the griefe of their countremen, to gaine the commoditie of corrupted coyne, hathe contrarie to naturall affection and without respect of their good name and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries credite, shewed themselues faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to their friendes, and hathe taken part with the enemy: whose names to bring all other out of suspecte, I will here declare.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Captains fled to the enemie.</note>First Captaine <hi>Peggot,</hi> Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> captaine <hi>Taylor,</hi> and captayns <hi>Vincent,</hi> captaine <hi>Welch,</hi> and captain <hi>Dethicke,</hi> all whiche are faulsly fled to the enemie, bending their force against those, which of right they should defend as friendes, although they haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselues professed enemies, and against all conscience drawing theyr swordes to cutte their countreimens throates, such is the crueltie of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
<pb facs="tcp:26270:9"/>
that it spareth none for profit. And suche force hath the desire of gaine in some mens heartes, that they will refuse no fraude or deceite, that maye bring them any commodity, be the déed neuer so tretcherous, neuer so villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and neuer so cleane contrarie to conscience, in so much that it hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some to betraye their owne Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, to sell their Cuntries, yea, father and frendes, and all for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Nay further, Couetousnes was the cause that Judas solde the Sauiour of the world, his owne déere maister into the handes of his enemies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Couetousnes is iustlie called the roote of all mischiefe.</p>
            <p>But to leaue this matter, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to consider the present estate of this wofull country, which hath béene so manye yeeres plagued with cruell warre, that ther is no place which hath béene frée from the enemy, wherby the people is brought in suche a case, that they knowe not where to remaine in

safetie. To daye they may bée in good estate, to morrow cleane vndone, their houses burned, and themselues infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to flie for safegard of their liues: no man can sleep in saftie in his own bed, no man can inioy the fruite of his own labours, but all thinges in so great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the enemy, that if they enioy <unclear>the loot</unclear> thereof, it is more then they looke for, and not onely their goodes is in such sorte to be spoyled, but also the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues made as slaues, their wiues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished, and their daughters defloured, and that many times before their face, which is no small griefe to behold.</p>
            <p>And therefore howe muche are wee bound to our good God, which doth so blessedly keepe vs in peace, and so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously defend vs: notwithstanding so many traiterous practises deuised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs by moste lewd wretches, the consideration whereof may worthely moue vs vnto thankfulnesse with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayses to his name, whiche is our only defendour against al our foes, and therwithall pray vnto his Maiesty
