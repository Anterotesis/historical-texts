            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Fable of the Bat and the Birds. In Imitation of that of the <hi>Buzzard</hi> in the <hi>Hind and Panther.</hi> In the year 1689.</head>
               <l>IN ancient times, as learned <hi>Aesop</hi> shows,</l>
               <l>'Twixt Birds and Beasts a fatal War arose.</l>
               <l>But whether this from State Intrigues did flow,</l>
               <l>Or to some Church pretence its birth did owe,</l>
               <l>Or depredations made, concerns us not to know.</l>
               <l>Weighty, you may be sure, the cause was thought,</l>
               <l>Which such an universal tumult wrought.</l>
               <l>Picqueering parties first began the fray,</l>
               <l>A sad presage of the ensuing day.</l>
               <l>At last the War was solemnly proclaim'd,</l>
               <l>The hour of fighting set, and both the Leaders nam'd.</l>
               <l>The foolish Bat, a Bird obscene and base,</l>
               <l>The scorn and jest of all the feather'd race;</l>

               <l>As fortune wou'd, on an ill-fated day,</l>
               <l>The Beasts drew out their forces in array:</l>
               <l>The different kinds their grudges laid aside,</l>

                  <salute>My Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AN humble Servant of yours here in Town, Monsieur <hi>Borne</hi> by name, is so fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the reality of your Reformation, that he expresses himself in these terms to all that have the honour to know you.</p>
               <p>I dare venture my own Salvation upon the same bottom with that of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> so firmly do I believe the sincerity of his Conversion.</p>
               <p>Conversion, says Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> to him, have a care what you say: People don't use to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54064:60"/>
now adays so easily. This new reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you talk of in the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is owing neither to you, nor me, nor yet to any man living.</p>
               <p>'Tis a new Friend of his, but one that has been dead, the Lord knows how many hundred years ago, that has very lately brought about this miraculous change that so surprizes us.</p>
               <p>I mean <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> the most delicate man of his age, for Poetry, Painting, and Music. One that perpetually studied and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued pleasure, one that turn'd the day into night, and the night into the day, but at the same time so absolute a Master of himself, that whenever his affairs requird it, he was one of the most regular men in the Universe.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who has long ago resembled him in a thousand other qualities, was resolved of late to imitate him too in this. Thus I have shown you, Monsieur <hi>Borne,</hi> from whence proceeds this alteration in his Grace's Life, which you it seems have mistaken for a Conversion.</p>
               <p>But with both these Gentlemens leave, I shall account for it after another manner.</p>
               <p>'Tis a certain Maxim with me, that no man of a nice palat can love vice, when once it ceases to be agreeable, so for my part I don't wonder that a person of so refin'd and delicate a taste, as your Grace, takes up with the virtue of Continence in the North, where you have no
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54064:60"/>
objects to tempt and disturb you. But I dare engage that if we had you here in Town, and showed you some of our topping Beauties, that have charms enough to conquer the most insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we shou'd soon find the new Convert of Monsieur <hi>Borne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s new <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to be nothing in the World, but the true genuine Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heaven forbid that I should ever be so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly given as to disswade your Grace from so comfortable a quarter as Love. But I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin to propose to you, which of your self you wou'd never guess, and yet I recommend it sincerely to you, and from the bottom of my heart. I confess it has a Scurvy name, and the World calls it <hi>Covetousness,</hi> however it would be of more advantage to your Grace, than the Wisdom of Philosophers, and the glory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. To be short, I should rather chuse to see your Grace copy any of the Heroes in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardstreet,</hi> than either <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Caesar.</hi> Where the difficulty is great, the merit of surmounting it is great. Now all the World knows that your Grace will find it infinitely more troublesome to you to imitate the former, than the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>As we don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54064:61"/>
you to deny your self every thing, amongst so great an affluence as surrounds you All I begg of your Grace is, that you wou'd have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye upon your City friends, that have the fingering of your Money, to keep them honest in spite of themselves. For unless out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to their Souls, you hinder them from play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knaves, I dare swear for them that they wou'd venture damnation a hundred times a day, and all in your Graces service.</p>
               <p>And now if you think it worth your while, when you come next to <hi>London,</hi> to bring a small retinue with you, but a great deal of money in your pocket, you will certainly be the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole Nation. If you neglect this advice, the greater part of the World will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be for you, and you must content your self with a few admirers in private, of whom I shall always be the first, who am</p>

But let the effect be what it will, I am too much in the interest of your Beauty, not to inform you, that you'll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure it extreamly, should you be so ill-advised as to set off, and adorn your self after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of the Court Ladies on the Queens Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Let others of your Sex make use of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for, properly speaking, they are but so many artificial helps, which we employ to cover the defects of nature, or else to give us some agreements that are wanting in our persons. But Heaven be praised, Madam, you lye under no such necessity. Every ornament that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon you, hides a charm, as every orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is taken from you, restores you some new graces, and you are never so lovely, as when we behold nothing in you, but your self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:54064:62"/>The greatest part of the Ladies lose themselve very advantageously under their dress. How many indifferent faces pass well enough with Jewels and Diamonds, and Conquer hearts by Candle-light, that wou'd make a very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry figure without them. The richest Necklace in the World wou'd have an ill effect upon you. It wou'd make some alteration in your person, and every alteration that happens to a perfect Beauty, wou'd certainly be for the worse</p>
               <p>Leave others then to ruin themselves by their Jewels and other Decorations; nature that has been at so vast an expence to frame you, has saved you that charge. You, Madam, wou'd be very ingrateful, and we shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d discover but a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed taste, shou'd we not be equally content, with that profusion of gifts she has heaped upon you.</p>
               <p>I wou'd counsel you, Madam, to take the same measures on her Majesties Birth day, which the famous <hi>Bussi d' Amboise</hi> formerly observed at a Tournament. Being informed before-hand that all the Noblemen of the Court designed to put themselves to an extraordinary expence in their Equipages and Cloaths, he ordered those of his retinue to be drest like Lords, and appeared himself in the plainest dress in the World at the head of so rich a train. The advantages of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were so conspicuous in the person of <hi>Bussi,</hi> that he alone was taken for a great Lord, and the other Noblemen, that relyed so much upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54064:62"/>
the magnificence of their habits, past but for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
               <p>Govern your self, I beseech you Madam, by the Example of <hi>Bussi</hi>: Let your Women be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired like Dutchesses, but as for your self appear in the ordinary dress of a Country Nymph, with nothing but the charms of your Beauty to recommend you: All the Ladies will be taken for your Women, and the plainness of your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit will not hinder you from out-shining all the Queens in the Universe.</p>
               <p>I have no great inclination to tell stories, which perhaps is nothing but the effect of an ill-grounded Vanity, that makes me prefer the expressing of what I imagine, to the reciting of what I have seen. The profession of a Story-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sits but awkwardly upon young People, and is downright weakness in old men. When our wit is not arrived to its due vigor, or when it begins to decline, we then take a pleasure in telling what does not put us to any great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of thought. However, I will for once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the pleasure, which I generally take in my own imagination, to recount to you a short adventure, which I once saw happen at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During my residence in that place, some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Daemon,</hi> put it one day into the head of a certain Count and his Friend, to draw the eyes of the Spectators after them. To put which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54064:63"/>
noble design in execution, they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that their dress should have all the magnificence which this part of the World was able to give it, and at the same time discover the goodness of their invention.</p>
               <p>The Count, who was one of the nicest men of his age, had a thousand singularities to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him. He had a Plume of feathers in his Hat, which was buttoned up by a Diamond, the largest that cou'd be found, for this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He wore about his Neck some Point <hi>de Venise,</hi> which was neither a Cravat nor a Band. 'Twas a small Ruff, which had serv'd him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly instead of a <hi>Golille</hi> when he liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the Ghost of Antiquity haunted his memory, so he cover'd his ankles with Buskins, but infinitely richer than the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> used to wear them: on which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From his Hat down to his Vest, 'twas all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and odd and fanciful. By the latter you wou'd have taken him for the Count <hi>de Serini,</hi> or some Beau of Quality dropt out of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> world; and an old Picture of <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Scipio</hi> had inspir'd him with the noble thought of wearing Buskins.</p>

A most prodigious Cravat-String peep'd from under his Chin, the two corners of which, in conjunction with a monstrous Perriwig, that wou'd have made a <hi>Laplander</hi> sweat under the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Pole, eclipsed three quarters of his face. In short, he was so be-ribbon'd all over, that one would have thought all the Milleners in the place, had joyned their Stocks to furnish him.</p>
               <p>This, in short, was the equipage of our <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs,</hi> when they made their appearance in the <hi>Voorhout,</hi> which is the place where persons of Quality use to take the air, and divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>They were scarce enter'd upon the spot, when multitudes ran from all hands to gaze and stare at them; and as every body was surprized at so fantastic a scene, they cou'd not tell at first whether to admire it as extraordinary, or to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule it as extravagant. In this uncertainty of thought, as they were going to determine it one way or another, Monsieur <hi>de Louvigni</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the place, and put a stop to their grave Contemplation. He wore a plain black suit, and clean linnen made up the rest, but then he showed one of the finest shapes, and most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54064:67"/>On the other hand, the old Marchioness, who was a perfect Stranger in it, not only took every occasion to receive them, but was always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, that she had not respect enough paid her.

No body's name cou'd be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to her, but still she found something to blame in their Conduct. Then she was the most imperious Devil alive to her Servants, none of her Women ever lived a full fortnight with her.

               <p>If any one now shou'd ask me the question, which of these two I thought to have the most Religion, I shou'd immediately declare my self in favour of the young Marchioness, and yet to see how partially the World judges of Persons, the young Lady passes by common consent for a Woman that is wholly devoted to the World, and the other is universally taken for a Saint.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how easily the World is imposed upon, by a fair outside, and glittering appearances. 'Tis true your persons of sense see through these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ten thousand Fools that always assist to deceive themselves.

I don't know the Gentleman, replys another Lady, but if he is what the World represents him, I dare not answer to my heart, that I cou'd maintain it long against him. This latter spoke her Sentiments honestly, and without reserve, whereas the other was a dissembling Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette that had buried two Husbands, and was looking out for a third, and if warmly attacqu'd, wou'd, I dare answer for her, swallow a temptation without making wry Faces, as readily as an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am none of the best comforters in the world; however, yours is so common and easie a case, that any one may set up for a Doctor, and pretend to prescribe Remedies for it. You send me word you are a Cuckold, and desire my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54064:69"/>
upon the matter: why is this a time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Cuckoldom. You ought to have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled your self to that point long ago, before you ventur'd into the Holy State, and not to mortify with the thought on't now, when you can't help your self. A Soldier should consider before he lists himself, how he can bear the loss of an arm or leg; if he meets with an unlucky shot, 'tis but the chance of War, and if he comes off in a whole skin 'tis more than he cou'd expect, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence used him better than he deserv'd. The Oracle in <hi>Rablais,</hi> to which you are no stranger, long ago declar'd, that every married man either has been, or is, or will be a Cuckold, and cou'd you ever hope to elude an Oracle? For my part, 'tis no more than what I expected to hear of you every post: you have been long jealous of your Wife, and now it comes home to you, for jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy does as naturally ripen into Cuckoldom, as a Catterpillar into a horned Insect call'd a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly. However, you have got this by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that it has cured you, God be thanked, of your jealousy, which is one of the worst tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a man can have; and who would not bear with a sawcy Companion to get rid of the Devil. But after all, what you complain of is no disgrace, you share it in common with the <hi>Caesars</hi> and <hi>Pompeys,</hi> and most of the Heroes of former Ages, and with the <hi>N—</hi> and <hi>M—</hi>  of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides an infinite number of Dukes, Marquisses,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54064:70"/>
Earls, Bishops, Knights, Aldermen, Deans, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Heads and Governors of Colledges and Halls; and who wou'd regret to be joyn'd in so good a Company?</p>
               <p>But <hi>your Family's dishonour'd,</hi> and so perhaps it has been twenty times since the Conquest. I told you before I had no extraordinary hand at comforting. A thousand other Families have been subject to the same calamity, and why you should expect to fare better than your Neighbours, I don't understand. <hi>But if I had deserved it from my Wife.</hi> Why so much the better still: Other people use to comfort themselves in their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, by reflecting upon their innocence, and why should not you? If your Wife has a fancy to go to the Devil let her ne're lose her longing: rather than that shou'd happen, do by her as <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth is said to do by a flying Enemy, build her a Bridge to go thither.</p>
               <p>Well, but <hi>what would you have me do?</hi> you say <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> have been so often prescrib'd to people in your condition, that I won't offer them to you. My advice is then, that you'd come to Town as soon as you can, and take a Lodging in <hi>Cheapside</hi> or near <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there I'll pass my word for't you'll be thought no monster: tho you unmannerly folks in the Country stare at a Cuckold, as much as here we do at a Kings Evidence just after a new Plot, yet <hi>London</hi>'s a civil place, and we think him no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54064:70"/>
here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if your affairs won't give you leave to come to Town, my next advice is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliate upon your Neighbours, plant Cuckoldom as thick as you can in your Hundred; and for that end get in with the Aunts, the Nurses, and Midwives; but above all, secure the Church, and get the Clergy on your side. When your num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are grown pretty considerable, make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into the next Hundred, and so on, till you have made the whole County of a piece. When you have effected this, you'll be above the reach of scandal, your multitudes will protect you, and then you'll live as comfortably, as we do here in <hi>London.</hi> But <hi>what shall I do with my Wife</hi>? I have already told you; Build her a Bridge, and lose no time. I am,</p>

               <p>'TIs a sign I am never weary of keeping a correspondence with you, since I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to do it at this terrible juncture, when the Ink friezes as I write: But you must expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else from me but what you would hear in every Coffee-house, were you in Town, and that is, to be entertain'd about the Frost. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people here are of opinion, that the Northern Monarch, who has done us the honour of a visit, has brought his own Country Weather along with him, and they confirm it with a very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; for they remember that when the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> Ambassador was here, we had the hottest Summer that ever was known. Thus, according to these merry Philosophers, every Foreigner that comes to see us, takes care, like <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> to bottle up some of the Air of his own Climate, and retails it among us here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54064:71"/>It has been a general complaint, that all the Seasons but winter have been of late inverted. Mr. <hi>Flamsted</hi> you know has pretended that the Sun has been out of order this good while, and a friend of yours, who loves dearly to sit up a nights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what was the reason that he never saw him, replied, that he cou'd not endure to see sick folks. 'Tis no wonder that he can do no more in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> since for eight years last past, he has not been scarce able to maintain his Summer Quarters, and Winter has had the impudence to bully him even in his own Dog-days. Indeed, if he decays in proportion to what he has done of late, the Lord have mercy, say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to leave off these metaphysical contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions— If this severe Season lasts many days longer, it will as effectually try the orthodoxy of peoples constitution, as the new A—concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing K. <hi>I—</hi> will shew who is <hi>Stanch</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and who not.

the wiser; but the Devil is in him if such search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weather (which penetrates deeper than the Inquisition) does not extort very unlucky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions from his Carcass, especially if in his younger days he studied natural Philosophy in <hi>Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> I can't tell how it fares with you in the Country, but here in Town Water is scarcer than its opposite Element, Fire; so that 'tis dreaded by some understanding persons, that a stop will be put to Bap—m for some time, unless the C—y can get <hi>Moses</hi>'s Miracle of striking Water out of a Rock, or unless the C—ch will dispence with the use of <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> in that case, as some will tell you they do in <hi>Norway,</hi> where at this time of the year Water is as great a rariety, as truth is at <hi>W—</hi> and most of the Courts in Christendom all the year round.</p>
               <p>A friend of mine happen'd yesterday to be in a Tavern Kitchin near the Custom-House, and complaining of the cold; Lord, says a Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him, this is nothing, Sir, to what I have felt, no more, as Gad shall judge me, than a Tooth-picker is to the Mainmast of the <hi>Britannia</hi>

As ill an opinion as the World unjustly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of our Females, I am very well satisfyed that there are above Forty Thousand Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Wives, within the Bills of Mortality, that would have lost all, before they would have taken so rash and insnaring an Oath. How is it possible that a Woman should positively swear to an imaginary thing, which may be lost (the Lord knows how) between sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? This I am sure of, that no Husband was ever a jot the securer, for prescribing Arbitrary and Unlawful Oaths.</p>
               <p>Yet as great a hardship as this may seem to be, it is nothing in comparison, of what hardships are practis'd in some Countries, even after the Nuptial Ceremonies are performed. Thus we find in the said Book <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>that among the Greeks, of the Women find in the Bed the next day any signs of a lost Virginity, they make a great Feast; but when that is wanting, they say nothing, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom sending back the Bride to her Relations and Friends.</hi> The same inhuman Custom, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise observ'd by the <hi>Persians,</hi> as the Reader may see, <hi>p.</hi> 64. <hi>by the</hi> Moors <hi>of the</hi> Morocco, <hi>p.</hi> 73. <hi>the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of</hi> Fez, <hi>p.</hi> 75. <hi>by those of</hi> Algiers <hi>and</hi> Tunis <hi>p.</hi> 79, <hi>by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>who retain this Custom from the</hi> Moors, <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54064:77"/>
that was always demanding Signs, and Tokens; nor among Infidels and <hi>Mahometans</hi>; but that any Christians, that are happily freed from the Levitical Bondage, should still hanker after the old superstitious Leaven, is matter of the greatest astonishment to me. I cannot but reflect with horrour, how many Ladies in <hi>England</hi> that now live comfortably with their Husbands, and are blessed with a numerous issue, had been Shamefully discarded and sent home, if ever such an unrighteous Fashion as this had got footing among us. It seems to argue a great deal of Cruelty in the Men, that they shou'd relish no pleasure but what comes at the expence of their dearest Consorts. But it is my daily Prayer, that Providence will protect the Freeborn Women of <hi>England,</hi> from such bloody minded Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
               <p>But tho' the greatest part of the World, are so extravagantly fond of Virginity, yet we find there are some People that have other Notions of things. Our said Author <hi>p.</hi> 88. accquaints us, <hi>that when one of</hi> Conchin <hi>Marries, whosoever he is, he may not lie with his Bride the first Night, but is obliged to give her to a</hi> Bramino, <hi>who lies with her, and that they believe this to be a favour and a good Omen.</hi> I hope their Parishes in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are not of a large extent, otherwise the Priest has more Work upon his Hands, than he will go through with, unless he keeps a Curate
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54064:77"/>
or two to relieve him, when Marriages come in thick. The holders forth of our Conventicles, affect to be thought great pains-takers, and really deserve the name, for their Bands will testify for them both in the Dog-days, and out of the Dog-days, that they Sweat exceedingly. But, Alas, what is this, if considered in the same Scales with the drudgery, that these Priests undergo in their Ministry. I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the Popish Clergy that stand up so stiffly for the divine Right of First-fruits, don't Troop in shoals to this Kingdom, when they Voluntarily pay such an extraordinary Tribute to the Church.</p>
               <p>'Tis observable, that in most Countries of the World this Ceremony is perform'd by the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who, if they equally pretended to the power of <hi>Loosing,</hi> as they do to that of <hi>Tying,</hi> they would have more Business upon their hands than they cou'd well dispense with. Only in <hi>Turkey</hi> married People are joined together by the <hi>Cadey,</hi> or Civil Magistrate, and here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time by a Justice of Peace; the Reason alledg'd for it then was, that none was so well qualified to Marry others as he, who, by his Office was Impower'd to lay People by the heels, and put them into the Stocks.</p>
               <p>As I have already taken Notice, <hi>Virginity</hi> is reckon'd so Essential to <hi>Marriage</hi> in several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that the poor Bride is Inhumanly dismiss'd,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54064:78"/>
and sent home to her Relations, if she be found defective in that particular; but, in this Author, we shall find, that all the world is not of this humour, in <hi>Pegu,</hi> of the Marriage Ceremonies, p. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. <hi>the King, and those of the greatest Quality, lye not the first night with their Wives, but admit others and pay them bountifully, that will give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the trouble.</hi> With all due respect to our Women be it spoken, I humbly conceive that one half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at least, of the married Men in this Kingdom, if they would speak their minds freely, must do their Wives this Justice, as to own that they sav'd them this Porters drudgery, as a Monarch (not inferiour to <hi>Solomon</hi> for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) rightly call'd it. Our Neighbours of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before they came to be civiliz'd, used to lie the first night with the Bride, their Vassal, but now they have flung up such a troublesom piece of State, and make their Tenants drudge for themselves.</p>
               <p>We rail at the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not without reason, for exacting implicite Obedience from her Sons, but alas, what signifies it to take a few Articles upon the Credit of the Priest; but to take a Wife, as our Author tells us they do in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and other places, without seeing her once, or knowing what Defects she may have, is somewhat hard upon the Subject. Heaven be prais'd, that here in <hi>England</hi> we are not forced to buy a Pig in a Poke, nay, there
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54064:78"/>
are some married Men in the World, that were as intimately acquainted with their Wives before Marriage, as ever they were after. See now what it is to live under a free Government, and to have <hi>Magna Charta</hi> on one's side.</p>
               <p>To conclude these Reflections, it is my hearty advice, That all unmarried Persons wou'd chuse themselves proper Spouses by the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in order to recruit those numbers that have been destroy'd in the wars, and not suffer their Talents to lie buried in a Napkin, for which they must severely Answer one Day. And as for those that are Married, the best way they can take, as I presume, is to live as easy as they can, and following the good counsel of <hi>Hobson</hi> the Carrier, so to manage themselves, as not to tire before their Journeys end.</p>

               <p>I Find by your answer, that my advice had not that good effect upon you, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. You still complain of your unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and disturb your self and your friends with Chimera's of your own creating. If I thought complaining wou'd make you a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the better, I wou'd out-weep a Church-Spout, and out-lament a Widow that has bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd three Husbands, and now laments for a fourth: or if I thought you wanted any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cordials, I wou'd send you a Cart-load of Sermons, to teach you that patience, which the preachers of them cou'd never practise. But you are a <hi>Malade imaginaire,</hi> and <hi>Moliere</hi> wou'd sooner bring you to your self than a Divine. In short, think no more of the Viper that stung you, and you are well.</p>
               <p>You talk much of what people do in <hi>Spain</hi> upon these occasions. But what have you and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54064:79"/>
I to do with them? Are we to regulate our eating by the sots of <hi>Lapland,</hi> or to go naked in complaisance to the Salvages under the Line? Had you liv'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> perhaps I had preach'd revenge to you, and out of my great concern for your person, advis'd you to venture the Gallows, because forsooth your Wife with the sweat of her brows had earn'd damnation. But since you live in a Country, where the people are wiser than to be enslav'd by such foolish notions, pray suffer yourself to be govern'd by the maxims of it. I tell you once more, Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oldom is no scandal in our Nation, and if you were the first and ancientest — in <hi>England,</hi> I cou'd say no more to you. If 'tis the rarity that makes the Monster, you'll never come within the number of them. 'Tis only the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd men that are not Cuckolds, that, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking, are the Monsters here, as in <hi>Guinea,</hi> 'tis not those that have huge Lips and flat Noses, but those that have them otherwise are really the deform'd.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>Romans,</hi> who may be suppos'd to have had as just sentiments of honour, as the nicest <hi>Dons</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> were guided by wiser Maxims. In case of Infidelity, the Wife was sent home with infamy to her virtuous relations, but no manner of disgrace reflected upon the Husband. <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Conqueror of so many Kings; <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Father of Eloquence; and

To undeceive you then, the Theatre is not so overstockt with ungodly Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as you may believe. <hi>Rablais</hi> somewhere saith, that the very shadow of an Abbey Steeple is enough to get a woman with Child; and I can tell you for your comfort, that the shadow of the Theatre is starving; and the air of it as naturally produces poverty, as that of the hundreds in <hi>Essex</hi> begets Agues. There was a Woollen-draper in the <hi>Strand,</hi> that unhappily dreamt but of a Candle-snuffer of the House, who is at least four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from a Poet, and the poor fellow broke within a week after.</p>

His Father, like a wise old Gentleman, design'd him for the Bar, but the giddy Fop flung up that profession, and set up for a Wit; but observe, I beseech you, what he got by the exchange. By some of his foolish Verses he drew the Emperors displeasure upon himself, who sent him a grazing to teach him more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and so he liv'd a miserable fugitive, <hi>in partibus infidelium,</hi> where he had leisure enough to curse the versifying Planet which betray'd him to these extremities. One or two perhaps in the compass of six thousand years have made their fortunes by it, but is this any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you to betake yourself to <hi>Apollo</hi>'s high road? What man of ordinary sense wou'd hazard his All in a Lottery, in hopes of meeting a Benefited Ticket, where he has forty thousand to one odds against him.

So that if you abandon so rich a soil, to starve upon a barren Common, the very Stones in <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> like the blood of the Recorders Horses, will rise up in judgment against you. After all, if you are not master of Philosophy enough to set your self at liberty, and cannot entirely shake off the Rhiming disease, let me advise you as a friend, to trespass that way in private; let not your Mistress, nor so much as your Bottle-companion know any thing of the matter, but when the Writing fit is upon you, do it with as much prudent circumspection, as discreet Thieves when they are going to commit Burglary.

               </head>

                     <hi>Cousin</hi> John,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu have done two very adventurous things of late. You have taken a new House, and a new Wife, and all in the compass of a week: not having the fear of some late Acts of Parliament before your eyes, which have made House-keeping so very chargeable. After this convincing proof of your boldness, shou'd you take a Lion by the Whiskers, it wou'd not surprize me. For, Cousin, to deal plainly with you, you have set up in a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous time, when tis fall of the Leaf with poor Tradesmen all the year round. The Taxes run high, but never was there such an ebb of Money since the Creation. Drunkenness, the Lord be praised, notwithstanding all that the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54064:97"/>
new Reformers have done to it, still makes a shift to maintain its ground: If it leaves one liquor, it takes up with another, like the Sea, which, what it loses in one place, gains some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else. All the Nation, to give them their due, wou'd be drunk if they cou'd, to forget their sorrows; but alas, not one quarter of the Nation can afford to be at the expence of it. The situation of things being thus at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent writing, you ought to manage your self with more than ordinary discretion, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make a figure in this transitory world.</p>
               <p>In the first place, lay it down for a fundamental rule, never to trust, or at least as seldom as you can. But when you commit that folly, let it not be with men, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by their dignity or character, or (what will not be unseasonable advice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to one that lives in <hi>Covent garden</hi>) with the Wits, who are protected from paying by their poverty. The less Faith you have for other people, the more Charity you shew for your self; for let the P—sons say what they I will, never knew man of any profession justified by Faith. Rather than venture that, cheat as much as you can, I mean in a lawful way, and when you have got an Estate then 'tis time enough to think of compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your sins with Heaven by building of an
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54064:97"/>
Hospital, according to the laudable and ancient practice of the City. If you have a mind to be sav'd by your Faith take my advice, do it by wholesale, but never by small parcels. In the mean time get Money and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Trade, for that (as a wise Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man long ago observ'd) is the Law and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Secondly, consider, that the Trade of a Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er is a perfect mystery, (for that is the term the Law bestows upon it,) now as all mysteries in the world are wholly supported by hard and unintelligible terms, so you must take care to christen your Wines by some hard Names, the farther fetcht so much the better, and this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy will serve to recommend the most execrable Stumm in all your Cellar. A plausible name to an indifferent Wine, is what a gaudy title is to a Fop, or fine Cloaths to a Woman, it helps to conceal the defects it has, and bespeaks the world in its favour. Men naturally love to be cheated, particularly those of our own Nation, for the honour of old <hi>England</hi> be it spoken, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the imposition is not too bare-fac'd, will meet you half way with all their hearts. I cou'd name several of our brethren to you, who now stand fair to sit in the Chair of Justice, and sleep in their Golden Chains at Church, that had been forc'd to knock off long ago, if it had not been for this artifice. It has sav'd the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54064:98"/>
                  <hi>Sun</hi> from being <hi>eclipsed,</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>abdicated,</hi> the <hi>Rose</hi> from <hi>Decaying,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> from being <hi>drawn dry,</hi> and both the <hi>Devils</hi> from being confined to utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. If your own invention is so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, that it wants to be assisted, or you have not Geography enough to christen your Wines your self, I advise you to buy a Map of <hi>Spain, Portugal, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and there you will find names of places, fit for your purpose, and the more uncommon they are, they'll be the more taking. Neither is this piece of policy only practiced in our, but in most other Trades. A Bookseller to help the sale of a dull Pamphlet, will spruce it up with a most glorious Title, and tell you the Edition is almost sold off, when he has five hundred lying dead upon his Hands. A Perfumer will pretend that his Essences came from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> or <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> tho he made them at home. The Glover talks of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and the Mercer of <hi>Naples,</hi> till their Lungs are foundered, when both their Commodities were of <hi>London</hi> extraction. And what harm is there in all this? If the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleased otherwise, we must in our own defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOu have used yourself with greater cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty than the most barbarous Tyrant durst have done, had it been your ill fortune to come within his power. <hi>Algiers</hi> itself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts no such punishment upon its vilest Slaves, as you have voluntarily and freely imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yourself. <hi>Mezentius,</hi> so execrable in History

for tying the living to the dead, reserved this inhumane usage only for his Enemies: As brutal as he was, he never dreamt of using his friends in that manner, much less himself. Yet you, Madam, have thought fit to practise it upon one, who to my knowledge deserved a better treatment at your hands.</p>
               <p>All the Town was melancholy upon the news, but especially those who are in the Interests of Beauty, lamented as heartily, as some pious people do when they hear of a Christian Town fallen into the hands of the Infidels. And that we fear is your case, for if a man has no other way of shewing his Faith but by his Works, 'tis concluded by all sides that your lot is fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a person who is as nearly related to an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, as an Informer is to a Villain.</p>
               <p>I have lately read over some of the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies, where innumerable instances are to be found of persons of both Sexes, who in a fit of devotion practised strange austerities; but none of them come up to you, even of those, who, for the singular mortification they enjoyn'd themselves, have been advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We meet with frequent instances of young Virgins that have leapt into the flames to make profession of their belief, and courted death in its most terrible mein, as eagerly as other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do a Coronet and a Title. Some have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

the sick in Hospitals, and in the midst of affluence and plenty, have deny'd themselves the conveniences of life, and mortify'd in Sack-cloth. Some after the Priest has done his office, have refus'd to receive the lawful tribute of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and some have oblig'd themselves to a perpetual silence, which is certainly self-denial enough in a Woman. Others have injur'd their own Beauty to preserve themselves from the Courtship of their Lovers, or from the lust of Tyrants. But, alas, what proportion does this bear to what you have done? Death puts a period to all our miseries: but you have given a greater proof of your constancy, by resolving to live. You have confin'd your self to a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infirmary, and nothing but providence can give you a discharge.

of tasting. You, like <hi>Sysiphus,</hi> take an infinite deal of pains to no purpose, to roll a Stone every night, which is no sooner <hi>up,</hi> but it <hi>falls</hi> down of itself, and will do so to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Tho I need not exaggerate your own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you, who are so well acquainted with 'em, yet as a Divine sometimes explains the effects of Drunkenness to his Parish that know them as well as himself, give me leave to lay down part of the persecution you undergo before your Eyes, that through you the world may know what you endure.</p>
               <p>The night approaches, but the night which bountifully rewards the pains of other Lovers, proves but the beginning of your misery. Even the Bed, where all the marry'd world besides find happiness, or at least a relaxation from their pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Scene where you suffer most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically. That old solemn piece of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, call'd your Husband, leads you to this place of real Martyrdom, but no execution, with his head muffl'd up in an infinity of Caps, and his Lungs, lest Musick should be wanting to the entertainment, are sure to serenade you all night long. Thus he disturbs your repose, but has nothing about him to reward you for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you awake. If he has got his Cargo of Wine in his guts, he snores by your side as heartily, as <hi>Garagantua</hi> and the Monks in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54064:104"/>
                  <hi>Rabelais</hi> do after they have rocked themselves asleep, with singing the penitential Psalms. But if in spite of impotence and age, he pretends to disturb you with his vigour, his shot scarce reaches the Walls of the Fortress. Thus your fate is just the reverse of <hi>Semeles</hi>; she generously expir'd in the arms of the Thunderer, whereas your Fumbler chills you with his warmest em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; his very flames gives you an Ague fit, and like the weather we have had of late, his Summer has a spice of Winter in it. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on't is, that every day will leave him a worse practitioner than other, and time, which uses to soften other hardships, will daily make yours more insupportable.</p>
               <p>What is it then that cou'd induce your Lady-ship to pitch upon so rigorous a pennance, which your very Enemies, (were it possible for you to have any) wou'd never have impos'd upon you? Since your Body can be no gainer by this wicked match, one would imagin you did it for the benefit of your Soul; but Religion produces no such miracles in this age, whatever it has done formerly. 'Tis enough now if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stick to it while they get by the bargain; for few, very few, even of those that wear her Cloath and eat her Bread, will be losers for her.</p>

<q>Quid prodest brevitas, dic mihi, si liber est.</q>
That is to say, what the plague is a man the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the shortness of a Distich, if he obliges himself to read a whole Cart-load of them; so he desires to know where lies the mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a Whore above a lawful Spouse, if the Spark keeps constant to her; and if he does not, where is the sense of keeping her in pay.</p>
               <p>Mr . . . . exprest himself against the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant sin of Keeping, to this effect. Of all the vices the present age is to answer for, nothing comes near it, and yet the Sots make merry with Marriage; which is full as ridiculous as if Dr <hi>Chamberlain</hi> should laugh at the Bank of <hi>England</hi> for paying people in Paper. If Marriage is expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, Keeping is certainly more, and with less pretence. I knew, says he, a Gentleman that lov'd Gaming as he did his eyes. One night he lost a hundred and fifty Guinea's at the <hi>Groom-Porter</hi>'s. When he came home he found his Lady in the Parlour, with two Candles burning before her. Lord! Wife, says he, what a strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance is this: Two Candles lighted at a time, and house-keeping so chargeable? But he forgot,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54064:112"/>
it seems, what his shaking of his elbow had cost him that evening. This is the case of all Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; what our Churchmen charge the Dissenters with, is actually true of them, they startle at a Gnat, but can swallow an Elephant.</p>
               <p>Right, says <hi>Harry</hi> . . . . Keeping is the greatest Solecism a man of pleasure can commit, If the Gallant is true to his Mistris, it has all the Phlegm, and if he is fond of her, all the expence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. In short, I have an equal aversion to Marriage and Keeping. They differ only like <hi>Holbourn</hi> and <hi>Cornhil:</hi> Both are streets. But to do Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> justice, the latter is nothing near so long as the former.</p>
               <p>That is as it happens, crys virtuous Mr . . . for I can show you several persons about the Town that parted fairly with their Wives before the first month was over, and yet cou'd endure to cohabit with their Harlots many years. But imagination governs all these matters. For my part, I think of Women as I do of Books, the finest of both sorts will hardly endure a thorough examination. If they find more savour than this, they may thank the Courteous Reader for it, who sees more in them than they deserve. I remember I took Mr <hi>Waller</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Denham</hi> last Vacation down with me into the Country. I read them over, and what was a consequence of that, I was weary of them. You may laugh at me for a man of a vicious palate, but I can't help that.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54064:112"/>
Before I came to Town I was glad to borrow <hi>Wesley</hi>'s execrable Poem of the Parson of the Parish, only for variety.</p>
               <p>Tho I am not wholly of your opinion, says Mr . . . . to him, yet I agree with you that Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is nonsense all over, and that for a reason which none of you have yet assign'd. Sir <hi>Henry Wooton</hi>'s Definition of an Ambassador in part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him. <hi>Legatus est vir bonus ad mentiendum foris Reip. gratia.</hi> And a Keeper is a good man to maintain a pretty woman in fine Cloaths, handsome Lodgings, and all that, for the public benefit of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Mr . . . . the Merchant is in our company, who has travell'd abroad, and seen the world: He says that a Whore in the Civil State is what Farthings are in the business of Trade, only to be us'd for the convenience of ready Change. But that a Man, that makes a Whore, if not his constant Wife, yet his constant Companion, and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that makes Farthings their only current Money, will soon be convinc'd of the vanity of their politicks. And he said <hi>Ireland</hi> was lately a sad instance of the latter.</p>
               <p>What vexes me most, says . . . . is to hear these Keeping Coxcombs magnifie themselves upon their discretion. I save charges by it, crys one —</p>
               <p>Yes, replies his neighbour, they are as much savers by the bargain, as one that goes down to <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or the <hi>Bath,</hi> to save his expences in
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54064:113"/>
Town. But since this point has been spoken to already, I will say no more to it. Only give me leave, Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to capp the story of the two Candles, with another like it. A brace of Country Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or a Term or two, they drank to the tune of eleven Pints. At last one of them call'd for a <hi>French</hi> Roll: Why Brother, says the other, are you not asham'd to inflame the Reckoning? Let the Keepers apply this.</p>
               <p>Well, but I scape Confinement by it, says ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—I don't know that, says Mr <hi>N—</hi> for I think a man is as much a Prisoner by a Gout or Rheumatism of his own begetting, as if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had confin'd him. What signifies it a farthing to one in this case, whether the Priest tyes the knot, or he does it himself? 'Tis true, the confinement of Keeping does not last so long as that of Marriage, but it devours more in a month than the other does in a year. It's like falling into the hands of the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> or a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> where the Fees run so high, that you spend more in a few weeks, than wou'd handsomely maintain you in another Prison all your life. But to see by what Chimera's the world is manag'd. Matrimony is Hell in Folio, because it's a charm that can't be dissolved when a man pleases. At the same time those that Keep can sometimes submit to a confinement full as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54064:113"/>
long and severe; yet bear it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asily, because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth 'tis of their own ordering. This puts me in mind of the famous Citizen of <hi>Paris,</hi> who had passed threescore long years within the City-walls, and never had the least inclination to make a step into the Country. So soon as he heard that his Prince had commanded him never to stir out of it, he discreetly dy'd with the thoughts of being a Prisoner. There are Penitents in <hi>Spain,</hi> who on certain days of mortification lash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as heartily as any of our <hi>Newgate</hi> Rogues are whipt by the public Executioner. 'Tis certain the pain and anguish are the same. But one does it voluntarily, and the other cannot help it. What pretty Salvos a fruitful imagination can find out</p>
               <p>Thus far, Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> we have given you our thoughts of Keeping in general, without descending to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; but now we come to consider your own case more nearly. To the surprize of all your friends, you have pitch'd upon a Daughter of the Stage, upon an Actress, to show your particular favours to; and pray be pleas'd to hear what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> company thinks of it.</p>
               <p>Mr . . . who next to Mr <hi>Rymer</hi> is the best Historian about the Town, says that this transaction of your life will be bound up with the Annals of <hi>Goatam</hi> in the next age; because to pretend to confine a She-Player to one's self, is altogether of a piece with hedging in a Cuckow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:54064:114"/>Mr . . . . the Poet first mentioned, prov'd out of the antient Records of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> that all Actresses belong to those of his Profession; and that if a Lay person pretended to lay his unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd hands upon her, he was guilty of making an Impropriation, and ought to be indicted in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Spiritual Court.</p>
               <p>Mr . . . . of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who, tho he never goes to <hi>Westminster,</hi> is nevertheless an Oracle of the Law, pretends that your Case comes within the Statute of Monopolies, that you have done as bad as inclosed a Common, and that all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ought to break down the Fence.</p>
               <p>'Tis but fit it should be so, cries another, for he that pretends to confine a Damosel of the Theatre to his own use, who by her character is a person of an extended qualification, acts as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, at least as unnatural a part, as he that wou'd debauch a Nun: that after all, such a Spark rather consults his Vanity than his Love, and wou'd be thought to ingross what all the young Coxcombs of the Town admire and covet.</p>
               <p>Captain . . . . ended this serious debate. He said, that whoever gave pay to a Woman or a Souldier expected they should prove faithful to him. Now, continued he, to expect fidelity from a Female that has been rais'd up in that Hot Bed call'd a Play-house, is to expect honesty from an Evidence. 'Tis a folly not to be excus'd. 'Tis
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54064:114"/>
to bottle up Air, like <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s Virtuoso. 'Tis to wash a Blackamoor. 'Tis to make Dr <hi>Otes rectus in curia.</hi> 'Tis, in short, to grasp at more than attaining an impossibility; for 'tis impossible to secure any other Woman to your self, but much more an Actress.</p>
               <p>Thus we have sent you, Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> the opinion of the <hi>Committee</hi> of our whole House upon this occasion. You are desired to consider of it cooly by your self; and when you have so done, if 'tis possible repent; otherwise do like some of our Divines when they contradict what they formerly asserted, and stand buff to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tom</hi> . . . . wou'd have you meet us to morrow night at the <hi>Rose,</hi> where he pretends to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack you with so many arguments against the Female Sex, that he does not question to make you a Proselyte to the Bottle.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Find I have a whole <hi>Posse Comitatus</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; but I rely so much upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Cause, that without calling in the assistance of my Brother-Keepers, without giving my self the trouble to repel numbers by numbers, I don't question but that I am able in my own single person to maintain the field against you.</p>
               <p>You are divided, Gentlemen, like all other Assemblies, in your opinions: Some of you seem to favour Marriage, but declare against Keeping: Some of you denounce War equally against both, and consequently must set up for Fornication at large. I make this Inference, because my Charity won't suffer me to believe that any of you are such rank Infidels as to discard the Sex by wholesale. If I thought you had any of that complexion among you, yet I should not think it worth my while to dispute them into better sense. 'Tis an old re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceiv'd
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54064:115"/>
Axiom, you know, that <hi>contra negantem Principia non est disputandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the former Gentlemen, I mean those that have some respect for Marriage, but are utter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Keeping, they wou'd oblige me to prove that lying at an Inn, where a man stays no longer than he finds himself well used, and the place agreeable, is half so chargeable or foolish, as stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there all one's life, let the entertainment be what it will. There are certainly degrees in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and the <hi>Fleet</hi> is not altogether so Pagan and uncomfortable a place, as <hi>Sally,</hi> or <hi>Algiers.</hi> Oh! but Imagination governs all these matters. If, as we have frequent instances of it in History, Imagination can kill as effectually as a Blunderbuss loaded with a dozen Bullets, deliver me, I say, from the hands of that Tyrant Imagination. But tho this is answer enough to so trifling an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet, Gentlemen, I will prove that there's something more than bare Imagination in the case. A Miss's Patent runs <hi>durante bene placito,</hi> and she lyes eternally at the mercy of her Patron. A Wife has a Lease of your Body for term of Life, and has no such obligations upon her to keep within bounds. One like an open Town can make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and consequently has no Temptation or Interest to rebel. A Wife is a sort of a Garrison, fortify'd by Law and Act of Parliament, which the Soveraign can't dismantle when he pleases. She lies secure behind that unrighteous Bulwark
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54064:116"/>
call'd a <hi>Settlement,</hi> which is made as strong as the <hi>Westminster-hall</hi>-Engineers can contrive it, and tho she's never so plainly convicted of revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her lawful Master, and holding an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Enemy, she forfeits neither Life nor Limb; nay, she can challenge a subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as long as she lives. This, I think, shews with a witness that there's a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Marriage and Keeping: but to dismiss this point, were a Wife never so sincere, and never so submissive, yet there's a Duty in the case. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what I say Gentlemen, there's duty in the case, in which single word there's dulness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, and death and desolation, and, in short, every thing that inspires horror, and casts a damp upon pleasure. 'Tis as bad as the <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> on the Wall, the very name carries a Palsy with it. It puts people upon unlawful evasions, it makes them think on other folks, when their thoughts shou'd be at home, and leads them to commit downright Adultery in the Nuptial Sheets.</p>
               <p>Even that Pink of Courtesie, Sir <hi>Iohn Falstaff</hi> in the Play, who never was a niggard of his Lungs, yet wou'd not answer one word when the <hi>Must</hi> was put upon him. <hi>Were Reasons,</hi> says that affable Knight, <hi>as cheap as Black-berries I wou'd not give you one upon compulsion,</hi> which is but another word for Duty. And now we are upon this Chapter, Gentlemen give me leave to copy from you, and tell you a short sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A Nobleman, who shall be nameless, in King
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54064:116"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time kept a Chaplain, that was a Rakehell enough in all Conscience. He wou'd break windows, kick and cuff, get drunk and swear, and do all the boisterous things you can think of, as uncanonically as any of his cloath. This fellow had not liv'd a full month with my Lord, by the same token that they kept him as hot as a Glass-house all the while, but, weary it seems of his reception, he came staggering into the Room where my Lord was drinking with some friends; faith my Lord, says he, you and I must part, before <hi>George</hi> we must. Why so, Doctor, have not I us'd you with all the civility—You mistake me, my good Lord, I love Drunkenness as well as ever a Peer of you all; but a plague I hate the thoughts of being forc'd to mount the Guard every night, I hate to be confin'd to it. You make Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a Duty, my Lord, and consequently a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and I'd have you know I hate all Virtue—Pray let me advise you to think of this at your leisure.</p>
               <p>I come now to those worthy Gentlemen, who are against Inclosures of all sorts, and fall upon the first Game they can start. Not to call their judgments in question, which they never put to the expence of choosing for them, I wou'd fain be inform'd why a man shou'd be so fool-hardy as to expose himself to the <hi>fortune de la guerre,</hi> when there's no occasion for it; or what

               <p>YOur barbarous and unjust usage of me has had this good effect, tho I am not at all oblig'd to you for it, as to make me a very good Christian. I was in a fair way to commit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, Madam, you have absolutely cured me of this superstitious blindness, and now I can plainly discover the Fiend, where I imagin'd a little before, that nothing but a Goddess in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
               <p>Since my eyes have been thus open'd, I can look upon the fairest of your Sex, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the least emotion in my heart, and the most beautiful Woman of Heaven's making, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects me no more than one of Sir <hi>Godfry</hi>'s. Nay, in some respect the Copy may be said to exceed the original. It has as fair and charming an outside, but nothing of that vanity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54064:119"/>
nothing of that Hypocrisie, Malice, and Dissimulation, which make up the compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other.</p>
               <p>I dare appeal to yourself, who are none of the most impartial Judges in the world, whether I ever said, or did, or writ one misbecoming thing to you. Passion, perhaps, which intoxicates no less than Wine, might betray one to some exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but still they were to your advantage, on which score you were oblig'd, if not to forgive them, yet at least to bury them in silence. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver approach'd you but with a sacred awe, and always represented a Divinity to my self, when ever I took Pen in Hand, to acquaint you with the sentiments of my Soul. If my incense was not of the first sort, (for I am humble enough to believe, that you might have receiv'd much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a thousand other hands) yet the sincerity of him that offer'd it, ought to have cover'd him from your displeasure. Tho you dislike my flame yet in common Charity you might have suffer'd it to expire in its own Urn. If you were resolv'd to punish it for aspiring so high, one single frown would have extinguisht it, or at least secur'd you from being troubled with it any longer: but to divert yoursel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o think of the miseries thou must endure this Summer, is as bad as going up to the Monument. It has made me giddy, confound me else, and my head turns round like a Weather-cock. In the first place, to lye in a damn'd sneaking Tent, where you can scarce turn yourself round, with no Curtains to your Bed; nay, not so much as a Looking-glass in its lowest signification: then no other Pulvilio to scent your Perriwig, but the dust of the Plains and Gun-powder, and to stink worse of the latter, than <hi>Cheapside</hi> did formerly on a Lord Mayor's Day, upon those unrighteous things call'd Marches, no such convenience as a Chair to be got. For your comfort, <hi>Tam,</hi> you must walk through thick and thin with no Waiter behind you to clean your Shoes, among a herd of skirtless Rascals, that stink worse than Pole-cats. Oh let me think no more of them. Besides, 'tis a million to one, that walking thus in the Sun, will dignify your Face with some Pimples. Horrid and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous!
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54064:121"/>

               <p>To come now <hi>Tam</hi> to the Field of Battle, those ill-bred whorson things call'd Bullets, are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specters of persons. A pox on them, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no distinction between a fine Gentleman and a Dragooner. Perhaps it would not grieve a man to lose his life upon a good occasion, (I speak this by way of supposition only) but to survive the untimely fate of one's beloved Wig, to see one's embroider'd Coat mangled and hack'd, is enough to break the heart of <hi>Hercules</hi> if he were alive, and had a true sense of things. To disswade you, if 'tis possible, from embarking in this pernicious affair, let me conjure you as a friend, to reflect upon Sir <hi>Iohn Foppington</hi>'s Case.

                  </gap>y, that the Parliament never made a five mile Act to banish such prophane Villains out of all Corporations, as once they did the Dissenting Ministers. But so it happen'd as I tell you, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All this while we endeavour'd to soften his calamity to him, by re-minding him of the inconstancy of human affairs. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed his memory with stories of Kings deposed, and famous Monarchies subverted, but 'twas all in vain; he could not be perswaded to live, till the Scowrer had taken his Oath before a Justice of Peace, that the Coat was not a farthing the worse. Nay, this was not enough, the Taylor was sent
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54064:122"/>
for to confirm the Scowrers deposition; and the Woman of the House, who saw him put it on in the morning, must swear as she hopes to be sav'd that it was not in the least injur'd.</p>
               <p>If this melancholy instance, <hi>Tam,</hi> is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deter you from your wicked resolution, and you have no bowels of compassion for the issue of your own fancy, meaning your Cloaths; pray retire for a moment or two to your Closet, lay your hand upon your heart, and ask it cooly and soberly, how it would rellish that most extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary accomplishment, a wooden Leg. Think what a decent figure you'll make in a Ladies Chamber, with so fine a qualification. Good Lard, a wooden Leg! 'Tis almost as charming as the Devil's Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Foot. A Lover made of Flesh and Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and of Timber below, what an odd compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is that! The <hi>Minataur</hi> in the Fable, who was half Man and half Beast, was a Cherubim to him. Or <hi>Tam,</hi> if this does not mortify you, pray consider that there are certain impudent things in an Army call'd Guns, that without asking any questions, will demolish a mans Nose, or run away with one of his Arms, or carry off half his Teeth an Under-jaw, and yet there lies no action against them for it. Such blessings as these are to be had in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with due care and application; and <hi>Tam,</hi> you may see several Heroes about the Town, who purchas'd them at no little expence of time and blood at <hi>Steenkirk</hi> and <hi>Landen.</hi> But, <hi>Tam,</hi> if you have any Guts in your Brains, you'll never long to make one of the number.</p>

As for me, confound my <hi>glandula Pintalis,</hi> if I am not of <hi>Will Essence</hi>'s opinion, the greatest Genius that <hi>Covent Garden</hi> ever produc'd, for exquisite dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, who us'd to say, for his part he knew not what a mans head was good for, but to hang his Hat or his Perriwig on, and that if it were put to his choice, he wou'd as soon lose that as any other part about him; that the chief end of man was to dress well; and death itself was not so formidable as a <hi>Dishabille.</hi> But whether does this subject hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, or how came that sower monosyllable Death in our Pens way? Faith <hi>Tam,</hi> I dare trust my thoughts no longer with so melancholy a Theme. So hoping you'll be so kind to yourself, as to consider more of this matter.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in the Country, TO HIS Friend in the CITY. <hi>Leeds,</hi> Feb. the <hi>2d.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have at last, with much Difficulty, procured you a Copy of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> Anatomiz'd, which you have so long, and with so much Importunity desired of me: All I can learn of the Paper is, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Calculated it for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>York,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54064:125"/>
as I take it, (the Magistrate of which place in the Year 44, was a famous <hi>Ambidex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) and that it will equally serve for any Corporation within his Majesty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but I will not detain you from it any longer.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> is a walking <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> of Religions, out of whom all the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Heresies</hi> might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily retrieved, though the Volumes of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Ross</hi> were lost. He thinks no part of a <hi>Church</hi> sacred but the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Cock,</hi> and honours the Memory of him that Invented A Wind-mill, because it can <hi>Grind</hi> indifferently with <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> He talks much of <hi>Moderation,</hi> yet is as hot as one of his own Custards, and as <hi>Choleric</hi> as a Hasty-pudding; he's as <hi>Positive</hi> in his own single Self, as an Assembly of splay-mouth'd Divines; <hi>Geryon</hi> and <hi>Cerberus</hi> were only <hi>Types</hi> of him, but though he has three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Independant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Presbyterian,</hi> and a <hi>Church of England</hi> Head, yet he has not <hi>Brains</hi> to furnish any one of them. By his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Gravity</hi> one would think he had <hi>Long Ears,</hi> but 'tis certain he has none, for he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54064:125"/>
is Deaf to the <hi>Cries</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi>; and though he devours Widows and Orphans at a Morsell, yet he has no Bowels. His <hi>Conscience</hi> is as unaccountable as a <hi>Modern Hypothesis,</hi> which spares Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, and dissolves the hardest Mettals; for it starts at an <hi>innocent Ceremony,</hi> when it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to digest <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Oppression.</hi> 'Tis impossible to frame an <hi>Oath,</hi> but what he'l readily Swallow to gratify his <hi>Ambition.</hi> He calls them <hi>State Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> takes them for his Interest, and breaks them for his Convenience; he calls God to witness, and yet believes nothing of his Existence, like the Fellow in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s <hi>Amphitrio,</hi> that Swears by <hi>Hercules</hi> before he was born. <hi>Trade,</hi> with him, is the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Text, he's resolved to serve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> together. Had he lived in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> he'd have gone to the <hi>Christian</hi> Assemblies one day to save his Bacon, and to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Temples the next to secure a Stake against a <hi>Pagan</hi> Revolution. The Men of <hi>Gotham</hi> are Registred for a pack of Fools, for endeavouring to hedge in a <hi>Cuckow.</hi> Is it not then a scurvy Reflection upon a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54064:126"/>
certain wise City's care for Religion, to pitch upon a Chameleon for its Head, who changes his Colour as often as he shifts his place? 'Tis pitty that our Laws, that Order so honourable a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for plurality of Wives, have not made the same wholesome provision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst plurality of Religions. He rails at <hi>Superstition,</hi> and pretends to stand up for the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>; but though we read that the Apostles were Fishers, they were not Watermen, to look one way and row another.</p>
            <p>He is very severe against the Bakers, and punishes them upon every Occasion; not for Cheats, for as such he honours them, but only to show his Skill in the History of the Bible, where he finds it was one of that Profession that first han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell'd the Gallows. He designs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Annals of his Government with something Extraordinary, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a Name as <hi>Herostratus</hi> did of old, by <hi>Inflaming</hi> the Church. <hi>Stow</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingshead</hi> that took such pains to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Calves with six Legs, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Births; if they had lived in our Age, What a strange Account would

they have given of this Triple-headed Beast, that exceeds all the Monsters that ever were shown in <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, that ever <hi>Afric</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?</p>
            <p>When his Dullness is mounted on Horseback, he makes me think of some Ancient Coats of Arms, where the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters are of the same Species with the Beasts in the Scutcheon. If the City, to give another Instance of their Discretion, should chuse <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or a Taylor under the <hi>Line</hi> where they all go Naked. He preaches up Temperance at his own Table, but is <hi>Harpy</hi> incarnate when he can Devour on Free-cost, and hates no Sins but those that are Expensive. He shews his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Poor, by providing Prison-room for them; and for fear they should Dye of Surfeits, takes care to let them Blood with a Dog-whip.</p>
            <p>In his own single Self, he out-does all the strange Changes in <hi>Ovid's Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis. Oedipus</hi> himself, were he alive, could never unriddle him. The Satyr that quarrel'd with the Fellow in the Fable, for blowing Hot and Cold succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively with the same Breath, What would he say to our Flea-bitten Magistrate, that can do both at the same Instant? If he varied his Body, as often as his Soul tacks about, no Taylor could fit this <hi>Posture Clark</hi> in Religion, but he that made a Manteau for the Moon. In vain he promotes a Reformation, who ought to begin it at home, and stands up for the Sabbath, which no one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes like himself, for he Teach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Parsons in the City can ever hope to preach down. He is of several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but of no Religion, as we say of Hermaphrodites, that by being of both Sexes, they are indeed of none, and can neither conveniently receive Love, as Women, nor Act it vigorously, as Men. He pretends to hate Divisions, and yet encourages Schism, which he foolishly judges to be Expedient for the State, as the Women on the other side of the <hi>Tweed</hi> refuse to be cured of the Itch, because, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, it is wholsome.</p>

               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image had a Head of Gold, and Feet of Clay. Our Idol has a Skull as soft as Pap, to a Face of Brass, and Arms of Iron.

            <p>I wonder with what pretence he can punish Beggars, who is himself the most inexcusable Vagrant in the Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

single Element can never content him. He alters his Shapes according to the Company he is in, like those experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Sharpers, who when they are at Court would pass for Good City Security, and when they are in the City, would be thought to have an Interest at Court. When he thinks his Authority will bear him out, <hi>Lucifer</hi> is less Haughty and Absolute; at other times he's as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive and Humble, as a <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> Vintner in the Long Vacation. But who would not bestow a Cudgel upon this fawning Cur, that will leap over a Stick for the Pope's Nuncio, and next minute do the same for a Crop-ear'd Tub-drubber?</p>
            <p>He goes to a Sermon with the same Intent, as the Prisoners in <hi>Ludgate</hi> go to the Grate, only to shew his Chain; or, as the Beaux go to a Play, not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Manners, but hear himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. But though he sees Hypocrisy lashed every Sunday, he stands all the Fire the Parsons flash at him, like a Managed Horse: He's convinced that 'tis a Cowardly Scoundril Sin, yet he won't part with it, because it brings

him in Gain: As I knew a Fellow once, that had Aches all over his Body, which punctually foretold all Changes in the Weather, yet could not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be Cured, because he would not lose his <hi>Almanack,</hi> as he call'd it. Had this Linsey-wolsey Brother lived under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, how finely had he been trounc'd, for plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus with an Ox and an Ass, and dividing himself so nicely between a <hi>Cassock</hi> and a <hi>Cloak.</hi> He revives the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Penelope,</hi> still Unravelling what he had done before, and Unlearning under one Teacher what he Learn'd under another.</p>
            <p>The poor Cully in <hi>Aesop,</hi> with his two loving Wives, one of which clear'd his Head of the Black, and the other of his Gray Hairs, till at last they left him none between them, is a true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of him. The different Churches he goes to will so Weed and Purge him by degrees, that they won't leave him a Rag of Religion to cover his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. With him, as in the Creation of the World, the Evening still goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Morning; for though he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54064:129"/>
his Morning to the <hi>Establish'd Church,</hi> yet in his heart he's at the <hi>Meeting,</hi> and his Thoughts still run upon his After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon's <hi>Extempore</hi> Repast. Thus he is guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> even when he seems to Assist at the publick Service; like the Man that committed <hi>Adultery</hi> with his own Lawful Wife, by thinking on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I never see him at the Cathedral, but he makes me think of an <hi>Algerine</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out <hi>Christian</hi> Colours. Indeed, if the Churches were shut up, something might be said for his going to the <hi>Barn,</hi> for even <hi>Horse-flesh</hi> we know was lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This last place puts me in mind of his extraordinary House-keeping, though so great a Gormondizer of Spiritual Food, which costs him nothing, yet very little will content him in his own Kitchin. By the power of good management, he can
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54064:129"/>
extract three Meals for himself and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily out of one single Shoulder of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which piece of Frugality he learn'd, I suppose, from the Story of the Welch Sherriff, that converted an old Cloak first into a Coat then a Wastcoat, and last of all into a pair of Breeches. I have heard of a Gentleman, who, purely to save his Money, would take a Coach that cost him Twelve Pence to be Trimm'd by a Two-penny <hi>French</hi> Barber in <hi>Soho.</hi> The City perhaps, with equal Discretion, chose him to Husband their Stock; but by starving the Poor, he has put the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes to such Charges in Burials, that they are not like to save any thing by him; unless as old <hi>Chiron</hi> was, both a Tutor and a Pad-nagg upon occasion to <hi>Achilles,</hi> so they make the Beast serve them in a double Capacity, that is to say, both as their Horse and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>
            <p>I have been told of a Man that had a very bad Memory, so very treacherous and unfaithful, that if he had made an Assignation in the morning, he was sure to forget it long before the hour came. Well, says he, to prevent this for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54064:130"/>
I am reseolved to buy a <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>-Book, But what was he the better for it? He soon after forgot that he had bought any such Director to relieve his Memory. This is the Case of our <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian</hi>: When those of his Party are under Hatches, then all his Discourse runs upon Christian forbearance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention, and never a Passage in the Old or New Testament escapes him, that makes for that purpose. But when they are mounted, and in the Saddle, the Tables are turn'd, and he lays about him like Thunder and Lightning, and forgets that Persecution is the Mark of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> 'Tis true, all the while he devours you, he cants of Moderation, and pretends he does it unwillingly, but this is only a Copy of his Countenance. He first tears you asunder, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did <hi>Isaiah</hi> of old, with the wooden Saw of a dull heavy Speech: But who wou'd not rather chuse to make a Breakfast for a generous Lion, than to be Eaten by a weeping Crocodile?</p>
            <p>For my part I wonder that the Priests of the different Churches he repairs to, don't execute a piece of Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54064:130"/>
upon him, and truss him up for a <hi>Spy.</hi> But I suppose hee keeps in with all, by telling them severally in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that each performs best; like the Harlot, in the Play, that was kept by three Gallants, and told each of them in private, that he was the Person that gave her the most Satisfaction. 'Tis next to a miracle to me, that the Priesthood, who are so sharp-sighted upon other Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, don't see through the thin Artifices of this bare-fac'd Impostor, and dart the Thunder of the Church upon a Wretch who pretends to be a Friend to all, and yet is an Enemy to the whole Tribe. I hope none of the Prophets have given it him under their hands, that 'tis no Sin to go to the Temple of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> But this present Contending between the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perswasions to secure him to their Party, gives me a perfect Resemblance of an <hi>Ant-hill,</hi> where there is the same lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and tearing, and struggling about a dead Fly.</p>
            <p>In short, our <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> is a Retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to all Churches, but a Member of none; and will never have the Benefit of his Clergy, though he pretends to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54064:131"/>
make his Court to all the various Sorts of them. 'Tis an unthinking Sot, that keeps the Streets cleaner than his own Conscience. At last, every Body finds out his Disguise, and despises him; and as several Cities formerly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who gave Birth to <hi>Homer,</hi> so, in his case, all <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Congregations</hi> strive who shall Disclaim him first. Though he has a middle Station here, he must not expect one in another World. <hi>Lucifer</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can pay him the Wages of his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy, in whose Clutches we leave him.</p>
