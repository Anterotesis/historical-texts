            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

directeth him, what manner of persons he
is to ordaine Ministers. Prouing from the
weight and excellencie of the calling, that
not euery one that desireth this office, is to
be preferred thereunto: but such a one as
<hi>Elthu</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 33. 23.</note> scarcely acknowledgeth to be <hi>one of

goe before, but follow the calling of God.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21742:4"/>
For their calling is but declaratiue, as
the Schoolemen speake, whereas Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is effectiue. And therefore men ought
by their calling to declare none fit for the
Ministerie, but such as God by his calling
hath made fit. <hi>The office of a Bishop,</hi> saith
<hi>Paul,</hi> is an excellent function, a glorious
calling, a worthy worke: therefore he that

                  <p>The Antecedent <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth by

                     </gap>, that is, by
way of preuention. For as the othes, which
the holy Ghost interposeth any where in
the Scriptures, doe argue our infidelitie; so
these asseuerations doe presuppose in vs
some contrarie and erroneous conceite.
As if the Apostle had said: Although car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men, whose<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> wisdome is enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, doe basely esteeme of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

Indeede it is, and alwaies hath been, the
lot and condition of Gods Ministers in
this world, to be contemned, scorned and
abused. The Prophets, who were the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours

                  <p>Against this carnall conceite of profane

testimonie of Gods spirit speaking in the
Apostle, and prefixed as a preface, to win
both attention and credit to this text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21742:6"/>
Now followeth the antecedent it selfe.
<hi>If a man desireth the office of a Bishop, he desireth
a good,</hi> or excellent <hi>worke.</hi> In which words,
besides the commendation of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which is the maine intendment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
two things are briefely to be discussed.
The one, whether it bee lawfull for a man
to desire the office of a Bishop: the other,
what is the office of a Bishop, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
here doth so highly commend. Of
the former the Apostle maketh no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but taketh it for granted, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for a man to desire this function. <hi>For
what</hi> (saith<note n="p" place="margin">Homil. 10. in 1. Tim.</note> 
                     <hi>Chrysostome) doth the Apostle
say? If a man desire the function of a Bishop, I
mislike it not, hee desires a goodly worke.</hi> For
first, when men consecrate themselues, as
<note n="q" place="margin">Numb. 6. Amos 2. 11.</note> Nazarits, to the studie of diuinitie, they
doe it in this desire: which, if it bee a desire,
as well to doe the worke of the Ministerie,
as to obtaine the honour thereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
is without doubt most acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. And afterwards, when God hath
blessed their studies, and fitted them for
this function; this desire and willingnes to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21742:6"/>
exercise their gifts, and to employ their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
is a part of their calling from God.
For God calleth men, partly inwardlie by
himselfe, not onely furnishing them with
those gifts which appertaine to the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of a Minister, but also giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
<note n="r" place="margin">Rom 1. 15. 1. Pet. 5. 2.</note>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or willing readines to imploy their
gifts: and partly outwardlie by his substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
to whom in his Church he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the power of calling, ordaining and
admitting Ministers. The Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Esay 6. 6. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> when his tongue had been touched with
a coale from the Altar, and hee had heard
the voice of the Lord, saying, <hi>VVhom shall
I send,</hi> he offereth himselfe and saith, <hi>Ecce
me, Behold, here am I, send me.</hi> A desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to glorifie God in the seruice of the
Church, and a signification of this desire,
when a man is fitted for the calling, is
not onelie lawfull, but also commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The greedie and ambitious desire of
them, who either are not willing, or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to glorifie God in the Ministerie, is that
which is to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>As touching the second, it will be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21742:7"/>
that the calling of a Bishop, being a
function of great authoritie and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in the Church of God, is indeede an
excellent and worthie worke; but what is
this to other Ministers, who are subiect to
the Bishops? I answere, by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, wee are in

                     </gap>, the person, not onelie of such as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
since the Apostles times haue proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been called Bishops, (howsoeuer this

the Fathers:) but of all Pastors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the word and Sacraments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
Which interpretation may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by conference of this Scripture with
<note n="u" place="margin">Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7.</note> Tit. 1. where the same Canon being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,

whence we may gather, either that by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

the names being as yet confounded,
as <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> suppose: or at the

spoken of the dutie and dignitie of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

doe also appertaine to Presbyters

                     </gap>, why Presbyters be not expressely

the Fathers seeme to be diuided in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the word Bishop, some
of them by Bishop vnderstanding euery
Presbyter; others, those who properly are

both of Presbyters and Bishops, that is to

vnderstoode. For<note n="x" place="margin">Theod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Theodoret,</hi> though hee
say, that by Bishop euery Presbyter is here

though they vnderstand this text as spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them who properly are called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
yet they say, that in the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Presbyters are also included. Here by
the way we are to note, that if the names of
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the writings of the
Apostles bee confounded, as <hi>Ierome</hi> and
<hi>Theodoret</hi> teach, and many in our times not

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21742:8"/>
Tit. 1. Phil. 1. 1. Pet. 5. confirme, in so much
as euery Bishop is a Presbyter, so euery
Presbyter a Bishop, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
phrase: then it followes necessarily,
that in the Apostles writings, there are no
Presbyters mentioned, but such as are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Ministers of the Word. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the phrase of the Apostles, hath
the perpetuall vse of this word been in the
Primitiue Church: there being, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
not any one example to be alleaged
out of any Councell or Father, where the
word Presbyter doth signifie any other
than a Minister or Priest. And if the like
shall bee obiected against Bishops, that in
the Apostles times there was no difference
betwixt Presbyters and them: I answere,
though the names of Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were for a short time confounded; yet
the functions were not, as I haue<note n="z" place="margin">In Apoc. 1. 20</note> elsewhere
shewed.</p>
                  <p>But to come to that, which, as I said, is
the maine intendment of these words: the
commendation, which the Apostle giueth
to the office of a Bishop, is, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21742:8"/>
worthie worke.</hi> He calleth it a worke, that we
should not imagine it to be an idle digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which when wee haue once obtained,
we might giue ouer our selues to ease and
securitie; but a worke full of imployment
and difficultie, wherein it behoueth Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
(who are the Lords<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 9. 38.</note> workemen) to
labour, and as the Apostle speaketh<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17. 1. Thess. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
that is, to labour vnto wearines. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it a seruile worke, or a base Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie;
but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a goodly and excellent
worke.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore doe here offer
themselues to our consideration, <hi>Onus &amp;
honos Ministerij:</hi> The burden and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Ministerie, both appertaining
to the greatnesse of this calling, and both
requiring, (which is the Apostles scope,)
a correspondencie of gifts in the person
of the Ministerie. For, in regard of both,
we may iustly vse that exclamation,<note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>and who is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for these things?</hi>
that is, who is able to beare this burden,
who is worthie to haue this honour? For
in that he calleth it a worke, that appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21742:9"/>
to the burden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that hee termeth it
excellent, that belongeth to the honour.
And these two are vnseparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For, <hi>honos &amp; onus: honour and charge</hi>
goe together. Whence it is, that the same
Hebrew<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> word signifieth both <hi>honorare &amp;
onerare.</hi> For whom God aduanceth vnto
honour, them hee doth burden with a
charge, and on whom hee imposeth a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to them he vouchsafeth honour. And
as they bee vnseparable, so also propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
For such as is the weight of the
burden, such is the height of the honour,
and contrariwise. These things therefore
which the holie Ghost hath vnseparablie
vnited, ought not to be separated, neither
by the Ministers themselues, nor yet by
the people. Desirest thou the honour of
the Ministerie, <hi>vt praesis,</hi> that thou maist be
preferred aboue others? thou must also
desire the worke of the Ministerie, <hi>vt prosis,</hi>
that thou maist profit others. For he, <hi>that
desireth the office of a Bishop, desireth an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
worke.</hi> Art thou discouraged with the
weight of the burden? so much let the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21742:9"/>
height of the honour which God hath in
this life awarded, and in the life to come
prouided for faithfull Ministers, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thee. As for the people: many care
not how great a burden they lay vpon the
Ministers, and how little honour they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them: as though their charge among
all callings could be the greatest, and their
honour the least. In a word, let vs on all
hands so acknowledge the dutie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the Ministerie to bee conioyned,
that the Ministers be as readie to performe
the dutie of the Ministerie, as to challenge
the honour: And the people as willing to
yeeld the double honour of reuerence and
maintenance to their Minister, as from
him to expect the performance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For <hi>what things God hath conioyned, let
no man seuer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how soeuer in vse these things may
not be disioyned; yet, that I may distinctlie
and orderly speake of them, I am for a
while to seuer them in my speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
first wee are to weigh the burden of the
Ministery. For that are we to vndergoe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21742:10"/>
before we can iustlie claime the honour.
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> Double honour indeed belongeth to the
Ministerie: of which, as the people must
count their Ministers worthie, so must wee
labour to be worthie. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>. And who are worthie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Ministerie? Surely they, which
beare, the burden, or doe the worke of the
Ministerie. The worke of a Bishop, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Apostle speaketh, is, as may bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to bee

                     <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 2.</note> exhorteth: 1. Epist. 5. Now what that is,
the Apostle sheweth, Act. 20. where hee
exhorteth the Ministers of Ephesus,<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> that
they <hi>would attend vnto themselues and to the
whole flocke, ouer which the holy Ghost had
made them Superintendents, to feed the Church
of God which he hath purchased with his owne
blood.</hi> The same he repeateth, though in
other words, 1. Tim. 5.<note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> Ministers are to
be accounted worthie of double honour.
But who? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>are good presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
especially they that labour in the word
and doctrine.</hi> For to feed the flocke, is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21742:10"/>
chiefe worke of the Pastor or Bishop, as
appeareth in all these three places. <hi>Feede
the flocke,</hi> saith <hi>Peter</hi> to the Ministers,
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, performing the Office of Bishops
or Superintendents, not as of necessitie, but
as willingly, &amp;c. But to speake more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
the worke of a Bishop or Pastor,
which, as I said, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>to be good

to be presidents of good workes. But
of this more, when I come to the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the person: vers. 2. To the flocke

                  <p>This burden of the Ministery, was after

                  <p>In regard of the people, the Ministerie

of those titles, wherewith Ministers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
in the word of God. Of the office
I am to speake, first, absolutely; then, by

                     <hi>feete of those which preach

the Gospell</hi> ought to seem beautiful vnto vs.
And the same may be confirmed, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>institution</hi> of the Ministery;
the <hi>eminencie</hi> of the persons who haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
this function; the <hi>excellencie of the
end</hi> for which it was ordained; and lastlie,
<hi>the dignitie of the parts,</hi> whereof it doth
consist.</p>
                  <p>First, therefore Ministers were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to supplie the office, and sustaine the
person of the Sonne of God, who is the
Word and wisdome of his father. For from
the beginning of the world vntill the time
of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Lord for the most part in his
owne person, performed the office of
preaching to his people. In which respect
hee is often called in the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi>
the<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 22. 11. 12 Exod. 3. 2. 4. 6. Gen. 32. 28. 30 &amp; Hos. 12. 3. Exod. 13. 20, 21 &amp; 1 Cor. 10. 9. Malac. 3. 1.</note> Angell of God, and elsewhere the
Angell of the couenant. But when the
Lord in terrible maner had published his
law from heauen, and the people, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to endure his voice, had humbly
intreated him, that he would be pleased to
speake vnto them by a Prophet: vpon this
occasion, the Lord ordained the publicke
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21742:13"/>
Ministerie, and<note n="z" place="margin">Deut. 18. 18.</note> promised a continuall
succession of Prophets, (into whose mouth
he would put his words,) which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
vntill Christ, in whom especially that
prophecie was verified. And againe, when
Christ was to ascend into heauen, hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the Ministers of the Gospell, as the
Embassadours of God, in his stead: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 20. 21.</note> that as his father <hi>had sent him, so he
did send them.</hi> For <hi>we</hi> (saith the Apostle)
<note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>are the Embassadours of God in Christs stead,
euen as though God did intreate you by vs, wee
beseech you in Christs stead, be reconciled vnto
God.</hi> The Ministers therefore were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to supplie the roome of Christ. Which
the Lord did, not that hee would haue the
Ministerie of the word lesse esteemed, then
if he should speake from heauen himselfe;
but that hee might by this meanes teach
vs after a more familiar manner, and might
make the better triall of our obedience.
For as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note n="c" place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that knoweth God,
heareth vs; and who is not of God, heareth
vs not.</hi> Our dutie therefore is, when God
doth speake vnto vs by his Ministers,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21742:14"/>
to set our selues, with <hi>Cornelius</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 10. 33.</note> and his
company, in the presence of God; and to
heare<note n="e" place="margin">1. Thess. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The word preached, not as
the word of man, but as it is indeede the word of
God:</hi> and to receiue the Ministers of God,
as the Galathians<note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 4. 14.</note> entertained <hi>Paul,</hi> as the
Embassadours of Christ, as the Angels of
God, yea, as Christ himselfe. For so hath
he said<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 10. 16.</note> to his Ministers, <hi>Hee that heareth
you, heareth mee; and hee that despiseth you,
despiseth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let vs also consider the excellencie
of those persons, who haue in former times
exercised any part of this function. And
here I could commend vnto you <hi>Noah,</hi> the
prince of the world, and<note n="h" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 5.</note> Preacher of
righteousnesse: <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> who was
both<note n="i" place="margin">Hebr. 7. 1. Gen. 14. 18.</note> a King and a Priest: <hi>Moses</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and Prince of Israel: <hi>Dauid</hi> a King
and a Prophet: <hi>Salomon</hi> that glorious King,
affecting the name of a<note n="k" place="margin">Ecclesiast.</note> Preacher. I might
alleage that the Kings among the heathen,
were also Priests. For hence it was, that the
Athenians and the Romanes, after they
had expelled their tyrannizing Kings, did
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21742:14"/>
ordaine to themselues, <hi>Reges sacrificos, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
Kings,</hi> because certaine sacrifices
among them, might not be offered but by
Kings. But what speake I of meere men?
The sonne of God, before his incarnation,
as you heard before, was the Angell and
messenger of God vnto his people: and
after he became flesh, he professed, that<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 4. 18. 43.</note> he
was sent to preach. And who knoweth not,
that he being truely and onely <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as
hee is our King, so also our Prophet, and
our Priest? And that, which yet more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
forth the excellencie of the Ministery;
Christ, who, as he was God, thought it no
robbery to be equall with God: yet as hee
was also man, he would not take vpon him
this<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4, 5.</note> honour to be our Priest, vnlesse hee
had been called thereto of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi>
was. Whereas therefore I said, that certaine
Princes haue been Prophets: you may well
thinke, that this is no greater credit to the
Ministerie, that Kings haue prophecied;
than it was commendation to the Kings
themselues, that they were Prophets. And
howsoeuer sometimes they haue been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21742:15"/>
with that part of the Ministerie, (for
euen<note n="n" place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 11. 19 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Saul</hi> sometimes was among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:)
yet might they not intrude vpon
the other functions of the Priesthood. And
therefore <hi>Saul,</hi> the King of Israel, for thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
himselfe into the office of the Priest,
<note n="o" place="margin">1. Sam. 13. 9. 13. 14.</note> was himselfe thrust out of his kingdome.
Likewise, when <hi>Huzziah</hi> the King of Iuda,
<note n="p" place="margin">2. Chron. 26. 16. 19.</note> presuming (his heart being lift vp with
pride,) to offer incense vpon the altar,
which was a function peculiar to the Priests,
the sonnes of <hi>Aaron;</hi> the Lord, not onely
caused a fearefull<note n="q" place="margin">Amos 1. 1. Zac. 14. 5. Ioseph. Antiq. Iud. lib. 9. c. 11.</note> earthquake, to testifie
his displeasure: but also presently smote
him with a Leprosie, and sequestred him
from his regall function. For<note n="r" place="margin">Hebr. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>no man,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he be, <hi>may take vpon him this honour,
but he that is called thereunto of God, as Aaron
was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come to the end of the Ministerie;
which is, to saue mens soules. Other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
respect the good of this life; as the
Magistracie, the maintenance of peace and
good order among the subiects; the art of
the Physition, the health of his Patient; the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21742:15"/>
profession of the Lawyer, the wealth of his
Client. But the end of the Ministerie alone,
is the saluation of Soules. For although
Christ hath performed so much as is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
for the saluation of all: yet none are
actually saued, but they onely, to whom the
benefit of the Messias is communicated.
Now the merits of Christ are applied ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie
by the Ministerie of the Word and
Sacraments: vnto which, for that cause, the
power of Saluation is ascribed. They
therefore who enioy the Ministerie of the
Word and Sacraments, let them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themselues infinitely bound vnto the
Lord; who hath visited them with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his people, and vouchsafed vnto
them the peculiar priuiledge of his visible
Church; in that he hath not onely sent his
Sonne to redeeme them, but also giuen
them those meanes, whereby the benefit of
Redemption may be applied vnto them.</p>
                  <p>There remaine the parts of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
which are two: the Leiturgie or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
seruice of God in the Congregation,
and the regiment of the Church. The Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21742:16"/>
hath three parts; the Preaching of
the Word, publike Prayer, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Sacraments. In the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word, as the duetie of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
so also the dignitie doth principally
consist: this being the chiefe worke<note n="s" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 12.</note> of the
Ministerie, for which<note n="t" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> double honour is
especially due vnto the Ministers: yea, the
<note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>worke of the Lord,</hi> in respect where of the
Ministers <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 15. 16.</note> Apostle
speaketh, that is, <hi>performing the sacred fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

                     </gap>, <hi>the co-workers of God.</hi> But the
worthinesse of this worke may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
if we consider the excellencie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and necessitie thereof. For what greater
honour can be vouchsafed to a mortall and
sinfull man, then to be the<note n="z" place="margin">Iob 33. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Angell</hi> or<note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 18. 20</note> 
                     <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour</hi>
of God in stead of Christ; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and sent of God,<note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 18. 20</note> to reconcile
men vnto himselfe, to iustifie them, and to
saue them? And hereby also appeareth the
exceeding profit and necessitie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the word. The profit, in that by
the preaching of the worde, men are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21742:16"/>
brought to saluation, and all the degrees
thereof. The necessitie, in that without it
ordinarily men cannot attaine to saluation,
no nor yet to any degree of saluation. For
whereas there are three degrees of saluation
in this life, our vocation, our iustification,
our sanctification: what one of these is not
effected by the Ministery of the word, and
what one of them is effected ordinarilie
without it? For whom God<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> hath elected,
them doth he call; neither shall any be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
(I speake of such as come to yeeres of
discretion,) but such as are, or shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Hence it is, that the Church, which is
the companie of the elect, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a
companie of men called. Now men are
called by the Ministerie of the<note n="c" place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 14.</note> Gospell,
seconded and made powerfull by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. For first, by it, our minds are
enlightned<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 1. 79. Act. 26. 18.</note> to see our owne miserie in our
selues, and the infinit mercies of God in the
mysterie of saluation by Christ. Secondlie,
by it, as by the<note n="e" place="margin">Esay 53. 1. Act. 26. 18.</note> arme of God, men are
drawne vnto him, that they may turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and beleeue in Christ. Neither
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21742:17"/>
is there any meanes in the world, so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to worke the conuersion of a sinner, or
to bring him vnto faith in Christ, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
of the word: by which if a man
will not be perswaded, neither will hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
though an Angell should come from
heauen, or a<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 16. 31.</note> man be raised from the dead.
For indeed the Ministerie of the Gospell,
is the<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>power of God to our saluation.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

therefore, as the Ministers be fathers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21742:18"/>
men; so are they also<note n="u" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11.</note> Pastors, to feed
them. And whereas sanctification consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
of two parts, a <hi>dying vnto sinne,</hi> and a
<hi>liuing vnto righteousnesse:</hi> the Ministerie
of the word, is as <hi>salt</hi> to mortifie our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
In which respect the Ministers
are called the<note n="x" place="margin">Matth. 5. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>salt of the earth.</hi> And in
respect of righteousnesse <hi>habituall,</hi> it is the
<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 10. 8.</note> word of faith, the<note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 8.</note> Ministerie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. 32.</note> word of grace, by<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 7. 17.</note> which wee are

it is the<note n="c" place="margin">Coloss. 1. 6.</note> fruit of the word preached, which
being sowne in the furrowes of good and
honest hearts,<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 8. 15.</note> bringeth forth fruit with
patience.</p>
                  <p>If therefore our vocation, iustification
and sanctification, which are al the degrees
of saluation going betweene election and
glorification, bee all of them wrought by
the Ministerie of the word: we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, worthily to bee called the
power of God to our saluation, and not
without good cause the power of sauing
mens soules to bee ascribed vnto it, and to
the preachers of it, as to the meanes and

continue therein; for this doing, thou shalt saue
both thy selfe, and them that heare thee.</hi> But
to conclude this point with the oracle of
our Sauiour Christ, sounding in the eares
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> at his conuersion, from heauen:
at which time he appearing vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> to
make him as he there saith,<note n="h" place="margin">Acts 26. 16.</note> a Minister of
the Gospell, setteth downe the end of the
Ministerie in these words, which containe
the summe of all that hath been said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preaching of the word. <hi>To
open</hi> (saith<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> he) <hi>their eies, that they may bee
turned from darkenesse vnto light, and from
the power of Satan vnto God,</hi> (there is voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<hi>that by faith in Christ,</hi> (for so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
the words, there being a comma in the
Greeke text after <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>they may receiue
forgiuenesse of sins,</hi> (that is iustification) <hi>and
inheritance among them that are sanctified:</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:21742:19"/>
there is sanctification, and glorification;
and all to be procured by the Ministerie of
the word.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore by the way diuers sorts
of men are to bee admonished. First, the
Ministers: that as they desire the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their people, whom Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
with his most pretious bloud, they
would not onlie bee diligent in preaching,
but also bee carefull so to preach, as that
their conscience may beare them witnesse,
that in their Ministerie they truely seeke
to glorifie God, in the saluation of the
people. Secondly, the people; that as they
tender the eternal saluation of their soules,
so they should be affected to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the word. For the<note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 13. 44, 45.</note> 
                     <hi>kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>
(so is the preaching of the Gospell cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
because it is the principall meanes to
bring vs to Gods Kingdome) <hi>is like a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
or a <hi>pretious pearle, which a man hauing
found, he will sell all that he hath to procure it.</hi>
Thirdly, they that doe hinder the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word: for seeing the word
preached is of such necessitie to saluation,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21742:19"/>
they which are an hinderance to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, doe also hinder the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of their brethren, which euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is bound by all good meanes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance.
Of this kind are they, who being
not of the Ministerie doe get into their
hands the liuings and possessions of the
Church. For where is want of liuing, there
will be want of Preachers: where Preachers
or Prophets are wanting, there prophesie,
or preaching faileth: and <hi>where</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Prou 29. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>prophesie
faileth, there the people perish.</hi> The people
indeede shall perish in their sinnes: but
their bloud shall be required at thy hands,
who hast been the cause of their spirituall famishment.</p>
                  <p>Such also are those greedie Patrons, or
rather latrons of Church liuings, who with
<hi>Gehezi,</hi> sell such things as none but Simons
will buy: who with the theefe, &amp; traitor <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
betray for <hi>quid mihi dabitis,</hi> the bodie of
Christ, which is his Church, into the hand
of blind and Pharisaicall guides: who with
<note n="m" place="margin">1. King. 12. 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> preferre to the
Ministerie, the <hi>skirts,</hi> or, as the Prophet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21742:20"/>
calleth such, the<note n="n" place="margin">Esay 9. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>taile</hi> of the people. But
these men as they imitate the practise of
<hi>Gehezi, Iudas</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> so let them
feare their end.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, such are those Ministers,
who hauing either no will, or no skill to
feede the people of God with the food of
life; doe notwithstanding for the milke
and fleece of the flocke take vpon them the
charge of soules. But let these and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
consider, that wheras they ought to be
resolued, not to hazard, or lose their owne
soules, though they might<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 8. 36.</note> gaine the whole
world: they to gaine, not the whole world,
but the tithes of some one parish (which are
as nothing in comparision of the world)
doe hazard not their own soules alone, but
the soules of the people, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
of the principall ordinarie meanes of
their saluation.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to my purpose: haue you
by your own experience found the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to haue been the meanes vnder God
of your vocation, iustification, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which are the necessarie forerunners
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21742:20"/>
of saluation? then, I dare say, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that to be true, which <hi>Paul</hi> writing to
<hi>Philemon,</hi> forbeareth to speake: that you
owe euen your owne<note n="o" place="margin">Phil. 17.</note> selues vnto them:
and that you ought to be affected to them,
as the Galathians were to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
giueth this testimonie of them, that they
were readie (if it had been possible) to<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> pul
out their owne eies to doe him good. But
if you be more readie to pull out their eies,
then to doe them any good; it is a manifest
argument, that as yet you are not sanctified,
not iustified, not called; and therefore not
to be saued, vnlesse these graces shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be wrought in you by the Ministerie
of the word. Which benefits if you doe
but looke for at the Ministers hands, you
cannot but honour and reuerence them in
the meane time. But if you neither haue
these graces, nor hope for any, wee must
count our selues blessed, when for our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and the discharge of our dutie, we are
of such persons hated and reuiled.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I thought good to speake
of preaching the word. Now are wee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21742:21"/>
brieflie to intreate of inuocation, and so of
the rest. For as in the preaching of the
word, the Minister is the Lords Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to his people: so in publicke prayer
he is an orator, and as it were an interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
for the people vnto God. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<hi>Chrysostome</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">De Sacerdot. lib. 6. cap. 4.</note> saith, that the Minister
<hi>performeth an embassage vnto God, not only
for his owne people, but also for the whole world,
as if he were an vniuersall father hauing care
of all.</hi> And <hi>Nazianzene</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Apolog.</note> acknowledgeth
it to be no small honour, to bee preferred
before others in neerenesse vnto God, and
to receiue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentship
of soules, and a mediation betweene
God and men:</hi> By which they stand, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 106. 23.</note> once did, in the breach: and for which,
as the Prophets were wont, so may godlie
Ministers now, bee worthilie called the
<note n="t" place="margin">2. King. 2. 12. &amp; cap. 13. 14.</note> horsemen and chariots of Israel.</p>
                  <p>I come to the Sacraments: whereof the
Ministers also are dispensers. For as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the word, which is as it were Gods
treasurie, the Ministers are his treasurers: so
in respect of the Sacraments, which are the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21742:21"/>
seales of God, the<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 4. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

which is by faith, they are the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Lords seales, whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God are assured, not of an earthlie
patrimonie, but of an eternall kingdome
in heauen. If therefore it be a great honour
(as it is indeede) to be the Lord keeper of
the Kings seale, which notwithstanding
hath vse but in temporall affaires: what
shall we thinke of their function, who are
the keepers of the heauenlie Kings seales:
which also serue for the confirmation of
spirituall blessings in heauenlie things?</p>
                  <p>Hauing spoken of the leiturgie, wee are
now to intreate of the regiment of the
Church. For to the Ministers the Church,
which is the spouse of Christ, is committed:
that hauing espoused her against the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
day, which is the day of iudgement,
they may present her<note n="x" place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 2.</note> vnto Christ the
bridegroome, as a pure virgin and vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
In which sense<note n="y" place="margin">Apolog.</note> 
                     <hi>Nazianzene</hi> calleth

that to them which beleeue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
they might pronounce the sentence

that they might loose the one, and
bind the other. Which their authoritie he
hath ratified with most gratious promises,
assuring them on his word, which is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
that<note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 20. 23.</note>

Others finally are but the familie, and as it

                  <p>Out of these two comparisons it doth
euidently appeare, that no man, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21742:24"/>
he be, whether a true Christian, or but
a naturall man, hath iust cause to despise
the ministers of God. For in that the true
Chistian hath attained to grace, hee hath
obtained it by the helpe of the Ministerie,
whereby he was reconciled vnto God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
with the truth, begotten vnto
God, &amp;c. And the naturall man, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
grace, is also to receiue it ordinarilie
by the helpe of the Minister, if euer he haue
it. And therefore those, who vilifie and
contemne the Ministers of God in respect
of their calling, doe manifestlie bewraie
themselues to bee vile and contemptible
persons, who neither haue any grace, nor
yet desire any.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs compare the Ministers
with other men, as they are honourable;
and first, with all iointlie, and together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
if we will make a comparison of all honors
in generall; we must also take a view both
of their burthen in this life, and reward in
the life to come. For the first, I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, not only that <hi>honos</hi> and <hi>onus</hi> do
alwaies goe together; but also that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21742:25"/>
to the weight of the burthen, such is
the height of the honour. Now euery man
is readie to lay loade vpon the Ministers,
and amongst all callings to attribute the
greatest burden and charge vnto them: by
which reason, they must be faine to ascribe
vnto them the greatest honour. For they
are Pastors, not of mens bodies, as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are, but of their soules; and they
beare all mens burthens, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
saith, &amp; they watch for other mens soules;
insomuch that if any perish through their
negligence, the blood of those which doe
perish, shall bee<note n="n" place="margin">Ezech. 33. 8.</note> required at their hands.
How weightie this burthen is, it will easilie
appeare if we shal consider how heauy eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
priuate mans owne<note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 6. 5.</note> burden will bee to
beare in the day of the Lord. For the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
own burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may seeme to be heauier
then others. First, because the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
greater matters in them, then in others.
Secondlie, because the same sinnes, which
in other men are lesse offences, in them are
esteemed greater faults. Simple fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which in others was after a sort salued
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21742:25"/>
by marriage, in the<note n="p" place="margin">Leuit. 21. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Priests daughter, was
punished with death. Thirdlie, because
the Priest<note n="q" place="margin">Leuit. 4. 3. 13.</note> was to offer as great a sacrifice
for his own sins, as for the sins of the whole
people. But the Minister must not onely
beare his owne burthen, but as vpon <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 28 29.</note>
the names of the twelue Tribes were
imposed; so the Ministers are to beare the
charge of their flocke; and of that flocke,
which Christ hath redeemed<note n="s" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> with his
blood, and therefore was more deere and
pretious to him, then his owne most preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood. But what vse are wee to make
of this? shall wee therefore depresse the
Ministers by contempt, whom wee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
with our burthens? nay rather as we
presse them downe with our burthen, so let
vs exalt them with honour. It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of the holy Ghost: Heb. 13.<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them that haue the ouersight of you, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your selues vnto them, for they watch for
your soules, as they that must giue an account,
that they may doe it with ioy, and not with
griefe, for that is vnprofitable for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as the Ministers charge is greater
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21742:26"/>
then others in this life; so hauing dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his dutie, hee shall haue a greater
weight of glorie in the life to come. For

for his reward, or that incorruptible
crowne of glorie, which the holie Ghost
hath promised vnto them: but also hauing
saued<note n="x" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> both himselfe, and those that heare
him, of whom hee may say in the day of
iudgement, <hi>Behold, here I am and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which the Lord hath giuen me</hi> (for whom
the Minister begetteth through his Gospel
vnto God, they shall be, as<note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith, his

the firmament for euer and euer. And
this is that, which in the place before cited,
the Lord promiseth to the wise and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
steward: that he will make him<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24. 47.</note> ruler
ouer all his goods. Vpon which wordes,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21742:26"/>
an ancient and learned<note n="c" place="margin">Author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. operis apud Chrysostin Matth. 24.</note> expositour writeth
to this effect; <hi>The greatest amongst all is
the Priestly dignitie, if a man keepe it without
blemish. For if the Lord aboue all his workes,
esteeme the soules of men most precious,</hi> (for
them hee hath redeemed with his owne
bloud) <hi>it is not to be meruailed, if he set him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all, who brings vnto him the gaine of soules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now are wee to compare the Ministers
with those peculiar sorts of men, to whom
the Lord hath vouchsafed honour. And
these are either priuate in the familie, or
publicke out of the family in the Church,
and commonwealth. Those that are to be
honoured in the family, are our parents: to
whom great honour is due by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
but not so great as to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
For, from thy parents as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, thou hast thy generation:
from the Ministers, as the instruments of
the holy Ghost, thy regeneration: by thy
parents thou art a man, by the Ministers a
Christian thy parents by mortal seed begat
thee vnto this world, the Minister, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
seed begetteth thee vnto the world
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21742:27"/>
to come: by thy parents is sin and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deriued to thee from the first <hi>Adam;</hi>
by the Ministers, iustification and freedom
from sinne is communicated vnto thee
from the second <hi>Adam.</hi> Finally, thy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parents are fathers in the flesh; but
the Ministers are fathers in the Spirit. Both
then, as you see, are parents: but the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
fathers are, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note n="d" place="margin">De sacerdot. lib. 3. cap. 5.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>more honourable then fathers.</hi> And
<hi>so great is the difference,</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> saith he, <hi>of them both,
as of the life present, and the life to come; for
these beget thee into this life, they into the other.</hi>
Wherefore, leauing our naturall parents,
we will compare them with another sort of
spirituall fathers, which is now ceased: I
meane the Leuiticall Priests; and chiefelie,
the high Priest, whose dignitie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
both in his office, and in his attire.
For his office, hee was, as it were, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
betwixt God and man; and therein,
because he represented the Messias, he was
superiour, not onely to other men, but to
the Angels themselues. And his attire,
which the Lord<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 18. &amp; 39.</note> appointed vnto him, was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21742:27"/>
answerable thereunto, signifying a <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rson,
excelling the condition of other men. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that as histories<note n="g" place="margin">Ioseph. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquit. Iud. lib. 11. cap. 8.</note> doe record, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the great, comming with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
against Ierusalem, when the high
Priest did meete him araied with his sacred
and magnificent attire; hee dismounted
himselfe, and in the high Priest worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
God: who, as he said, had in a dreame
appeared vnto him in that habit. But what
is this to our Ministerie? As an argument
of comparison fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lesse to the greater.
For, if the ministerie of the law was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent:
what shall we thinke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of the Gospell, which, as the Apostle
sheweth,<note n="h" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 7. 8. 9.</note> 2. Cor. 3. is much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and glorious then it? The same doth
our Sauiour seeme to testifie, when hauing
extolled <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> aboue all the Priests
and Prophets that went before him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then a Prophet, then whom a
greater had not risen amongst the sonnes
of women; notwithstanding hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
euery faithfull Minister<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 11. 11.</note> in the

Church of Christ, before him.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to enter into comparison
with the ciuill Magistrate. Wherein the
fathers<note n="k" place="margin">Ambros. Chrysost. Nazianz.</note> indeed haue included also the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Magistrate, affirming that the
Ministers excell Princes, as farre as gold
is better then lead, as heauen surpasseth
the earth, as the soule excelleth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
and such like speeches are frequent
among them, which the Papists abuse to
the maintenance of the Popes supremacie
ouer Princes: For, whereas the Fathers
speake of the dignitie and spirituall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of the Ministery aboue all other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
the Papists vnderstand their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of power and externall authoritie.
And againe, whereas their commendations
are giuen of the calling in generall, either
of all Ministers, or at least of all Bishops,
whom the Fathers notwithstanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be subiect to their Princes:
the Papists applie them as peculiar to their

howsoeuer the comparison of Bishops
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21742:29"/>
with Princes, vsed by the fathers, may
seeme capable of good construction, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of spirituall excellencie, and dignitie
celestiall: yet me thinks it should beseeme
the modestie of a loyall subiect, in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
due to that supereminent function,
to exempt the royall Maiestie of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Princes from this comparison, not
onely in respect of externall power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, (in regard whereof, we doe freely
professe that Ministers are and ought to
be subiect to their Soueraigne, and that to
the King is committed of God a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
or supreame authoritie in all causes
and ouer all persons, as well Ecclesiasticall
as Ciuill:) but also in respect of externall
excellencie and glorie. For as the whole
Church, the spouse of Christ; so the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,

haue executed this function: if the proper
end of their Ministerie be the saluation of

the mouth of God to his people, in regard

is not onely a worthie worke, as the

                  <p>The full demonstration whereof, I
thought to be very needful, as well for their
sakes, who bee not of the Ministerie, as for
those that be. For first, those of the Laitie,
by this doctrine may bee throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
to esteeme their Ministers worthy
of that double honour of reuerence and
maintenance, which by the word of God is
due vnto them: &amp; to free themselues from

                  </p>
                  <p>For as touching reuerence; there is no
true Christian, but he will readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that hee ought highly to reuerence
those, whom God would haue in speciall
manner honored, as the Embassadours of
God in the stead of Christ, sent to reconcile
men vnto God, and to saue them. Neither
will he easily despise those, whom hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
to be the blessed instruments
of God, for his singular and euerlasting
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21742:38"/>

which, though it be most due to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

now adaies greatly called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Some thinking the Ministerie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
of allowance, as being in their
conceit an idle and needelesse function;
and therefore whatsoeuer they can by anie
fraudulent deuice either detaine or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loine
from the Minister, they thinke it well
gotten. Others thinking, that the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Ministery is a thing arbitrary,
which they may either yeeld or withhold,
as <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ey find themselues able, or as they like
their Minister. Others acknowledging that
Ministers ought to bee maintained, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
would haue them to depend
either altogether, or for the most part, on
the vncertaine beneuolence of the people:
themselues not caring how little they pay
by way of dutie, so they may pay what they
list by way of beneuolence. The first is a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21742:41"/>
kind of brutish people, which haue no taste
of religion; but are either meere earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes,
or Epicures, seruing no God but
Mammon, or their owne bellie. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
a kind of professors forward in shew,
and but in shew; who thinking the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Ministers to be as it were a matter
of ceremonie, make no conscience of it.
The third, a companie of glorious profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
who being indeed vnwilling to pay so
much as they ought of dutie, would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
make God as it were behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and his Ministers obnoxious vnto
them for their gratuities. But I hope it doth
sufficiently appeare by that which hath bin
said in commendation of the Ministerie,
that the Ministers are well worthie of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
maitenance, and that, to bee yeelded
vnto them, neither as a thing arbitrary, nor
as a meere gratuitie; but as an honor in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
and iustice due vnto them by the
word of God. Yea, I will adde, so due, as
that without sacrilege it cannot be detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from them.</p>
                  <p>For the cleering of this point, we are to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21742:41"/>
shew two things; first, that a sufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is due to the Minister. Secondly,
what this sufficient maintenance is. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the former: the Apostle<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 14.</note> saith: 1. Cor.
9. 14. <hi>God hath ordained that they which preach
the Gospell should liue of the Gospel.</hi> The main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
therfore of Ministers is not an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
policie, but the ordinance of God:
and wee are to acknowledge it to bee due
vnto them not onelie by mans law, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>iure diuino,</hi> by the law of God. Now
God hath ordained it as a dutie both of
pietie towards him, and also of iustice and
equitie towards his Ministers. Pietie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that we should<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>giue vnto God that
which is Gods.</hi> For God hauing reserued
vnto himselfe a portion in all mens goods,
he is to be honoured with the same, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Prou. 3. 9.</note> saith: Prou. 3. <hi>Honour the Lord with
thy substance, and with the chiefe of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi>
This portion is the Ministers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance:
in which respect the Lord<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 18. 2. Ezech. 44. 28.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that hee is the portion of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
And this portion is so due vnto God,
and from him to his Ministers, as that to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21742:42"/>
professe religion, and to denie this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
is no better then to<note n="m" place="margin">Gala. 6. 6. 7.</note> mocke God,
and no lesse then to<note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 3. 8.</note> robbe him.</p>
                  <p>Equitie requires, that the Ministers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
not onely for the furnishing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the seruice of the Church, spent
their time, industrie, and substance; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
when they are furnished, employing
their gifts, and spending their strength in
the most profitable and necessarie seruice
of the Church, should bee liberallie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and as the Apostle speaketh, bee
<note n="o" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>counted worthie of double honour.</hi> And this
equitie the holy Ghost prooueth by diuers
reasons: 1. Cor. 9. First, <hi>à pari,</hi> vers. 7.<note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>VVho
goeth a warfare at his owne cost? who planteth
a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruite therof?
or who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the
milke of the flocke?</hi> Therefore by the same
reason, Ministers, who are the captaines of
the Lords bandes, planters of his vineyard,
Pastors of his flocke, are to haue mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from the Church. Secondlie, <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori;</hi>
we are in equitie to afford food, and
<note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 9. 10. 1. Tim. 5. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>not to mussle the mouth of the oxe that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21742:42"/>
out the corne:</hi> therefore much more are
we to yeeld maintenance to them, that
breake vnto vs the food of life: vers. 9. 10.
Thirdly, <hi>à maieri,</hi> the Minister communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
spiritual things to the people, which
are incomparablie of more value then all
temporall commodities. <hi>Is it then a great
matter,</hi> saith the<note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 11.</note> Apostle, <hi>if we reape your
carnall things?</hi> vers. 11. Fourthly, <hi>à simili,</hi>
as the Leuiticall Priests for their seruice
had liberall maintenance; so ought the
Ministers of the Gospell.<note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 13. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Doe you not know,</hi>
saith he, vers. 13. 14. <hi>that they which minister
about the holy things, eate of the things of the
Temple, and they which waite at the Altar, are
partakers with the Altar? so also hath the
Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
should liue of the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, what and how great this sufficient
maintenance is, which as I said, is due to
the Ministers, we are not to estimate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the niggardly conceits of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
men, but according vnto that proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which God assigned to the
Priests of the Law. For it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21742:43"/>
but that as we are more bound vnto the
Lord in all duties of thankfulnes, since the
Messias exhibited, then they to whom hee
was only promised; &amp; as in the same respect
the Ministerie of the Gospell far excelleth
the priesthood of the law: so the portion
which is due vnto God, and from him to
his Ministers, ought to be answerable.</p>
                  <p>Let vs then consider, what allowance
was due to the clergie by the lawe. First,
they had<note n="t" place="margin">Numb. 35. 4. 5. 7. Iosua 21. Philo de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. honorib.</note> 48. <hi>cities,</hi> and the suburbane
fields round about, for the space of two
thousand cubits euerie way; which in so
small a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try was a very great proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Secondly; they had <hi>the</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Numb. 18. 21. Leuit. 27. 30. 32. Matth. 23. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>tithes</hi> of the corne,
wine, oile, and of all fruites and hearbs, the
tithes of the heards and the flockes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,

                     <hi>borne,</hi> of all sorts of cattell, as of
beeues, sheepe; and goates, and the prises
of the rest, according to the Priests esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Likewise, the first borne of men,
redeemed at fiue shekels a man. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
the<note n="y" place="margin">Num. 18. 13. Deut. 18. 4. Ezech. 44. 30. Nehem. 10. 35. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>first fruits,</hi> as namely, the first ripe
of all that was in the land; the first fruits of
the wine, oile, and wooll, the first fruit of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21742:43"/>
their dough. Fiftlie, all<note n="z" place="margin">Num. 18. 8. 14. 19. Ezech. 44. 29. 30.</note> the <hi>oblations and

                     <hi>meate offerings, the sinne offerings,

Seuenthlie, of<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 18. 18. Leuit. 7. 31. 32. 34. Deut. 18. 3. Leuit. 7. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>sacrifices eucharisticall,</hi> they
had the brest &amp; the shoulder; of others, the
shoulder, the two cheekes, and the mawe;
of burnt sacrifices, the skinne. Eightly, all
the<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 23. 15. cap. 34. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>males were to appeare thrice a yeare before
the Lord,</hi> and none emptie handed. Lastly,
all these duties were to be<note n="d" place="margin">Nehem. 10. 35. 37.</note> brought to the
Priests and Leuites; and if any for their
owne ease desired not to pay in kind, but
to redeeme any dutie, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated thing;
they were to pay according to the Priestes
estimation, and to adde a fifth part. And if
any<note n="e" place="margin">Leuit. 5. 15. 16.</note> detained any thing, either in whole,
or in part, which was holy, and by law due;
hee was to bring a ramme for an offering,
he was to make good that which hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
and also to adde a fifth part.</p>
                  <p>The maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therfore of the Priests,
by the law of God, was in respect of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21742:44"/>
quantitie, very liberal; and in respect of the
maner, very honorable. For as <hi>Philo</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">De honorib. Sacerd.</note> saith,
it is a great honor to bee partaker of those
things which are consecrated to God; and
as he<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> hath well obserued, lest the people
when they brought any of their duties,
should vpbraid the Priest, as if he were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vnto them; they were commanded
to bring their offerings or gifts into the
Temple, that from thence the Priests might
receiue them, as from the hands of God.
Now, if such plentifull &amp; honorable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
by the law of God, was due to the
Priests and Leuites; no man of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
will denie, but as great a proportion
at the least, doth in equitie belong to the
Ministers of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that the Leuites were the 13.
part of Israel, and therefore a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
needfull for their maintenance: I
answere, though they were the 13. Tribe,
yet were they not the thirteenth part. For
when the other 12. Tribes were<note n="g" place="margin">Numb. 1. 46.</note> numbred
from 20. yeeres and vpward, such onelie as
were fit to beare armes, the number of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21742:44"/>
them was <hi>six hundred and three thousand, fiue
hundred and fiftie.</hi> Whereunto if you shall
adde all which were either vnder twentie
yeeres, or vnfit for seruice, the number
would be at the least doubled. But the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
being al reckoned from a moneth old
and aboue, their number was<note n="h" place="margin">Numb. 3. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>but two and
twentie thousand:</hi> which was not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the sixtith part; and not so much
by<note n="i" place="margin">Numb. 3. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>two hundred seuentie three,</hi> as the onelie
first borne of the other tribes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Lord tooke the Leuites for
the first borne of Israel, the odde two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
seuentie three, were redeemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 18. 16.</note> law, at fiue shekels a man;
and for them a<note n="l" place="margin">Numb. 7. 47. 48. 50. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>thousand three hundred sixty
fiue</hi> shekels giuen to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes.
Now, if a suruey bee taken of the Clergie
of England and their families; I suppose,
they will not come much short of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Besides, the meanes of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which the Clergie of Israel had,
descended to their posteritie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a lesse annuitie might suffice them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had a perpetuitie; whereas the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21742:45"/>
maintenance of our Clergie dieth with
them; and out of the annual receites, which
the parent hath for terme of life, his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
must be prouided for; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
an inheritance to bee permitted vnto
them, which was denied to the Leuites. But
although our Ministery be more excellent,
and therefore greater honour both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and maintenance due vnto it:
though our number and charge being not
lesse, our need of larger maintenance grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because it endeth with vs: though the
Church, being not tied to the succession of
the posteritie, which oft would prooue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie,
but being (by law) alwaies to bee
prouided of sufficient incumbents, ought in
this regard also to make the better allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
yet what haue wee in comparison of
them? yea what are our annuities to their
perpetuities? Our Colledges, and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate
Churches (blessed bee God) haue
lands, and our benefices glebes, though
much impaired by sacriledge. But what
are these to the 48. cities of the Priests and
Leuites with their precincts; beside all the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21742:45"/>
land, which at any time was dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and (being not redeemed) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
for a perpetuall<note n="m" place="margin">Leuit. 27. 21. 28.</note> possession to the
Priests? Beside the lands (which many
want) we haue scarce any thing but tithes;
and a great part of them, by popish either
appropriations, whollie alienated, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions
defaulked, or by the sacrilegious
practises, both of corrupt Patrons, and also
of vnconscionable parishioners, mightilie
impaired. But the Priests, to whom our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are answerable, had so many allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
(as you heard) that although they
had had no tithes, the proportion of their
maintenance had farre exceeded ours.</p>
                  <p>If it shall be said, that tithes are ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
or iudiciall, and therefore not to bee
exacted of vs: I answere, first, that many
learned men are of iudgement, that they
are morall, as being that part of mens
goods which is perpetually due vnto the
Lord. But I will not enter into that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at this time, it shall suffice vs to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
these two things: first, that if not the
same maintenance which was assigned to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21742:46"/>
the Priests, then questionlesse a greater is
due vnto the Ministers of the Gospell, for
the reasons before deliuered: secondly, that
although tithes were prescribed by the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
law; yet the equitie of that law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
and it is lawfull for Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
in imitation thereof, to prescribe
the same things. Neither can it be denied,
but that the tithes being by the lawes, not
only of this land, but almost of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
consecrated vnto God, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Ministers, they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sacrilege bee alienated, or detained
from them. <hi>It is destruction,</hi> saith<note n="n" place="margin">Prou. 20. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Salomon,
to deuoure that which is sanctified, &amp; after the
Vowes to enquire.</hi> That which is once dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
vnto holy vses, and consecrated to
God, may not returne to common vses.
If the thing be abused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the vse is to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
but the propertie is the Lords, and no
man can take it from him. See Numb. 16. 38.
Leuit. 27. 21. 28. Sacrilegious therefore was
the alienation of Church liuings by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
which are the bane of the people,
and blemish of our Church: neither wil the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21742:46"/>
Popes authority, by which they were made,
excuse them as lawfull; but prooue the
originall of them, to haue been Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
Sacrilegious hath been the practise
of courtlie Harpies, who haue praied vpon
the liuings of the Church, which praied for
them. If it were sacriledge in <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>

<hi>Belshazzer,</hi> to abuse them to profane vses:
what shall we say of them, who haue taken,
not the mooueables, but the very patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the Church? Sacrilegious is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Patrones, who detaine any part of
the glebe or tithes, or with <hi>Gehezi</hi> make
gaine of that which ought freelie to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
as well as it was sacriledge in<note n="p" place="margin">Ios. 6. 22. &amp; 7. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Achan,</hi>
to take part of that which was consecrated

and deuises of vnconscionable pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners,
who either by fraude or pretence
of law, as by pretended customes, composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or such like, defraude the Minister of
his due. Was it sacrilege in<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 5.</note>

who detained part of that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
had consecrated vnto God, and
might before the consecration thereof
haue kept it to themselues? and is it not
much more sacrilegious to detaine that,
which wee neuer had right to keepe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by law consecrated vnto God? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
should remember that the tithes and

                  <p>And to conclude this point, let those
which be in authoritie (as it becommeth
the nursing fathers of the Church) imitate

the zeale of godlie <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who could

of the Priests to the priuate vse of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah.</hi>
And let our Parliaments, in the name
of God, be carefull to auoide that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which <hi>Paul</hi> laieth vpon the Iewes, that
howsoeuer in respect of the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, it may be verified of too
many among vs, yet notwithstanding the
whole state may not bee charged with it.
<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 2. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou abhorrest idols,</hi> saith he, <hi>and doest thou
commit sacriledge?</hi> And let them know that
not onelie to the restitution of impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(which at the dissolution of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
ought to haue been made) they still
remaine deepelie obliged: but also for the
not restoring thereof, the whole land stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in an high degree, obnoxious to the
iudgements of God. For though the Pope
and Papists had some shew of reason to
take from the secular Priests, that which
they gaue to the regular, who as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
liued in a state of perfection, whose
deuotions were in their conceit the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church for the releefe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21742:48"/>
soules, and whose maintenance in
their intent, was to serue for the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of the poore and harbourlesse: yet
what colour, or shew of reason haue we, by
alienating the Church liuings from the
Cleargie, to robbe God of his portion, the
Ministers of their maintenance, the people
of their spirituall, and the poore of their
corporall sustenance? And lastlie, let them
acknowledge it to bee a great shame for
our land prosessing the Gospel, and sincere
religion of Christ, that the idolatrous
Priests, not onely among the Papists, but
also among the<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 47. 22.</note> Heathen, are more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and better rewarded, then the true
Ministers of Christ among vs.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the vse, which the
people are to make of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
some thing is to bee added concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
scholers or students. That none of
them presume to refuse the Ministerie, as
thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in respect either of their
parentage, or of their wealth, or of their
gifts, too good to be Ministers. For if they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21742:49"/>
will call to mind what hath been said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the honour of the Ministerie: I
doubt not, but they will say with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>And
who is sufficient for these things?</hi> and be more
readie to acknowledge themselues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to bee Ministers, then the Ministerie
to be vnworthie of them. If they refuse it,
because it wanteth either wealth or honor,
or because they call into question the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of the chiefe places in the Ministerie
(which respects haue diuerted many indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with excellent gifts, to the studie of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
or law either ciuill or common) I
would intreate, not onely them, that they
would with indifferencie reade that which
<note n="h" place="margin">In Apoc. 1. 20.</note> elsewhere I haue alledged to iustifie the
honorable calling of Bishops, as being the
ordinance of God, but also those which be
in authoritie, that they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it to be a godly, wise, and necessary
policie, that places of great reward and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
honor, should be prouided for those
who deserue best, in respect either of the
studie and profession of diuinitie, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Ministerie, For <hi>honos alit artes:</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:21742:49"/>
neither may it be expected that men of best
gifts, and therfore most worthie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to the Lord, will ordinarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this calling, which is exposed to such
contempt of the world, subiect to so great
a charge as the gardianship of mens soules,
and yet rewarded with small preferment
either of maintenance or honor; when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
studies, especially that of the law, doth
promise vnto them, so rich rewards, so
great honour, so high preferment in the
world. It is true, there should bee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
in the estimation of a Christian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
that profession which respecteth
onely outward wealth (especially if you
adde the vsuall and personall corruption
of them who professe it, who vndertaking
all causes that come to hand, seeme to set

to sale) and that calling, by the studie and
practise whereof, thou mayest<note n="i" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> saue thine
owne soule, and those that do heare thee:
notwithstanding because yong men, when
they are to make choice of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are not (for the most part) so wel setled
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21742:50"/>
in Christianitie, as simplie to preferre things
spirituall, to things temporall; there must
be some inducements to the studie of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
which may euen in outward respects
allure them who are of best gifts, and of
greatest hope: for they also are flesh and
blood.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the Prophets, and sons
of the Prophets; that is, to Ministers and
students of Diuinitie: who from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the Ministerie are to reape two
vses. The one, of comfort and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the other of instruction. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Ministerie aboue all callings
is most subiect to the contempt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of profane and godlesse men: yet the
Ministers are to be assured, that their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is a worthie and excellent worke; and
that as God himselfe hath greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so can they not but be honored of
all those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are the children of God. The
contempts and contumelies of the rest,
which they offer vnto vs for Christs, or for
our callings sake, ought to bee so far from
dismaying vs, as that we ought in respect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21742:50"/>
thereof to account our selues<note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 5. 11. 12.</note> happie: For
being there by made conformable not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to the Prophets and Apostles of Christ,
but also to our Sauiour himselfe, wee shall
also be conformed vnto them in happines
and glorie. And howsoeuer our Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
be contemned or oppugned; yet wee
are to be assured with the Apostle,<note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 15. 16.</note> that we
<hi>are a sweete sauour vnto God in Christ, not
onelie in them that are saued, but in them also
that perish; to the one, a sauour of death vnto
death, &amp; to the other, a sauour of life vnto life.</hi>
And in some measure may euerie one of vs
say with the Prophet (though speaking in
the name of Christ)<note n="m" place="margin">Esa. 49. 4. 5.</note> howsoeuer <hi>I haue
laboured in vaine, and haue spent my strength in
vaine, and for nothing: yet my iudgement is
with the Lord, and my worke with my God.
And though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I
be glorious in the eies of the Lord, and my God
shall be my strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The instruction which is to bee learned
is this, that seeing the function of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
is so honourable, as hath been said,
Ministers first, would labour to be worthie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21742:51"/>
of that honour, which in respect of their
function appertaineth to them. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that students in diuinity would not
offer themselues, or Bishops admit them,
namelie, to bee Pastors, vntill they bee in
some competent measure qualified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that sufficiencie or worthinesse,
which is required in the Minister of God.
For (as they say) <hi>Non ex quouis ligno fit
Mercurius.</hi> And this (that I may proceede
from the worthinesse of the Ministerie, to
the worthinesse of the Minister, described
vers. 2.) is the vse which the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
maketh in this place. The office of a
Bishop, saith he, is a worthie worke: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Bishop ought to be blamelesse, &amp;c.
But howsoeuer many things are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the worthinesse or sufficiencie of
a Minister; yet all may be reduced to these
two heads. The one, respecting his life,
that he be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, of blamelesse conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

together in the Scriptures, to wit, <hi>Thummim</hi>

precept, and practise. For the Lord
would haue his Ministers, whom they
teach by precept, to goe before them also
in example, and contrariwise. For this
cause, as God inserted in the brest-plate of
the Priest<note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 28. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>vrim</hi> and <hi>thummim,</hi> to bee vpon

on the skirts of the Priests robe

doe goe into the Sanctuarie, hee incurreth
the anger of God: by the other, the sweet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21742:52"/>
and holsome fruit of a godlie life. For as
the diuine<note n="t" place="margin">Plato in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chete.</note> Philosopher saith, <hi>Hee maketh
the best harmonie, whose life agreeth with his
doctrine.</hi> But whose doctrine is altogether

saith,<note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>a iarring Cymball.</hi> The same hath the
Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> ioyned together; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that these things were, and so ought to
be in the Priests of God.<note n="x" place="margin">Mal. 2. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>The law of truth
was in his mouth, and there was no iniquitie
found in his lippes: he walked with me in peace
and equitie, and did turne many away from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.
For the Priests lippes should preserue
knowledge, and they should seeke the lawe at his
mouth, for he is the Angell of the Lord of Hosts.</hi>

                     <hi>Augustine, haue

for our selues, and Ministers for you. In
that wee are Christians, our owne profit is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
but as we are Ministers, your profite
it sought.</hi> Likewise, in his epistles, <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
Ministers<note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 19.</note> to <hi>retatne faith,</hi> that is,
sound doctrine, <hi>and a good conscience:</hi> to<note n="c" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

                     <hi>examples

<note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 2. 7. 8.</note> to teach <hi>sound and vncorrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strine.</hi>
These two, whosoeuer ioyneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that is,<note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 5. 19.</note> whosoeuer shall <hi>keepe the
Commaundements of God and teach others so
to doe, the shall be great in the kingdome of God.</hi>
Such a Minister was <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> to whom
our Sauiour giueth this testimonie,<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35.</note> that
he was a burning and a shining light: bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in himselfe, and shining vnto others.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21742:53"/>
Such were all the men of God, who are
commended vnto vs in the Scriptures;
whose knowledge was inflamed with piety,
and their pietie enlightened with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>These things which the holy Ghost
ioyntly requireth in Ministers, by no means
ought to be seuered. For what is an honest
Minister, if he be vnlearned? A Lampe that
burneth, but giueth no light: a Bell of
good mettall, but wanting a Clapper: a

And therefore they are like to remaine in

For the Ministers, they be the <hi>light
of the world,</hi> the <hi>salt of the earth,</hi> the eies in
the bodie of Christ, which is his Church,
the guides of the people: If therefore the
light<note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 6. 23.</note> of the people be darkenes; alas, how
great shall their darkenesse be? If the salt
whereby the people should be seasoned be
vasauourie, how should not the people
putrifie in their sinnes? If the eies of the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation (as<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 10. 31.</note> guides be in stead of eies)
be blind, how should the people see? If the
guides know not the way, needes must the
people wander. <hi>If the</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 15. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>blind leade the blind,
both shall fall into the ditch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some idle drone wil say: it is enough
for mee, that I serue God in holinesse and
righteousnesse; though I cannot, or do not
preach. To whom I answere, that a mans
religion and iustice, if hee haue any, must
appeare in the exercise of his calling. And
therefore a Minister can hardlie be a good
man, as I suppose, that is not, in some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencie,
a good Minister. Now a good
Minister, is not onely a sheepe in Christs
fold, but also a Pastor of his flocke: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21742:54"/>
a liuing stone in the Temple of God,
but also a builder: not onely a plant in
Gods garden, but also a planter: not only
a child of God, but a father also in the faith,
begetting others vnto God: not onelie

                  <p>On the other side, what is a learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,

<hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>for if I had prophecie,</hi> saith he, <hi>and knew

                     <hi>Idoll is nothing,</hi>
as he saith in the same Epistle. And a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
that saith, and doeth not, little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
from an idoll; being not vnfitlie to
bee compared to the <hi>Mercuriales statuae,</hi>
which shew the way to passengers, but
themselues stirre not. But with <hi>Paul</hi> (in
<note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2. 3.</note> that place) <hi>nihil esse,</hi> and <hi>nihil prodesse,</hi> to
<hi>be nothing,</hi> and to <hi>profit nothing,</hi> is all one.
But Ministers, who with the Pharisies,<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> say
and do not, they are like to profit the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
but a little; and themselues nothing at
all. This therefore ought to bee the first
care of euerie Diuine,<note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>First, to seeke the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21742:54"/>
kingdome of God and his righteousnesse.</hi> That
he may be a sound Christian, before he bee
a Minister; a Disciple of Christ, before hee
take vpon him to teach others; a liuing
stone in the Temple of God, before he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to bee a builder: a sheepe of Christ,
before he be a Pastor; a plant in Gods gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
before he be a planter; that himselfe
be called, before he call others: himselfe
a follower of Christ, before he lead others:
himselfe one of the houshold of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he take vpon him to bee a steward or
ruler of the houshold.</p>
                  <p>And surely if all Christians, who tender
their owne saluation, had neede to labour
for holinesse,<note n="s" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>without which no man shall see

to<note n="t" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>exercise themselues vnto godlinesse,</hi> to
whose care and fidelitie the saluation of
others is entrusted; that by preaching pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablie,
and liuing vprightlie, they may
<note n="u" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> saue, not onelie themselues, but those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
who are committed to their trust. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if we say and doe not; yea, if wee
say one thing, and doe the contrarie, wee
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21742:55"/>
shall neither profit the people, nor yet
our selues. Not the people, whom by our
example we do more scandalize, then edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by our doctrine, pulling downe with
the left hand, what we set vp with the right,
misleading by our life, whom by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
wee would seeme to lead. Euen as
the Prophet saith,<note n="x" place="margin">Esay 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>My people, qui ducunt te,
seducunt: they which leade thee, mislead thee.</hi>
Wherfore, as <hi>Isidore</hi> saith, <hi>Qui negligit recta
facere desinat &amp; recta docere: Let him cease to
teach well, that cares not to liue well.</hi> For to
what purpose doest thou commend to thy
people the straite and afflicted way to
heauen; when thy selfe takest the broad
and easie way, which leadeth vnto hell? for
wil not the people sooner learne Atheisme
by thy life, then religion by thy doctrine?
For what saith thy sillie sheepe in such a
case? Surelie if my Pastor were indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that there is a God which wil iudge
the world, ren dering to euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his waies; if hee thought indeede,
that there is a heauen for the godlie, and a
hell for the wicked, as hee would perswade
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21742:55"/>
vs; it could not bee, that he would liue as
he doth. But what heare I words, when I
see deedes? If my guide goe that way,
who am I, that I should not follow him?
This is that, which <hi>Gregory</hi> saith,<note n="y" place="margin">Pastoral. part. 1. cap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Cum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor

Wherefore, whosoeuer by an vngodly life

                     <hi>a stumbling block before the blind,</hi> or causeth

                     <hi>the blind to erre out of his way,</hi> which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
doth he is accursed: yea, as I said, he
openeth a schoole to Atheisme, whereby it
comes to passe, as<note n="b" place="margin">De dignit. Sacerd. cap. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith <hi>Vt non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums

themselues whiles they liue wickedly, doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie

But neither do they profit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
for as <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>If I speake with the tongue

and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
Such Ministers are like to cookes, which
prouide wholesome meate for others, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21742:56"/>
eate not thereof themselues. Like to those
carpenters that built the Arke for <hi>Noah,</hi>
and themselues perished in the floud; for
whiles they<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 27.</note> preach to others, themselues

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I am not ignorant (good
Christian Reader) how vnpleasing
this Sermon will be to some, who
are forestalled with preiudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
(whom I could wish, I were
as sure to perswade, as I hope by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of truth to conuince:) notwithstanding, if I
may intreat thee, to reade it without preiudice, and to
iudge of it without partialitie; I doubt not, but thou
wilt acknowledge with mee, that the doctrine therein
contained, is not onely true, but also a profitable and
necessarie truth. And the rather doe I conceiue this
hope, because the time hath beene, when mine affection
enclined by the reuerent opinion, which I had worthily
conceiued not onely of Master <hi>Caluin,</hi> the author, but
also of Master <hi>Beza,</hi> and many other godly and learned
men, patrones and fautors of the pretended discipline,
made me suspend my iudgement in this cause; vntill I
had seriously entred into the studie thereof. The which
for a long time I did forbear: partly because I did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppose, that my paines might bee more profitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in other partes of diuinitie, and I had heard a
<pb facs="tcp:21742:60"/>
zealous preacher reproue young Diuines in a Sermon at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Master Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> who, before they had studied the grounds
of theologie, would ouer-busie themselues in matters
of discipline, and as hee said, before they had laide the
foundation of their studie, would bee setting vp as it
were the roofe: and partly because in my slender iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I could not then see, what good would come either
to my selfe or to the Church of God, by my paines taken
in that controuersie. For I conceiued the issue of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
would bee, either the disgrace of my ministerie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the forwarder sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I resolued, as now I knowe
I should haue done; or the ouerthrowe of my ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
if I should stand for that discipline. Thus was I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to remaine in suspense, whiles I tooke it to bee the
best course, both for my selfe and for the Church, to bee
no medler on either side. But when of late yeares the
case was so altered with the time, that a necessitie was
imposed, not onely to resolue, but also to professe my
resolution on the one part; and it was now expected,
that I should informe not onely my self, but some others
also what way to take: I did then seriously enter into
the studie of these things; Perhaps with another minde
then some others haue done, and therefore with other
successe. I considered with my selfe, that this Church of
<hi>England,</hi> wherein I was called to be a minister, did hold
and professe all substantial points of diuinity, as sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as any Church in the world, none excepted neither in
this age, nor in the primitiue times of the Church. And
secondly, that it hath the testimonie of all other true
Churches. Thirdly, that in it the means of saluation are
ordinarily and plentifully to be had. And therefore to
make separation from it, I tooke to be schismaticall and
<pb facs="tcp:21742:60"/>
damanable presumption. And as touching my selfe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that being in the ministerie, <hi>necessitie is laide
vpon me, and woe bee vnto mee, if I preach not the
Gospell.</hi> Wherefore I must confesse, I studied the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
wherein the policie of our Church is called into
question, as one who meant if hee were not conuicted
with euidence of truth, to bee as it were the respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or defendant, resoluing not to leaue my standing
wherein God had placed mee, vnlesse by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I were remooued: Whereas others, hauing (as it
seemeth) beene out of loue with our Church-discipline
before, and in affection wholly alienated from our
Church-gouernours, haue studied these things as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
and plaintiffes. And therefore hauing sought a
knot as it were in euerie bulrush, and strained at euerie
gnatte, they haue picked so many quarels against the
Church, and by consequent, against their owne ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as that by their oppos<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ion, the Church is depriued
of their ministerie, &amp; themselues of the imployment of
their gifts; They suffering the Land to swarme (euen in
their owne opinion) with Papists and Atheistes, and
their places either to be destitute, or to be occupied with
such as they account vnprofitable ministers, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they wil embrace, nay rather then they wil without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
and partiality read, what is truly said for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Church. But to returne to my selfe: when
with this resolution (which I am perswaded ought to be
in the like case) I had studied som, which are supposed to
bee the chiefe treatises on both sides: I found on the one
side, certaine places of Scripture drawne as it were by
the necke to that side, a fewe stragling sentences quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the Fathers, and as it were with oares wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by these men (looking as one would thinke the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:21742:61"/>
waie) against the full streame of Antiquitie; some
pretie speeches and wittie proofes, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
were (as before I had obserued in the question of
vsurie) meere colours, rather then sound arguments. On
the other side, I found full and plentiful proofes, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writinges, so namely in the learned treatise of the
perpetuall gouernemant of the Church, from which I
receiued good satisfaction. Now, the arguments which
perswaded me, I haue here set downe, as the shortnesse
of a Sermon (though somewhat enlarged) would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte;
hoping (because I knowe nothing to the contrarie,
setting not the iudgement of men, otherwise minded,
but their preiudice aside) that the same argumentes
which haue perswaded me, wil also preuaile with others
to embrace this, which at the first I called a profitable
and necessarie trueth. The which if it shall please God
according to my hearts desire to effect, I would hope
through Gods goodnesse qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>kly to see an ende of this
pernicious diuision which is among vs. For though some
other particulars be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerted; yet this, of the church-gouernment,
is the chiefe &amp; principal: and so chiefe, as
that somtimes I haue thought the rest to be but contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
in prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to auoyd the enuie of this. Neither doe
I doubt, but that if men sincerely affected were rightly
perswaded of the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that either they wold not
so stand vpon matters of ceremony, &amp; such like of small
importance, as that for them they would maintain this
rent in the bodie of Christ or suffer either themselues to
be depriued of the imployments of their talents, or the
Church of their ministerie: or if anie out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience should make scruple of these things,
that they would fauourably be respected. So that by the
acknowledgment of this one truth our differences would
be compounded, our breaches healed, our diuided minds
<pb facs="tcp:21742:61"/>
reunited, with one heart and voice to glorifie God in
the edification of his Church, propagation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
confusion of Poperie and Atheisme. Whereas now
this opposition, whiles it is continued, greatly dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God and his true religion which we professe, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the proceedings of the Gospel, aduantageth Poperie
&amp; Atheisme scandalizeth the people whom we ought to
edifie, and not onely the backwarder sort; who hereby take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be of no religion, but also the forwarder sort, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies, as I wil particularly shew. For they (I speak not
of all) are hereby occasioned, 1. To despise the solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship
&amp; seruice of God, and whatsoeuer good thing else is
set forth by Authoritie: and 2 Wheras they would seeme
aboue all things to esteeme the ministery of the word, as
that precious treasure for which they would (with him
in the Gospell) forgoe all things; they not onely vilifie
and disgrace the ministerie, which is to bee had (I mean
of those who are conformable, though no way inferiour,
but in many graces, by many degrees superiour to many
of those whom they admire:) but also encourage by all
meanes their admired ministers to stand out, as though
they had rather want the foode of their soules, and that
which they acknowledge to be the power of god to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to enioy their fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, for which they haue no
ground. 3. To place the height of religion in disconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
turning zeal into faction, godly confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to bitter
inuectiues against Bishops, &amp; odious censures of such as
they cal formalists; the study of the scriptures &amp; the sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance
of diuinity, to disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of discipline &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
&amp; being ignorant in the Catechisme to professe skil
in those things: Combining themselues in a diuided bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
hood, as though none were to be accounted Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Christ, but such as stand for the pretended discipline; to
whom also they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fine their charitie. 4. To be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerously
<pb facs="tcp:21742:62"/>
vnthankfull vnto God for the continuance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
together with outward peace and prosperitie vnder
the happie gouernment of our gratious and dread soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.
For whereas before the end of the blessed raigne
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all good Christians would haue
acknowledged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues infinitely bound to Almightie
God in al duties of thankfulnes, if they might haue been
assured of the continuance of these things after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
(which was the time that we feared &amp; our enemies
expected:) yet now when the Lord hath granted what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
almost we could desire, we take on, as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and like weyward children when we haue what is
fit for vs, if we cannot also haue what we fancy besides,
we are ready to cast away that, which, through Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
goodnes, we may to our soules health enioy. Yea
so strangely doe some dote vpon their owne deuises, that
they protest to all the world,<note place="margin">Christian &amp; modest offer of disput.</note> vnlesse their assertions (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
euen the principall whereof were neuer heard of
in the Church of God within 1600. and some odde
yeares after Christ) bee graunted, they see not how our
separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can bee iustified.
Nay they protest, that if they be in an errour and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
haue the truth, the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue
had great wrong and indignitie offered vnto them, in
that they are reiected: and that all the protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are schismaticall in forsaking vnity and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them; And therfore in their wisdoms make this
offer to the Priests and Iesuites, that if from them they
can receiue satisfaction concerning their propositions,
they will be reconciled to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that now
it must be thought that we separated from the church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> not for their abominable idolatries &amp; heathenish
superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor for their capital heresies subuerting the
<pb facs="tcp:21742:62"/>
foundation of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor because the church of Rome is
the whore of Babylon, the See of Antichrist, the mother
of all fornications and abominations, being also embru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as it were died red with the blood of the Saints,
&amp; of the Martyrs of Iesu; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to
separate in these respects: but because forsooth among
them, euery particular parish is not held to be an entire
body by it selfe, furnished with sufficient power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for the gouernment of it selfe in all causes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall;
because euery parish among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not power
immediatly vnder Christ, to elect and ordaine, depriue
and depose their Ministers, and to execute all other ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
censures: because the Pastor of euery particular
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, is not among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the highest ordinary eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
officer, but aboue him they haue diocesan and
provinciall church-officers, &amp; such like; for it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to haue mentioned those, which as they concerne the
cause in hand, so they are the principal. In respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
seeing they holde separation is to be made from the
church of Rome, they plainly bewray themselues what
manner of persons they be, who for the same causes may
separate not onely from our Church, but those of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Geneua,</hi> and all others, where these vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
deuises were neuer heard of. Fiftly, to growe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in religion through a kinde of spirituall pride, not
caring for the heauenly food of their soules, vnlesse they
may haue their own sawee, &amp; preferring the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ceremonies, before the substance. We wil
not heare a sermon forsooth made at a funerall, bee it
neuer so profitable, and by our good wil we would heare
none that is conformable, be hee neuer so learned and
godly a preacher: of if we doe, (we hearing with preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice,
<pb facs="tcp:21742:63"/>
&amp; making the word vneffectual vnto vs) we say
his gifts be decayed, &amp; his preaching to be without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
we heare &amp; not heare with admirable acceptation of
persons, as if we had neuer learned to acknowledge Gods
ordinance, or to look higher then to the speaker. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
if lawe did not compell vs, wee had rather be at no
publique prayers, then at those which by authoritie are
appointed; or if we be present, we will behaue our selues
as absent, not vouchsafing to ioyne with the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
We had rather not haue our child baptized (if we might
choose) then that the crosse in baptisme should be vsed.
We had rather not receiue the Communion, then receiue
kneeling &amp;c. Which things, when I consider how fewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people (in comparison) de care for religion, &amp;
of those few, how many are (I am sory to speake it) schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
disposed, doe make my heart to sorow, and my
bowels to yearne in commiseration so the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither can I
choose, but in an earnest desire of the peace of our church
(whereby these inconveniences might be remedied) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
&amp; euen in the bowles of Christ, to beseech my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Ministery, that as they tender the glorie of
God, in the propagation of the Gospel, or the salvation of
the people which Christ hath redeemed with his precious
blood: or if these considerations wil not preuaile, as they
hope to answer these thinges at the day of the Lord, they
would at length seeke the peace of Sion, &amp; be as desirous
to find arguments to revntie themselues vnto vs, as they
haue bin ouer-busie in seeking reasons to disioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Or if they will not be at so much paines, yet
at the least, that they would weigh in the ballance of an
vpright &amp; vnpartiall iudgement, those proofes which
heere are briefely set downe. And if they finde them to
<pb facs="tcp:21742:63"/>
ouer-weigh the reasons of the contrary part, they wold giue
glory to God, by acknowledging ingenuously so profitable, &amp;
as these times are, so necessary a truth. Neither shall they
need to feare discredit, if vpon better information they shal
reforme their iudgements. Wherein all moderate men will
hold them excused: remembring first, the common condition
of humane frailty, which is subiect to ouer sight; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
the most zealous men are so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being exempted, as that
many times they are more subiect there-vnto then others of
milder temper; men of greatest zeale being not alwaies, nor
for the most part, of soundest iudgement. Secondly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent
opinion which worthily they haue conceiued of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
&amp; <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp; other worthy Diuines, whom they hauing
found so admirably sound &amp; orthodoxal in the substantiall
points of religion; it is no maruel, though without any great
search they relied vpon their credit for matters of lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
Thirdly, the good effects which (as they haue beene
enformed) the new discipline hath brought forth, and the
manifold corruptions which they haue taken notice of in the
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our church, being the personal defaults not so
much of the Bb. themselues, as of their officers. And yet what
are these to those horible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusions, which if the discipline of
the newest edition should be established, wold inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
Namely, if euery parish Bishop should, as they teach, bee
the supreme or highest ecclesiasticall officer: that euery parish (where
plurality of voices must cary all things, &amp; the greater part ouersway

from Christ, to elect, ordaine, depose and depriue their Minister, and
to exercise all other ecclesiasticall censures; that euery parish should
be an entire body within it selfe, hauing neither subordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor (for
ought that I see in the new plotforme) consociation with others.</p>
                  <p>And is it possible, that these things should not onelie bee
broached of godly learned Ministers, but also with such vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
be vrged, that separation is to be made fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all those

Or shal we not rather think, that <hi>Brownists,</hi> or some not far

so, why do not the rest disavow these new-found assertions,

giuen to Papists as though the ministers among vs, who
would be thought to seeke reformation, did acknowledge no

these matters of the new-found parish-discipline, which no
reformed Church in the world doth obserue?</p>
                  <p>But if in the partial ballance of their forestalled iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
these argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts shal seem light in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of their own; my
desire is, that their answers may be distinctly applied to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in order, &amp; that their proofs may be produced:
which (they must remember) had need to be very pregnant

of that gouernment which euen from th' apostles times
hath been perpetually obserued in the church, &amp; setting vp
of another which was neuer heard of till now of late. And if
for ought that I haue heere said, or can say, the newest things
wil proue the truest, (which yet neuer hapned) I will then
acknowledge my error. Onely I desire christian and modest
dealing: not as in that which is called the christian and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

censures, proud &amp; scornful speeches, vnchristian &amp; vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
provocations, with great bitternes galling those whom
they haue made their opposites. In expectation whereof, I
commend thee to the Grace of God, vnfainedly protesting,
that what I haue heere either in this Praeface or in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                     <hi>Albertus</hi> noteth, allegorical,
we are to examine, who, and what manner of

new and old, that by the Angels we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Pastors or Bishops of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
yet is it become a great controuersie in
our time (which I wish were as likely to bee
determined and ended, as it is easie by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of truth to be decided) what manner
of Bishoppes they were: whether (for the
substance of their calling) such as the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende
Fathers of our Church are (which,
by the grace of GOD, I will plainely
prooue), or such, as some of our time haue
fancied.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee are to consider the quality
of their function, and out of the wordes to
shewe, that the office and function of Bishops
heere meant by Angells, is in this text both
approued as lawfull, and commended as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21742:65"/>
they hauing this relation to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
whereof they are Bishoppes, that where
the Churches are compared to Candlesticks,
they are presupposed to bee the lightes sette
there on, to<note n="5" place="margin">Mat. 5 15. Iohn 5. 35.</note> giue light to all in the house
of God: where the Church in this booke is
tearmed heauen (as it is the heauen vppon
earth) the Pastors and Bishoppes are the
Starres of heauen: where it is called the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, as though it were the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of heauens, they are the Angels in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                  <p>For the deciding of the former question,
two things are in the wordes offered to our
consideration. For whereas they are said to
be Angels of the Churches, wee are first to
consider what manner of Churches they
were, whereof they were Angells; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what manner of preheminence they
had in those Churches, in regard wherof they
are tearmed the Angels of the Churches. As
touching the first: we are to try, whether these
Churches whereof they were Angels or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
were parishes, or dioceses: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
whether they were parishionall, or
diocesa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bishops. For som of late haue taught,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21742:66"/>
that properly there is no visible Church, but
a parish, nor lawfull Bishoppes but parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
and that for the space of two hundred
yeares after Christ, there were no other but
parish-bishops. And that we should not think,
they vse the word parish, in so ample a sense
as the auncient Fathers and Councilles
were wont to vse the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as after
you shall heare): they define a Parish to bee
a particular, ordinarie, or set Congregation
or Christians assembling in one place (as it
were in one synagogue) to the solemne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
and seruice of God; such as bee our
parishes here in England. To make good
this newe-found opinion (the noueltie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
bewrayeth the falsitie) they haue coyned
others, as newe, and therefore as false asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As first, that euerie parish<note n="a" place="margin">Iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> by
right hath sufficient authoritie within it selfe
immediately deriued from Christ, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of it selfe in all causes ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall.
And secondly, least they might
seeme to set vppe an absolute Popeling in
euerie parish, who should haue not onely<note n="b" place="margin">For they say, that the Pastor of a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is the highest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall office in any true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Christ.</note>
supreame, but also sole authoritie in causes
ecclesiasticall: they adioyne vnto him, his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21742:66"/>
consistorie of lay or gouerning Elders. And
to this parishionall presbyterie consisting of
the parish Bishoppe (forsooth) and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
elders, they doe ascribe that sufficient,
immediate, and independent authoritie for
ecclesiasticall gouernement of euerie <hi>proper
visible Church,</hi> otherwise called a parish.
Thirdly, as for diocesan or prouinciall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
they hold them vnlawfull, &amp; Antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:
neither may they (good men) bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to bee so much as members of
the true visible Church; because forsooth they
bee not members of some one onely parish;
which in these mens conceipt must needes be
the kings owne case.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the second; <hi>viz.</hi> what was
the preheminence of these Bishoppes in the
Churches, in respect whereof they are called
the Angels of the Churches; Others more
wise and learned then the former, graunting
they were Bishops of whole Cities, and the
Countreyes adioyning (that is to say of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses)
notwithstanding the sway of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment
they ascribe to the Presbyteries of
those Churches, consisting partly of ministers
and partly of annuall or Lay-presbyters; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21742:67"/>
these Angels or Bishoppes nothing else
but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or presidents of those presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
and such presidents, as were not superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the other presbyters in degree, but
onely in order; hauing an authoritie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them by the free consent of the rest, to
assemble the Presbyters, to moderate the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to propound matters, to aske voyces,
euer pronouncing what the greater part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth,
and lastly to execute the presbyterial
decrees: and further, such president, as had
not this superioritie for terme of life, but for
a shor time, as a weeke or a moneth, and that
by course; this presidentshippe being, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their conceipt, common to all in their
turnes.</p>
                  <p>Now for the clearing of this matter, which
wee haue in hand: forasmuch as both sortes
obtrude lay-elders to extrude Bishops; I will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first proue against both, that there were no
lay-gouerning-elders in the primitiue church
&amp; that the presbyteries then consisted whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of ministers. And then more particularly
against the former sort, that in the first two
hundred yeares, the visible Churches (such as
they speak of) <hi>indued with power of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21742:67"/>
gouernement,</hi> were dioceses properly, and
not parishes: &amp; that the presbyteries which
were in those times, were assigned not to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
but to dioceses. And consequently,
that the Angels of the Churches and presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of the presbyteries, were not parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
but diocesan Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Against the latter, that the Bishop being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to a higher degree of the ministerie,
was set aboue the other presbyters, not onely
in prioritie of order, but also in maioritie of
rule: and that, neither for a short time, nor yet
by course: but, as for his worth hee was either
at the first appointed by the Apostles, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
elected by others; so was he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for tearm of life, vnlesse for his vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
he were displaced.</p>
                  <p>And so in the last place I will come to the
other thing, which is to bee obserued in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
text, which is, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the qualitie of their
function: wherein I am to shew, and by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of truth to demonstrate, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of such Bishops, is of apostolicall and
diuine institution. Vnto which last, that I may
in due time come, I will be the shorter in the
former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21742:68"/>
ANd first,<note place="margin">First, no presbyters, but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> I am to shew, that there were no
other Presbyters in the primitiue Church
but Ministers. A sufficient proofe whereof
may bee this: that, as in the writings of the
Apostles, in the auncient Fathers and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Presbyter (noting
an Ecclesiasticall person) doth euermore sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a Minister of <hi>Priest</hi> (which word, though
abused by the Papistes to signifie sacrificing
Priests, is the proper english of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and
from thence deriued:) and therefore questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might as wel be made whether there were
anie annuall ministers or lay-priests, as pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
(that being also a name, as themselues
say, confounded in the Scriptures with <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus,</hi>

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>): so can ther not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one pregnant testimonie be alledged out
of the scriptures, Councils or Fathers, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
or meaning any lay, annual, onely-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
presbyters: which no doubt will seem
strange to those; who remember with what
vehemencie this kinde of presbyters hath
beene vrged and obtruded vpon vs. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
manie places are vsually alleadged
out of the Scriptures and Fathers: yet I doe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21742:68"/>
vnfainedly professe, that (to my knowledge)
there are onely two allegations, which I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
worth the answering: the one, out of
<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> 1. Tim. 5. the other, out of <hi>Ambrose</hi>
on the same Chapter. <hi>The Presbyters,</hi> sayth
Paule, <hi>that rule well, let them bee counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of double honour, especially they who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the worde and doctrine.</hi> From
whence they gather a distinction of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
or elders; that some are gouerning
elders onely: others, also Ministers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I answere, that not anie of the Fathers,
or any other before our age, did euer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this text of any other, but of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the word, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing of it, as if the
Apostle had said: Let those <hi>Ministers or Priests</hi>
which rule wel &amp;c. Neither doth the Apostle
indeed note 2 sorts of Elders, as they imagin,
but two dueties of the Ministers, in respect
wherof double honour is due vnto them: the
one generall, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to bee good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents;
the other speciall, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>to labour in the word and doctrine.</hi>
Putting onely this difference, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
double honour is due to all ministers for
the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their duty in general, (for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21742:69"/>
so<note n="b" place="margin">Hiero. nym. in 1. Ti. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> expoundeth these wordes, <hi>qui

                     <hi>qui implent officium suum:</hi>)
yet especially they are to bee honoured for
their paines in preaching the word; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in <hi>Pauls</hi> estimation, the chiefe worke of
the Ministerie. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is all one with
that phrase of <hi>going out and in</hi> before others,
wherby the conuersation of publike persons
in the scriptures is signified. And they are
said <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who goe out and in before
the people of God as it becommeth them.
And thus also the ancient <hi>Syriack</hi> Paraphrase
expoundeth those wordes, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>qui

in their place. And this is to be vnderstood
both of their priuate conuersation (in which
sense the word <gap reason="foreign">

Both which the Apostle expresseth in
his farewell-sermon to the same Presbyters of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> of whome hee speaketh to <hi>Timothe,</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note>
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. which may serue as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to this place. As if the Apostle had sayd,
those Presbyters or Ministers among you,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21742:69"/>
who fulfill their ministerie according to that
directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which at my departure I gaue them,
viz. <hi>that they should attend to themselues and
to the whole flocke, ouer which the holy Ghost had
made them ouerseers,</hi> (that is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and
more specially, <hi>to feede the Church of God
which hee hath redeemed with his owne bloud,</hi>
(that is, to labour in the word and doctrine)
let them bee counted worthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
It is plaine therefore, that the Apostle
in that place speaketh onely of Ministers.
And that hee speaketh not there of lay or
onely-gouerning elders, it may further bee
proued by plaine euidence out of the text.
For, seeing by honour in that place the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vnderstandeth honourable maintenance,
which by their owne confession is not due to
lay-elders; it is therefore certaine, that this
place acknowledgeth none such. Thus ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I argue;</p>
                  <p>To all those elders, who are mentioned or
meant in this place, the honour of
maintenance is due for their worke
sake.</p>
                  <p>To the Lay-elders the honour of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is not due for their work sake.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21742:70"/>
Therefore lay-elders are not mentioned
nor meant in this place.</p>
                  <p>The proposition the Apostle prooueth in
the next words by 2.<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 18 Deut. 25. 4.</note> testimonies. <hi>For the
Scripture sayth, thou shalt not moosell the mouth

                  <p>The Assumption the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues confesse, both
by their doctrine and their practise. For,
whereas some obiect, that their lay-elders, if
they stand in neede, are to bee maintained:
I aunswere, that they<note n="d" place="margin">See the Suruey of the pretended discipline cap. 10.</note> choose such as
haue not neede; and if they haue, that the
maintenance which is allowed, is for their
neede, and not for their worke sake. But
the Apostle sayth, <hi>the Presbyters are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of double honour, and the workeman is
worthie of his stipend;</hi> to signifie, that the
honour or mayntenaunce, whereof hee
speaketh, is not a beggerly almes giuen

for his worke sake.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore this Scripture failes
them, wee may conclude, that lay-elders
haue no footing in the Scriptures; and
therefore by their owne principles ought
not to bee obtruded vpon the Church of
God.</p>
                  <p>I come to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> writing on the first
verse of the same Chapter<note n="e" place="margin">Ambrose. in 1. Tim. 5. 1.</note> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
exhorting <hi>Timothie,</hi> not to rebuke an

<hi>For among all nations old age is honourable:</hi> and
then addeth, <hi>vnde &amp; synagoga, &amp; postea eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia

Whence it is, that both the Synagogue, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Church had Seniors, without whose
counsell nothing was done in the Church. Which
by what negligence it is growen out of vse, I
knowe not, vnlesse perhappes by the slouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the learned or teachers, or rather pride,
whiles they alone will seeme to bee some thing.</hi>
Which wordes, whosoeuer vnderstande
as giuing testimonie to lay-elders, they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21742:71"/>
wrong <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in making him against his mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
to testifie that, which hath no warrant
either in Scriptures, or in the elder writings
of Antiquitie. For, <hi>Ambrose</hi> himselfe was
a Diocesan Bishoppe, and one who laboured
as much as anie, not to iustifie (for that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not in those times) but to magnifie the
calling of Bishoppes; and was as farre as
any, from subiecting either Bishoppes or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
(as these men doe) to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of lay men.</p>
                  <p>But let vs examine the force of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, there were elders in
the Church as well as in the Synagogue,
therefore (say they) there were lay elders.
It followeth not. For euen the Synagogue
had<note n="*" place="margin">Ierom. 19. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Seniores sacerdotum, Seniors of the
Priests,</hi> as well as <hi>Seniores populi, Seniors of
the people.</hi> And, of such, <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh,
when hee sayth, in the Church or Church
causes nothing was done without their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.
If it be said, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of
such Seniors, whose aduise was neglected
through the default of the learned or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and therefore of such as were not tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
I answere againe, neither doth this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21742:71"/>
for, <hi>doctorum, the learned or teachers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a common title both to Bishoppes and
Presbyters, and so to bee vnderstood in this
place; wee may easilie conceiue, how the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Seniors, through not lay-men
but Ministers, was grown out of vse, through
the default of such as had beene teachers in
the Church, either as Presbyters, or as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes.
For, whereas in the Primitiue
Church, the Bishoppe had vsed the aduise of
certaine graue Ministers, who remained with
him, after the greatest number of Presbyters
(being now allotted to their seueral titles or
charges) were seuered from him: (a liuely
resemblaunce whereof remaineth in the
Deanes and Chapters of Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
and nothing almost was done in
Church causes without their aduise: <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
complaineth, that their counsell in his
time was neglected, &amp; their assistance grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out of vse, by what negligence hee could
not tell: but as hee ghesseth, it was to bee
attributed either to the idlenesse <hi>doctorum</hi> of
the learned or teachers, that is to say, of the
Presbyters, who for their owne ease gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
medling in matters appertaining to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21742:72"/>
or else to the pride <hi>doctorum</hi> of
the learned or teachers, that is to say, of
the Bishoppes, who tooke all vppon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that they alone might seeme to bee
somewhat. For if you expound <hi>Doctorum,</hi> for
pastors of parishes alone, as the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
doe, or for Bishoppes alone, as others
doe: I cannot see, how the excluding of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,
and taking the whole burden and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
vpon themselues, could by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
bee imputed as a matter of sloath or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse,
either to the Pastors, excluding
the lay Elders; or to the Bishoppes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the learned Presbyters. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<hi>Ambrose</hi> knewe not what to saye
of this matter, otherwise then by coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet I doubt not but the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherefore the assistaunce of the Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
grewe out of vse, were these: First,
because it beeing a matter of greate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whereby they had no profitte, they
prouided for their owne ease, giuinge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to intermeddle in those combersome
imploymentes, (which was <hi>Ambrose</hi> his
first reason). Secondly, because it grewe
needelesse; for that the frequent Synodes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21742:72"/>
of Bishops, which in euery Province were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
not onely determined many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which before were wont by Presbyteries
to bee decided: but also decreed many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and constitutions, whereby the Bishop,
without his former assistance, might seeme
sufficiently directed. I conclude therfore the
first poynt, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Primitiue church
there were no lay Elders, and consequentlie,
no parishionall Presbyteries. Wherevpon, it
will necessarily follow, either that euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Bishop (as they call him) must rule as a
Pope, or be subjected to the authoritie of the
diocesan Bishop.</p>
                  <p>I come to the second;<note place="margin">2. The Churches, dioceses.</note> which is, to shew, that
in the Apostles times, &amp; in the age follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Churches, whereof the Bishops are
called Angels (or, to vse their words, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Churches, endued with power of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
gouernment) were dioceses properly,
and not parishes. This is prooved out of this
place. For, whereas our Sauiour Christ, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> numbreth but
7. and naming the principall, and (some of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21742:73"/>
them) mother-cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> saith, <hi>the seauen
starres, were the Angels of those 7. churches;</hi> it
cannot bee denied, but that the churches
whereof they were Bishops, were great and
ample cities: and not the cities alone, but also
the countries adjoyning. For, it is euident,
that the Apostles, when they intended to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
any Nation, they first preached to the
chiefe cities thereof. Wherein, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through
Gods blessing they had converted some, their
manner was to ordaine Presbyters; hoping
by their Ministerie, to convert not onely the
rest of the citie, but also in the countries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
so many as did belong vnto GOD;
the kingdome of heauen beeing like a little
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 33</note> leaven, which beeing put into any part of
the meale, seasoneth all. Neither were the
parishes distinguished in the Apostles times,
nor the presbyters assigned to their seuerall
titles or cures; but in common, the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were to attend the<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20. 28</note> whole flock con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
feeding them with the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and to labour the conversion of
the residue, so farre as they should be able,
both in the citie, and in the countries adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The presbyteries therefore in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21742:73"/>
times, were appointed, not to seueral
parishes, but to whole cities, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
annexed, that is to say, to Dioceses;
that both they might convert them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and feede them beeing converted.</p>
                  <p>Against this which hath been said, they do
object; that in the first 200. yeres, all the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in any one great city, did make but one
particular ordinarie congregation assembled
in one place; &amp; consequently, that both the
presbytery, and the President thereof, were
assigned but to one congregation.</p>
                  <p>I answere, first, that the presbytery and the
President thereof, were prouided, not onely
for the cities the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but also for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
adjoyning, which were converted, or to
be converted, by the Bishop &amp; presbyters of
the citie; and being converted, were counted
part of that church. And therfore though the
antecedent of this objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were true, yet the
consequence were to be denied. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
is not onely false, but also vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
&amp; vncredible. For, if you consider the
number of the christians in the greatest cities
within the first two hundred yeeres, or the
times vvherein they liued, or the places
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21742:74"/>
where they vsed to assemble; you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that all the Christians in the great
Cities, neither did, nor could ordinarilie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
in the same place, as one set particular
ordinary congregation.</p>
                  <p>What the number of Christians were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first 200. yeers were ended, in <hi>Rome,
Ephesus, Alexandria;</hi> and such like Cities, we

Christians which were at<note n="c" place="margin">Acts. 4. 4. 5000.</note>

other priuate and priuie places, not capable

that the Churches which were in
the Cities alone, contained many particular
congregations, vnto all which, there was but
one presbyterie, or Colledge of Presbyters
assigned.</p>
                  <p>

times, as the presbyterians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, had
&amp; by divine ordinance ought to haue
a President, whom the holy Ghost heere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
an Angell, and the Fathers, a Bishoppe;
which, by that which hath been said, may be
proued to have been, not a parishionall, but
a diocesan Bishop. And that is the 3. point,
which I was to prooue. For, if the churches
whereof they were Bishops, were dioceses, &amp;
not parishes; if the parishes were not yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
nor Ministers assigned to their
peculiar titles, or seuerall cures; if the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
were allotted to whole dioceses, and
not to seuerall parishes: then the Bishoppe,
who was set ouer a whole diocese, and not a
particular parish, who was president of the
presbyterie allotted not to a seuerall parish,
but to a whole diocese, was vndoubtedly not
a parishionall, but a diocesan Bishoppe. And
this was the state of the Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times. Howbeit, in the end of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
time, parishes began to be distinguished
in cities, and afterwards in the country. For,
about the yeere 100. and therfore before the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21742:75"/>
death of S. <hi>Iohn, Euaristus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
distinguished the parishes or titles in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Damasus, &amp;c. vt supra.</note>
and assigned not a presbyterie, but seuerall
Ministers to euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which was also prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
in other cities. We may gather out of
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> that before the time of <hi>Iulianus,</hi> that
is, before the yeere 180, diuers particular
congregations or churches, were subiect to
the Bishoppe of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For, <hi>in the first

                  <p>Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parishes were distinguished, both

                  <p>These three points wherof hetherto I haue
intreated, are of such euident and vndeniable
truth, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> the first founder of the
<hi>Presbyterian discipline,</hi> doth acknowledge
the same. For, speaking of the discipline of
the primitiue Church, which<note n="e" place="margin">Instit. lib. 4. ca. 4. §. 1.</note> hee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
was framed according to the worde of
God, &amp; scarcely had any thing differing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21742:77"/>
he saith:<note n="f" place="margin">Calv. Instit. lib. 4. cap. 4. §. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Quibus ergo docendi &amp;c. to

chose one in euery citie, to whom they special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gaue the title of Bishop:</hi> ne ex aequalitate, vt
fieri solet, dissidia nascerentur; <hi>least out of ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
as vsually it happeneth, dissensions
should arise.</hi> And some-what after, Habebant

who were Pastors and Teachers.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>To euery citie there was attributed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
region or country, which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence should
receiue their Presbyters, &amp; be reckned as part of
that church.</hi> And yet againe: <hi>But if the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey
which was vnder his Bishopricke, were more
large then that hee could sufficiently discharge
all the offices of a Bishop in euery place: through
the countrey, in certaine places, some Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were appointed, who in matters of lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
should bee the vicegerents of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
Such they called</hi> Chorepiscopi, <hi>because in
the province they represented the Bishop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre, that worthy seruaunt of Christ,
<hi>Calvin:</hi> who though in these three thinges
hee agreeth with vs, namely, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
consisted of Ministers, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21742:78"/>
indued with power of Ecclesiasticall
gouernment, were dioceses, and that Bishops
vnder their charge, had both their cities and
countries adioyning: yet I confesse, in the
fourth point he differeth from vs, and as I am
vndoubtedly perswaded, from the truth.</p>
                  <p>IN the 4.<note place="margin">4. Bishops, superior to other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> place therfore, wee are to intreat of
the superioritie of Bishops ouer other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
For, although the presbyterians &amp;
we agree in this, that by divine institution,
there was in the primitiue Church, and still
ought to be one, set ouer the Presbyters: yet
in diuers things they dissent from vs, and as I
said, from the truth. First, in that they make
the Bishop superior in order onely, &amp; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Secondly, in that they assigne a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie
or presidentshippe vnto him for a short
time, and that by course. Thirdly, in that they
ascribe vnto him a prioritie onely of order, &amp;
not a majority of rule or power. And to this
pupose, it pleaseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to distinguish Bishops
into 3. sorts, <hi>divine, humane, divelish;</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging

there could bee no lawfull ordination,

                     <hi>Antioch,</hi> permitted the lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed <hi>Chorepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi>
who were but presbyters, to ordain presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
&amp; deacons in the country, in the local ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the bishop, to whom with a litle more
paines they might haue repaired: how much
more would they haue allowed the same to a
company of graue &amp; learned Ministers in the
totall want of a bishoppe? Yea, doth not the
church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in her practice allow <hi>Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopos</hi>
or Suffragans to ordaine? &amp; haue not
some learned<note n="c" place="margin">See D. Field. de eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia. lib. 3. ca. 39.</note> men among them (in their
iudgement) approued the ordination, not of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21742:89"/>
priests alone, but of Bishops performed by
Presbyters, where no Bishops are to be had?
Yea, suppose that the right of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
belong to the power of th' episcopall order:
yet I am sure the begetting of fathers to the
church by ordination, doth no more belong
to the power of order in Bishoppes, then the
begetting of children to the church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
to the power of order in all Ministers.
Yet, in the case of supposed necessity, in the
absence of their priests, not onely other men,
but women also, among them are permitted
to baptise. The truth is, where Ministers may
be had, none but Ministers ought to baptise:
and where bishops may be had, none but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
ought to ordaine. But though neither
ought to be done; yet beeing done, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
by other christians in the want of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
the latter, by other Ministers, in the
defect of a bishoppe, as the one in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the fathers is of force, the church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the partie baptized into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the faithfull; so also the other, the
church admitting the party ordained as a
lawfull Minister. Thus much by the way, to
prevent popish cavills.</p>

Now am I to shewe, that the Bishop is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
also in the power of jurisdiction. The

in place from the Bishop, and affixed to
their seueral cures: First, in the Citie, and then
in the Country. For as in the City, the Bishop,
to whom, as<note n="m" place="margin">In Tit. 1</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, <hi>the whole care of
the Church did appertaine,</hi> distinguished the
parishes, and assigned a Presbyter to euery of
them: so in the Countrey, when the townes
&amp; villages were conuerted (which was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Bishop of the Citie &amp; his presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.)
they had their presbyters<note n="a" place="margin">Here note by the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that presbyters first were ordained (as diuines be in our vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall or dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Church (where they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, before they were assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their peculiar titles or cures.</note> by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21742:92"/>
appointed vnto them: &amp; when any place
was void, the Bishop out of his presbytery, or
if he could not, the Metropolitan supplied it.
These presbyters, as I said before, might doe
nothing but by authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bishop, or as
the ancient council of<note n="b" place="margin">Concil. Ancyr. c. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Ancyra</hi> speaketh, <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
authoritate literaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eius, without the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his Letters.</hi> Nay, they might not so much
as trauel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, and much lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
from one cure to another, without the
Bishopslicence. To his iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; censures
they were subiect: for to him they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
being accused, by him they were conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and examined; being faulty, by him they
were<note n="*" place="margin">Concil. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. c. 5. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. 2. c. 8. &amp; alijs.</note> censured, according to the qualitie of
their offence; by reproofe, putting to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
suspension, depriuation, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the pastors of seuerall parishes
either had assistants to restrain them, or they
were subiect to the bishop, or they ruled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolement, neither subiect to
Bishop, nor restrained by assistants. But this
last is absurde: for that had been to set vp a
Pope in euery parish, and to make as manie
schismes as there were parishes. Associates
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21742:93"/>
of lay Presbyters in euerie parish they neuer
had, nor yet haue in those Countreyes where
Presbyters be erected. For there is but one
Presbyterie in the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> for all
the parishes in the Citie, and territory thereto
belonging: and in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> where be some
thousands of parishes, there bee scarce halfe
a hundred presbyteries. To haue a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of ministers to assist the pastor in euerie
parish, it neither was, nor is possible. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
therefore, that the Ministers of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parishes euer were, and still ought to be,
subiect to the bishoppe; whose pastoral care
extended it selfe to all euen the remotest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
in his Diocese, to see them furnished
with sufficient Ministers, to prouide that they
were soundly taught, and discreetly guided,
to reforme abuses notified vnto him, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
schismes, to decide controuersies,
to exercise Church-censures against offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus then you haue heard, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Bishoppes of the Primitiue Church
were, for the substance of their calling, such as
our bishops are; that is to say, Diocesan and
prouinciall bishoppes, being superiour in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21742:93"/>
to other Ministers, and hauing a singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of preeminence for terme of life, and a
peerelesse power both of ordination and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
For, as for titles of honour, which
in our church are giuen to bishops; sure it is,
they are inferiour to those which the holie
Ghost assigneth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this place. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should we thinke much, that they, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their honourable calling, are termed
<hi>Lords</hi> (a title in Scriptures giuen not onely
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 31. 35 Let not my Lord be angry, saith <hi>Rabel</hi> to her father.</note> to naturall, but also, and that more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,

Ghost termeth them <hi>Angels</hi> of the churches.
Not that Bishops may behaue themselues as
<note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> LL. of the churches; but that they being
angels, &amp; spiritual fathers, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a paternal
and pastoral authority is committed ouer the

title of <hi>Lords.</hi> Neither is there such great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Master &amp; Lord, that inferior
Ministers, which assume to themselues the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Master, should deny the title of Lord to
Bishops. Neither doth it follow, that Bishops
are Lords of the churches, or they masters of
the churches, because the titles of Lords are
attributed to Bishops, and Masters to them.</p>

manifestly prooued) honourable, and they, in

worthy of double honour; then much more
the office of Bishops, who are the chiefe and
principall Ministers, is a worthy or excellent
worke. If euery Minister in a diocese is to be
honored in regard of his calling; much more
that one, who in a place of singular preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
is set ouer the rest. And if a worthy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

beget children to the church, as all ministers
do, by the ministery of the Gospell, &amp; by the
laver of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; much more to beget fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the church, as bishops do, by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If it be a great honour to be set ouer the
people of one particular flock; what is it to be

set ouer not onely the people, but the Pastors
also of many flocks, as a chiefe steward ouer
Gods family, as a principall spirituall Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his body, which is his church, as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
successour (as touching ordination and
jurisdiction) in euery church, of the glorious
Apostles of Christ.</p>
                  <p>All the question now adaies is of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For those, who vnderstanding the words
of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. (that the office of a
bishop is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) of the ministery in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
acknowledge it to be both good &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
they are so far from granting <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the
office of a bishop,</hi> properly vnderstood of those,
whom the church of God, euer since th' Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

be excellent, that they do not acknowledge it
to be good. Yea, they are so far from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to be good, that they thinke it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawful, nor indifferent, nor tolerable.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore shew that the function of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

                  </p>
                  <p>The proposition is of vndoubted truth,
and is so acknowledged by <hi>Beza. Surely,</hi> saith
he,<note n="a" place="margin">De grad. Ministr. c. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>if it proceeded from the Apostles, I would

ordinances, to the institution of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The assumption I will proue by three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
in which I will proceede as it were by
degrees. 1. <hi>That gouernment which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and perpetually vsed in all Christian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the first three hundred yeres after Christ,
and his Apostles, and not ordayned by generall
councils, was vndoubtedly of apostolicall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
This proposition, besides that it is
<hi>Augustines</hi> rule, is also of manifest truth. <hi>That
which the whole church obserueth,</hi> saith<note n="b" place="margin">De baptis. contra Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. l. 4. c. 24. quod vniuersa tenet ecclesia, nec co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilijs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sed sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per retentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, non nisi autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca traditu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimè credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note>

and was not instituted by Councills, but
alwaies retayned, it is very rightly belieued to
haue beene ordained no otherwise but by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Apostles.</hi> And againe, <hi>to dispute
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21742:95"/>
whether</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Aug. ep. 118</note> 
                     <hi>that which the whole primitiue
church throughout the world obserueth, is to be
done or not, insolentissimae insan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ae est, it is most
insolent madnesse.</hi> For, can it enter into the
heart of a modest and charitable Christian, to
imagine, that all the godly learned Fathers,
whereof many had liued and conversed with
the Apostles, all the famous Confessors, and
glorious Martyrs of the primitiue Church, all
those pure &amp; orthodoxall churches, planted
by the Apostles, did all with one consent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after the deceasse of the Apostles,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spire to abolish that forme of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
which the Apostles had established, and (as
these men vse to aggravate the matter) to
turne Christ out of his kingdome? Or if wee
could find in our harts to thinke they were so
vngodly (which be it far from vs once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:)
yet how is it possible, that al christians,
in all places, so far distant one from another,
should suddainly, &amp; at once, jumpe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in abolishing the Apostolical gouernment,
but also in setting vp in all places throughout
the Christian world, one vniforme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they had not receiued from the
Apostles? Therefore this proposition also, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21742:96"/>
of infallible truth.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore adde th' assumption. <hi>But the
gouernment of the churches, by such Bishops as I
haue spoken of, was generally and perpetually v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in all Christian churches, in the first three
hundred yeeres after Christ and his Apostles, &amp;
not ordained by any generall Councill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was so vsed, appeareth first by that
which hath been said: when I shewed that the
Angels or Bb. in the primitiue Church, were
diocesan Bb. superior in degree to other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
hauing singularity of preeminence
during life, and majority of power, in respect
both of ordination, and also iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the confession of <hi>Ierome,</hi> who
saith<note n="a" place="margin">Hier. in Tit. 1.</note> when factions began in the church,
<hi>toto orbe decretum, it was decreed in the whole
world, that one elected from the rest of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
should bee set ouer the rest,</hi> viz. <hi>in euery
church, vnto whom the whole care of that church
should appertaine, and that the seeds of schismes
might be taken away.</hi> And in another place, he
saith<note n="b" place="margin">In Psal. 44.</note> that the church when th' apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceassed,
in stead of them who had bin fathers,
had her children, that is, bishops, who should
become Princes or Gouernors in all Lands.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21742:96"/>
                     <hi>In omnibus finibus mundi</hi> (saith hee) <hi>principes
ecclesiae.</hi> i. <hi>episcopi constituti sunt: In all the
ends of the world, the princes of the church, that
is, Bishops, were ordained or established.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by the testimonies of Councils,
histories, and Fathers, who with one consent
giue testimony to this gouernment. Neither
can any one pregnant testimony of any sound
writer, or example of any one orthodoxal or
apostolicall church, be produced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Fourthly, the successions of Bb. in all
the most famous churches, deduced from the
Apostles times to the council of <hi>Nice,</hi> do yet
remaine vpon record in the<note n="c" place="margin">Eus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Irae. lib. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of best credit. Neither is any
thing objected against this succession, which I
hold worth the mentioning. Verily, to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
christian, this might seeme a sufficient
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the episcopal functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thogh
no more could be said to iustifie it; that in the
best times of the primitiue church, it was
borne of so many thousand godly &amp; learned
Bb. receiued in al true churches, approued of
al the orthodoxall &amp; learned Fathers, allowed
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of all the famous councils. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
I say, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, but not first orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21742:97"/>
by Councils. For, the most ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
Councils, consisted chiefely of such
Bishops, assembled &amp; guided by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes.
And the councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> which
was the first generall councill (for vntill the
time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> there was no meanes for
assembling a Councill generall) is so far from
first ordayning Bishoppes, as not onely that
Councill consisted of such bishops, but also
it speaketh of Metropolitanes, as being long
before in vse; yea, and ratifieth the ancient
custome (for so it saith<note n="a" place="margin">Concil. Nic. ca. 6.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
of subjecting diuerse prouinces to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches
or Archbishops of <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and confirmeth<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> the next
place of honour (according to the ancient
custome) to the bishop of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the gouernment of the Churches by
such Bishops, as I haue spoken of, was vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie
of apostolicall institution.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that gouernment which no where
was in vse in the first three hundred yeeres, is
not of Apostolicall institution:</p>
                  <p>The gouernement of the Churches, by a
paritie of Ministers, and assistance of Lay-Elders
in euery parish, was no where in vse
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21742:97"/>
in the first three hundred yeares. Therefore
it is not Apostolicall institution.</p>
                  <p>Now I proceede to the second degree, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to the Apostles times, from whence
in the second place I argue thus:</p>
                  <p>That gouernement which euen in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
times was vsed in the Apostolicall
Churches, and was not contradicted by
them, was vndoubtedly of apostolicall
institution. <hi>This I take for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The gouernement by Bishoppes was vsed euen
in the Apostles times, and not contradicted by
them.</hi> This I proue, both by Scripture, and
by other euidence. The seauen Angels were
the Bishoppes of the seauen Churches as all
confesse, and for the substance of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
like to ours, as I haue prooued. Besides,
it is wel knowen, that the Angel of the church
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to whome the second Epistle is
directed, was <hi>Polycarpus</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Bulling. in Apoc. conc. 9. noteth that Polycarpe was made Bishop of Smyrna, 13. yeares before the reuelation was giuen, and so hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many yeares after.</note> that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

(say they) this <hi>Polycarpe was one in our
times, an Apostolicall and propheticall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
hauing beene the Bishoppe of the Catholike
Church in Smyrna.</hi> And it may well bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that the Angell of the Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi>
to whom the first Epistle is directed,
was <hi>Onesimus.</hi> For when <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote his
Epistles, hee testifieth,<note n="e" place="margin">Ignat. ad Ephes. &amp; ad Antioch.</note> that at that time,
<hi>Onesimus</hi> was Bishoppe of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Nowe
hee wrote, while <hi>Clemens</hi> was Bishoppe of
<hi>Rome;</hi> as appeareth by his first<note n="f" place="margin">Ignat. ad Mariam Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sob.</note> Epistle:
That is to say; betweene the 90. yeare of
our Lord and 99. in the middest of which
time the Reuelation was giuen. And that
wee should not thinke that Testimonie
counterfeit and falsely fathered on <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
who was Bishoppe of <hi>Antioch</hi> at the same
time: <hi>Eusebius</hi> also alledgeth it out of the
same Epistle. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> sayth hee,<note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. c. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>being
at Smyrna where Polycarpus was, hee writeth
one Epistle to the Church of Ephesus, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their pastor Onesimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is euident, that from these
seauen Angels, a succession of Bishoppes was
continued in all those seauen Churches, vntil
the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> and long after: for both

of that particular church, ordained <hi>Iames</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the other point: (to omitte his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the superinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent of

euen vnto the seauenth yeere of Nero;</hi> &amp; in like
manner his successour, 38. yeeres.</p>
                  <p>As touching other churches; we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
that the Apostles did not, at the very
first planting of them, appoint bishops vnto
them; because as yet, there was neither that
choice, nor yet that vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was to be converted, before it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be gouerned: but first they ordayned
<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 14. 23. 19. 6. et 20. 17. 28.</note> Presbyters, to labour the conversion of
the people, and to seede them which were
converted by the Word and Sacraments, and
attending them in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, to gouerne them
after a priuate manner, and as it were, <hi>in foro
conscientiae.</hi> But the Episcopall power, which
consisteth specially in the right of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in the sway of ecclesiastical iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
committed to one, the Apostles each of
them retained in their owne hands, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<note n="e" place="margin">2. Thes. 3. 14. 1. Corin. 5.</note> whiles either they continued neere
them, or meant not to be long fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. All
which while, bishops were not so needful; the
Apostles providing for the necessity of those
churches, either by their presence, or by their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21742:102"/>
Letters or Messengers. And this is the cause,
why in the writings of th'apostles, bishops
are so seldom (though not so seldom as some
imagine) mentioned, &amp; the name with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
confounded. But when as they were to
leaue the churches altogether, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
or by death, (that the churches
should not be left fatherlesse, they fulfilled
that in Psal. 45. according to <hi>Augustine &amp; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi>
exposition, <hi>In stead of fathers,</hi> that is,
th'apostles, <hi>there shall bee children borne vnto
thee, whom thou shalt make Princes ouer all the
earth;</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Hieronym. et Augustin. in Psalm. 44.</note> that is, bishops succeeding th' apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in the regiment of the church:) at their
departure they left substitutes, and at their
death appointed successors, to whom they
committed the gouernment of the churches;
furnishing them by a singularity of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
both with the right of ordination, and
with the power of iurisdiction, as well ouer
the Presbyters, as the people of each Citie,

<hi>Intimes past,</hi> saith he, <hi>they called the same men
Presbyters &amp; Bb. and those who now are called
Bishops, they named Apostles. But in processe of
time, they left the name of Apostle, to those who
are properlie called Apostles, and the name of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21742:103"/>
Bishop they imposed on them who had been called
Apostles. Thus Epaphroditus was the Apostle of

The Epistles themselues, beeing the verie

                  </p>
                  <p>The other thing which they obiect, is,
that they were Euangelists. But that doth not
hinder, but that when they were assigned to
certaine Churches and furnished with episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
power, they became Bishoppes. For as
<hi>Zuinglius</hi>

Euangelist, who had beene one of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,

bee verefied of the<note n="g" place="margin">So was Marke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</note> Euangelists) <hi>when they
ceased from their peregrination, became Bishops
of certaine Churches, as by the ancient histories
is manifest.</hi> Hereof we may conclude thus:
<hi>The supposed Euangelisticall function of Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
and Titus, was to ende with their persons,
and admitted no succession, being</hi> (as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues

                     </gap>each) <hi>both extrordinarie and temporarie.
but the function and Authoritie which they
had, as being assigned to certaine Churches,
viz. of Ephesus and Creete,</hi> (consisting spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the power of ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction)
<hi>was not to ende with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but to bee continued in their successours;</hi>
as being ordinarie, and perpetually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
not onelie for the well beeing,
but also for the verie beeing of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Churches: (For, if whiles the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselues liued, it was necessarie,
that they should substitute in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
alreadie planted, such as <hi>Timothe,</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> furnished with episcopall power:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21742:107"/>
then much more, after their decease, haue the
Churches need of such gouernours.) <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the function and authoritie, which</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>had, as being assigned to</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<hi>and</hi> Creet, <hi>was not extraordinarie and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelisticall;</hi>
but, as I will further proue, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall.
For, that <hi>Timothe</hi> was Bishoppe of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> it appeareth
not onely by the subscriptions, annexed to
the ende of the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and second
to <hi>Timothe:</hi> but also by the generall consent
of the auncient fathers, and histories of the
Church. <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth out of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall

the most ancient Writers, who liued next the

professeth, that th' apostolick churches could
shew <hi>the order of their bishops, so running along
by successions from the beginning, that their first

                  </p>
                  <p>Against all this, which hath beene saide to
proue that th' episcopal function is of aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
institution, the authoritie of <hi>Ierome</hi> is
obiected. First, where he saith,<note n="7" place="margin">In Tit. 1.</note> vntill fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>did arise in the church, some saying, I am
of Paule, I am of Apollo, &amp;c. the churches were
gouerned by the common counsell of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
But when they began to draw disciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them,</hi> namely, such as themselues had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<hi>it was agreed in the whole world, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answere, first, that this speech of <hi>Ierome,</hi> in
respect of the church at <hi>Ierus.</hi> is vntrue: which
was first gouerned by th' apostles in common,
and after, committed to <hi>Iames</hi> in particular,
before we read of any presbyters there ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<note n="8" place="margin">Catalog.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe hath tolde vs, that
<hi>Iames straight-waies after the passion of our
Lord, was by the Apostles ordained Bishoppe of
Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Secondly, in respect of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
that which he saith, neither proueth that
the office of Bb. &amp; presbyters were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
(which notwithstanding seemeth to haue bin
his scope by that which followeth in the same
place) neither doth it hinder, but that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
office of Bb. is of apostolicall institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21742:111"/>
It is true, that for a time the Presbyters by
common counsell gouerned the churches,
but as vnder the Apostles, who kept in their
owne hands the Episcopall authoritie; they,
I meane the Presbyters, hauing neither the
right of ordination, nor the power of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
iurisdiction. This therefore doth not
prooue, that the offices of Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
were confounded. The name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was confounded with Presbyter: but the
office and authoritie of the Bishop, was as yet
in the Apostles; The Presbyters beeing such
then vnder the Apostles, as they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
vnder the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>But when th' apostles were to discontinue
from those churches, which they had planted,
then were Bishops substituted: wher-vnto the
factious behauiour of the Presbyters (wherof
<hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh) might be some inducement.
For, parity indeede breedeth faction &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
For the avoyding whereof in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Apostles, Bishops were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but when, and where, and by whom, and
to what end, let <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe testifie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
when <hi>factions began to spring in the church,</hi> saith
<note n="a" place="margin">In Tit. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome, some saying I am of Paule, I am of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21742:111"/>
Apollo, I am of Cephas,</hi> which was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
time, 1. Corin. 1. and it were fonde to
imagine, that factions did not begin till after
their time.</p>
                  <p>Where? <hi>in toto orbe,</hi> saith <hi>Ierome,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in the whole world. Which could not
be in the Apostles times, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
nor neere the Apostles times, without a
generall Councill, which was not.</p>
                  <p>By whom? <hi>Ierome</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Vide. supra.</note> hath told vs, when,
and by whom, <hi>Iames</hi> was made bishop of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Marke</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Timothe</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
Polycarpe</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. To what
end? <hi>to avoyde schisme,</hi> saith <hi>Ierome:</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Aduers. Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian.</note>
for the same end to be retained, as hee
doth also acknowledge. For, <hi>the safety of the
church, dependeth on the dignity of the Bishop; to
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if a peerelesse power &amp; eminent aboue all be
not giuen, there will be as many schismes in the
churches as there be Priests.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they vrge <hi>Ieromes</hi> inference in that
place: <hi>Presbyters, at the first, ruled the church by
common counsell; therefore the bishops, and they,
ought to rule the church in common still.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
it followes not in respect of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
themselues. Before titles were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21742:112"/>
and presbyters assigned to their seuerall
cures, they attended the whole flock in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
which after the parishes were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and they seuered to their seuerall cures,
they did not: Onely the Bishop, and the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
which remained still about him, had
the like care, which th' apostles and presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
had, at the first; The Bishop vsing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
of the Presbyters (though not to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled
by them) vntill their advise and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
to themselues seeming troublesome,
and to the Bishop (by reason of the frequent
Synodes, and synodall constitutions) need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
grew out of vse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they alledge out of <hi>Ierome,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Epist. ad Oceanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, item ad Evagrium. in Tit. 1.</note> that
<hi>Bishop &amp; Presbyter is all one: &amp; therfore Bb. are
to know, that they be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Presbyters, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the custome of the church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the truth
of divine disposition.</hi> I answere: where <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
saith <hi>Episcopus</hi> and Presbyter is all one,
he is to be vnderstood in respect of the names,
which he proueth, by<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 1. 1. Act. 20. 17. 28. Tit. 1. 5. 7. 1. Pet. 5.</note> many testimonies,
to be confounded in the writings of th' apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
And in this sense it is true, that whereas
now <hi>Episcopus</hi> is more then Presbyter, it is to
be ascribed to the custome of the Church; as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21742:112"/>
before I haue noted out of <hi>Theod.</hi> And in the
same sense, <hi>Augustine</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Epist. 19. ad Hieronym.</note> is to be vnderstood,
when he saith, according to the names of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in which the vse of the church hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<hi>Episcopatus est maior Presbyterio;</hi> that
is, <hi>Episcopatus, Bishop-ship,</hi> is a name of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour then <hi>Presbyterium, Priesthood.</hi> But
if you think that <hi>Ierome,</hi> in affection towards
his owne degree, (which hee sought to set as
high aboue the deacons as he could, who<note n="f" place="margin">Ad Evagr.</note>
at that time beganne to compare with the
Presbyters) did meane, that the functions, as
well as the names, were confounded, or that
it is not an Apostolicall ordinance, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
should be set ouer the Presbyters:
you shall make him, not onely to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the streame of all Antiquitie, but also
to be contrary to himselfe: as appeareth by
all those allegations, which I haue alreadie
cited out of his writings.</p>
                  <p>If his meaning should be, that the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of Bishops ouer Presbyters, though it be
an apostolicall tradition (as<note n="1" place="margin">Ad Evagr.</note> him-selfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it) yet notwithstanding, is not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of diuine institution; although there be

smal<note n="2" place="margin">Though in respect of the first institution, there is small difference between an apostolical &amp; divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, because what was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostles, proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, (in which sense &amp; no other, I doe hold the episcopall function to bee a diuine ordinance:) yet in respect of perpetuity, difference by some is made betwixt those things which be <hi>divini,</hi> and those which be <hi>apostolici iuris:</hi> the former in their vnderstanding beeing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, perpetually, and immutably necessary; the latter, not so.</note> difference between these

proue, that the episcopall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

of God. For, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was <hi>Timothe</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Bishop? By <hi>Paul,</hi> I confesse, as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

                     <hi>hold in his
right hand.</hi> Which plainely argueth, his, both
approbation of their function, and gratious
protection of their persons.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing proued this doctrine arising
out of the text, that the episcopall function
is of apostolicall and diuine institution: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
that we should from thence gather
som vses to our selues, both for the informing
of our iudgments &amp; reforming of our liues.
For the rectifying of our iudgements, the
same doctrine which by way of explication
of my text I proued; I doe now by way of
application commend vnto you: that as the
episcopall function hath beene manifestly
prooued to bee lawfull and good, as being
the ordinance of God; so you would bee
perswaded to acknowledge it. But you will
say; Some further matter, by your doctrine,
may seeme to bee intended. For whereas it
hath bin proued, that the gouernment of the
Churches by Bishoppes, is an apostolicall
and diuine ordinance: may not wee also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
that all Churches are so necessarilie
and perpetually tied vnto it, as that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21742:114"/>
forme of gouernement is warrantable
in the Church of GOD? and that not
onely this gouernment is lawfull, but that
it onely is lawfull? This inference I referre
to their consideration who hauing fancied
that the Presbyteriall plot-forme is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
vnto vs in the scriptures; doe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vrge the same vpon vs, as perpetually
and vnchaungeably necessarie in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
As for others, who being of better
temper, doe so commend their forme of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
as that they doe not condemne all
others, neither seeke to force other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to their imitation; they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the like moderation from vs. For
although wee bee well assured that the forme
of gouernement by Bishoppes, is the best,
as hauing not onely the warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the first institution, but also the
perpetuall practice of the Church from the
Apostles time to our age, for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of it: notwithstandinge, wee
doubt not, but where this may not bee had,
others may bee admitted; neither doe we
denie, but that siluer is good, though gould
be better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:21742:115"/>
But some will say, the protestants, which
were the blessed instrumentes of GOD
for the reformation of religion in this last
age, are thought to haue preferred the other
discipline by presbyteries, before this by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
and therefore in thus magnifying the
Bishoppes, you seeme to ioyne with the
Papists against them. Whereunto I aunswere,
that those godly and learned men<note n="a" place="margin">See the Suruey of the pretended dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. cap. 8. pag. 110. 111. &amp;c.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the episcopal function, and simply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the continuance thereof. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
when together with it they could not
enioy the profession of the Gospell, (such
was the obstinacie and tyranny of the Popish
Prelates:) they were forced with the losse of
the episcopall gouernement, to redeeme the
most pretious iewell of the Gospell; which is
to bee<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 13. 45. 46.</note> redeemed (if neede bee) with the
losse of all outward things. Which losse, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
they endeuoured to repaire in
some places, by renewing the function of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
and Arch-bishoppes, vnder the
names of superintendents, and generall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents,
as in <hi>Germanie.</hi> In others,
where that could not bee done, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Popish Bishoppes were still coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21742:115"/>
by the ciuil magistrate, as in <hi>France;</hi>
or because the form of ciuil gouernment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the expulsion of the B. changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a popular state, could no more endure the
gouernment of a Bishop, then <hi>Rome</hi> after the
expulsion of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the regiment of a
King, as at <hi>Geneua:</hi> they were forced to bring
in that forme of gouernment, which is next
the best, and by a Senate or Aristocratie of
graue men, to supply the absence of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe.
But, as in those places, where ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall
Bishoppes could not bee had, presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were wisely brought in, (for any gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whatsoeuer, is better then none at all:)
so are they verie inconsideratly obtruded on
those Churches, where Bishops, most sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professing the Gospell of Christ, are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
especially, considering that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
by Bishoppes, is not onely simplie
good and lawfull; but also in comparison, to
bee preferred before theirs, as hauing better
warrant.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs consider, what practicall vses
this doctrine doth afforde: first, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom
God hath subiected to the authoritie of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
For if their authority be the ordinance
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21742:116"/>
of God, and they in respect of their function
are termed Angels, as sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; &amp; Stars,
which Christ holdeth in his hand, as appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their office, and protecting their perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;
then are we bound in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, first, to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their persons, &amp; as the Apostle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 2. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Philippians,</hi> to <hi>haue them in honour,</hi>
as spirituall fathers; &amp; as they are heer called,
so to receiue them, as the Angels of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to obey their authoritie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: It is the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> Heb. 13. 17. as the Canons
<note n="d" place="margin">Canon. 40. Ignat. ad Trall.</note> of the Apostles, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and apply it. And the rather we shuld
make conscience of these three vses alreadie
mentioned, because the schisme, which is in
our Church, and all the euilles which arise
from thence, (which are worthie to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with aboundance of tears,) are to be
ascribed to the neglect thereof; that is, to
the not acknowledging of their lawfull func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the contemning of their persons, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
their authoritie.</p>
                  <p>As for the reuerend Bishops themselues,
they may reape comfort and encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
from this text. For, seeing they bee Starres in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21742:116"/>
Christs right hand, they may be assured whiles
they receiuing their light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, who is the
Sunne of righteousnes, do shine vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the light of doctrine, &amp; of a godly life,
they shall be protected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euill (for who shal
be able to plucke<note n="c" place="margin">Iohn. 10. 28</note> them out of his right
hand?) and also be preserued, both from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the falling<note n="d" place="margin">Apo. 12. 4.</note> starres, &amp; from erring
with the<note n="e" place="margin">Iud. ver. 13.</note> wandring starres. And seeing they
be the Angels &amp; Embassadors of God; whiles
they perform their office &amp; embassage faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
they may expect, that he will blesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
reuenge, and reward them.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, from these words they are to be
put in minde of their dutie, that as they be
heere honored with the titles of Angels and
starres; so they would endeuour to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their names; that they would fulfill
<note n="f" place="margin">Colo. 4. 17 2. Tim. 4. 5.</note> their ministerie, that they woulde keepe
their<note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>depositum,</hi> or that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their trust; that, as starres, they would
shine before others in the light of pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> and of a godly conversation; that
they acknowledging themselues as Angels,
entrusted with the<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> custody and gardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Gods people, may faithfully, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21742:117"/>
vprightly, discharge the trust reposed
in them; and as Angels sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God for the
<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> good of those who shal inherit saluation,
they may faithfully and zealously seeke the
glory of God, from whom they are sent, in the
saluation of his chosen, for whom they are
sent: that so hauing shined as starres vpon the
earth, and demeaned themselues as Angels
in the church militant; they may also shine as
the starres in heauen, as <hi>Daniell</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and be like the elect<note n="m" place="margin">Math. 22.</note> angels in the
Church triumphant. Which the Lord grant
for his Christs sake; to whom with the Father
and the holy Ghost, one eternall, all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
infinite, most gracious, and most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
GOD, be all glory, honour and praise,
both now and euer-more. Amen.</p>
