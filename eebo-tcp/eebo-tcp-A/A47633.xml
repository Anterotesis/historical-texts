            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Granada;</hi> a Gentleman on the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the <hi>First Part,</hi> &amp; therein the Discription of the
Bull-baiting, said, that <hi>Almanzor's</hi> playing at the Bull
was according to the Standard of the <hi>Greek Heroes,</hi> who,
as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dryden</hi> had learnedly observ'd (<hi>Essay</hi> of <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique

might not <hi>Almanzor</hi> as well as <hi>Ajax,</hi> or <hi>Don Quixot</hi>
worry Mutton, or take a Bull by the Throat, since the
Author had elsewhere explain'd himselfe by telling us
the <hi>Heroes</hi> were more noble <hi>Beasts of Prey,</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65668:3"/>
to his <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> distinguishing them into <hi>wild</hi>

Chaine,</hi> and <hi>frighting his Keeper.</hi> p. 28. broke loose. p.
64. and <hi>tearing those that would reclaim his rage.</hi> p. 135.
To this he added that his Bulls excell'd others <hi>Heroes,</hi>
as far as his own <hi>Heroes</hi> surpass'd his Gods: That the
<hi>Champion Bull</hi> was divested of flesh and blood, and made
immortall by the poet, &amp; bellow'd after death; that the
fantastique Bull seem'd fiercer then the true, and the
dead bellowings in Verse, were louder then the living;
concluding with a wish that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dryden</hi> had the good
luck to have vary'd that old Verse quoted in his <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique
Essay.</hi>

               </q>
Another <hi>Virtuoso</hi> said he could not but take notice how
ignorantly some charg'd <hi>Almanzor</hi> with transgressing the
Rules of the <hi>Drama,</hi> vainly supposing that <hi>Heroes</hi> might
be confin'd to the narrow walks of other common Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
not considering that those Dramatick Planets
were Images of <hi>Excentrio Vertue,</hi> which was most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
when least regular: that <hi>Almanzor</hi> was no lesse
maliciously tax'd with changing sides, then which charge
what could be more unjust, if they look't on him as
<hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Rinaldos's</hi> countryman, and born with them
in that <hi>Poeticall Free-State,</hi> (for Poets of late have
form'd <hi>Vtopia</hi>'s) where all were Monarchs (without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65668:3"/>
Subjects) and all swore Alleagiance to themselves, (and
therefore could be Traytors to none else) where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man might invade anothers Right, without trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on his owne, and make, and execute what Lawes
himself would consent to, each man having the power
of Life and Death so absolutely, that if he kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he was accountable to no body for the murder; that
<hi>Almanzor</hi> was neither Mr <hi>Drydens</hi> Subject, nor <hi>Boabde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi>
but equally exempt from the Poets Rules, and the
Princes Laws, and in short, if his revolting from the
<hi>Abencerrages</hi> to the <hi>Zegrys,</hi> and from the <hi>Zegrys</hi> to the
<hi>Abencerrages</hi> again, had not equally satisfi'd both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it might admit of the same defence, Mr <hi>Drydens</hi>
Out-cries, and his Tumults did, that the Poet represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men in a <hi>Hobbian</hi> State of War. A third went on and
told them that Fighting Scenes, and Representations
of Battells were as necessary to a Tragedy, as Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,
and broken Pates to a Country Wake; that an
Heroick Poem never sounded so nobly, as when it was
heightned with Shouts, and Clashing of Swords; and
that Drums and Trumpets gain'd an absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the minds of the Audience: (the Ladies,
and Female Spirits) Here an Aquaintance of the
Authors interpos'd, and assur'd the Company, he
was very confident, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dryden</hi> would never have
had the Courage to have ventur'd on a Conquest
had he not writ with the sound of Drum and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;
and that if there was any thing unintelligible in
his rants, t'was the effect of that horrour those Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of War with their astonishing noise had precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
him into, which had so transported him, that he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65668:4"/>
writ beyond himselfe. But he was interrupted by a
grave Gentleman <hi>that us'd to sup in Apollo and could tell
many Story of Ben. Iohnson,</hi> who told them, that in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dryden</hi> had given little proof of his Courage,
since he for the most part combated the dead; and the
dead—send no Challenges; nor indeed need they, since
through their sides he had wounded himselfe; for he
ever play'd the Critick so unluckely, as to discover
only his own faults in other men, with the advantage
of this aggravation, that the <hi>Grammaticall</hi> Errors or ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Poets, were but the Errors of their Age, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made his, were not the Errors of this Age: since he
granted this Age was refin'd above those <hi>Solecismes</hi> of
the last: thus the <hi>Synchoesis,</hi> or ill placing of Words, a
fault of <hi>B. Iohnsons</hi> time, was an usuall Elegancy in
Mr. <hi>Drydens</hi> writings, as in the Prologue to his <hi>Indian
Emperour</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Such easie Iudges, that our Poet may</l>
                  <l>Himself admire the fortune of his Play.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>Himself</hi> in the second verse, which should have been
plac'd before <hi>may</hi> in the first.
In the <hi>Indian Emperour, Guyomar</hi> say's,
<q>
                  <l>I for my Country fought, and would again,</l>
                  <l>Had I yet left a Country to maintain.</l>

               <hi>left</hi> should not have preceded <hi>Country,</hi> but follow'd it.

            <p>In all these places he observ'd the Rhyme hid the
false English. The placing of the Preposition at the end
of a Verse or Sentence, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dryden</hi> had confest was
common to him with <hi>Iohnson,</hi> but not discovering

at that in <hi>Maximin.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>your Brother made it to secure his Throne,</l>

               </q>
and more conspicuously in his <hi>Elegy</hi> on <hi>Oliver.</hi> (one who
was as great a contemner of Kings as <hi>Almanzor,</hi> and

here, in making <hi>Porphyrius</hi> a Bride, he has <hi>reacht an

those of the former in his <hi>Postscript</hi> and <hi>Epilogue;</hi> for

               </q>
sufficiently displai'd his <hi>gayety</hi> of <hi>nonsence:</hi> and 'twas
for this reason he suppos'd that he upbraided <hi>Beaumont</hi>

but this was the unhappiness of their Education, they
were not so well bred, nor kept so good Company as
Mr <hi>Dryden;</hi> nay had <hi>Iohnson</hi> (who was <hi>more conversant
in Courts</hi>) converst (as our Poet) only with Persons
of Honour, he had never disgrac'd the Stage with <hi>Tib</hi>

the Clown, then the Gentleman; thus <hi>Otters Horse,</hi> and
his <hi>Bear,</hi> and his <hi>Bull,</hi> might be entertaining to a
Groom, or a Bear-ward, but nothing in nature and
all that (to english <hi>Tom. Otters in rerum naturâ</hi>) was
more odious to a Man of Garniture and Feathers: in

this Poeticall <hi>Coryat</hi> would travell beyond the Poles of

not be so happy as to expect, since the Objector had
alter'd his resolution of exchanging the Sock and Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
for the Canonicall Girdle Here a great Patron of
Rhyme interpos'd, and said, he could heartily wish
that not only Divines would preach, Lawyers plead,
Philosophers dispute, and Councellers debate, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
our Ladys and Gallants would converse in Rhyme,
for besides that this would take off the Argument of the
the unnaturallness of Rhyme,</p>
            <p>It would be a means of exalting our thoughts, and
raising Conversation above the vulgar level, for what can
be suppos'd more indecent then for Ladys and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality to walk on foot in Prose with the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Without the sweetnesse and cadency of Rhyme
our quick Repartees in discourse lose much of their
Beauty, when as if he that spoke last be nick'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both in wit and sound, nothing is left desireable.
Nay, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dryden</hi> that writ ill in Rhyme, would have
writ worse without it, for such Redundancy's as this
in <hi>Granada, First Part,</hi>
               <q>This is my will, and this I will have done.</q>

would never have been passable, were not many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zn'd
with their sound; in a word, many things were
charg'd upon the Poet, of which the Rhymer was no
ways guilty, but there needed no greater Argument for
the efficacy of Rhime above Blank Verse, then that of
blowing a Candle out, and blowing in again, in two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

Syllables, or Rhyme, but even, sweet, and flowing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
