         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That doctrine ought to bee lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, which ſerues to declare Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>But the doctrine of election doth manifeſt the glory of God. For firſt, it ſheweth that we are elected to the honour of God, and to the praiſe of his glorious grace. Secondly, it argues and illuſtrates his eſſentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as his omnipotencie, omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eternity, mercy. Thirdly, this doctrine doth both demonſtrate and defend the free grace of God againſt all contrariant hereſies and errors, and will arme vs againſt many impetuous enemies of the truth; therefore it is a doctrine worthy to be learned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Doctrine is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2635:10"/>
to bee learned, which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs in the courſe of Chriſtianity: but the doctrine of election will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vs much in the running of this race. For firſt, it releiues our faith againſt diffidence, ſhewing that our ſaluation hangs not like a Meteour in the ayre, but is firmely fixed vpon the loue of God in Chriſt. Secondly, it furthereth our Spirituall ioy, in that it teacheth that the loue of God is <hi>Constant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31.3. &amp; 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>40. 2. Tim. 2.19</note> and his decree concerning our welfare is <hi>Eternall.</hi> Thirdly, it eclipſeth the pride of the heart, ſhewing that Gods dignation, and not mans dignitie, his fauour &amp; not mans faith, his mercie and not mans merit is the fountaine and foundation of mans felicitie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it prouokes vs to true gratitude and the practiſe of all good works:<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> becauſe it teacheth to aſcribe our ſaluation wholly to the grace of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4</note> and not to our owne goodneſſe: as alſo that wee were elected to bee holy, and not to follow the ſwinge of the fleſh, and to goe a whoring after our owne luſts. Fiftly, this doctrine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2635:10"/>
miniſters comfort to vs, and helpes our pacience in aduerſitie.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </note> For it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that wee are predeſtinated to weare the crowne of thornes with Chriſt, as well as the crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and that, as wee are couered with the grace of God as with a Canopy, whiles wee liue in this world, ſo wee ſhal be honoured with immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world to come; therefore this doctrine ought to be learned and remembred.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is fit for Miniſters to acquaint their people with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The reaſons are theſe.<note place="margin">Polanus &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rmius de praed.</note> Firſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſome of the olde Prophets haue commended this doctrine vnto the Church, and did teach it the people. But it were grieuous ſacriledge to depriue the poore people of that, which GOD doth vouchſafe them; and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent impietie to denie the preaching of that in the Church, which God doth teach in his word for the good of the Church. For whatſoeuer is written in the word,<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5.4</note> 
                  <hi>it is written for our learning, that through the conſolation of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2635:11"/>
the Scripture we might haue hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28. Mark. 16.</note>Secondly, the Goſpell ought to be preached vnto all, both learned and vnlearned: but the doctrine of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a principall part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; yea the <hi>whole Goſpell</hi> is incloſed within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſome of this doctrine, if we reſpect both the decree it ſelfe, and the execution and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it together: therefore it ought to bee promulged and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> vnto all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this doctrine is very vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſolatious, and may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many notable purpoſes. For it ſhewes vs the true cauſes of all our happineſſe. Secondly, it confuteth the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who aſcribe ſaluation to mens owne ſtrength and merits: and vtterly ouerturneth the opinion of Election for works, or faith foreſeen. Thirdly, it ſerues to correct the courſe of thoſe that hinder their owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe by their preſumption, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, incredulity, prophaneneſſe, ſenſuality, and other irregular and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religeous courſes. Fourthly, it proues the deity of Chriſt. For in that hee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2635:11"/>
hath elected vs vnto life,<note place="margin">Polan. ibid</note> we conclude that he is very God. Fiftly, as it teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the loue of God vnto vs: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſerues to enflame vs with loue towards him. For who would not loue him, of whom hee is ſo loued and to whom hee is ſo much obliged? And to omit many vſes which might be made of this doctrine, it ſhewes the great power and authoritie that God hath ouer men, in making choiſe of whom hee list to bee his veſſels of honour, and temples for his Spirit to inhabit. And finally it teacheth vs to loue our brethren, who are elected by the ſame God, and for the ſame ends that we our ſelues are.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Miniſters are by <hi>Pauls</hi> example bound to teach their people the <hi>whole counſell of God, and to keepe backe nothing</hi> which is commodious:<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> therefore they muſt teach them this doctrine. Laſtly, Miniſters muſt not ſuppreſſe or keepe backe that which is reuealed, but rather proclaime and diuulge it.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.9.</note> For <hi>things reuealed</hi> (as this is) <hi>belong to vs and to our children</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth. Yea, they ought
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2635:12"/>
to do it the more diligently, that they may preſerue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errors, which many turbulent and erroneous ſpirits doe publiſh to the world, and ſtay them from abuſing this ſo holy a doctrine (as many doe) to licentious &amp; luxurious liuing.<note place="margin">

               <p>The fift and laſt thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidered, is the <hi>maner</hi> of propounding and handling of this doctrine. Here
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2635:12"/>
theſe duties muſt be obſerued. Firſt, that this doctrine bee deriued onely from the word of God, and not fetcht from the forge of mans braine.<note place="margin">Caluin. ibid.</note> For the word is a ſure <hi>Rule</hi> to direct our vnderſtanding. And it is the <hi>cheifeſt point of ſobrietie to make GOD our Schoole-master when we learne, and then to leaue learning, when he leaues teaching.</hi> When he leaues ſpeaking, then wee ſhould leaue inquiring. Hee which curiouſly pries into Gods ſecrets, runnes himſelfe into an inextricable labyrinth, and findes not that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his curioſitie may be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this doctrine ought to bee deliuered in conuenient and fit tearmes, that the trueth thereof may be diſcerned, and no point obſcured, and that the ſublimitie and maieſtie thereof be not eclipſed and debaſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is fit that before this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be preached to the people, the Miniſter do firſt acquaint them with more familiar points of Religion, that his labours may be more proſperous and beneficiall. Theſe things haue beene deliuered by way of a Preface.

Thirdly, we are elected <hi>that we ſhould be holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 1.4.</note> and ſhould doe good works; &amp; therefore it were abſurde to imagine that good workes did mooue God to elect vs. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith: <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith not he hath elected vs—Cum eſſemus ſancti,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Election is not made for the wil of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or for that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would it. For the Apoſtle painely profeſſeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16. <hi>Polan. lib. de praed.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>it is not in him that willeth, but in God, which ſheweth mercie.</hi> By <hi>will,</hi> is meant the cogitation, deſire or endeuour of our minde, which the holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from Election. Secondly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2635:18"/>
the will of man is not eternall, and therefore cannot be the cauſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election. For the efficient cauſe muſt goe before the effect in time, or at leaſt in nature. But the will of man is not in nature before Gods election, much leſſe then in time. Laſtly, if we were elected for our owne will, many groſſe abſurdities would enſue. Firſt, the grace of God ſhould bee ſubiect to mens wills, as <hi>Proſper</hi> affirmeth:<note place="margin">Polan. ibid.</note> that is, the grace of Election ſhould be inferiour to the will of man, as the effect is to the cauſe: the will of man ſhould bee more excellent then the grace of God. Secondly, it were (as <hi>Prosper</hi> ſaith) to make the beginning of ſaluation to bee in him that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Thirdly, it were in mans power to be either an elect, or a reprobate if he would. Fourthly, all certaintie of Election would be taken away, ſeeing the will of man is inſtable and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Fiftly, election would be caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as depending vppon the will of man, which is mutable, and ſo God ſhould be made an <hi>Idol of Fortune,</hi> that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2635:19"/>
is, he ſhould chuſe if man would, and not chuſe if man would not. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that the will of man, is not the efficient cauſe of Election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God doth not elect any man for his birth or beauty, or for any prerogatiue or excellencie in his perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.11</note> For God is no <hi>accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>: and theſe things are not before Election, but come after it.

prerogatiue or dignitie in vs. We call Chriſt our Sauiour, becauſe he by his dignitie and merit hath deſerued our ſaluation of God for vs: euen ſo wee might be called our owne Electors, if we did mooue God to elect vs by our dignities or prerogatiues.

               </p>
               <p>Finally, the merit of Chriſt is not the efficient or impulſiue cauſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though it be of ſaluation.

               <p>Theſe <hi>Meanes</hi> are of two ſorts. Some are ſuch as ſerue for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decree, both of Election and Reprobation indifferently.

               <p>The Creation of man is the forming of man, according to the image of God, but yet in a changeable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here we muſt remember theſe 2. things.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2635:37"/>
and contrariwiſe to embrace iniquitie and to refuſe iuſtice.</hi> For God properly and by himſelfe is conſtant and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and if any thing elſe continue conſtant it is through him, who is bound to none,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, we muſt know that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was no priuate perſon, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all mankinde. And therefore we ſtood and fell with him. For hee was the root and we are his branches: he was the ſpring, and we the ſtreams: he was as the head, and wee are as the members. As the King, his Nobles,

                  </note> The Lord (ſaith <hi>Gregorie) did ſo make Adam, as that he might procreate children without ſinne, if hee continued in the obedience of his Creator: but becauſe the ſoule of man refuſed to obey her Lord, the procreation of children is in ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee ſee now that Creation is a meane of the execution of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For a man muſt firſt be, before he can be ſaued. Yet it is no ſpeciall, or peculiar meanes. For all that are created ſhall not be ſaued, ſome ſhall be damned. <hi>All men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Proſper) are of God created:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Permiſsion</hi> of the fall is that, whereby God ſuffred <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſonnes to reuolt, &amp; fall into ſinne, and did not hinder the fall, which he could haue done, if it had ſo pleaſed him, But hee would not hinder it, becauſe ſuch was his pleaſure for certaine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſt knowne vnto himſelfe. In the meane, let no man thinke that God was iniurious. For 1. he was not indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs to confirme vs by his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to keepe vs from declining. 2. this fall was by God permitted, for the greater benefit of all his Elect.

The third is the interceſſion of Chriſt, who hath prayed effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruation in the world.

So that if they fall, yet they ſhall not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: if they ſin, yet they ſin not with full conſent of will.<note place="margin">Rom, 7, 29</note> For they hate &amp; nill in part the euill, which they wil: and they doe not make a trade of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the ſpirit remaining in them, cauſeth them to returne to God, and to recouer themſelues by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To conclude this property<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, when hee calles a man hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes theſe foure workes of grace

Firſt he quickens him and giues him power to anſwere his call. Secondly, hee giues an execution of this power, and makes him to anſwere. Thirdly, he giues continuance of that power: yea and addes a fourth, which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that continuance: and ſo it comes to paſſe that none of Gods <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> do fall quite away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>though they fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly this vocation is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worke of God.</p>
               <p>For firſt, it is an vndoubted token of election:<note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, God by calling his elect, doth (as <hi>Caluin</hi> affirmeth) <hi>admit them into his familie,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>this inward vocation is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible pledge of ſaluation</hi> For God denies the ſpeciall efficacie of his ſpirit to the reprobate for the illuſtration of his ſoueraigntie and glorie;<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his mercie.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the excellencie of the Agent doth oftentimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the act. But it is that great God, who ſwayeth the ſcepter of the whole world,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.16</note> and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the light that no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto, it is hee that inhabiteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9. 2 Cor. 4.6.</note> &amp; ſpanneth the heauens with his fiſt, <hi>who calleth vs with this calling. God, that commanded the light to ſhine

out of darkeneſſe, is he, which hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glorie of God in the face of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> He, and he onely is our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall Caller, and neither man nor Angell.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, this calling is an argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of admirable power in God, &amp; of his infinite mercie to vs. For as he ſhewed his power in creation, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things to bee that before were not: euen ſo hee manifeſts his power in his effectuall vocation, in calling men (that were dead in ſin, and worſe then nothing by their owne deſerts) to liue the life of grace, and in breathing into them the breath of life, which was vtterly expired by their fall in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Yea the Lord may ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit more power when he calles men, then when he did create him: for at his creation there was none to hinder him: but at his vocation there were many hinderers &amp; great impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, (though all inferiour vnto GOD). There is the Diuel and his ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: there is the World and her incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

ſcandals and allurements: &amp; there is our owne fleſh, the rebellious corruption of the heart.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly this calling is a notable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his grace and mercie to vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that it pleaſed him to ſhine vpon vs with the light of his ſpirit, and to caſt his gratious eies vpon vs, who were by ſin more loathſome then a carion, and more ſtincking then any dunghil.

goodnes ſhewed, more grace exhibi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in reſtoring a man out of his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and inextricable miſerie, and in curing him of his curſed blindneſſe, then in giuing him a beeing, hauing none before, &amp; in making him to ſee, hauing no ſight.

               <p>The fourth and laſt propertie of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall vocation,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.10.</note> is that it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by certaine ſignes thereof.</p>

vocation, is either when by a ſpeciall and extraordinary reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, one man diſcernes &amp; determines infallibly of the calling of another: this (I ſay) is performed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is performed by a ſpecial work of God.

               </p>
               <p>Or elſe ſecondly, this infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and diſcerning is made, when a man determines of, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes his owne vocation by certaine workes of Gods ſpirit, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible teſtimonies and tokens of it, and by which we may make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſure,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Firſt, the Calling of God works in vs another call, whereby wee call vpon him, and ſeriouſly ſeeke vnto him and deſire his grace. <hi>Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">D <hi>Willet on Ioh.</hi> 17.6.</note> the attentiue hearing of the word is a marke of our effectuall vocation. For as a man is iudged to be ſicke and diſeaſed, when his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack cannot brook nor digeſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats: ſo the ſoule of that man cannot be ſound, to whom the word of God hath no pleaſant taſt.

ſuch, as are called home out of the vaſt wilderneſſe of this world vnto Chriſt their ſheepheard.

               <p>Now the Sanctification of the ſoule conſiſt firſt in the alteration of the minde, whreby ignorance is by little and little aboliſhed, and the mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to know the true God and his mercie in Chriſt, and to know a mans ſelfe and to ſee his ſecret corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againg the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly it conſiſts in the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the will. <hi>Which is when God giues grace truely to will good: as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, fear, and obey God.</hi> But yet this will is weake and not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and contention made by the fleſh,<note place="margin">Perk. ib.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it conſiſtes in the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the memorie, which is an <hi>openeſſe by grace to keepe good things, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the doctrine of ſaluation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:2635:96"/>Fourthly, it ſtands in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the conſcience, as when it is fitted to giue true teſtimony to a mans heart of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and of his care to ſerue God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it conſiſts in a ſpirituall tranſformation of the affections, as loue, ioy, ſadnes, anger, feare and ſuch like, whereby a man that is iuſtified, doth ſo temper them by his reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and by the light of the Law, with the helpe of Gods Spirite, that they doe not breake out (as in the wicked, that giue the reignes to their luſts) but may bee held in ſome good order; howbeit in this life, this is done with much ſtrife &amp; reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is rather affected then effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the ſactification of the ſoule conſiſts in a Chriſtian reſolution, and conſtant indeauour with al our forces to pleaſe God, and to teſtifie our loue vnto him in the ſeruing of our neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeking our owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: and withall flatly denying of

               </p>
               <p>The Sanctification of the body is that, wherby the members thereof are made fit inſtruments for the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated to worke the workes of God with; it being become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the minde illumined and the heart reformed, through the worke of the Spirit, who now hath made it the <hi>Temple</hi> of his holineſſe, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a ſlaue to the fleſh,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.19</note> and a ſhop of iniquitie and vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Sanctification of the life is a viſible reformation of it, when as it is dedicated to God and good duties, thoſe ſinnes being abandoned, which reigned in it in former times.

                  </gap> where remember that this worke of the Spirit is wrought in the whole
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2635:97"/>
man: and that it belongs onely to the faithfull and Elect of God. Ciuill moralities, outward formalities, and ſuch graces, as doe onely bridle and repreſſe ſinne, may befall the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: but Chriſtian vertues, and ſuch graces, as doe ſupplant and ſuppreſſe ſinne in our ſoules, ſuch works of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as doe reuiue and reſtore Gods image, are appropriated to beleeuers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>time</hi> wherein Sanctification is wrought, is in this life; in ſome ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in others later, but in none after this life, if wee reſpect the beginning of it, and not the finiſhing. For it is begunne euer before death, and neuer after. He that would be ſaued in the life to come, muſt bee ſanctified in this life. None liue like victorious Princes in the Church triumphant, but ſuch as haue bene courageous ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in the Church militant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>properties</hi> of Sanctification are many.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a moſt gracious and free worke of the Lord, without all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation or merit of ours. For the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2635:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit of God bloweth with his blaſts of grace both when,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.4.8</note> how and where he liſteth. And the Apoſtle teacheth vs that our quickning and ſaluation, is through the <hi>great loue and grace of God.</hi>

                  <hi>It is not giuen vs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) <hi>for any merit</hi> (to wit of ours) <hi>that we are borne againe of vvater and of the Spirit: but it is freelie giuen: and if faith haue brought vs to the lauer of regeneration, we muſt not therfore think that we gaue ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, that ſauing regeneration might be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in the vvay of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this new birth is ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as that without it we cannot bee ſaued. The kingdome of grace is the ſuburbs of the kingdome of glorie: he therefore, that walkes not through the ſuburbs, ſhall neuer enter into the Citie: a man muſt be in the kingdom of grace, or elſe he ſhall neuer be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the kingdome of glorie: no grace, no glory: no holineſſe, no happineſſe, no heauen, no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly honour.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.3.</note>

world to come. <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>) <hi>certaine beginnings of faith, like vnto conceptions: but yet, that a man may come to eternall life, it is not onely needfull that he be conceiued, but that he bee alſo borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sanctification is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable act of the Spirit. For when the holy Ghoſt doth ſeriouſly intend to ſanctifie a man, hee doth ſo worke vpon him, that hee ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeeld, how vnwillingly ſo euer his will be by nature.<note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, our Regeneration is but once begun, howſoeuer our holineſſe ſometimes increaſeth, and ſometimes decreaſeth.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh but of one new birth.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>As there is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſten) one fleſhlie generation, neither can there be made a returne into the vvombe: ſo is there one ſpirituall regeneration. Semel
