            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>THere was I'll tell you a wealthy young Squire,</l>
               <l>Who took his Iourney to <hi>Gloſter-ſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Deckt in ſuch gawdy and ſumptuous attire,</l>
               <l>Which might become a right noble Peer;</l>
               <l>As he rid through a place call'd <hi>Streeter,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>ſtrange flames of Love he then did feel,</l>
               <l>It was at the ſight of a Beautiful Creature,</l>
               <l>as ſhe ſat cloſe at her Spinning Wheel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He had no power alas! to ride by her,</l>
               <l>but ſtood and gaz'd on her Beauty bright;</l>
               <l>And was reſolved that minute to try her,</l>
               <l>hoping ſhe'd grant him his hearts delight,</l>
               <l>Silver and Gold this Gallant ſhew'd her,</l>
               <l>hoping thereby to have his will</l>
               <l>But his kind profers could no ways delude her.</l>
               <l>ſhe was reſolv'd to live honeſt ſtill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Often he told her that he would advance her,</l>
               <l>if ſhe would tell him her Pedigree;</l>
               <l>Then ſhe with bluſhes return'd him this anſwer,</l>
               <l>I was born of a mean Family;</l>
               <l>Yet I'll not be at your Devotion,</l>
               <l>I value not a Golden Gain,</l>
               <l>Though I have never a Groat to my Portion,</l>
               <l>my Credit, Sir, I will never ſlain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Finding he could not obtain his deſire,</l>
               <l>he rid away in a cruel Rage,</l>
               <l>Vowing again he wou'd never come nigh her;</l>
               <l>but yet his flames he could not aſſwage:</l>
               <l>The more he labour'd to forget her,</l>
               <l>the freſher ſhe ran in his mind;</l>
               <l>To be his Lady he needs muſt admit her,</l>
               <l>Beauty had ſo far his Heart confin'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With his Relations he tarried a ſeaſon,</l>
               <l>where there was beautiful Ladies ſtore;</l>
               <l>Thus with himſelf he began for to reaſon,</l>
               <l>why ſhould I marry with one ſo poor,</l>
               <l>When I may have my choice of many,</l>
               <l>which are both wealthy, fair and wiſe;</l>
               <l>Yet amongſt theſe I cannot fancy any,</l>
               <l>the Farmers Daughter hath won the Prize.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With his Relations he long could not tarry,</l>
               <l>becauſe he had left his heart behind,</l>
               <l>With that fair Beauty, which he vows to marry,</l>
               <l>it that he might but her favour find:</l>
               <l>Then in a week, or fortnight after,</l>
               <l>he to her Father's houſe did ride,</l>
               <l>Saying, if that you will give me your Daughter,</l>
               <l>Sir, I will make her my lawful Bride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then ſaid her Father, I much do admire,</l>
               <l>that you on her ſo much love ſhould place,</l>
               <l>Seeing your Garb and moſt Sumptuous attire,</l>
               <l>ſpeaks you to be of a noble Race,</l>
               <l>You may have Ladies at your leaſure,</l>
               <l>wealthy and fit for your Degree:</l>

                  </gap>d the Squire, of Treaſure,</l>
               <l>ſhe is more precious than Gold to me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There is no Lady moſt noble deſcended,</l>
               <l>that ſhall be honour'd, Sir, more than ſhe;</l>
               <l>With many Servants ſhe ſhall be attended,</l>
               <l>And I my ſelf in her company:</l>
               <l>O then beſpoke her loving Father,</l>
               <l>may all the Powers now Divine,</l>
               <l>Make you for ever moſt happy together,</l>
               <l>get her good will, and I'll grant you mine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then the young Squire ſaluted his Beauty,</l>
               <l>who gave him freely both Heart and Hand,</l>
               <l>Saying, for ever ſhe own'd it her Duty,</l>
               <l>to be obedient to his command:</l>
               <l>And in ſome three or four days after,</l>
               <l>their Ioys they did with comfort crown;</l>
               <l>This Squire marry'd the Farmer's fair Daughter,</l>
