            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Friendſhip for me I look upon as a great Honor, and I value my ſelf upon it; and the ſincerity, wherewith I endeavour to ſerve you, prompts me more to undertake what you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, than any ſenſe I can have of my own Skill or Ability: and rather than oblige you to continue your importunities, I ſend you here my thoughts of that Book you ordered me to Read. I undertook it with great averſion; partly becauſe ſuch ſcurrilous Contentions are very Unchriſtian in the firſt Original, ſcandalous in their Conſequences, and very unedifying to the Chriſtian Church. Partly, Becauſe I think the late Presbyterian Barbarities and Cruelties towards the Epiſcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known all <hi>Europe</hi> over, and therefore I was unwilling to undergo the Penance of reading a Book, that provoked me in every other Line unto the undecencies of Paſſion. It lay by me ſix months without ever opening it, until I was over-powered by your Commands. Though, in the mean time I muſt tell you that you never impoſed a ſeverer Task upon me. I have no inclination to Read ſuch Books, no more than I have to drink off a Potion of Phyſick every day to my Breakfaſt: beſides there are ſome men with whoſe Genius I am not well acquainted, who cannot be ſilenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have made lies their Refuge. The Truth, it ſelf (if at any time it happen'd to be on their ſide,) doth not pleaſe them unleſs it be dreſſed up in all the Colours of Falſhood, and ſtript of its natural Beauty and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; who like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Whore, when they have but newly committed their Abominations, defie all mankind to charge them with the leaſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Men who Arm themſelves with all degrees of Confidence to run
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60080:4"/>
down the cleareſt Truths that <hi>truly repreſent</hi> or ſeem to <hi>diſparage</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in which they are engaged. If that Book of which you deſire my Thoughts were particularly anſwered, ſuch a Reply could not but ſwell to a prodigious Bulk, becauſe to clear the Matter of Fact in ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes, obliges men to turn over all the Pamphlets to which his Book is related. I did indeed once Read his Book that he Entitles his <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> and I hope I ſhall never be ſo deſtitute of good Books (though at preſent I have very few) as to peruſe it a ſecond time. However I will briefly give you my thoughts of it, and ſince the Book has no method, I may be allowed to put the Reflections I make upon it in any order I pleaſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I will examine his General Apologies by which he thinks to ward off the blame of the barbarous <hi>Rabblings</hi> of the Clergy from his Party. Secondly, From the Book it ſelf, I'll give you a natural Character of the Author. Thirdly, I will ſhortly conſider his Theological Reaſonings, that occaſionally falls under his conſideration, when he pleads for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of Presbyterians. And laſtly, I will conſider the truth of that ordinary Objection that the Presbyterians manage againſt the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they alledge that Presbyterian Government was eſtablished in that Church from the beginning of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I take notice that all along he ſeem to diſown the <hi>Cameroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> as Presbyterians, or as men not of their <hi>Communion.</hi> At other times he acknowledges they are zealous <hi>godly</hi> men, and if he proves that the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities committed upon the Clergy were not committed by <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> Presbyterians, he thinks the Presbyterians are ſufficiently vindicated from all imputations of Cruelty and Violence. And therefore unleſs we prove them <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>intelligent,</hi> he thinks all our Complaints of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Tumults of the Presbyterians are <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>impertinent:</hi> But are not the <hi>Cameronians</hi> Presbyterians? To what Communion then do they belong? Have they any Principles, Diſcipline, or Worſhip, different from the Presbyterians? Were not their Leading Men lately owned and received by the pretended General Aſſembly, without retracting any Articles of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or diſowning any of their Practices that they ſo zealouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their Followers in the Weſt? This is a very pleaſant Fancy, that the Author ſhould endeavor to hide the Tumults and Inſurrections of that Party by changing the name of Presbyterian into <hi>Cameronian.</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> (as readily all Schismaticks do) ſplit themſelves into two great Factions, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Primianiſts</hi> and the <hi>Maximianiſts.</hi> What Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Villanies they committed (and all under the Pretext of Zeal and Reformation) every body knows. But pray? What an impertinent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy could it have been for the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> to ſay that it was true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were a great many Barbarities committed upon the Clergy, their Families, Churches, Altars, and Sacred Utenſils;<note place="margin">Vide Optatum, <hi>Milevit.</hi>
               </note> and upon the People adhereing to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60080:4"/>
their Communion, but that ſuch Indignities were not committed by the <hi>ſober intelligent Donatiſts,</hi> they intended no more than the Reformation of Abuſes by orderly and <hi>Imperial</hi> Edicts. Their Zeal againſt the <hi>Traditores</hi> only put them upon extraordinary attempts of Reformation. It could not be denied, but that the <hi>African</hi> Church and the Catholick Clergy there were ſadly oppreſt and run down by a company of mad and ungovernable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts; but the <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>intelligent Donatiſts</hi> were not to be blamed. They were either the <hi>Primianiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Maximianiſts,</hi> that committed ſuch Extravagancies, and diſorders, or (which is moſt probable) they were committed by the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> a third Diviſion of that unhappy <hi>Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Author makes juſt ſuch another Apology for the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He cannot deny but that the Orthodox Clergy in the Weſtern Shires were miſerably haraſſed, but the <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> Presbyterians are not to be blamed. We do eaſily grant him that the Presbyterians that were moſt inſtrumental in the Diſaſters of the Clergy were not <hi>ſober</hi> men, though the moſt <hi>intelligent</hi> amongſt them did contrive and manage the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Heats and Motions of their own Partizans.</p>
            <p>But to expoſe the vanity of this Apology a little more cloſely. We know no Opinions that Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> propagated or entertained that were <hi>peculiar</hi> to himſelf. He followed moſt cloſely and ingenuouſly the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> of the old and zealous Presbyterians; and the plain Truth is, Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> was not a man very proper to be the Founder of a new Sect. He built upon the Notions that he was taught by his Brethren: and the Presbyterians are obliged for this word <hi>Cameronian</hi> to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy, who mean no more by this <hi>word but a Presbyterian whoſe Zeal for his Faction</hi> (after the Example of Mr. <hi>Cameron) over drives him violently beyond all Bounds of diſcretion.</hi> And yet I cannot but commend their Artifice in this. The word <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is known in <hi>England,</hi> but the word <hi>Cameronian</hi> is not; and therefore this diſtinction (for diſtinctions are of great uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Cameronian</hi> is a very plauſible Defence in <hi>England</hi> to diſprove all the complaints made by the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy. As if the <hi>Cameronians</hi> were a new <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> different from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, and that we had three conſiderable diviſions of Chriſtians in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and the <hi>Cameronians.</hi> Whereas indeed, we know of none but two. And the <hi>Cameronians</hi> are thoſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi> that have ſtudyed their own Principles moſt accurately, and draw from thoſe Principles ſuch practical <hi>Concluſions</hi> as they <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> yield. I know not how this Author can make his Peace with the <hi>Cameronians.</hi> For the whole Nation knows that thoſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi> whom he <hi>Nicknames Cameronians</hi> did aſſert their Presbyterian Principles when others were very ſilent; and upon this they value themſelves as the moſt Pious, Active, and ingenuous of the whole Party, who differ not from others in their Principles but do exceed ſome of their Brethren in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60080:5"/>
higher degrees of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> to promote the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination. But pray? What is it that the <hi>Cameronians</hi> have done that they might not have done upon Presbyterian Principles? For it is a received Maxim amongſt them <hi>That the people may, (eſpecially in Conjunction with their Paſtors) reform the Church when the Magiſtrate is ſlack or remiſs in his duty, or oppoſite unto the deſigned Reformation.</hi> Now the removal of the Epiſcopal Clergy upon their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> was a neceſſary mean to advance this glorious Reformation. And what is there in the moſt Barbarous Rabbling of the Clergy inconſiſtent with the Presbyterian Principles? Can <hi>Religion</hi> proſper in our Nation unleſs the Biſhops and their <hi>Adberents</hi> be extirpated? And is not Presbyterian <hi>Government</hi> the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Inſtitution</hi> of our Lord and Saviour? Is not the exerciſe of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Diſcipline</hi> the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of his Royal Kingdom and Scepter. And may we be leſs ſerious in aſſerting his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> than in defending his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> and <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office? Did not the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon all Turns wreſtle with Authority about this great <hi>Truth?</hi> And does the Author think that they ought not to interpoſe in so Critical a Juncture to reſcue themſelves from the Bondage of the <hi>Antichriſtian Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy?</hi> That their Squeamish Conſciences groan'd under for ſo many years? If the Reformation of the Church from Epiſcopacy to Presbytery be of this Conſequence (As they Print and Preach every where.) What is there in thoſe laſt Tumultuous <hi>Rabblings</hi> that the Presbyterians can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own? Wherein are the <hi>Cameronians</hi> to be blamed? Becauſe forſooth this Author thinks that the Actors of thoſe <hi>Villanies</hi> we complain of were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not ſo <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>intelligent,</hi> that is to ſay, he rejoyc'd in what was done, but he wiſhed it might have been carryed on with greater caution and ſecrecy, leaſt the Epiſcopal Clergy might take occaſion to repreſent them and their proceedings in their true and natural Colours.</p>
            <p>I think the Author is to blame for ſaying the <hi>Cammeronians</hi> are not <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> For certainly they took their Meaſures by the beſt directions that could be had; for their Agents gave them exact intelligence of what they might venture upon and when. Accordingly a company of wicked Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries (who had declared War againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Nation by thoſe Laws that were made in times of Peace by the moſt unanimous and ſolemn Parliaments that ever the Nation had, and who declared in their Seditious Pamphlets and Papers that he had forfeited all Right to the Crown, becauſe forſooth, he had broke the Covenant) I ſay they, were the men who at the beginning of this Revolution (as they were directed) fell violently upon the Clergy and drove them from their Houſes and Reſidence; to the ſcandal of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> of our Nation. And this is not at all to be imputed to the caſual efforts of Paſſion or Revenge, but to an uniform Combination of the whole Society: and this appears, becauſe the Clergy were not generally Rabbled by their own Pariſhioners,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60080:5"/>
but by thoſe Fire-brands who concerted their Meaſures with their own <hi>Societies,</hi> and did nothing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Directions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Confederacies againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Societies</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> The Author thinks to excuſe what was done againſt the Clergy, when he tells us in ſome places of his Book, that their <hi>own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners</hi> gave them no <hi>diſturbance:</hi> but this proves that the Cruelties they met with proceeded from a <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> amongſt their Enemies ſince thoſe miſchiefs did not light upon a few of the Clergy (who might poſſibly provoke their Pariſhoners by ſome indiſcretions) but upon the whole <hi>Order,</hi> even upon ſuch, (who miſtaking the true Objects of Pity and Compaſſion) as had frequently interpoſed with their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors to mitigate the Legal Penalties againſt Non-Conformiſts. Add to this that ſeverals of the Gentry in the Weſt, who were better natur'd and had better Principles than their Presbyterian Neighbours, were very forward to reſent the <hi>Affronts,</hi> and <hi>Indiguities</hi> done to the Clergy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they underſtood that the Tide was riſen too high to be reſiſted: and that ſuch of the Presbyterians as were then out of the Nation, and directed the Methods that the Rabblers were to take, would vigorouſly reſent the leaſt ſtop that was put to their <hi>carreer.</hi> For it is obſervable of ſuch men that they never forgive an Injury; and no Injuries are more implacably reſented than any the leaſt Affront that is offer'd to their <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And it is no wonder for they never ſay the Lords <hi>Prayer,</hi> and it is probable that their oppoſition to that Divine Compoſure, is rather from its contradiction to their Nature, than from the ſtrength of ſome whiffling <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Arguments invented againſt it. It is not poſſible to oblige men of their Tempers by any Favours, and the Clergy upon the laſt Revolution found ſuch of them as they had done kindneſs to, moſt <hi>venomous</hi> and <hi>irreconcilable:</hi> and generally the Body of the People in thoſe Weſtern Shires are <hi>cunning, avaritious</hi> and <hi>diſſembling</hi> beyond meaſure: and ſince the Presbyterian Principles invaded their Honeſty, it was never heard that any of them heartily forgave an Injury, or what they ſancied to be ſo.</p>
            <p>But I return to what I intended, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Affronts done to the Clergy were concerted by the Party: ſince it is evident from many of their Topicks and their avowed Principles, that there was nothing ſo rude or villanous in the diſaſters that the Clergy met with but what they might venture upon by the <hi>Maxims</hi> of their <hi>Moral Theology;</hi> ſo alſo it appears undeniably from this, that the Leading Men of that Party who were at <hi>London</hi> upon the beginnig of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> oppoſed with all Vigour and Impudence all the <hi>Evidences</hi> brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> of the Sufferings of the Clergy. And though a Reverend perſon brought with him Authentick Atteſtations of what the Clergy ſuffered;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>S</hi>—.</note> yet the leading Presbyterians boldly averred, that there was nothing in <hi>Scotland</hi> but proſound Peace and Silence; that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60080:6"/>
they had Letters from their <hi>Factors</hi> and <hi>Chamberlains</hi> informing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what was alledged by the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Confuſion</hi> that Affairs then ſtood, it was eaſie for them to ſtop any <hi>regular</hi> or <hi>legal</hi> Tryal; and they had in that <hi>critical</hi> Juncture many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of their Neighbours. So their Emiſſaries in <hi>Scotland</hi> went on with all poſſible <hi>Licence</hi> and <hi>Villany.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Juſque datum ſceleri—</note> And it is very odd that this Author ſhould undertake to vindicate the Presbyterians from thoſe Tumults, when the united force of the whole Party, with all their Zeal and Strength, never yet appeared ſo unanimous and uniform in any enterpriſe as at that time in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to pull down our National Church, and ſo fond were they then of their Revenge, that they preferred their <hi>Dagon</hi> of Presbytery to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing United to <hi>England.</hi> The Author thinks that neither he nor his Party are obliged to vindicate any act of Cruelty that proceeded from the Civil Authority againſt the Clergy. If they were the Patrons of Presbytery (as he thanks God they were) certainly their Actings ought to have been juſtified in the firſt place, but he tells us that if the Clergy have ſuffered any thing that was hard and extraordinary, it ought not to be imputed to his <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> but to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Councel,</hi> and the <hi>Rabble,</hi> as he very mannerly expreſſes himſelf. Yet I muſt thank him for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Apology, ſince the Presbyterians under the late Reigns ſuffered nothing but what was <hi>inflicted</hi> by Law. We need make no excuſes for the Laws made againſt Presbyterians, and thoſe Laws more gravely conſulted, than the haſty and undigeſted reſolutions of peeviſh and angry Outlaws. And ſuch Laws were made in times of Peace, and with all <hi>Solemnity</hi> and <hi>Deliberation,</hi> and were abſolutely neceſſary to maintain the Peace of the Nation, and the <hi>Kings legal and juſt</hi> Prerogative againſt the <hi>Popular</hi> but <hi>pernicious</hi> Tenets of bigotted Covenanters; now I hope you are ſufficiently convinced that I need not tranſcribe the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Tragical Rebellion in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his time, nor yet the many Proteſtations of the Covenanters at the Croſs at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> againſt the Kings moſt Juſt and Fatherly Proceedings. And to convince you by one Inſtance that they love nothing but what they poſſeſs by Force and Rebellion. When that moſt gracious King ordered the Covenant to be taken as it was Enacted in King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth his time (thinking this might blunt the edge of the Covenanters, and ſatisfie the deluded People) they Proteſt againſt this his Proclamation. For you muſt think that in their Divinity, things <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in their Nature, nay things Neceſſary, (for ſuch they take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be) become <hi>unlawful</hi> when once required by lawful <hi>Authority.</hi>

               </note> The Reaſon is, the Presbyterians are in poſſeſſion of ſuch an Union in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have no legal <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to unite them together.

            <p>But I leave this general <hi>Head</hi> when I give you an account of one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able piece of <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> and <hi>tergiverſation,</hi> that he makes uſe of to palliate the Crimes of his Party; and it is ſo much the more material, ſince if he fails

in this he ſhakes the Foundation of all his Apologies, by which he would make us believe that the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>leading</hi> Men of his Party had no hand in any Tumults, no not in that at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1688.

And from this one ſingle Inſtance his Book is ruin'd and his Authority baffled, <note place="margin">Crimine ab uno diſie omnes.</note> and the next General Aſſembly will order him to be more <hi>cautious,</hi> and quietly tell him, it had been better he had not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon this <hi>unfortunate</hi> Sally againſt his Adverſaries. For there is nothing more eaſily made out than that the Leading Men of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were the ſole <hi>Actors</hi> and <hi>Contrivers</hi> of this hideous <hi>Tumult.</hi> To make you ſenſible of this, let me obſerve <hi>firſt,</hi> That he <hi>ſhuſſles</hi> and <hi>confounds</hi> two very different <hi>Stories</hi> into one, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tumultuous deſaceing of the Kings Chappel, and the burning of the Pope in Effigy: for the laſt was near a fortnight after the other without any <hi>Tumult</hi> or <hi>diſorder.</hi> The <hi>Students</hi> had made a mock <hi>Effigies</hi> of the Pope, and carryed it from the place that it was made to the Colledge, and from thence to the Croſs at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> All of them in the mean time walking orderly in their Ranks, and the Colledge <hi>Mace</hi> carryed before them by one of the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, this could not be obtained without the Maſters <hi>Permiſſion.</hi> So there was no Tumult nor no diſorder intended. A great many of the Nobility, and moſt of the Citizens of beſt quality were looking on, and when this fooliſh <hi>Ceremony</hi> was over, they retired to their Lodgings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Tumult or <hi>Extravagance.</hi> But the defacing the Chappel at <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rude Houſe</hi> was a <hi>Tumult</hi> indeed, and a very <hi>tragical</hi> one too, in all its <hi>beginnings</hi> and <hi>Conſequences.</hi> This fell out upon the 10. day of <hi>December,</hi> 1688. The Presbyterian Faction in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> had ſometime before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to Rifle the Kings Houſe, particularly my <hi>Lord Chancelor's Lodgings,</hi> to deface the <hi>Chappel,</hi> and to force the <hi>Guards,</hi> and in a word, to make the moſt <hi>terrible</hi> and the moſt <hi>numerous</hi> ſhew that they were able to make. In order to this they gave out that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> intended a <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though there was not a Papiſt in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to two thouſand Proteſtants: And in the Confuſion that Men were then in, a great many unwary people were frighted, and the Presbyterians <hi>concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60080:7"/>
their Meaſures and ſlew to their Arms, and the City for that night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a diſmal <hi>habitation,</hi> carrying all the marks of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Confuſion;</hi> nothing was to be heard but ſcreeches, lamentable <hi>howlings</hi> and <hi>ſhootings,</hi> and this was not managed by the Body of the People (who were very a verſe to ſuch treacherous and unmanly adventures) but by ſome of the Leading Presbyterians, who <hi>then</hi> and <hi>now</hi> have Authority in the State, and might be known by their large <hi>Buff-Belt,</hi> and a <hi>Halbard</hi> upon their Shoulder, running up and down in great fury to excite the People to this <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> In this Scuffle, before they entred the Chappel, there were ſome killed, and ſeveral wounded by the Guards that kept the <hi>King's</hi> Houſe, and in the mean time the <hi>Governours</hi> of this Tumult finding that the People were not ſo forward to Pillage the <hi>King's</hi> Houſe, went up and down and told them that their own Children were killed, when thoſe very Children were as Home and ſafe in their Lodgings. And though many were wounded, and ſeverals killed, yet not a Student belonging to the College was hurt, for there were but very few of them whoſe Youth and Levity had engaged them to be witneſſes of this Tumult.</p>
            <p>I believe the Ringleaders of the Presbyterians at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> will give the <hi>Vindicator</hi> but little thanks for mentioning this Tumult that is openly avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves And he may ask, not only the forementioned Gentleman, but alſo the Maſter of <hi>F</hi>—and ſeveral others (whoſe names are concealed, and may continue ſo, unleſs the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> or ſome of his <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> by their <hi>indiſcretions</hi> oblige me to be more particular) whether they were <hi>there,</hi> and what a glorious <hi>Figure</hi> they made. If it be unpleaſant to name particular Gentlemen, they may thank their <hi>Vindicator</hi> who obtrudes ſuch <hi>fulſome</hi> Lies upon the World, when the Matter of Fact is ſo very recent, and known to all the Inhabitants at <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> and the Leading <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are very loth to part with the honor of this Atchievement, ſo agreeable to their conſtant <hi>Genius</hi> and former Practiſes; for one of their chief Advocates pleaded lately before the Judges, in the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Wallace,</hi> that they that Pillaged the Kings Houſe were a <hi>Company of Grave, Reaſonable, Thinking Men, Commanded by a Lord of the Seſſions.</hi> We ſee then by this one ſingle Inſtance the Spirit of Lies and Vanity that runs through his Book. For if it be undenyable that this Rabble Reformation was <hi>concerted</hi> by the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> of the Faction. Then he muſt own that the Tumults were not the <hi>accidental Eſſorts</hi> of ſome angry inconſiderable People but the <hi>united</hi> endeavours of the Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>And indeed this Eſſay at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> was but the Preface to other marks of the Kindneſs they intended the Clergy in that place; if their violence had not been happily prevented by the Generous Reſolution of that <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Society of the College of Juſtice: and it is very probable that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> wrote down this Story carleſly and hand over head. For if he had adviſed with his Friends at <hi>Edenburgh, George Stirling</hi> the Apothecary, and Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> in the <hi>Locken buiths:</hi> they could not be ſo ſelf-denyed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60080:8"/>
as to be willingly deprived of the honour they had in <hi>managing</hi> and <hi>contriving</hi> this Tumult. <note place="margin">The very next Lords day one of their Miniſters in the Meeting-Houſe belonging to the <hi>Tron</hi> Church Pariſh, <hi>December</hi> 17. thanked God for this Glorious Reformation, I inſtance him not to exclude others, but becauſe I can prove it.</note> It was a diſparagement to their Zeal, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to be robbed of the <hi>Glory</hi> they acquired in this <hi>Enterpriſe.</hi> I cannot but acknowledge that it is highly indecent to name particular Men, but what ſhall we ſay when we have to do with ſuch <hi>Waſps</hi> and <hi>Hornets:</hi> you ſee then by the Reflections I have made of this General Topick, what the Superstructure muſt be.</p>
            <p>The next thing under which he endeavours to cover himſelf and his Party, is his fancy of an <hi>Interregnum.</hi> He tells us gravely in many places of his Book, that what was done againſt the Clergy was done in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum,</hi> and <hi>that the People were highly provoked by the Clergy,</hi> that they were <hi>inſtrumental</hi> in the Sufferings of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts.</hi> That the <hi>Clergy</hi> themſelves were but <hi>profligate</hi> and <hi>debauched,</hi> and that they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch as are unacquainted with the <hi>operation</hi> of the Spirit of God upon their Hearts; and if this does not <hi>excuſe,</hi> yet it <hi>extenuates</hi> what thoſe <hi>zealous</hi> Patriots did at that time to advance the <hi>Glorious Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice in the firſt place of his wild imagination of an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> which cannot properly fall out in an <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy; for the <hi>King</hi> never dies. For, Though the <hi>Laws</hi> were not put in Execution in that Interval of <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>uncertainty,</hi> yet they retained their <hi>Legal</hi> Force and <hi>Authority.</hi> The Government was indeed in a Convulſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that it could not perform the <hi>ordinary</hi> Functions of Order and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but does he think, that becauſe humane <hi>Laws</hi> were in that <hi>Interval</hi> hindred, that therefore the <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> Presbyterians were loosed from the Obligations of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Nature and Religion? Is there no ſecurity againſt the <hi>violent</hi> hands of thoſe <hi>Saints,</hi> but the <hi>coercive</hi> power of Laws? How can they pretend to be better Chriſtians than the reſt of their Neighbours when they venture upon the moſt <hi>unchriſtian</hi> Practices? Which puts me in mind of the Character that <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> gives of the <hi>Jews, They were kind and affectionate to their own Kindred, but they retained adverſus omnes alios hoſtile odium. Juvenal</hi> gives the ſame Character of them, but it is much more agreeable to the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Does he think that the Notion of an <hi>Interregnum</hi> can juſtifie what modeſt Men are aſhamed to own? <note place="margin">Non monſtrare vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as eadem niſi ſacra colenti.</note> And is it for the honour of his <hi>Party</hi> that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the World that they ſtand not in awe of the Divine Laws, unleſs they are reſtrained by the terrour of Humane Laws? Why do they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be acquainted with the Goſpel, when they <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>jointly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomn its moſt <hi>eſſential</hi> Precepts? But he ſays the People were much injured and <hi>provoked by the Clergy.</hi> What the Clergy in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> did,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60080:8"/>
I know not, if I make an eſtimate of their proceedings againſt <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,</hi> from the practice of our Clergy-Men in other parts of the Nation, I declare ſincerely to you I never knew one of them that proſecuted the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> without great reluctancy, nay I knew many of them that interpoſed with ſincere kindneſs and vigor for their Pariſhioners, frequently and with ſucceſs too, when they were obnoxious to the Laws.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe that the Clergy did proſecute the Diſſenters according to Law, they did nothing in this but what they were obliged to do, the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Nation was <hi>indangered,</hi> the <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Lineal</hi> Monarchy was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and the Government, by ſuch frequent <hi>ſhakings,</hi> most likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into its former <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Civil War</hi> and <hi>Confuſion;</hi> and the ſouls of the People committed to their Care were poyſoned with <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Principles: Speaking evil of Dignities</hi> took place of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and a Schism unreaſonable in its beginnings, and diſowned by all Proteſtant Churches, and the <hi>learnedeſt Presbyterians</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60080:9"/>
               <hi>Principles,</hi> when the wickedneſs of the Party appeared thus terrible to the Peace of the Nation, was it to be expected that our Governours ſhould look on and ſuffer their own <hi>Throats</hi> to be cut, their <hi>Families</hi> to be forfeited, their <hi>King</hi> to be dethroned, their <hi>Church Polity</hi> to be pulled down, and the entire <hi>Scheme</hi> of their Government to be defaced? And all this for no other Reaſon, and upon no wiſer Conſideration, than becauſe their Enemies <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Religion, and gave moſt <hi>ſacred</hi> Names to the moſt <hi>abominable</hi> Crimes. And now again that they are uppermoſt, they are very angry that men do not ſhut their Eyes, and ſuffer their Follies and Tyranny to overſpread the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Contradiction. But what was it, that <hi>their</hi> Miniſters did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon the Reſtitution of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Why they would not take <hi>Preſentations</hi> from the Patron, nor <hi>Collation</hi> from the Biſhop: they would poſſeſs their Benefices againſt the Law, and in defiance of Authority: but was any of them turned out that did comply with the Law? <note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Lighton.</hi>
               </note> So earneſt were ſome of our Eccleſiaſtical Governors to keep them in their Places, that they made ſuch offers of Peace and Accommodation, as none could refuſe but <hi>ſullen</hi> and <hi>deſperate</hi> Incendiaries, nor was there any thing required of them, but what the moſt rigid Presbyterians might comply with, if their Zeal to ſupport their Faction had not infatuated them as much againſt the Vow of Baptiſm, as againſt the common Peace and Safety of their Country.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> are generally blinded with this <hi>fatal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice (an Evidence of their incurable Enthuſiaſm) they think that no man can act any thing againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but he immediately acts againſt the light of his own Conſcience. They take it for granted that their <hi>way</hi> is the only true Religion, that it is <hi>plainly</hi> revealed, and that they give greater Evidences of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> than any other Society of Chriſtians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and if you do not believe this preſently, without Examination, you are far <hi>from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Nay, you are <hi>alienated from the life of God.</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> conclude that whatever is done againſt their Party, is done rather againſt the Light and Conviction of their Enemies, than the petulance and vanity of their <hi>own</hi> Fraternity: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they inſinuate upon all occaſions, that all Reaſonings againſt them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Prophanity and Atheiſm, or from men void of all <hi>Principles</hi> and Religion. You may as eaſily reaſon a <hi>Bedlamite</hi> out of his fancied Honors and Principalities, as perſuade any of their deluded Diſciples that they may be in an Errour: and this they owe to their <hi>cunning</hi> Teachers, who tyrannize over their <hi>Belief</hi> as imperiouſly as the cruel <hi>Brach-mans</hi> do among the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let me enquire in the next place calmly, did the meek <hi>Covenanters</hi> when they got the aſcendent in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his time, treat their Oppoſite with that <hi>gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>diſcretion,</hi> that <hi>condeſcention</hi> and <hi>longanimity,</hi> that became the true Goſpel of our Saviour? But ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from this temper, that they proſecuted the <hi>Malignants</hi> with all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60080:9"/>
               <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> And if there were not another inſtance of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Sufferings of the <hi>excellent Biſhop Wiſhart,</hi> men might eaſily penetrate into the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Party. Then their Pulpits thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered againſt the <hi>Malignants</hi> all the <hi>Curſes</hi> in the Bible; and all were <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,</hi> in their Dialect, that were not <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Add to this the univerſal and reſtleſs endeavours of their Miniſters to ruin the <hi>Perſons, Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Families,</hi> of all that oppoſed their <hi>Deſigns:</hi> and their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was made an Engine to pry into the greateſt Secrets of Families, and the Presbyterian Chaplain, who was ordinarily the Miniſters Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer, complained in his Prayers of what he thought amiſs in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Neighbourhood, nay the Soundest part of the Nation groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Tyrannical <hi>Pedantry,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did under the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when their bloody Scaffolds ſtood erected for ſome whole weeks together. Then it was, that their <hi>modeſt</hi> Miniſters ſaid that <hi>their Cauſe</hi> was like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, when they juſtified one Crime by the Commiſſion of another, and the whole <hi>Scheme</hi> of their Arbitrary Tyranny from their Succeſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; when their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Argument of Force and Arms ran down the Doctrines of our <hi>Meek and Crucified Saviour.</hi> And now forſooth they muſt tell us, that the Epiſcopal Clergy were <hi>rigid,</hi> and <hi>peeviſh,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, to their Pariſhioners; when perhaps they did not repreſent to the Judges, in their ſeveral bounds, the tenth part of thoſe Crimes that were committed againſt the Church and State; and yet the Law did oblige them to give up the names of Recuſants. And do not we ſee, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians ſince the late <hi>Revolution</hi> have out done the diligence of all men againſt the Clergy and Laity of the Epiſcopal perſuaſion, for the whole Faction applyed their utmoſt force (ſince the <hi>Revolution)</hi> to ruin her Neighbours, and poſſeſs themſelves of all their Places, <hi>Civil, Military, and Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, there are no people upon Earth that value Government and Sovereignty as the Presbyterians do. It is the Idol they bow to: there is nothing gratifies their highest Paſſions ſo much as a power to tyrannize. If the whole world were once under their Feet, they would look chearful, their Blood would <hi>Circulate</hi> more <hi>briskly;</hi> untill this be obtained there is no reſt nor peace for mankind. The <hi>Diſcipline, the Sacred Diſcipline of Geneve,</hi> muſt <hi>wreſtle</hi> with all Authority until the Conſumation of all things.</p>
            <p>But if the former excuſe did not ſerve his <hi>Deſign;</hi> yet it is often inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all a long his Book that moſt of the <hi>Clergy</hi> were <hi>wicked men.</hi> But let me ſuppoſe the truth of this <hi>infamous</hi> accuſation; who made <hi>them</hi> Judges of the <hi>Scandalous</hi> Clergy? Whoſe Delegats were they in the <hi>Execution</hi> of this Puniſhment? I have told you before that I am acquainted with very few of the Clergy of the Weſtern Shires, but I am informed by judicious and intelligent Men, that generally the Clergy in thoſe Shires were <hi>Grave, Sober,</hi> and <hi>Aſſiduous</hi> in the work of the Miniſtry. That moſt of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60080:10"/>
upon all occaſions to gain thoſe <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> from their <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Deluſion,</hi> and were very ſucceſsful in this Chriſtian deſign, if a new <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> after the Defeat at <hi>Bothwel</hi> Bridge had not buoyed up their <hi>Intereſt.</hi> As for the <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Aſperſions caſt upon the Clergy by the Weſtern Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, it is certain that by one of the Vindicators own <hi>Rules</hi> we ought not to believe them; becauſe they are all of them of a <hi>Party,</hi> and indeed of ſuch a Party, who from their firſt appearance in the World placed much of their ſtrength in reproaching the <hi>Clergy.</hi> If ſome of the Miniſters in the Weſt did not live according to the Dignity of their Character, we ought rather all of us (who have not renounced our Baptiſm) to lament it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than inſult and upbraid them with it. Indeed a Miniſter, whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is to fit other men for Eternal Life, and yet lives in open and ſcandalous oppoſition to his Rule, is the moſt <hi>monſtrous</hi> thing in Nature. All the Satyrical Writings of the Poets, and all the Invectives of Orators, cannot furniſh one word to give a true <hi>Idea</hi> of that loathſome Creature. But on the other hand, If any of them be guilty, to upbraid them with their faults, is not the way to reform them, for of all Advices thoſe that are given to reform the Clergy, ſhould be managed moſt nicely and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. And it is to be feared that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> and his <hi>Aſſociates</hi> are very glad when they can diſcover the trippings of their Adverſaries. If any of the Clergy be guilty of ſuch things as are clamorouſly alledged by <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> it is no Argument againſt the common Cauſe of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, and the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Succeſſion of that <hi>Hierareby</hi> of Biſhop, <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> continued from the days of the Apoſtles until now. And therefore he may, if he will (as is threatned) employ the people in the Weſt to make and gather ſtories to the diſadvantage of the Epiſcopal Clergy, and it is an eaſie thing to ſwell that Volumn into a prodigious Bulk, if their ignorant and implacable Enemies may be believed, it is not poſſible for them not to accuſe. But I think the Vindicator himſelf, is not of ſo <hi>profligate</hi> a <note place="margin">The Presbyterians in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> libelled all kind of Crimes againſt the Clergy before the Rump Parliament, and one of them was deprived for drunkenneſs, who was ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious, that he never drank any thing in his life but Milk and Water.</note> Conſcience as to give Ear to ſuch <hi>malicious</hi> Reports. We have had late Inſtances of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> activity againſt the Reputation of the Clergy, no man could eſcape a Libel that enjoyed a <hi>comfortable</hi> Benefice. Nothing could have made the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> more contemptible than this <hi>treacherous</hi> and <hi>ſneaking</hi> method of <hi>Libelling,</hi> when it was viſible to all men that thoſe ſcurrilous Papers were intended for no more, than to ruin and diſgrace the moſt <hi>innocent</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving men. And it is very odd that they could venture to blindfold the Nation by this <hi>baſſled</hi> and <hi>hypocritical</hi> Sham, and how comes it that the Clergy in the Weſt are repreſented as <hi>Criminals,</hi> when they dare not attack the Clergy in the North? The reaſon is obvious, the People in the <hi>Weſt</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60080:10"/>
date their <hi>Converſion</hi> from the time that they forbear to hear the <hi>Curates,</hi> and they think themſelves obliged by all their ties and ſolemn <hi>Covenants,</hi> to ruin and diſparage thoſe <hi>limbs</hi> of Antichriſt. But the People in the North can diſcover no ſuch beauty in their Presbyterian <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> they love and honour their own <hi>Miniſters,</hi> they hear them Preach the Articles of Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> and true and ſolid Morals, and ſo rough are thoſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> in the North, that they never thought <hi>Sniveling</hi> neceſſary to make a <hi>great Saint.</hi> They love a plain and unaffected Stile, and they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded but that the Oracles of God may be Preached without <hi>affectation,</hi> and yet with all requiſite <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Recollection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be ſo many Libels gathered by <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it may provoke their Enemies to recriminate, and if the Vindicator thinks that ſuch <hi>ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous</hi> writings can ſerve the common cauſe of Religion, I wiſh him more wiſdom and ſobriety: I condemn all <hi>ſuch</hi> methods in all Parties, and if the thing were allowable, we could tell him that many of his Aſſociates in the Miniſtry are very <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> ſome of them <hi>Adulterers.</hi> ſome <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,</hi> ſome <hi>Blaſphemers;</hi> ſome whole Presbyterian Families <hi>Inceſtuous,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>—Sed praeſtat motos componere fluctus.</q>
            <p>If I rejoyced in this Recrimination, I were not a good Chriſtian. But it is neceſſary to put thoſe Proud and Supercillous men in mind, that they are but ordinary Mortals, encompaſſed about with the ſame Infirmities with other men, and that they ſhould conſult the Scriptures, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Arguments, rather than the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Zealots in the Weſtern Shires; and if they beat the Clergy at thoſe Weapons, they deſerve to be chaſtiſed; and for a concluſion to this Obſervation, I muſt tell you that I know not a more <hi>unblamable</hi> Company of men upon Earth than the Epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor do I know any five of them in the whole Nation, who could not undergo the ſevereſt Examinations, uſed in the Chriſtian Church <hi>Preparatory</hi> to <hi>Ordination,</hi> I wiſh that they may make a Chriſtian uſe of their preſent <hi>Tryals,</hi> and give the world a proof of that greatneſs of ſoul that qualifies men for the Prieſthood; that all round about them may be convinced <hi>that he that is in them is greater than he that is in the World. Seneca</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John <hi>Ep.</hi>
               </note> tells us that <hi>to do good even when it is attended with infamy, is noble and heroick:</hi> and a greater than <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, that <hi>we muſt go thorough good report and bad report;</hi> God will clear our <hi>Innocence</hi> as the Sun in his <hi>Meridian Elevation,</hi> and I hope to the Conviction of our Enemies, that in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of our ſouls we deſigned the Reformation of ſinners, and that we look upon our ſelves as Dedicated to the <hi>immediate</hi> Service of God, and the ſooner we retire into our own Conſciences, and diſcover the ſecret <hi>Springs</hi> of our <hi>preſent</hi> Calamity, the ſooner will our heavenly Father remove the marks of his Indignation. There is no Argument ſo proper to convince the Ignorance of <hi>fooliſh</hi> men as by well doing: and though we

ſhould not be ſo ſuccesful in gaining <hi>Proſelites in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation,</hi> yet we fortifie the Peace and Tranqulllity of our Conſciences, we ſtrengthen our ſelves againſt thoſe things that are moſt <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi> to Fleſh and Blood, <hi>we rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> in the midſt of all Calamities and Reproaches that are caſt upon us.

            <p>I leave this, and I go forward to another Topick by which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to vindicate the Presbyterians; and it is this that the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did preſs the Conſciences of the Presbyterians; and that the People could not own them <note place="margin">

But the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſhould conſider, that if his Argument be turn'd againſt his Party in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it may be of <hi>dangerous</hi> Conſequence to the growth of <hi>Presbytery.</hi> For the bresbyterians there are not likely to carry their Elections by plurality of Votes; but does not he remember that ſeverals of the Remonſtrator Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians have been <hi>inducted</hi> to their Churches by ſome Troops of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe in the time of the late Civil Wars, yet he does not think but that the People owed all <hi>Deference</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Obedience to them; and if a <note n="*" place="margin">His own word.</note>

But does not the Vindicator remember that ſome have been obtruded on the <hi>old College</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> without the <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Collegiate</hi> Election, by the ſame very force that had planted ſome Remonſtrator Miniſters, and that without any <hi>Tryal</hi> or Examination, when their more deſerving <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> were moſt Tyrannically removed.</p>
            <p>But not to trifle with the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> The method of admitting Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Epiſcopal Conſtitution, is the moſt <hi>juſt,</hi> and the moſt <hi>unexceptionable</hi> that can be deviſed.

can complain of in this Eccleſiaſtical Polity? The Conſuſions of Elections that are ſolely left to the People are innumerable, and though we had not famous and remarkable Inſtances in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the bloody and tragical Effects of ſuch popular Elections, our own Country might furniſh us with very many ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">

               </note> when the Pariſhoners could not compromiſe the affair peaceably, they quickly came to Blowes, and in many places to Bloodſhed, and Riots. Theſe were all the good effects we could diſcern of their popular Elections; it cannot be denyed, but that the method of electing the Clergy <hi>varied</hi> often and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under many <hi>Figures</hi> in ſeveral Ages, and Countries, ſince the firſt <hi>Plantations</hi> of Chriſtianity: but I dare boldly ſay no Chriſtian Church came nearer the Apoſtolical Method, and more happily avoided both Extremes, than the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> under the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But you may put the Vindicator in mind <note place="margin">Wherever they dare venture, they have no regard to the popular Call, as lately appeared at <hi>Leith,</hi> the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous popular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. <hi>George Gray</hi> was refuſed, and one <hi>Wiſhart</hi> a Presbyterian thruſt upon them.</note> that the Presbyterians themſelves never thought the <hi>Call</hi> of the People ſo <hi>eſſential</hi> a Conſtitution of that <hi>Paſtoral Relation.</hi> For there is an Act of the General Aſſembly, ordering the Presbytery to name a Miniſter to ſuch Pariſhes as were Malignant, that is, ſuch as were of the Epiſcopal perſuaſion, ſo this pretended popular Election, if at any time it prove unſerviceable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Tyranny, is immediately rejected. For the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do not at all believe any ſuch inherent Right in the People to chuſe their own Miniſters; for they think the Malignants have no Right to chuſe for themſelves, this is the ſole privilege of the <hi>Godly.</hi> The Malignants are not at all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, accordingly we ſee that though their <hi>Parliament</hi> Iudged the power of Election in the Heretors and Elders of each Pariſh, or in the major part of them, yet no Elections are allowed by the Presbyteries, though never ſo unanimous and univerſal, but ſuch as are promoted by their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, witneſs <hi>Muſſelburgh</hi> and <hi>Tranent.</hi>

            <p>There is hardly any thing inſiſted upon by the Presbyterians more fooliſh and inconſiſtent with common honeſty than this Topick from popular <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and to ſay the truth, the old Presbyterians never obtrude ſuch a whimſey upon the People: the Lay Patronages were not aboliſhed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> until the year 49. when the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was in its <hi>Zeaith</hi> when there was no ſin Preached againſt but <hi>Malignancy,</hi> and the King, Prerogative Royal was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Kirk.

As for the grave and retired Clergy-Man, he is ſure never to be preferred; and if ſome judicious and diſcreet Patron does not force him out of his Solitude, he is like to die amongſt his Books, and the Church has been ſerved in all Ages to the best Advantages by ſuch as leaſt underſtood the Arts of <hi>Inſinuation,</hi> and it will continue ſo until the end of all things.</p>
            <p>In the next place I do not ſee why the Vindicator ſhould ſay that the Clergy <hi>preſſed the Conſciences of their Hearers:</hi> there was nothing in our worſhip, but the uſe of the Lords Prayer, the Doxology, and the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Creed at Baptiſm, that they themſelves objected againſt, are not theſe mighty <hi>Grievances</hi> to <hi>Tender Conſciences?</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> tells us that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians were not againſt the uſe of thoſe <hi>Forms</hi> but they would not uſe them as the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> did. What he means by this I cannot tell; but I can tell you that all the Presbyterians before the year 1638. made uſe of them all. And that after the year 38. until <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Army invaded our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they never left off the uſing of thoſe <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Forms. But ſuch of the Remonſtrators as were deeply in the Intereſts of the <hi>Uſurper,</hi> then left off the uſe of ſuch <hi>Forms,</hi> drawing as near as was poſſible to the Spiritual Heights, and pretended Purity of the <hi>Independents</hi> in the <hi>Army.</hi> And the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion at that time in our Nation varied in its outward Figure, and in their <hi>Notions</hi> about it as much as the Philoſophy of the Schools, and the <hi>wiſe</hi> Queſtions of <hi>Univerſale</hi> and <hi>Objectum Attributionis logicae.</hi> The Vindicator is content to uſe ſuch Forms, but not as the <hi>Epiſcopal Church doth command it.</hi> That is to ſay, he will do nothing in <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> with the Chriſtian Church, and though the Vow of Baptiſm oblige us, as we are Members of Chriſts Myſtical Body, to preſerve and ſupport the Unity of the Chriſtian Church, yet he thinks he may leave the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, without either fear or ſcruple, in thoſe very things that are ſhort <hi>Abſtracts</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi> of our <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> And yet no People are now ſo violent as they in preſſing <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Confeſſion at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> without any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, reſtriction,</hi> or <hi>explication,</hi> I am of Opinion that <note place="margin">

               </note> the Epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been from their Infancy taught in, (and are firmly reſolved to adhere to) the Proteſtant Religion, and is it not a piece of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vanity in the Presbyterians to inſinuate that they themſelves are the only men careful to preſerve the purity of Doctrine? Did not the Clergy that addreſſed to the pretended General Aſſembly, plainly declare that they would ſubſcribe the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion, as it contained the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60080:12"/>
Fundamentals of Proteſtant Religion. But this the Vindicator thinks did not ſufficiently purge them from the ſuſpicion of being <hi>Arminians.</hi> There are but very few of the Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> that explain the Doctrine of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Freewill</hi> after the method of <hi>Arminius;</hi> and if any of them does not favor the <hi>Calvinian Hypotheſis</hi> they are very far from propagating their Opinions in a factious manner, and not at all enclined to change the <hi>Pulpit</hi> into a <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> Chair. I think it is no diſparagement to either of the Parties to ſay that every one of them cannot ſtate ſuch controverſial differences <hi>fairly,</hi> and reaſon about them <hi>cloſely;</hi> nor is it neceſſary for every Country Miniſter to read <hi>Alvarez</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tuiſſe, Arminius</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> Thoſe queſtions have been debated in all Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and if we underſtand ſo little of our <hi>ſelves,</hi> of our own <hi>ſoul,</hi> and its <hi>union</hi> with the body, the <hi>method</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of its operations.

            <p>Another Topick by which he endeavours to provoke the preſent Powers againſt the Epiſcopal Clergy, is, that <note place="margin">Page 24. <hi>Edinb.</hi> Edit.</note> they are Enemies to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> I have no Commiſſion to give an account of particular mens Opinions in the Controverſie that is now debated in <hi>Britain,</hi> but I may obſerve that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> puts a mean Complement upon King <hi>William,</hi> to tell the World in Print that the Intereſt of King <note place="margin">Page <hi>ibid.

               <hi>William,</hi> and that of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> is embarqued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>i. e.</hi> If King <hi>William</hi> does not punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <note place="margin">For they fancy the Covenant to be the tenure by which any King may hold his Crown.</note> the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> they know well enough what they owe all earthly Kings. Again he tells us, that ſuch of the Epiſcopal Clergy as addreſſed to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> never thought of any ſuch Addreſs, until they had loſt all hopes of King <hi>James;</hi> and by this he thinks to diſparage the Epiſcopal Clergy wonderfully: whereas the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rightly turn'd is to their Advantage. That they never <hi>treacherouſly</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60080:13"/>

And therefore he himſelf (not others) deſerves to have his <hi>Neck ſtretched</hi> for adhereing to ſuch Principles, as neceſſarily overthrow in their laſt <hi>conſequence</hi> all Government and Order.</p>
            <p>Another Topick upon which he and others found many of their Libels againſt the Clergy, is, that they were ſubſervient in the late Reigns to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Arbitrary Power by their Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive Obedience. <note place="margin">
                  <l>—Nunquamne reponam</l>

               </note> The Epiſcopal Clergy Preached no Doctrine but the true Chriſtian Doctrine, which can never be overthrown by all the Attempts of their Adverſaries; they Preached indeed that in every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was a Supreme Legal Tribunal, from whoſe Deciſions there lay no Appeal upon Earth.

whether the King of <hi>Scots</hi> may be reſiſted, I will tell the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> my Opinion when he and I ſtands upon a Level.

               </note> in that caſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, <hi>That a Houſe divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi> And do the Presbyterians think to recommend themſelves by aſſerting ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as neceſſarily overthrow all Government?

            <p>The <hi>Vindicator</hi> himſelf thinks that the Authority of <note place="margin">Pag. 96. and 97.</note> the Nation in the Convention or Parliament, may take away the Legal Right that belongs to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> Had not the Clergy as good right to their by-paſt <hi>Stipends</hi> as any man had to his <hi>private</hi> Eſtate?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60080:14"/>
So it ſeems that in ſome caſes the Convention may <hi>invade</hi> the <hi>Property</hi> of private men, eſpecially the <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy, and this is no other ſtretch of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> than what was practiſed formerly againſt the Lieges in the <hi>warmeſt weather</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when private men were compelled to lend their mony to Levy an <hi>Army</hi> againſt the <hi>King:</hi> yet ſince it was to <hi>advance</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> there was nothing <hi>Arbitrary</hi> in it, and though it was open <hi>Robbery,</hi> and never <hi>practiſed</hi> by any of our Kings, yet we were <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>ſtoop</hi> to Ruin and Poverty, becauſe the Covenanters ſaid that this was our <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> So they that clamour moſt againſt <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, <hi>practiſe</hi> it moſt when they dare venture.</p>
            <p>Another Imputation whereby the Presbyterians endeavour to fully the Reputation of the Epiſcopal Clergy is this, that the kindneſs that any have for Epiſcopacy proceeds from the Eſpiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's indulging men in their <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>immoralities.</hi> And <note place="margin">Pag. 76. and pag. 166.</note> this is the old ſtory, and contains nothing but their <hi>inveterate ſpite</hi> and <hi>malice.</hi> What is it that the Epiſcopal Church teaches that <hi>indulges</hi> men in their ſins? What Doctrine is it, that's publickly owned or taught by the Epiſcopal Church, that has the leaſt tendency to the breach of any of Gods Commandments? How long ſhall theſe <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Strife</hi> continue in their <hi>Impudence?</hi> Though this Accuſation be as <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> as it is <hi>indeſinite,</hi> yet upon this occaſion they ordinarily magnifie their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> as the moſt Sovereign Remedy againſt the <hi>immoralities</hi> of the Age, much after the ſame manner that Montebanks do when they ſet off their <hi>Drugs</hi> with <hi>vehement</hi> and zealous <hi>Harrangues;</hi> and if you have the patience for a quarter of an hour you'll hear all that they can ſay. Whereas a grave experienced <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> will make no ſuch <hi>promiſes,</hi> but he'll calmly conſider the preſent <hi>temper</hi> of your Body, the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of your Diſeaſe, and <hi>proportion</hi> his Applications to your ſtrength, and other Circumſtances, without <hi>noiſe</hi> or <hi>Oſtentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no effect that ever the <hi>Presbyterian Diſcipline</hi> had towards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the World, unleſs you reckon that the murthering of Baſtard Children was of that Nature. It cannot be denyed but that the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Miniſters uſe <hi>long</hi> Diſcourſes to the <hi>Whores</hi> that ſit on the <hi>Stool</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> but they cannot name three of them that ever mounted that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Seat but they became <hi>Proſtitutes,</hi> and when once they made <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of their <hi>Modeſty,</hi> one may gueſs what followed. And their publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in this manner made them <hi>impudent.</hi> This is all the Reformation I know that their Diſcipline moſt eminently promotes; its true indeed there was a very remakable Step towards the Reformation made by Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> and his Aſſociates, the firſt year of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> when the Wells were locked up, and none could have freſh Water upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> yet as much Wine and Brandy was allowed as one was pleaſed to call for.

                  <hi>Vid.

It is pleaſant to hear them declaim againſt the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of Papal Power, and yet meddle with all that ever he medled <note place="margin">Act of General Aſſembly 49.</note> with.</p>
            <p>We know what Profanations of the Name of God were occaſioned by this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the year 1648. when the beſt of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and others were made to profeſs their <hi>Repentance</hi> for the <hi>Lawful</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. I do not plead againſt <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline;</hi> for it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is a Society founded by our Lord and Saviour. But this new fantaſtick and apiſh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſtrictneſs, is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with <hi>reaſon,</hi> as it is indeed <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>true</hi> and <hi>regular Devotion.</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> uſes to refer his Readers to other Books, I cannot condemn that practiſe, therefore I wiſh him to Read <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Bramhall</hi>'s Treatiſe of the <hi>new</hi> Diſcipline. There is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable than to ſee the <hi>Antient</hi> Diſcipline revived, and all men ought to Pray that God would direct our Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Governours,</hi> to reſtore the <hi>Primitive</hi> Diſcipline, ſo as the moſt negligent may be awakened, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and encouraged to repent, and teſtifie his Repentance by the moſt <hi>unfeigned mortification,</hi> and Charity.</p>
            <p>Thus I have run over ſome of the General Heads that are ſcattered up and down his Vindication, and given you freely but very briefly my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them. The next thing I undertook for your ſatisfaction was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Author, by the Characters that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of him in his <hi>Vindication.</hi> Not that I conclude him <hi>habitually</hi> ſuch, for perhaps the <hi>paroxyſms</hi> of his Indignation are over, but this I may conclude that when this Book was written, he was overdriven with his paſſion: I do not immediately conclude him to be of <hi>the Seed of the Serpent,</hi> nor <hi>of the Race of Eſau,</hi> nor a <note place="margin">His own manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſions.</note> 
               <hi>Villain, nor the Succeſſor of Judas Iſcariot, nor a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh.</hi> Though he oppoſes the Apoſtolical Government of Epiſcopacy, he is not of my Opinion; but I do not think he deſerves any Cenſure on that account that he is not of my Perſuaſion. His Adverſaries cannot drive him to a greater abſurdity than if he be made to vent his Paſſion in perſonal <hi>Reflections,</hi> and therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſix nothing upon his <hi>perſon</hi> but what naturally follows from his <hi>own</hi> words.</p>
            <p>I charge him therefore in the firſt place with open and <note place="margin">Pag. 94.</note> avowed <hi>Partiality.</hi> He rejects the Teſtimony of any man that is not of his Party, ſo he rejects the Teſtimony of <hi>John Gibſon,</hi> one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Glaſgow becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he was of a party, and made.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Alderman.</note> 
               <hi>a Bailiff by the Archbiſhop;</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60080:15"/>
and all <hi>knew the Prelates. Inclinations towards the preſent Civil Government.</hi> His Argument may be reduced into <hi>form</hi> thus, the Biſhop was an enemy to the <hi>Civil</hi> Government, <hi>John Gibſon</hi> was named a Bailiff by the Biſhop: <hi>Ergo</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>John Gibſon</hi> ought not to be received in a <hi>Matter of Fact:</hi> this is very hard, how can a man at <hi>London</hi> be more credibly inform'd of a Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> than by the <hi>Authentick</hi> Teſtimonies of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> but he tells us the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were of a Party, and what of that? By this method of <hi>reaſoning</hi> what becomes of <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Presbyterians? Muſt not we believe him at all becauſe he is of a different <hi>perſuaſion?</hi> Juſt ſo our Author treats Mr. <hi>Morer,</hi> one of the <hi>Prebendaries</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> who wrote the firſt Letter of the Perſecutions. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> tells us <hi>it is one lie from the beginning to the end,</hi> and why all this <hi>harſhneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeverity?</hi> Why? Becauſe the <hi>Vindicator</hi> imagines him to be a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> though he ventured his perſon in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſwore the Oath of Allegiance to K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and wrote this Letter to one of his <hi>Eccleſtaſtical</hi> Superiors in <hi>England,</hi> yet the account he gave of the <hi>Scots</hi> Affairs did not pleaſe the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and therefore he's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>transformed</hi> into a <hi>Jacobite.</hi> This is a very hard caſe, but why may not even the <hi>Jacobites</hi> be received as Witneſſes. The <hi>Jews</hi> when they ſwear upon the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> are received as Witneſſes before all Judicatures, and in all Courts in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> ſo are the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> when they ſwear upon the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and all <hi>Pagans</hi> if they ſwear by the <hi>Idol</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But Mr. <hi>Morer</hi> is no <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and therefore his Teſtimony muſt be rejected; thus with one daſh of his Pen he overthrows all the Accounts that he himſelf had from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to the Diſparagement of the Epiſcopal Clergy, or in defence of their Enemies, for they are all of them of a Party, and obliged by their Oaths to <note place="margin">Page 85.</note> ruin Epiſcopacy. And again he rejects the Teſtimony of a <hi>great</hi> and an <hi>exact</hi> Hiſtorian, becauſe he was no <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> And again, The Teſtimony of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, <note place="margin">Page 88.</note> Witneſſing the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> muſt not <note place="margin">Page 100.</note> be received. <note place="margin">Page 109.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing very remarkable in this Book, is the Author's peremptory and dogmatick pretences to the <hi>Jus Divinum of Presbytery,</hi> contrary to the Modeſty, or rather Caution of the firſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who declared in their publick Conſeſſions, that all <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Confeſſion of Faith inſerted in the Oath of the Teſt.</note> Church Polity was <hi>variable,</hi> and <hi>changeable;</hi> but the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> think they cannot juſtifie their Zeal for their now Polity, unleſs the People believe it to be of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> But how to make up this Divine Right from the <hi>Precepts</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the firſt Ages of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> they know not; they are reſolved to ſay it is of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and then they work hard for <hi>ſtrained Conſequences,</hi> and hence it is that they are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60080:15"/>
very angry if their <hi>intrinſick Eccleſiaſtical</hi> power lodged in this <hi>parity</hi> be not obeyed, or <hi>queſtioned.</hi> So the <hi>Vindicator</hi> complains that ſuch of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> as addreſſed to them, did conſider them no otherwiſe than as a <hi>Company</hi> of men that derived all the Power they had from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and was not this a mighty aſtront? They cannot endure that they ſhould be conſidered as <hi>Delegates</hi> of the State, when as yet all the Nation knows, and common Senſe muſt determine they could have no power over the Epiſcopal Clergy, but what they derived from the State; and therefore all along he aſſerts poſitively, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbytery is the <hi>immediate Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But I muſt be ſo juſt to him as to acknowledge that moſt of all his Brethren, are equally <hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>dogmatick</hi> upon this Head, and though <hi>Calvin</hi> acknowledges great honor and deference to be due to Prelates <hi>etiam hoc nomine,</hi> if they ſhould embrace the Reformation, yet his Diſciples are more improved, and cannot endure that any other Church Pollty ſould prevail. From this proceed the <hi>high</hi> and <hi>lofty</hi> Epithets they beſtow upon <hi>Presbytery; Chriſts viſible Kingdom upon Earth,</hi> his Royal <hi>Crown and Scepter, his expreſs Inſtitution and Diſcipline.</hi> And upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis they become proud and inſolent, they deſpiſe all their oppoſites as men not acquainted with the Spirit of <note place="margin">Page 185.</note> God. and enemies to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. <note place="margin">Page 178.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing I take notice of in his Writings, is, his <hi>rudeneſs</hi> and <hi>vanity.</hi> He repreſents his Adverſary as a <hi>Liar,</hi> and a <hi>Villain,</hi> though he cannot prove that the Author of the Hiſtory of the General Aſſembly wrote one <hi>Lie,</hi> from the beginning to the end, if the Accounts he got from ſuch as were preſent were not ſo exact, he himſelf was not to be blamed; but the <hi>Vindicator</hi> cannot prove that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation <note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> he got was falſe. Again, one of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries is repreſented as a <hi>Liar,</hi> and a <hi>Slanderer,</hi> and tell us again that the Council appointed that no <hi>Decreet</hi> ſhould paſs in ſavour of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy, until the Parliament ſhould determine in that <hi>extraordinary</hi> caſe; where I take notice, that according to the <hi>Vindicators</hi> preſent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Council may <hi>ſtop</hi> and <hi>diſable</hi> the Laws, eſpecially when the the Epiſcopal Clergy Proſecute their <hi>Debitors</hi> before the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Judge. and therefore the Council may invade any mans <hi>Legal Property,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Law,</hi> and much more the <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet this is a ſtretch or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power,</hi> never heard of in <hi>Scotland</hi> notwithſtanding of all the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clamors of that <hi>reſtleſs</hi> Faction. He may if he will endeavour to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that <hi>Arbitrary ſtretch,</hi> but I think that they who were moſt active in it, do truly think <hi>ſhame</hi> of it as a thing as much <hi>unprecedented</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, He inſinuates that the Clergy had Clubs for <note place="margin">Pag. 55</note> thinking, and that it is an impudent falſhood that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>R.</hi> or Mr. <hi>Malcolm</hi> made application to the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> As
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60080:16"/>
for the laſt whether he made application, or after what manner, I neither know nor ſhall I ever enquire. As for the firſt he is at his reſt, and I will not rake into his Aſhes; but this is certainly known, although he had addreſſed unto the Presbyteries, he had been rejected becauſe he was one of the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> for his Party had determined to break through all obſtacles of Juſtice and Decency, rather than ſuffer any of the Epiſcopal Clergy to continue within the City of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Nay, no Presbyterian was allowed, if once he had made the leaſt Advances of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with Epiſcopacy, as was then too viſible in the Caſe of Mr <hi>Wilky.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vindicator's</hi> clowniſh Buffoonry, and inſulting over the afflicted, in the 4th. page, I omit. You will excuſe me if I do not tranſcribe the moſt part of his Book, the ordinary Epithets he beſtows on his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are, that they are <hi>impudent Slanderers</hi> and <hi>Villains;</hi> but when his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic</hi> Paſſion is put into a higher <hi>ferment,</hi> they are <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of <hi>Judas Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> and <hi>Rabſhakes.</hi> No doubt the Siſters will think that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is a <hi>precious convincing man,</hi> he tramples upon the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy as if they were below his <hi>notice,</hi> there is no grapling with a <hi>Giant</hi> of ſo much <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt be taught better <hi>manners</hi> than to venture upon this man of <hi>Oak</hi> and <hi>Forehead,</hi> poor Creatures! Have not we been taught better than to make publick the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Faction?</hi> if this man write once again, he will <hi>ruin</hi> us for ever.</p>
            <p>Is not the World well mended by this Reformation? But I had rather prove the <hi>Vindicator</hi> a Lyar than call him ſo, and therefore you may ask him who gave him information that my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> had gathered together at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> two thouſand men of the Kings <hi>disbanded</hi> Forces, that with them he <note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> might <hi>ſurprize</hi> the <hi>Convention,</hi> when all the Nation knows that when he retir'd from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he had not above thirty or forty to attend his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Who ſaw the two thouſand? And how comes the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to ſix upon that <hi>preciſe number twice?</hi> Where were they <hi>Muſtered?</hi> And is it likely that my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> at the Head of two thouſand well trained old Soldiers could be forced to retire from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by all the Vagabond <hi>Ruſſians</hi> that came from the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Let the <hi>Vindicator</hi> recollect himſelf a little, and enquire where he had this <hi>information.</hi> What my Lord <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> intended is not the Subject of our preſent <hi>enquiry,</hi> but I am very ſure that if he had had the fourth part of that <hi>number</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> alledges, he could have quickly made the <hi>Convention</hi> at that time retire: and this I confidently think, though the <hi>Vindicator</hi> Confutes this <hi>probability</hi> by telling Mr. <hi>Morer</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> that the <hi>Presbyterian Confidence</hi> is built on a better foundation than ſuch as <hi>Dundee</hi> was; and here I muſt take notice of this Gentlemans <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Temper</hi> and <hi>Condeſcention.</hi> Mr. <hi>Morer,</hi> one of the Prebendaries of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60080:16"/>
               <hi>Sarum,</hi> wrote that none doubted but that if my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> had lived he would have changed at that time the <hi>Face</hi> of Affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> From this the <hi>Vindicator</hi> concludes that the Epiſcopal Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> placed their <hi>Confidence</hi> in none <hi>higher</hi> than my Lord <hi>Dundee,</hi> how is it <hi>poſſible</hi> to ſhun thoſe <hi>venomous darts</hi> of <hi>ſpite</hi> and ill <hi>nature?</hi> So when ever you ſpeak to a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> I adviſe you to take good heed what you <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>how;</hi> if you do not ſay <hi>every thing</hi> that may be ſaid, they are ſure to <hi>conclude,</hi> that what was left <hi>unſaid</hi> was not at all <hi>believed</hi> by you: ſo when Mr. <hi>Morer</hi> writes again he muſt tell his Patron that though ſuch a change was <hi>probable</hi> according to the <hi>ſituation</hi> of Affairs at that time yet the Epiſcopal Party placed their <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>God.</hi> For if his <hi>words</hi> are not thus <hi>guarded</hi> the Presbyterians will <hi>immediately conclude</hi> that the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> are but a pack of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> that place no <hi>Confidence in God,</hi> but lean on the <hi>Arm of Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I return from this <hi>Digreſſion</hi> to that that I lately mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Vindicators</hi> ſtory of two thouſand disbanded Soldiers, which carries with it all the marks by which a <hi>willful</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> lye, may be known from <hi>modeſt</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi> Truth, and the reaſon why I inſtance in this <hi>particular</hi> is becauſe the Vindicator was at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> or not far from it, about that time, and therefore it is not probable but that he might have known the truth: and from this I conclude that either he lies <hi>deliberately,</hi> and <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> or his Informers are Lyars, and idle talkers, or at beſt he himſelf, is <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>ſupine negligence,</hi> in gathering true <hi>Informations.</hi> For to do him Juſtice, I promiſe to retract this publickly, if he get five or ſix men of any <hi>note</hi> even amongſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> who will declare it under their hands that they knew that my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether two thouſand <hi>Disbanded Soldiers</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> before he retired from the <hi>Convention.</hi> And the <hi>Vindicator</hi> himſelf cannot deny but that this is an extraordinary piece of Condeſcenſion, that I ſhould leave it to be decided by the Teſtimony of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themſelves, ſince he rejects all Epiſcopal Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The next thing I inſtance, as to his Candour and Integrity, is this, that in the third page of his Preface he <note place="margin">Second Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Edenb.</hi> Edit.</note> writes, that there was Advice writen by Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> to Mr. <hi>Lisk,</hi> to be <hi>communicated</hi> to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party, <hi>That they ſhould yield feigned Obedience to the Presbyterians at preſent,</hi> and theſe words he cauſed to be Printed in a different Character, that every one might conclude they were the words of Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> Letter; whereas the Doctor never <hi>wrote</hi> ſuch a thing, nor any thing that can yield any ſuch <hi>Conſequence.</hi> And 'tis yet more pleaſant to read his Letter that juſtifies this diſingenuous uſage, becauſe forſooth <hi>feigned Obedience</hi> was a Scriptural Phraſe, and though the Doctor wrote no ſuch thing, yet he thinks he was allowed to Print this Relation of him, ſo as all the World might conclude theſe words were the expreſs words of Dr. <hi>Canarie</hi>'s Letter, and this Lie is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60080:17"/>
than the former, becauſe it is <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>unrepented</hi> off. I ſhall mention one Inſtance more of his Candour and Integrity, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> whom he injures moſt atrociouſly.</p>
            <p>And becauſe he raiſes all his Batteries againſt Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Leſwade,</hi> we need no other proof of the <hi>Vindicators</hi> ingenuity, nor no other Character of his <hi>genius</hi> than to read that part of his Libel that relates to Mr. <hi>Macmath.</hi> Firſt, he charges him with <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> but the <hi>Vindicator</hi> knew no ſuch thing, only the <hi>barbarous Villains</hi> who wounded him upon the Road as he was Travelling from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to his own Houſe, they would take care to tranſmit to the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſuch ſtories as were moſt convenient for him to <hi>propagate,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Macmath</hi> was that very night, before he came from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in the company of two Gentlemen of Honor and Integrity, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Riddel</hi> of <hi>Hayſning</hi> in the Foreſt, and Captain <hi>Straitone.</hi>
               </note> and appeals to them whether they could perceive in him either the <hi>firſt beginnings,</hi> or the <hi>leaſt appearance</hi> of any exceſs or diſorder, and their Teſtimony is of greater <hi>authority</hi> than all the ſtories that the <hi>Vindicacor</hi> can patch together from ſuch Villains as made an attempt upon his life.</p>
            <p>Next he charges him with amorous, wanton, and <hi>laſcivious</hi> behaviour, and I am glad the <hi>Vindicator</hi> mentions it, becauſe in this very ſtory we have a <hi>notorious</hi> inſtance of their Villany and Hypocriſie: there was a poor woman hired by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to ſay that Mr. <hi>Macmath</hi> once made Love to her, and ſhe was prevailed with by her Brother, a Presbyterian, to ſay ſo, and when ſhe was encouraged by them again to adhere to what ſhe ſaid, ſhe declined it, and told them that ſhe had ſaid enough for any thing ſhe had gotten. Her Brother, who had taught her thus to accuſe an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, was ſmitten with ſuch a remorſe (when he came to conſider more narrowly what he had done) that he was in hazard to deſtroy himſelf, and actually did ſo, when he removed to the next Pariſh, by ripping up his own Belly. But it is no wonder to hear Mr. <hi>Machmath</hi> thus calumniated, when they had the impudence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <note place="margin">Anno 38.</note> the Venerable Old Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> of Inceſt with his own Niece of fourteen years old. And to make an end of what concerns Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> let me acquaint the Reader that ſuch as were moſt active in his Trouble and Perſecution, very ſhortly after felt the ſeverity of Gods juſt Judgment. <hi>John Clark,</hi> who beat him with the great end of his Musket, was ſuddenly bruiſed to death by the fall of a Tree in the Wood of <hi>Roſling,</hi> ſo that he never ſpoke again: and for the other Mr. <hi>Borthwite,</hi> his Conſcience did ſo check him, that he had no peace until he ended his life in a moſt lamentable Diſtraction and Madneſs. I am not ſo bold as to infer that the Perſecuting of Mr. <hi>Macmath</hi> was the only ſin that drew upon them the viſible and ſudden marks of Gods heavy diſpleaſure, but I may very ſafely ſay that the Signatures of Gods anger are frequently legible enough
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60080:17"/>
in the puniſhment of ſome mens ſins, and that Atheiſtical Hypocrites ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom eſcape his indignation even in this World.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Vindicators</hi> Tattling of Mr. <hi>Finlaſone,</hi> Mr. <hi>Finlaſone</hi> himſelf denyed all when he was challenged. But, that I may no longer detain the Reader, nor yet condemn my ſelf to the drudgery of raking into that Puddle that is here heaped together againſt Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the following Authentick Certificate in favours of Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Gentlemen and others of his own Pariſh, with all the little <hi>knaviſh</hi> and <hi>impudent</hi> Lyes that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has gathered already, or may hereafter invent, and then let him Judg as his diſcretion will lead him.</p>

Again he tells us, that it is well known that the Epiſcopal Party made all the <hi>eſſayes</hi> they were capable <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> of to carry the Elections for the Convention, when it is far better known, that in ſeveral Shires the Epiſcopal Gentry declin'd <hi>induſtriouſly</hi> their being choſen for that <hi>Convention,</hi> particularly in the Shire of <hi>Roſs</hi> where the <hi>Vindicator</hi> dare not ſay that the Presbyterians can carry the <hi>Elections.</hi> And let me but once for all tell you, that the Presbyterians had many Advantages of their <hi>Oppoſites</hi> at that time not to be <hi>named.</hi> To be ſhort, his Book is every where interſpersed with the ſilliest <hi>ſhufflings</hi> and <hi>tergiverſations:</hi> it is not enough for him to ſay that he is not acquainted with the Matter of Fact, when any thing is <hi>affirmed</hi> by his <hi>Adverſary,</hi> that he is a ſtranger to, but inſtead of this; he preſently flies in his Face and gives him the <hi>Lie.</hi> I'll give you one Inſtance of this rudeneſs, Mr. <hi>Morer</hi> wrote to his Patron, that there were ſome that Sate in the late Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were not <hi>infeft</hi> in their Eſtates, and conſequently were excluded by the Fundamental Laws of the Nation. This the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> denies, and tells us, his <hi>denial</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and all this becauſe Mr. <hi>Morer</hi> did not name the <hi>Members</hi> of the Convention that were not infeft in <hi>their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Eſtates.</hi> Had it not been an extraordinary <hi>indiſcretion</hi> to have named <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Gentlemen, and to publiſh what might be ſo prejudicial to their Intereſt amongſt their <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Acquaintances.</hi> And if the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly conceal their names, he ſhall know them too when he pleaſes; and when he thus contends for the honor of that Convention, he in the next Line <hi>blunders</hi> moſt <hi>unhappily,</hi> and tells the World in Print that ſome Sate in that Convention who were forfeit <hi>for High Treaſon</hi> by all the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of Law, and that before the Sentence was Repealed by any <hi>Judicatory:</hi> and therefore I adviſe the <hi>Vindicator</hi> not to bind up the Sovereign Powers of the Earth to little <hi>Punctilio's</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of Law, but let him be a little more kind to <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and the <hi>extraordinary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of State.</hi> And ſince he thinks it very juſt that the Convention ſhould allow ſuch a procedure againſt all the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Law;</hi> why may not he allow the King and Council to put the very <hi>Laws</hi> in <hi>Execution</hi> againſt <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> when the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Government are endangered by their <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> and <hi>Inſurrections.</hi> There are frequent Inſtances of his <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> and <hi>ſhifting,</hi> which no body expects ſhould be particularly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed:</hi> becauſe they engage ones enquiries into all thoſe Pamphlets he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>refute;</hi> and becauſe the Book would ſwell to a prodigious <hi>Bulk,</hi> and the Publick is not at all concerned to know the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of every particular Miniſters Sufferings in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could in the next place inform you of his Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies. He treats his Adverſaries as <hi>Brethren,</hi> yet in <note place="margin">Pag. 10. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph 6.</note> his Preface he inſinuates that ſuch <hi>Diſputes</hi> with the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60080:18"/>
               <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party are but the <hi>ſtrugglings</hi> and <hi>oppoſitions</hi> between the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>Serpent;</hi> and that there are but few Matters of Fact that he pretends to any <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>himſelf.</hi> Yet in the next Line al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he tells us that he doth not build on <hi>hear-ſay</hi> or <hi>common Talk;</hi> and yet the materials of his Book are but the Teſtimonies of many who were Actors or <hi>Abettors</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern Villanies:</hi> and if he did not build on hear-ſay, how came he to Print that Mr. <hi>George Henry,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarphin,</hi> meddled with a Brewery, which is notoriouſly falſe? And though this be a trifling ſtory, yet is it an undeniable Evidence that the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> was heedleſs and inconſiderate in gathering true Materials.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Vindicator</hi> tells us that they do not think K. <hi>William</hi> an Idolater though he Communicate with <note place="margin">Pag. 115.</note> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet when ſome of his Party mounts the <hi>Desk</hi> and declaims their <hi>Maccaronicks,</hi> they poſitively conclude that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>idolatrous.</hi> Again, he does not allow that the Clergy who Addreſs'd the Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly had any meaſure of <hi>wit,</hi> yet their <hi>Contrivances were founded on deep Conſults.</hi> But let me tell the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> that no man, or Society of men, has the <hi>Monopoly of Prudence,</hi> the moſt cautious ſteps may be ſometimes <hi>fruſtrated</hi> and the wiſeſt men may ſometimes widely miſtake their <hi>meaſure:</hi> and the Hearts of all Men, as well as the Hearts of Kings and Princes, are in the <hi>hands</hi> of God, and their motions directed by his <hi>Providence.</hi> And after all, let me tell the <hi>Vindicator</hi> once more, that that little Contrivance and <hi>Formula</hi> of an <hi>Addreſs</hi> blew up their <hi>pretended</hi> Aſſembly: and let me tell him more, yet (tho I pretend to no acquaintance in <hi>Political</hi> things) that it is very <hi>probable</hi> that thoſe very Laws by which the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> of Presbytery thought to ſecure their <hi>Tyranny</hi> for ever, will occaſion its <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>ruin,</hi> though they endeavour to <hi>ſupport</hi> it by the <hi>Pens</hi> and <hi>Lungs</hi> of all its <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could name many other Inconſiſtencies, I have no room for them: every other Line is ſtuffed with ſuch <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>ſcurrilous</hi> Railings that it is nauſeous to repeat them; yet I cannot but take notice of his Vanity. He treats his Adverſaries with ſcorn and contempt. The Author of the Hiſtory of the General Aſſembly he treats as a <hi>Scioliſt,</hi> and as a <hi>Momus,</hi> and he is enraged that he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſume <note place="margin">Pag. 183. and Pag. 169.</note> to write that one of the Presbyterian Doctors could not ſpeak <hi>Latine.</hi> Such an <hi>Affront</hi> was not to <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule.</hi>
               </note> be endured by a man that had <hi>ſignalized</hi> himſelf ſo much in <hi>Controverſial</hi> Feats, and therefore I adviſe you when you meddle with the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> to make your <hi>Approaches</hi> with all poſſible <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi> A <hi>Presbyterian</hi> had rather be accuſed of <hi>Adultery, Sodomy,</hi> or <hi>Inceſt,</hi> than to be thought <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and this is the reaſon why the Author of that <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60080:19"/>
is laſh'd with all the ſeverities of <hi>Satyr,</hi> and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> would have forgiven him any thing rather than the leaſt <hi>Inſinuation</hi> of being <hi>ignorant.</hi> Alas! this was not to be be endured that one of their Leaders, and who had made a remarkable Figure, ſhould be thus run down and expoſed to laughter. For though the Presbyterians look very demure and grave, you miſtake them, if you think them <hi>Stoicks:</hi> If you venture to ſay any thing that may rob them of that pleaſant <hi>Imagination</hi> of their own <hi>Grandeur,</hi> that lovely <hi>idea</hi> that they have of <hi>themſelves,</hi> and their extraordinary <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt tell you what occaſioned his heavy diſpleasure againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Hiſtory of the General Aſſembly, That Author gives one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance why he thought Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> did not underſtand throughly the things that he wrote of, becauſe when he Cites the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> and from thence Cites the Sentence you ſee in the Margine <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sancti Hieron. Epiſt.</hi> ad <hi>Evagr.</hi> Quid facit Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus quod non facit Presbyter excepta ordinatione.</note> he muſt needs force the word <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> in that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>Ordering of the Meetings.</hi> This Expoſition the Author of that Hiſtory (ſuch an Infidel he is) thinks a little <hi>Paradoxical,</hi> if not <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> Ignorance; becauſe no <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Writer in that, or any former Age underſtood any ſuch thing by that word ſo <hi>placed,</hi> as it is in that Epiſtle; beſides there's no mention of any <hi>meeting</hi> near that word, that <hi>determin</hi> it to that ſignification. And ſince this Expoſition was ſo very odd, the Author of that Hiſtory did treat it and the Inventer of it very familiarly. Beſides, others do think that it this Expoſition be received, it will oblige us to underſtand St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in many places, in a Senſe contrary to the Opinion of all former Ages.</p>
            <p>Thus I find St. <hi>Jerom</hi> informs us that ſuch and ſuch a man was <hi>Ordinatus ab Apoſtolis Epiſcopus</hi> of <note place="margin">Catalogus Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorum Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</note> ſuch a place, therefore the meaning muſt be that ſuch a man was appointed to meet the Apoſtle at ſuch a place. However the <hi>Vindicator</hi> treats him as a <hi>Scioliſt,</hi> a <hi>Momus,</hi> a poor <hi>ſequacious Animal,</hi> that follows ſuch as went before him. But if he had been acquainted with the penetrating <hi>Genius</hi> of Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> he had no doubt underſtood the <hi>Fathers</hi> better. It is very difficult to gueſs what to impute this extravagant Fancy to, he thought it dangerous to allow that <hi>Ordinatio</hi> did ſignifie the Impoſition of Hands, at leaſt he wiſhed ſuch a power might not be granted to a Biſhop, and therefore he will have <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio</hi> in that Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> to ſignifie the ordering of ſomething, though that thing be not named in St. <hi>Jreom;</hi> and if it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ordering of ſomething (as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> profoundly Reaſons,) why not the ordering of a Meeting? And if it was the ordering of a Meeting? Why not the ordering of an Eccleſiaſtical Meeting? Yet all this time it is not determined whether this ordering of the Meeting be an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60080:19"/>
appointing of the time <hi>when</hi> they ſhould meet, and what they ſhould treat of, or only preſiding as <hi>Moderator</hi> amongſt them, when the Collective body themſelves appointed the meeting. Becauſe, I ſay, this is left uncertain; perhaps the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will judge it moſt convenient to adhere to the laſt. If he had ſaid, that <hi>Ordinatio</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the ordering of a <hi>Dromedary</hi> it had been more to his purpoſe, for certainly the ordering of ſuch an Animal made not ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between a Biſhop and Presbyter as the ordering of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Meetings.</p>
            <p>How contrary ſuch a fancy is to the received expoſition of that word, will beſt appear when we conſider other places in the works of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> where the word <hi>Ordinare</hi> is made uſe of, and let us ſuppoſe that the word muſt be interpreted according to the new Critick. Thus we find <hi>St. Jerom, Comment.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt. ad Timothe. Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ab initio Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum laicos inſtituit de quibus optimi quique in facordotium eliguntur &amp; ſic dicit quales debeant ordinari.</hi> Then the meaning muſt be according to this late diſcovery, that the Apoſtle declared ſuch as were fit to be appointed to meet. Again, S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Comment on the Epiſt. to <hi>Titus</hi> in thoſe words: <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Crete <hi>that thou mighteſt ordain,</hi> He hath theſe words, <hi>Quae deſunt recto tenore corrige &amp; tunc demum presbyteros poteris ordinare, cum omnes in Eccleſia fuerint recti,</hi> when all have been blameleſs in the Church, then thou mayſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Presbyters to meet. And again, in his Catalogue <hi>Scriptorum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticorum,</hi> ſpeaking of S. <hi>James</hi> the Brother of our Lord, <hi>Jacobus qui appellatur frater Domini cognomento juſtus—Poſt Paſſionem Domini ſtatim ab Apoſtolis Hieroſolymorum Epiſcopus ordinatus,</hi> the meaning muſt be, that he was appointed by the Apoſtles to meet at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And in the ſame Book it is ſaid again, <hi>Timotheus autem Epheſiorum Epiſcopus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatus</hi> a <hi>Beato Paulo,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Timothy</hi> the Biſhop was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to meet at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Again, <hi>Polycarpus Joannis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtoli diſcipulus &amp; ab eo Smyrnae Epiſcopus ordinatus, totius Aſiae princeps fuit.</hi> I need add no more teſtimonies to make this Critical obſervation more <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and I defic all that ever looked into the Presbyterian Books to find any thing ſo palpably ignorant and fooliſh, as this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that paſſage in S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> except it be the Vindicators No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>decretum praedamnatum,</hi> which I ſhall examine before I end this Letter, and yet I do not remember that ever I read any Man more proud and ſupercilious; but Ignorance and Pride go ordinarily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

            </p>
            <p>But I muſt tell him withal what I heard from eye and ear Witneſſes in (and this I have more credible Atteſtations than any of the Teſtimonies the Vindicator brings to diſparage the Clergy) That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> did publickly in his Prelections <hi>in plenis Academiae comiti is,</hi> ſay, That one that did ſo and ſo, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> did, was <hi>guiltus Idolatriae;</hi> nor have I this from the younger Boys of that Houſe, but from ſuch as need not be <hi>named</hi> and cannot reaſonably be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> of lying.

But I will tell you of another thing that I think was yet worſe.</p>
            <p>At a publick <hi>Commencement,</hi> apprehending that a Gentleman who was diſputing againſt the <hi>Praeſes</hi> did bear too hard upon him; He got up very <hi>gravely,</hi> and ſpoke to the <hi>Praeſes</hi> thus, <hi>Domine Praeſes, require illum ut proponat Argumentum categorice.</hi> It is true, that <hi>require illum</hi> is <hi>Latin;</hi> for (if I remember right) it may be met with in <hi>Eunuch. Terent.</hi> But in a ſenſe vaſtly <hi>different</hi> from what was intended by Mr. <hi>Rule.</hi> For the ſenſe intended by Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> no doubt, was that the <hi>Praeſes</hi> would oblige the <hi>Opponent</hi> to be more <hi>methodical.</hi> and if that be the meaning, it could not be more unhappily expreſt,

for <hi>requirere aliquem</hi> in true <hi>Latin</hi> ſignifies to ſearch for one again and again, to ſee where he may be found. I ſhall give you one Inſtance more, It is this, Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> finding <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Magnus Prince.</hi>
               </note> that one of the Students in a <hi>Harrangue,</hi> advanced ſome things that were <hi>unagreeable</hi> to him, and favourable to ſome of the <hi>Maſters</hi> that were <hi>lately</hi> ejected, He got up and offered to <hi>ſilence</hi> the Youth, and ſaid, That <hi>ille diolamat contra ſtarum Regni,</hi> He meant no doubt the <hi>late Convontion</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>them</hi> in the <hi>old Latin</hi> was <hi>contra Ordines Regni,</hi> how this ought to be expreſs'd after the Reformation I know not. I can make no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for keeping you ſo long to ſuch Importinencies, but who can help it: Why ſhall men give themſelves the trouble to anſwer Books ſo accurately as the Vindicator pretends to do, that there muſt not be a <hi>Cobweb</hi> in all their foldings unſwept. This put the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator upon many impertinent Eſſays, and if I had time to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them I could furniſh you with very pleaſant Inſtances out of his Anſwers to Mr. <hi>Morer</hi>'s Letter. But the Vindicator muſt refute accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and this obliges him to <hi>condeſcenſions</hi> below <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> Every where we have viſible marks of the Vindicators <hi>Genius,</hi> every where he ſtoops ſo low when he has nothing to pick up but ſtraws and broken Pins, the Spirit of Contradiction eats out the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of his Soul, and ever and anon puts him upon <hi>ſilly</hi> and <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> importinencies: For to nothing elſe can it be imputed than to his impardonable vanity<hi>—his wiſhing this Scioliſt or ſome other would attempt the refuting his Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I read his Vindications and his pretended Anſwer to the <hi>Ironicum,</hi> and if he be not improved ſince he wrote thoſe Tracts, he deſerves no particular Anſwer, for his Explication of S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Epiſtle, and his <hi>Decretum praedamnatum</hi> (of which hereafter) are Indications of his groundleſs and <hi>illiterate</hi> Fopperies: if he had defended himſelf by the common Pleas of learned <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he ought to be treated with Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Diſcretion; but when he preſumes to dictate either blaſphemous Nonſence, (ſuch as his <hi>decretum praedamnatum)</hi> or <hi>viſionary</hi> and <hi>childiſh</hi> Romances (ſuch as his fancy of the meaning of <hi>Ordinatio</hi> in S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle) he ſhould in this caſe be treated according to his Character, for it is not poſſible that ſo much ignorance could dwell but in the company of ſo much Pride, and therefore I appeal to all the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> if ever they yet diſcovered any ſuch <hi>monſtrous Nonſence</hi> written or ſaid by any man that pretended to have read but one Syſtem in his lifetime, and yet this <hi>Mormo</hi> of a Scholar muſt forſooth <hi>ſtrat</hi> with ſo much inſolence and vanity, as if he were teaching ſome <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> who were never acquainted with the civilized part of Mankind. There have been many attempts uſed by different Parties to expoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60080:21"/>
one another for their Ignorance and Immoralities, but I defie all men to name one Inſtance of greater Ignorance, either before or after the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation than this one Notion of his <hi>Decretum praedamnatum,</hi> and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth he muſt pretend to explain and defend the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Syſtem, and takes occaſion by an innocent Sentence or two, to thruſt himſelf into this Scuffle without conſidering whether he underſtood the Controverſie or not, but I leave him to the Chaſtiſement of others.</p>
            <p>Good Nature and Chriſtian Modeſty teach us to hide and extenuate the weakneſſes of others; but when thoſe very men pretend to give Rules to all mankind, they ought to be put in mind that it is not yet time for them to appear ſo <hi>arrogant</hi> and <hi>preſumptuous.</hi> Affectation is the meaneſt Vice, and an intollerable piece of <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> we are not ſo ugly by our <hi>natural defects,</hi> as by the Accompliſhments that we <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and this is the Hereditary uncurable Diſeaſe of our Pedling little Reformers. They cannot indure to follow the common Sentiments of Mankind, they are all for <hi>heights,</hi> and <hi>ſingularities.</hi> He that walks not in the common Road, where the way is ſafe, muſt be <hi>ſilly,</hi> and <hi>bypocondriack,</hi> or <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning;</hi> and therefore the Spirit of Chriſtianity teaches us to believe and practice the <hi>indiſputable</hi> Truths of our Religion, more than the peculiar Opinions of broken <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and leſſer Fraternities. Sometimes I have had ſome kind Thoughts towards the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but when I conſidered that they needleſly forſake the innocent Cuſtoms of Mankind, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged Rules of Decency, and the Univerſal Tradition of the Church, I muſt think that they are led by a Spirit of <hi>Deluſion</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi> Nothing recommends us to God more than true Humility, and it is an undeniable proof of Integrity and Self denial to comply with the innocent Cuſtoms of the World, and therefore our Saviour left us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by which we may in the midſt of all tentations live in the World, and yet continue unſpotted by its infection. I have digreſſed two far, not from what I deſigned, but from the <hi>Vindicators</hi> account of things.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I may get upon the Finger-ends, becauſe I did not name my Witneſſes for the Latin <hi>Eleganeies</hi> that I lately mentioned; but if he waites to the Bookſeller whoſe name is prefixt, he ſhall know as many Witneſſes as are neceſſary, and forty more ſuch Barbariſms.</p>
            <p>To end, and to complete this Character of the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his apparent <hi>Shufflings</hi> and <hi>Tergiverſations,</hi> for when the Outrages done to the <hi>Clergy</hi> are open and <hi>notorious,</hi> then he extenuates it as no great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, when ſome of them were <hi>beat</hi> upon the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Legs,</hi> and others of them made to go through <hi>deep waters</hi> in the <hi>midſt</hi> of <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But among all the Flights of his <hi>Invention</hi> there is none more remarkable than this unwary conceſſion, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical <note place="margin">Page 164.</note> Judicatories that enquire into Scandals are not obliged to follow <hi>the Forms of other Courts.</hi> I thought that the Forms of Civil
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60080:22"/>
Courts were wiſely appointed partly to prevent our being <hi>ſurprized,</hi> partly to hinder (as far as humane Prudence could prevent) all <hi>Forgeries,</hi> and <hi>Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> againſt the <hi>innocent,</hi> and that the Forms were but the <hi>external Fences,</hi> that the Law invented to guard <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity.</hi> But this Author tells us that its doubted (no doubt amongſt Learned Men) whether the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Court be obliged to follow <hi>ſuch Forms.</hi> It is very odd that the Laity among the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> who pretend to be at the greateſt Remove from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> ſhall thus calmly ſtoop to the moſt intollerable ſlavery of the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to this Conceſſion is his fair Advertiſement to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that indeed the <hi>Covenanters</hi> do not think themſelves <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> the Church of <note place="margin">Pag.</note> 
               <hi>England,</hi> unleſs they are <hi>called</hi> to it; but if the <hi>Godly</hi> in <hi>England</hi> call them, then all their <hi>Ammunition</hi> muſt be employed to ſerve their <hi>dear</hi> Brethren in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to this, let me inſtance his ſhameful Shuffling about the Toleration lately granted to Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he tells us, that they expreſſed as much as <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> they were capable their diſlike of the Toleration given to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their <hi>Heroſies</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet their Agents, then at Court, wrote <hi>Books</hi> (ſuch as they were) <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi>
               </note> pleading that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> ought to be Repealed; but withal the <hi>Vindicator</hi> adds that they do not grudge <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> Liberty to any others who can ſhew as good a <hi>Warrant</hi> for their <hi>way</hi> of Worſhip as they do, <hi>i. e.</hi> they have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> for their <hi>way,</hi> and none others can have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> if they have it; becauſe their way is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all <hi>others;</hi> and therefore at bottom they are againſt <hi>Toleration</hi> as the moſt miſchievous thing in the World: and in the time of the late Troubles they exclaimed againſt it, as a thing worſe than the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> Now you have no other Character of the <hi>Vindicator</hi> from me, than what I have extracted from his Book, nor do I conclude him to be habitually guilty of ſuch ſhuffling and diſingenuity; but ſingle Acts may grow into <hi>rooted</hi> Habits. He is ſo deeply tinctur'd with the <hi>fulleneſs</hi> of his <hi>Faction;</hi> that he'll rather queſtion whether the Body of the Sun is <hi>luminous,</hi> than admit the leaſt <hi>ſcruple</hi> concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Presbytery.</p>
            <p>The next thing I promiſed to Diſcourſe of, was his Theological Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings that occaſionally falls under his Conſideration, when he pleads the Innocence of the Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Vindicator does not deſignedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on thoſe <hi>Theological</hi> heads that I am ſhortly to ſpeak of, but <hi>incidentally</hi> they fall in his <hi>way;</hi> but he <note place="margin">Pag.</note> cannot forbear his <hi>venomous Squibs,</hi> when he mentions the practice of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> that moſtly expoſe their <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60080:22"/>
firſt I take notice of is his Cenſure of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Obſervation of Chriſtmas; The Author of the ſecond Letter did very <hi>iudiciouſly</hi> obſerve how <hi>diametrically oppoſite</hi> the <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> weſtern Phanaticks are to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, That they ſhould begin their <hi>Barbarities</hi> againſt the Clergy upon that very day upon which the Church did celebrate the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour;</hi> and which the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Hoſts of Heaven did <hi>magnifie</hi> with <hi>triumphant</hi> Songs; the Vindicator cannot let this Obſervation <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> paſs without his <hi>Theological Animadverſions.</hi> And he tells us in the firſt place, that the Author of that Letter <hi>valu'd himſelf upon this fine Notion,</hi> certainly the Author could not value <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> upon this Notion, but he had great reaſon to value the <hi>univerſal</hi> practice of the Chriſtian Church from the firſt plantations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Next the Vindicator tells us, that it is ridiculous to aſſert that that day was celebrated by the Court of Heaven. <hi>What?</hi> ſays he, <hi>Did the Court of Heaven keep the Anniverſary day?</hi> This is profoundly wiſe. There is no ſtanding before the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>ſmartneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees.</hi> What, did not the Court of Heaven celebrate the birth of our bleſſed Saviour? And was not the <hi>Anniverſary Solemnity</hi> of this <hi>Feſtival</hi> a juſt <hi>imitation</hi> of what the <hi>Court</hi> of Heaven did? But he asks if the Court of Heaven did keep an <hi>Anniverſary?</hi> For the great Danger is in that word <hi>Anniverſary.</hi> But might not the Chriſtian Church take care that this <hi>glorious Myſtery</hi> ſhould never be forgotten? And was it not <hi>reaſonable</hi> that our <hi>Poſterity</hi> ſhould remember it, as well as they to whom it was firſt reveal'd? and could the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church take more <hi>effectual methods</hi> to preſerve the memory of it than by appointing this Anniverſary Feſtival? He grants that the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> is very <hi>ancient,</hi> but that the Church did keep it in all Ages <hi>is ſaid without book;</hi> If he means that there are no <hi>Presbyterian Books</hi> that give <hi>Evidence</hi> for this <hi>Feſtival,</hi> we grant it; but if he mean that the Church did not obſerve it from the very days of the Apoſtles, we deſire to know when it began? and in what Period of the Church it was not obſerved? and then we may ſee more clearly into the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> of this <hi>Feſtival:</hi> And tho it had not been from the beginning the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> may continue the <hi>practice</hi> of it upon the <hi>beſt reaſons.</hi> He asks again, If our Saviour was born upon the 25th day of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> but this is <hi>childiſh</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> when the Church did order the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of that <hi>Myſtery</hi> on the 25. of <hi>December,</hi> ſhe did not decide that <hi>Chronological</hi> Nicety, whether our Saviour was born on the 25. of <hi>December,</hi> nor was it needful to encreaſe the Devotions of the Church, that they ſhould be performed with regard to one day more than to another, as if they depended upon ſuch <hi>a Critical Minute of</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60080:23"/>
               <hi>time,</hi> I hope the Vindicator knows that the 25. of <hi>December</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is not the 25. of <hi>December</hi> in <hi>Britain;</hi> and yet the Chriſtians of either <hi>communion celebrate</hi> the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour with regard to the <hi>Calculations</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> in which they live, nay, he may know that there are Confiderable Objections againſt the common <hi>Aera</hi> of the Chriſtians. But the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator <note place="margin">Vid. Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> Diſcourſe of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</note> thinks <hi>that ſuch an Anniverſary day is not to be kept by Gods Appointment.</hi> But hath not God <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> us to obey <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> our lawful Eccleſiaſtical Rulers to the end of the World: And may not they <hi>regulate</hi> the publick <hi>Solemnities</hi> and <hi>returns</hi> of Gods Worſhip? Is there any thing in this Regulation but what hath a natural tendency to preſerve and <hi>propagate</hi> the <hi>great truths</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament?</hi> With what impudence then dare we refuſe obedience to the <hi>univerſal</hi> Church, when her <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> are ſo juſt, ſo wiſe and ſo agreeable to the whole tenor of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> If all the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from the days of the Apoſtles had been written in the Bible, could one read it in a <hi>thouſand</hi> years? There was a plain <hi>neceſſity</hi> in that caſe to have continued the <hi>immediate</hi> inſpiration in the Church until the <hi>conſummation</hi> of all things. Upon this their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to order the <hi>publick Solemnities</hi> of the Church, the Chriſtian Faith being once revealed, they needed not the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of a new <hi>Revelation</hi> to order its <hi>publick Solemnities;</hi> For when the feſtivities and Faſts of the Church were only converſant about the Articles of Faith already reveal'd, it is ſuppoſed that common ſenſe and diſcretion muſt cloath the great Myſteries of our Religion, with ſuch vehicles of <hi>time, place,</hi> and <hi>publick Solemnity,</hi> as beſt preſerve their <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>tranſmit</hi> them to <hi>Poſterity.</hi> But this is an <hi>unfortunate miſtake,</hi> an <hi>original Blunder</hi> of the whole <hi>Party;</hi> and as long as they keep to this <hi>Maxim</hi> they muſt neceſſarily continue <hi>ſtubborn</hi> and <hi>ungovernable,</hi> and <hi>proof</hi> againſt the <hi>wiſeſt Conſtitutions</hi> of the Chriſtian Church: for they muſt have Scripture for ſuch <hi>things</hi> as could not be <hi>contain'd</hi> in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> but he fortifies this with a Latin Sentence, as if <hi>Nonſence</hi> could change its <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Quia ſcriptum non legimus ideo juſſum non credimus.</note> by being put into <hi>Latin.</hi> For the Queſtion is not of Articles of Faith, but concerning the <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of the <hi>univerſal Church.</hi> But perhaps the Vindicator might yield to the Obſervations of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> if the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of it were not <hi>anniverſary.</hi> There is ſome hidden dangerous Plot in that word <hi>Anniverſary,</hi> as if our Poſterity were not to be <hi>educated</hi> in that <hi>Faith</hi> which we <hi>believe.</hi> And ſo Enthuſiaſtick our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that they broach Principles unknown to all the ſubdiviſions of Diſſenters in <hi>England;</hi> and tho more knowing and intelligent among

them never ſcruple the obſervation of an Anniverſary day, ſince they <hi>yearly commemorate</hi> the dreadful Fire of <hi>London,</hi> by Faſting and Prayers.</p>
            <p>From all this I conclude, That it is very <hi>dangerous,</hi> if not <hi>impious,</hi> to ſeparate from the Church in thoſe <hi>excellent Conſtitutions</hi> that have been received from the beginning, and in all Countries where the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath been worſhipped, ſuch <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> have been derived from the Apoſtles or Apoſtolick times.</p>
            <p>When the World was <hi>enlightened</hi> by the knowledge of the Son of God, he did not extinguiſh the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but he <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> it, and <hi>reaſons</hi> from it, and <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> it, and there is nothing more ſtrongly enclined towards God, and the <hi>Communications</hi> of his Spirit, than <hi>true</hi> and <hi>unbiaſſed</hi> Reaſon. Therefore <hi>ſuch Conſtitutions</hi> [as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Mankind is agreed in) have nothing in them contrary to the <hi>purity</hi> of our Religion.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Anniverſary</hi> days and <hi>Feſtivals</hi> have been <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned</hi> among the <hi>Pagans</hi> to the worſhip of <hi>Idols,</hi> why <note place="margin">A ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> may they not be <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the <hi>true</hi> Object of Worſhip, and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Publick <hi>Solemnities</hi> have nothing in their own nature that is reproveable no more than the <hi>motion</hi> of the Sun, or the <hi>viciſſitude</hi> of Seaſons, if any part of our time be abuſed to <hi>exceſs</hi> or <hi>riot,</hi> or the worſhip of an <hi>Idol,</hi> we are liable to the Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>But when we return from <hi>Idols</hi> to the <hi>true</hi> God, when we change our <hi>exceſs</hi> into <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> and when the whole <hi>Scene</hi> is become <hi>pure,</hi> what is there in all this that can be <hi>blamed?</hi> Do not we ſee all Nations agree in this, that publick <hi>Solemnities,</hi> and <hi>anniverſary Feſtivals,</hi> and <hi>Faſts</hi> are neceſſary to the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> even thoſe Nations that are at the greateſt <hi>diſtance</hi> from our <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> our <hi>Language,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> and way of living, upon the Converſion of Nations to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> ſome of the <hi>places</hi> where they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped their <hi>Idols</hi> have been <hi>dedicated</hi> to the true <hi>God;</hi> and was it not a happy <hi>Victory</hi> over the Kingdom of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> when the publick <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities</hi> of <hi>Idolatry, times</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> have changed their <hi>Objects, their Exerciſes,</hi> and <hi>their End.</hi>

Our Saviour was preſent at the Feaſt of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> for which there was not any <hi>immediate</hi> Divine Inſtitution; and though he had not been preſent, if it had been <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> he had certainly <hi>reproved</hi> it, and given directions againſt ſuch <hi>uſages</hi> in the general. To ſhake off all the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of Religion, is as dangerous as the multiplying of them, the one is the Error of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and the other the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> It is certain that nothing preſerves Knowledge of Chriſtian <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt the <hi>Body</hi> of the People more than the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the Church; for it is not left to the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> or <hi>Extemporary Fits</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> but the Church by her <hi>excellent</hi> Diſcipline orders the matter ſo, that it is not poſſible to forget the Faith unto which we have been <hi>once</hi> Baptized: but amongſt the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the People are taught by their Leaders to deſpiſe all Forms, ſuch great ſouls ought not to be fettered to the Rules and Methods of the Univerſal Church, and therefore it is very rare to find a Child in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that can repeat the Commandments or the Creed (I mean the Children of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parents) and by ſuch <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> pretences, <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is inſenſibly promoted, and the Body of the People alienated from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, and ſcarcely will they allow any man to be acquainted with true Religion that mentions thoſe firſt Principles of it. It is not poſſible to tell how much their oppoſition to <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the Church has infatuated their People, there is nothing can make a <hi>Clown</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> laugh ſo heartily, as when the Curate recommends to their Children the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> and therefore they have no opinion of any Mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, unleſs he entertain them with Diſcourſes of Gods <hi>unſearchable decrees,</hi> of <hi>Juſtification before Converſion,</hi> and how the <hi>Convictions</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience may be diſtnguiſhed from the <hi>Convictions</hi> that proceed from the Spirt of God: to obſerve the Feſtivals of the Church is but a piece of antiquated Superſtition. But we ought to remember that the ſtated Feſtivals and Faſts of the Church do preſerve, and increaſe true Devotion and Mortification. Faſting is acknowledged a neceſſary Inſtrument of Religion by all Nations who profeſs any Religion at all. It is not enjoyned, but ſupoſed by our Saviour: why may not then the Church regulate and direct the Publick Solemnities of Faſting, as well as of Prayer. There is nothing ſo proper to fix our attention as Faſting, it delivers the Soul from the oppreſſions of the Body, and reſtores it to its true and native Sovereignty over our Luſts and Paſſions. The ſtated Periods of Faſting oblige the moſt ſtubborn and impenitent to think of his Soul, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Practice of the Church Preach Repentance more effectually, and make more laſting Impreſſions than the looſe and indefinite Homilies of ſelf-conceited men.</p>
            <p>The External Solemnities of Religion may be abuſed (as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are) when they are left to the Conduct of humane weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

Nothing hinders the Reformation of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Churches, from the variety of their Errors and Superſtitions, ſo much as the open neglect of Faſting <note place="margin">We may ſeek for reſt in new ways, but we ſhall never find it but in the old.</note> among the Proteſtants, and this Practice is not to be defended, but rather lamented and amended.

It is certain that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Churches had, long ere now, made an utter Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion, if the ancient and fix'd Diſcipline of the Church did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in the Faith, and when we conſider how much the Religion that we are Baptized into, triumphs over <hi>Senſualities and Concupiſcence,</hi> we cannot but acknowledge the Wiſdom and Beauty of the ancient Diſcipline. The moſt uſeful things in Art or Nature, may be ſadly abuſed by Folly or Ignorance. We are not to ſeparate from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, further than they have ſeparated from the Wiſe and Primitive Conſtitution of the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; and all the Proteſtants abroad ſeem to agree in this Truth, for they Preach and Pray Publickly upon the great Faſts and Feſtivals of the Church. The publick <hi>Seaſons</hi> of Devotion are the Catechiſm of the People. It is true, when there is no day fixt for the Uniform Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Myſtery it may be remembred by ſome; but it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that all the People will remember it; but when the day is fixt we cannot forget it, and from our Infancy we are eaſily trained in the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Admonition of the Lord, and in the ſimplicity of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, free from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Superſtition <hi>(touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> with which all our Sectaries are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Leavened) as well as from giddineſs and <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi>

            <p>The next thing that I mention, is his Accuſation againſt the Epiſcopal Church, that they were guilty of Schiſm: For, <hi>He tells us that he knows no Schiſm, but ſuch as was cauſed by his Oppoſites,</hi> and this is pleaſant enough.

            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they ſeparate from all Churches <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> there is not now a Church upon Earth with whom they think they may <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> without <hi>fear</hi> of being <hi>polluted.</hi> The Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the Church, as alſo the Proteſtants of <hi>Geneve</hi> and <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> do the ſame. As for the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> of <hi>Germany, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweedland,</hi> we dare not ſo much as once name them, they have all of them <hi>Liturgies</hi> and <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> and Divine <hi>Hymns,</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> As for the <hi>Socinians</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> though they agree in ſome things with them; yet they would no doubt refuſe their <hi>Communion.</hi> They muſt refuſe, upon their <hi>Principles,</hi> the Communion of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church, and all the <hi>Subdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of it: and they cannot joyn with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor yet with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And their Conſciences could not endure to <hi>Communicate</hi> with the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that was againſt their <hi>Covenants,</hi> and their <hi>Obligations,</hi> as if a man could diſingage himſelf from what he is obliged to, by the Common Ties of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the Vows of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by any Bond or poſterior <hi>Obligation</hi> of his own.</p>
            <p>But if there be no <hi>viſible Church</hi> with which they can Communicate, they are certainly cut off from the viſible Communion of Saints over the Habitable World; and this Phariſaical <hi>ſingularity</hi> is ſo much the more hateful, that it is abhorred by all Proteſtant Churches, and if the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> will Read <hi>Durellus</hi> only, he will eaſily ſee how <hi>oppoſite</hi> this <hi>peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is to the Sentiments and <hi>Practice</hi> of all <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. It is acknowledged by all ſober men, that to joyn with, or abet <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> makes one guilty of Schism: and therefore the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> can by no means require the Members of the Epiſcopal Church, to joyn with them, who have <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>furiouſly</hi> cut themſelves off from the <hi>whole Body</hi> of Chriſtians: but there is lately found out a wiſe Diſtinction to ſave them from this blow, they can have <hi>occaſional Communion with other Churches,</hi> tho they cannot have a <hi>ſixt Communion</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Before I conſider this Diſtinction, let me inform you that the Ringleaders of the former <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> never made uſe of any ſuch Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they themſelves reaſoned againſt Separation upon ſuch frivolous pretences as are now alledged by their <note place="margin">

            <p>I have almoſt forgot to enquire into the meaning of that diſtinction of <hi>occaſional</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> Communion.

For <hi>then</hi> all thoſe things that they ſcruple at in the <hi>Publick</hi> Worſhip were <hi>practiſed</hi> by the <hi>Univerſal</hi> Church, the <hi>Solemnities,</hi> and <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,</hi> the Publick Faſts, the Altars, the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Biſhop, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon.</hi> Nay, the Dignity of <hi>Metrapolitans</hi> is ſuppoſed as Ancient and Venerable by the <hi>firſt</hi> Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> So upon the Presbyterian <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> they ſhould have been obliged if they had lived amongſt the <hi>Ancients</hi> then, to keep up diſtinct and ſeparate Conventicles, when the Purity of their Lives, and the <hi>Glory of Martyrdom,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> made them ſhine to the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of their Enemies, when their <hi>Zeal</hi> for God made them <hi>victorious</hi> over all the Powers of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> when by their <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and their <hi>Prayers,</hi> they <hi>crucified</hi> the Fleſh with all its Luſts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when they taught the Goſpel in its <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>bafled</hi> the Objection of the Pagans by their heavenly <hi>Converſation.</hi> Let my Soul be with thoſe <hi>firſt</hi> Christians, I would chuſe their Company at all <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,</hi> without the leaſt fear of either <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> or <hi>Good Friday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thirdly, The preſent Presbyterians muſt be <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice of their <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> This I have touched a little before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I deſire the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to name ſome <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> in the Records of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtory, that are now acknowledged by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> conſent of all Churches to be <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and then I enquire what it was that made them <hi>ſuch;</hi> and if this be not agreeable to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> more <hi>eminently,</hi> than to any rank of the <hi>ancient Schiſmaticks,</hi> I am miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But fifthly, They themſelves do not deny (nor can they) but that they are <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Notion of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> ſince to ſeparate from ones own Biſhop was a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Notion of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are by ſo much the more <hi>inexcuſable</hi> in that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60080:26"/>
have <hi>ſtubbornly</hi> and <hi>factiouſly</hi> Conſpired againſt the Apoſtolical <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Biſhop, Presbyter, and Deacon.</p>
            <p>The next thing that I remark, is his Cenſure of the I piſcopal Clergy for Preaching Morality, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. and 63. He tells us that the Author of the Second Letter wrote, <hi>That the Epiſcopal Party underſtand the Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy better, and that it was never underſtood or preached better in</hi> Scotland, <hi>than under Epiſcopacy.</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> replies very wittily, <hi>That he thought the Commendation of a Miniſter had been rather to underſtand Chriſtian Divinity, than Chriſtian Philoſophy.</hi> But ſoftly, Sir, I do not ſee that nice diſtinction between Chriſtian <hi>Divinity,</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> for if Philoſophy be truely Chriſtian, it muſt be refined upon no <hi>lower Standard</hi> than the <hi>Morals</hi> that our Saviour <hi>practiſed,</hi> and <hi>recommended;</hi> and is not this Chriſtian <hi>Divinity</hi> in it; <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Tendency?</hi> The Author of that Letter did not underſtand by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> the <hi>lame</hi> and defective <hi>Syſtems</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but rather that Heavenly and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Rule delivered by our Saviour. I hope he has not the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to accuſe the Clergy that they recommended the <hi>Pagan</hi> Morals as a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Rule of Life to their Hearers; or that they themſelves did neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor exhort others to believe the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Faith, the <hi>Credenda</hi> of our Religion. It may be they did fortifie ſome excellent <hi>Arguments</hi> among the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> with <hi>Chriſtian Motives,</hi> and what the Philoſophers (who ſpoke of the Immortality of the Soul with <hi>diſſidence</hi> and <hi>heſitation)</hi> could not recommend but faintly: the Chriſtian Preachers did aſſert boldly, ſince the Reſurrection of our Saviour from the Dead, was an <hi>invincible</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> Argument, not only of our Reſurrection, but of the Glory that ſhall afterwards be revealed. There is nothing truly excellent among the <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers, but what is in one place or other for the Matter found in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and <hi>purer</hi> Morals, and <hi>greater</hi> heights than the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> could diſcern. Nor can I think but that the <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may make very good uſe of <hi>Pagan Moraliſts.</hi> I always thought <hi>Seneca</hi> a very excellent Book, but if <hi>Seneca</hi> be <hi>Chriſtianiſed</hi> (as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſpeaks) I cannot ſee what fault the <hi>Vindicator</hi> can find with <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> or any of our <hi>Ancient</hi> Friends. For certainly Chriſtian <hi>Morality</hi> in its <hi>true extent</hi> and <hi>latitude,</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience and Holineſs, without which no man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall ſee God.</hi> And I believe the Author of that Letter intended no more, than that the Episcopal Clergy did <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> recommend to their Hearers the <hi>Reformation of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

That this <hi>is the dialect of men ſtrongly enclin'd to</hi> Socinianiſm. I let go this mark of his <hi>ſpite</hi> and <hi>ill nature,</hi> for we have no <hi>Socinians</hi> amongſt the Epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And if he underſtands the <hi>Socinians,</hi> they are not ſo very zealous for Celebrating the Feſtival of Chriſts <hi>Nativity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation;</hi> nor yet are they great Enemies to Presbyterian Government, nor can they be thought zealous for any
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60080:27"/>
particular Platform (were it never ſo agreeable to the Canons of the Ancient Church) any further than their <hi>intereſt</hi> is involv'd. He tells us a little after, that the <hi>preaching of ſome men is ſuch morality,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> and other Heathens taught, <hi>only Chriſtianiſed</hi> with ſome words; ſo the <hi>Vindicator</hi> thinks that the <hi>morality</hi> they recommended to their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers was neither <hi>higher</hi> nor <hi>purer</hi> than the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Seneca</hi> and other <hi>Stoicks;</hi> But it may be that they have read <hi>Seneca</hi> with as much <hi>attention</hi> as he did, and can give as good an <hi>account</hi> of the <hi>Defects</hi> of the <hi>Stoical Philoſophy,</hi> and wherein it fell ſhort of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Standard: One may eaſily gueſs whom he means, and intends to hit by this waſpiſh accuſation. But to purſue him thorow all his <hi>hiding</hi> places, and little <hi>Subterfuges,</hi> is as <hi>uſeleſs</hi> as it is <hi>weariſom.</hi> The reaſon why I kept you ſo long on this Head, was to diſcover the <hi>Genius</hi> of the people we have to do with. He tells us, <hi>this Philoſophy was never much preached by the</hi> Presbyterians: but the Philoſophy that I have deſcrib'd was preach'd by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and conſequently not <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito</hi> unto the Doctrine of Chriſt <hi>crucified</hi> (as he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</note> but rather <hi>ſubſervient</hi> unto it, and a great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> of the truth and <hi>divinity</hi> of it; It is very true, that the Princes of Philoſophers underſtood not the <hi>Revelations</hi> of the Goſpel, but the <hi>true exerciſe</hi> of Reaſon is very <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with Revelation; and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſcourſe to the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> proves him a <hi>learned and ſolid</hi> Philoſopher. And tho the Apoſtles were <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>illiterate</hi> men, yet God did ſtrengthen their Reaſon beyond the moſt <hi>accurate Philoſophers:</hi> And when he ſent them forth to preach the Goſpel, they became in the ſtrictest ſenſe <hi>greater Philoſophers</hi> than their Enomies. And tho the Chriſtian Religion in its <hi>beginnings</hi> appeared <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>fooliſh,</hi> yet when it was <hi>narrowly enquired</hi> into, it was found to be the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of God: for the Apoſtles offer'd the beſt Reaſons to <hi>convince</hi> both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth was the Meſſins;</hi> and conſequently, that <hi>there was no other</hi>

            <p>It is certain, that if the <hi>Moral</hi> Philoſophers could lay aſide their <hi>pride</hi> and the <hi>intereſt</hi> of a <hi>Faction,</hi> they might be ſooner gained to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> than others, they could not but ſee the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of ſuch excellent <hi>Morals</hi> as were recommended in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and were far above the <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>defective ſyſtems</hi> of the Pagan <hi>Schools.</hi> There are no excellent Precepts amongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but what are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and if we recommend Chriſtian vertue by <hi>Chriſtian motives,</hi> I think the whole undertaking is very commendable. Why the Vindicator ſhould thus waſpiſhly Comment on an innocent Sentence or two of that Author, I cannot tell; but he may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that when we were Boys we were taught that Philoſophy in its <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent</hi> and <hi>latitudo,</hi> was <hi>the knowledge of divine and human things.</hi> And then Chriſtian Philoſophy is good Chriſtian Divinity &amp; <hi>vicê verſâ;</hi> but the Vindicator is afraid leſt any one may think him a ſtranger to Philoſophy, and therefore tells us, <hi>that it may be that they underſtand that as well as their Neighbours.</hi> And no doubt this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his, that I have examined, is a ſufficient <hi>Evidence</hi> of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such another Specimen of his Candour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity we meet with pag. 66. where he again inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, that <hi>the Clergy</hi> are <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. The <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> Author of the ſecond Letter had juſtly obſerved, that the Clergy could not be <hi>erroneous,</hi> becauſe they could ſign the 39 <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But the Vindicator replies, <hi>So can many do who every day preach againſt the Doctrine contained in theſe Articles.</hi> And at this rate he may diſprove all <hi>external</hi> Evidences: there is no penetrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>hearts</hi> of men, they are only <hi>acceſſible</hi> to <hi>Omniſcience</hi> to whom all things are <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>open.</hi> But the Vindicator may remember, that the diſſenting Miniſtes in and <note place="margin">Article of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith.</note> about <hi>London</hi> in their late <hi>agreement,</hi> require no more of any as marks of Orthodoxy, than the <hi>ſubſoription</hi> of 36 Articles. The Vindicator inſinuates, that though the Clergy do <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> them, yet they <hi>preach</hi> againſt them. This is another ſtroke of his good <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Civility;</hi> and he may beconvinced long
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60080:28"/>
e're now, that the Epiſcopal Clergy is not ſo very pliable to do any thing againſt their Convictions in view of their worldly Intereſt, even when he and his <hi>Party</hi> have been very <hi>active</hi> to <hi>reduce</hi> them to <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtraits</hi> and <hi>difficulties;</hi> nay, if he will oblige me to be plain, I could tell him, where ſome Miniſters of that <hi>Faction</hi> were ſo villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly zealous againſt the Clergy, that they did ſolicite Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, where they themſelves, or ſome of their <hi>intimate</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were <hi>Judges.</hi> I am not to publiſh Names, but I can prove this whenever it is found <hi>convenient.</hi> I know the Vindicator will be very curious to know my <hi>Informers,</hi> but I am not obliged to be ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, though I am reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance to perform all the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> I make to him and his <hi>Aſſociates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the next <hi>Cenſure</hi> that he beſtows on the Clergy is of the ſame nature with the <hi>former.</hi> The Author of the ſecond Letter had ſaid, that there were many among the Clergy who were not inclined to be every day talking to the people of <hi>Gods decrees and abſolute reprobation,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed, I think the Author gave a juſt account of the <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>modeſty</hi> of his Brethren, but the Vindicator laſhes him here with great ſeverity, and tells him that his diſcourſe is <hi>impertinent;</hi> for they do not require that one ſhould talk <hi>always</hi> to the people of <hi>Decrees and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations.</hi> But here the Vindicator gives no great proof of his <hi>Logick.</hi> For the phraſe, <hi>every day</hi> did not imply a Metaphyſical ſtrictneſs, as if the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> never preach'd on any other <hi>Subject</hi> but on the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> but the plain and obvious meaning is, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did <hi>frequently</hi> and <hi>indiſcreetly</hi> handle ſuch <hi>abſtruſe</hi> Subjects, as neither they nor the people were able to <hi>fathom.</hi> And all ſuch <hi>Phraſes,</hi> though they ſeem to imply a <hi>Logical</hi> univerſality muſt be interpreted, to intend no more, than that ſuch or ſuch a thing <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> comes to paſs.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Blow</hi> is more <hi>ſevere,</hi> and one had need <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> to be armed <hi>Capa-pee</hi> to meet with it, <hi>But if he mean (as he muſt if he ſpeak to the purpoſe) that the abſolute decrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton and Reprobation, both</hi> praeteritum <hi>as an act of Sovereignty, and</hi> praedamnatum <hi>as an act of Juſtice, are not to be held forth or taught to the people; we abhor this as an unſound Doctrine, and look on him as a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Advocate for the Orthodoxy of the Clergy.</hi> Thus the Vindicator is ſufficiently revenged of his Adverſary, who is now more lamentably ſhattered than can be imagined; It is not generous in the Vindicator thus to purſue his Victory; is it poſſible that ſuch meek and calm Saints ſhall thus openly expoſe the weakneſs of their Antagoniſts. But if the Vindicator were out of his paſſion, I would entreat him to tell me in what place of Saint <note place="margin">Virg. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 1.—Tantaene animis coeleſtibus irae.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles does he read of a <hi>Decretum praedam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi>

and what ever come of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> or <hi>Arminian Hypotheſis;</hi> I am afraid his Explication is both conplicated <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> and <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy.</hi> But he tells us, that he underſtands Philoſophy as well as his Neighbors; pray, let him tell us in which of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> or Proteſtant <hi>Calviniſts</hi> did he ever read of a <hi>Decretum praedam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum? praeteritio</hi> and <hi>praedamnatio</hi> may be met with, but a <hi>Decretum praedamnatum</hi> is the peculiar invention of this <note n="*" place="margin">

And if you be acquainted with the Vindicator, you may adviſe him to read the <hi>Calvinian Hypotheſis</hi> before he venture to explain it.

            </p>
            <p>The next thing I take notice of is his hiſtorical Argument from the <hi>Culdees,</hi> to prove that there was a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the <hi>primitive</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag:</note> times before <hi>Popery</hi> entred. And the plain truth is, this is the only thing that he ſays, that deſerves to be conſidered, not for any weight or <hi>hiſtorical Truth</hi> that is in it, but becauſe the <hi>learned Blondel</hi> made uſe of it to ſupport that <hi>imaginary Hypotheſis</hi> from ſome <hi>Ancient</hi> Teſtimonies. He had met with <hi>it</hi> in <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Hiſtory, and that learned Hiſtorian took it unwarily from his <hi>Contemporary Monks, Boctius</hi> and others, or ſuch as were little removed from his <hi>own</hi> Age; <hi>Blondel</hi> made uſe of it to ſerve the <hi>diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apolog. pro ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Hieronym, p 315.</note> Intereſt in <hi>Britain.</hi> And to the end that he might make a great <hi>muſter</hi> of Teſtimonies, he muſt needs <hi>erect</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> towards the <hi>end</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Century,</hi> or beginning of the third. If they can prove this, I muſt confeſs it is of <hi>conſiderable</hi> weight; but the great <hi>misfortune</hi> is, there are no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors now extant upon whoſe Teſtimony an affair ſo diſtant from our times can be reaſonably <hi>founded.</hi> None within ſix hundred years of that Period gives us the leaſt evidence for it, when I ſay ſix hundred years, I do not mean, that good Authors at the diſtance of ſeven or eight hundred years give any <hi>Evidence</hi> for it more than their <hi>Predeceſſors;</hi> but when there is none to <hi>vouch</hi> it within that Period, it is <hi>ridiculous</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Vindicator</hi> diſcovers much of his own creeping Genius, when he diſcourſes of the Act of their Aſſembly againſt the <hi>private</hi> Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> nor is it poſſible to purſue him in ſuch a Wilderneſs of little impertinencies.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>pretended</hi> Aſſembly would have done better if they had left the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of Miniſters in all places, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much to be wiſhed, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be Adminiſtred with all <hi>publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,</hi> when there is not an apparent <hi>neceſſity</hi> to recede from ſo laudable a Cuſtom, but to make Diſcourſes to the People on particular Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, at the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, is a thing in it ſelf altogether new and unneceſſary. If the <hi>nature, uſe,</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of it, be ſeriouſly explained, there needs no more. And to think a Sermon, in the modern and uſual Notion, neceſſary is as great Superſtition, as that of theirs, who fancy that the effects of it follow <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> which <hi>Phraſe</hi> is very little underſtood by the People, and perhaps <hi>others</hi> who ſhould teach the People do not throughly underſtand it neither.</p>
            <p>Next I ſhall take notice of what we are told by the <hi>Vindicator Pag.</hi> 174. That the Presbyterians could not comply with Human <hi>Ceremonies</hi> with a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the Worſhip of God <note n="*" place="margin">But they refuſed to joyn in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God when there were no Ceremonies appointed.</note>. It is true the <hi>Vindicator</hi> hath not in this place any Diſcourſe to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60080:31"/>
prove this unlawful, but I take notice of it as one of the <hi>Theological hints</hi> that are interſperſed in his <hi>Defamatory Libel,</hi> But may not Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Human <hi>Appointment</hi> (if they <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>gravely</hi> expreſs our <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)</hi> be <hi>uſed</hi> in the Worſhip of God? Did not <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſe us <hi>to look to our Feet when we come into the houſe of God,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Ceremony</hi> was practiſed under the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Diſpenſation, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>putting off our Shoes</hi> when we approach the Holy Place: as <hi>Moſes</hi> was enjoyned by God himſelf, <hi>becauſe the place he ſtood upon was holy ground,</hi> and this was an Advertiſement that he ought to do what was <hi>ordinarily</hi> done by all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations when he approached the place of Gods <hi>peculiar</hi> Reſidence. And pray, Was it not a <hi>ſignificant Ceremony expreſſive</hi> of their <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>adoration?</hi> In like manner, Sackcloth and Aſhes did amongſt all Nations <hi>ſignifie grief</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> therefore in their <hi>Humiliations</hi> they were uſed to expreſs their <hi>Remorſe</hi> and <hi>Contritions.</hi> The Presbyterians fix upon a word, and pronounce it with <hi>diſdain</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> they repeat it with <hi>Indignation,</hi> and then their zealous Diſciples when they hear that <hi>word</hi> pronounced, preſently let <hi>fly</hi> their thoughts to ſome <hi>monſtrous thing</hi> or <hi>other</hi> that is not at all <hi>ſignified</hi> by that <hi>word;</hi> yet the <hi>Idea</hi> of ſome ſuch <hi>ugly</hi> thing ſticks to their <hi>Imagination,</hi> for no other reaſon but that <hi>Mas John frown'd</hi> when he heard that word <hi>pronounced.</hi> What other reaſon can we give why the word <hi>(ſignificant Ceremony)</hi> ſhould <hi>diſturb</hi> their <hi>Imaginations?</hi> Why may not we expreſs our <hi>Thoughts, Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> by Ceremonies as well as by words? Since both are <hi>innocent,</hi> and both ſerve the ſame <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi> But the Covenanters themſelves uſed <hi>ſignificant Ceremonies,</hi> when they impoſed the <hi>Covenant:</hi> he that Swore was to <hi>lift</hi> up his <hi>right hand bare,</hi> you are to take notice that it was the <hi>Right</hi> and not the <hi>Left,</hi> and it was <hi>lifted up</hi> and not otherwiſe <hi>extended.</hi> It was <hi>bare,</hi> and not <hi>covered,</hi> and was not this a <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> of Human Inſtitution?</p>
            <p>In the Worſhip of God, nature taught Mankind to approach God with all the decent Marks of <hi>Diſtance</hi> and <hi>Adoration,</hi> and they that declaim moſt againſt <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> do practice them frequently, only they do this more <hi>awkwardly,</hi> and with a <hi>figure</hi> becoming their <hi>ſingularity;</hi> but this will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convince the <hi>Intelligent</hi> part of Mankind that they are either <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> than any of their Neighbours. True Religion obliges us to comply with the <hi>innocent</hi> decencies of Mankind, and to affect nothing that's <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> or <hi>ſingular.</hi> Our Saviour left us this Example, he eat and drank with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> and affected no <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> different from the <hi>Jews.</hi> If the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be practiſed by the Nation amongſt whom we live, if they decently expreſs our <hi>Reverence,</hi> or our <hi>Humiliation,</hi> I ſee no reaſon why they may not be uſed in the <hi>Service</hi> of God, as well as <hi>words,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they are commanded by our <hi>lawful</hi> Superiours as <hi>neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> of <hi>Publick</hi> Order and Uniformity, nor can they change their <hi>Nature</hi> by being <hi>commanded;</hi> for ſuch and ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60080:31"/>
               <hi>indifferent,</hi> yet ſome one or other muſt be uſed, and which of them we ſhall uſe may very well be determined by our lawful <hi>Superiors.</hi> Sitting (for any thing I know) was never looked upon as a Poſture of <hi>Reverence,</hi> yet the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the moſt part fit all of them in time of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer, what they <hi>ſignifie</hi> by it I know not, I am ſure not that which becomes Prayer, and the Worſhip of the moſt High God. We look upon the decent Ceremonies of the Church as <hi>Appendages</hi> or Expreſſions, but not conſtituent parts of Worſhip, as is <hi>fooliſhly</hi> and <hi>peeviſhly</hi> alledged by our <hi>Adverſaries;</hi> and I may put the <hi>Vindicator</hi> in mind, that the reaſon why ſome of the Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> Read the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is not what he <hi>ſuggeſts,</hi> according to his wonted Candor and Ingenuity, but rather an open <hi>avowing</hi> of their <hi>Principles,</hi> when it was viſible to the World there was no <hi>poſſibility</hi> of uniting with the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing I take notice of, is to be met with <hi>Pag.</hi> 196, 197. The Author of that Epiſtle, that is ſubjoyned to the <hi>Vindicators</hi> Book, tells us, to the reproach of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that ſome of them upon the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the Government <hi>ſubmitted to reordination to the great ſcandal not only of this, but other Reformed Churches.</hi> I know none were ſcandalized at it, but ſuch as were reſolved to pick quarrels with every thing that the Biſhops would do. It was no ſcandal to the <hi>Foreign</hi> Churches or the <hi>French</hi> Divines. All of them the <hi>greateſt</hi> men among <note place="margin">
                  <hi>M. Alix,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</note> them are <hi>reordained</hi> when they come to <hi>England,</hi> and they chearfully ſubmit to it. And this was never condemned by any Publick Act of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, nor by none of their Eminent Divines. The Church of <hi>England</hi> does not abſolutely <hi>condemn</hi> their <hi>Ordinations</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but rather waves the <hi>debate:</hi> but ſhe is determined to preſerve an <hi>unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> within her <hi>own</hi> Bounds.</p>
            <p>As to the Matter of Fact narrated in Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s Letter I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and therefore I ought to ſay no more than I know. He tells us that he ſubſcribed a Paper, and that the Paper was <hi>drawn</hi> out of the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> Letter by a Friend of his, and that now he repents for <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing</hi> this Paper, and that though he was in great Friendſhip afterwards with <hi>Biſhop Scougal,</hi> and did what others in that <hi>Interval</hi> did, yet he thinks that by all this he paid no <hi>formal</hi> Canonical Obedience. From all which I obſerve, that it is a very happy thing to live in, or near an <hi>Univerſity</hi> as Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> did. Diſtinctions are <hi>very uſeful things,</hi> one had better carry a good bundle of them about him than all your famous <hi>Elixirs</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences;</hi> one may pay <hi>material Canonical Obedience,</hi> but it is dangerous to pay it <hi>formally:</hi> the great miſchief is in the <hi>formality</hi> of paying it, but for my part I have ſworn Canonical Obedience formally, and I have paid it <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially,</hi> and ſhall never decline my Biſhops Spiritual Authority when ever there is occaſion, and I think all the Presbyters of that National Church are as much obliged to obey their Spiritual Governours, notwithſtanding of all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60080:32"/>
that paſt in favors of the oppoſite Faction ſince the <hi>Revolution.</hi> And now I think it high time to go forward to the fourth Particular that I promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To let you ſee the ſeveral Periods of Epiſcopacy and Presbytery in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince the Reformation. And I am the more confident to give you ſatisfaction, becauſe I had the happineſs to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe a Manuſcript (written by a perſon of <hi>great honour</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) relating to this very affair; and it is of ſo much the greater <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> that it is not only founded on our beſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, but on the <hi>authentick</hi> Records of Parliament; and it is from that Manuſcript that I <hi>copy</hi> the following Account: for it is apparent that the Church was never governed by a Parity of Officers, but by different Orders from the beginning of the Reformation. And in the entry to this Narration, Let us remark, ſays <hi>my Author,</hi>

Indeed, in the year 1580. an Aſſembly met at <hi>Dundee,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> and his Aſſociates without a ſhadow of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Civil Authority; and they declared that the Office of a Biſhop (but with this reſtriction, <hi>as it was then uſed)</hi> had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>foundation</hi> nor <hi>warrant</hi> in the Word of God. But let all ſerious Chriſtians conſider, whether they will believe this famous Conventicle or the plain <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>primitive Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of all <hi>Oecomenick Counſels,</hi> and the rule of <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> and <hi>primitive</hi> Practice, and to help their choice, let them take notice of the pious Deſign of this Aſſembly in caſting off Biſhops, by the very next clauſe in their Act, <hi>viz.</hi> That their next Aſſembly ſhould conſider how to diſpoſe of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> This was the primitive Invaſion of the Kings <hi>Patronages</hi> and <hi>Regale</hi> of the Crown.

that they did not meddle in Civil matters; but in <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> matters they had <hi>ſufficient</hi> Authority to proceed, and did ſo.</p>
                  <p>The practice on theſe grounds did ſhortly follow, for on the 23d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1582. the King was made Priſoner by a <hi>Faction</hi> of Lords at the houſe of <hi>Ruthwen,</hi> and on the 13th of <hi>October</hi> 1582. the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Edenburg,</hi> did by an Act <hi>approve</hi> of that <hi>perduel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and declared that it was <hi>good</hi> ſervice to God and his Chucrh.

                  <p>The King having delivered himſelf from his reſtraint, Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> and others of the Miniſtry openly aſſert that there was no <hi>injury</hi> done to the King, and Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi> declaimed frequently <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> for which he was called before the Council; but he boldly <hi>declined</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> as <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>prima Inſtantia</hi> of what's preached in the Pulpit, even tho it were high Treaſon, and ſo he fled to <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the year 1573. The Authority of the Biſhops is owned by the firſt Act of the 4. Par. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1578. the like by Act. 63. Parl. 5. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1579. the like by Act. 71. Parliam. 6. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1581. That the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did <hi>continue</hi> in the Church appears from Act 100. Parl. 7. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>The like appears from the Acts 106, and 114, of that Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1584. The <hi>Biſhops Authority</hi> fully own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Act. 132. Parl. 8. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6</p>
                  <p>In the year 1587. It appears that <hi>Prelacy exiſted then</hi> by Act 28. Parl. 11. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Also in that 11. Parl. It appears by the Act of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation,</hi> that <hi>Prelacy</hi> did ſtill <hi>exiſt</hi> by Law, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their <hi>Temporalties</hi> were annexed to the Crown. and by the 111. Act, of that 11. Parl.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1591, 1592, 1593, and 1594. The <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> could not ſtop the <hi>Inſolence</hi> of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor their <hi>meeting</hi> in <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>interpoſition</hi> of the Royal Authority, but this hindered not but that the Biſhops did ſtill <hi>exiſt</hi> by Law, and <hi>exerced</hi> ſome part of their Office, and in all <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Conventions</hi> of Eſtates, the <hi>Prelates</hi> did did always Sit and Vote as the <hi>firſt</hi> of the <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> as the Records and <hi>Sederunts</hi> of all the Parliaments will prove.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1596. <hi>Leſlie,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> dying at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Lindſey</hi> was preſented by the King to the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> the very next year.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1598. there was a <hi>Conference</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Falkland</hi> betwixt the Commiſſioners of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and ſome appointed by the King to meet with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60080:36"/>
them, where they agreed on ten <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Policy, for the Church, relating chiefly to the Clergy's <hi>Votes</hi> in Parliament, and the <hi>Elections</hi> of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the Dioceſes; ſome of theſe Propoſitions were <hi>fooliſh,</hi> but it was thought convenient that the King ſhould comply with thoſe Hot Heads in <hi>ſome</hi> things; for at that time Severals began to <hi>debate</hi> his Right of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo he would have <hi>all quiet</hi> at Home, yet ſtill this is <hi>evident</hi> that <hi>Biſhops</hi> did then <hi>exiſt</hi> by Law, and that altho ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning them was debated, yet their <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> was not.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1600, theſe forementioned Articles were appoved in the Aſſembly at <hi>Monroſs, March</hi> 28, 1600. and to that Aſſembly Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> (who was the chief Tool with Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi> for <hi>parity)</hi> at his death did write an Exhortation diſowning his <hi>former</hi> Errors, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſing them to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the <hi>ancient</hi> Order, and to chuſe <hi>good</hi> Biſhops of the <hi>beſt</hi> of the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1601. the King called an Aſſembly of the Church to meet at <hi>Brunt Iſland,</hi> where many good things were Enacted, both for the true Liberty of the Church, and for <hi>reclaiming</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Nobility from their <hi>Errors,</hi> which proved more <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>pacific</hi> than all the former furious Methods, which at that time were promoted by a <hi>Hot Headed</hi> Man, called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidſon,</hi> who by a Letter to the Aſſembly incited them to declare againſt the Kings <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and other Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The Aſſembly would have proceeded to Cenſure him, but the King would not allow it, ſaying, it was matter of Joy that theſe Hot Heads were reduced to one, or ſome few.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1602. the King in an Aſſembly at <hi>Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood-Houſe,</hi> did ſhew great <hi>Clemency</hi> to ſome firy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60080:37"/>
whom the Aſſembly would have Cenſured: as alſo he gave great Satisfaction to the whole Aſſembly and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by his excellent Propoſals for <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> Proviſions both for <hi>Biſhops</hi> and Presbyters. And in this Aſſembly of the Church was the fifth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> appointed an <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> Thanksgiving for the Kings Delivery from <hi>Gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Conſpiracy.</p>
                  <p>Before the Diet appointed for the next General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the Crown of <hi>England</hi> did fall to the King by the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> ſo there was no meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Church General Aſſemblies for a while, but the few remaining <hi>Hot Headed</hi> Presbyters were very buſie on the Kings removal ſo far: and fearing the <hi>excellent</hi> Order of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church (the great Safety and Peace of <hi>Britain</hi> depending on an intire and full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Iſland) they were apprehenſive that upon ſuch Conſiderations, the King would heartily promote a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Juriſdiction in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Presbyterians in this Juncture did buſily ſtir up Prejudices in the People againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> tho undoubtedly the beſt <hi>Reformed</hi> Church and <hi>greateſt</hi> Bulwark againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> And though the King, for good Reaſons, when he went to <hi>England,</hi> Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the General Aſſembly from <hi>July</hi> 1604, to <hi>July</hi> 1605. yet theſe Men prevailed with Nine of the Fifty Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of <hi>Scotland</hi> to keep the Meeting notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Kings Prorogation:</hi> where Thirteen Perſons meeting did moſt <hi>Seditiouſly</hi> run into ſuch <hi>Declarations</hi> againſt the <hi>Statutes,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding Laws,</hi> as were by the <hi>Judicatures</hi> declared <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and for which Severals of the Thirteen were Condemned before the Juſtices. For they could not be perſuaded either to <hi>acknowledge,</hi> or <hi>revoke</hi> their <hi>ſeditious</hi> Paſquils, but they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pardoned by the <hi>King,</hi> when they confeſſed that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60080:37"/>
the Chancellour encouraged their Meeting in <hi>July</hi> 1604. and proved it, which forced the Chancellour to prove likewiſe that they promiſed to <hi>connive</hi> at his being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and his Poſſeſſion of what he had of the Church Lands, upon Condition he ſhould <hi>own</hi> them againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy,</hi> whereupon the King ſaid that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would betray the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion in hatred to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the Chancellour would <hi>betray</hi> Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy for <hi>greed</hi> of their <hi>Temporalties. So far my Author.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now from all this I infer, that the firſt Reformers of our Religion in <hi>Scotland</hi> declaimed againſt the <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>incroachments</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but never againſt the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Juriſdiction <hi>as ſuch.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart,</hi> and ſome others of our moſt Eminent <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> knew no other Government of the Church but <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> The firſt being bred in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and others, who were his Diſciples, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Sentiments. And that the firſt Reformers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction of ſuch of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as Preached and promoted the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That though the Epiſcopal Authority was frequently <hi>weakned, cruſhed</hi> and <hi>interrupted,</hi> by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Inſurrections, and Conſpiracies of Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi>'s Faction, yet it was never legally <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> but rather <hi>continued</hi> in the Church, <hi>ſecured,</hi> and <hi>defended</hi> by many Laws.</p>
            <p>☞ Thirdly, That the Presbyterians always watched the <hi>difficult</hi> Poſtures of the King's Affairs, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they found him at a <hi>diſadvantage, then</hi> they made him much more uneaſie by Popular Tumults, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy never pleaded their <hi>Exemptions</hi> from the Secular Powers more <hi>violently</hi> and <hi>factiouſly,</hi> than the <hi>Melvilian</hi> Tribe in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60080:38"/>
Fifthly, That Epiſcopacy was not <hi>Aboliſhed</hi> in that <hi>very</hi> year wherein they pretend that Presbytery was Eſtabliſhed, but that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. was ſtill retained in all its <hi>legal</hi> Rights, <hi>Privileges,</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> It is true that the Inſolence of Presbyters was not then to be <hi>reſiſted,</hi> but by granting them great Liberties, and that this Liberty was granted by the neceſſitous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that the King was in.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That the moſt violent of their Faction had not then the <hi>Impudence</hi> to quarrel the Superiority of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop above a Presbyter, as a thing <hi>unlawful</hi> in it ſelf; but that Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi> made his <hi>approaches</hi> to the ruin of Epiſcopacy by plauſible pretences, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was abuſed, and that it was not exerciſed according to its <hi>primitive</hi> deſigns and <hi>ſimplicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, I obſerve that Epiſcopacy was never legally Aboliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> until the Tragical Rebellion in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his Reign broke forth, and we need not inform the World how unwilling King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr was to <hi>Aboliſh</hi> Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That the Royal Authority never gave way to their Rebellion, and Inſolence, when they could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; but ſometimes they were forced to yield to grant them great Liberties to avoid the heavier Blows and Thunder Claps of their Fury.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That we can have no better Evidence for any Matter of Fact than the Publick Records of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, We may clearly diſcern that the <hi>Vindicators</hi> Book in defence of his Party, is one <hi>Hypocritical Shuffle</hi> from top to bottom. For if Mr. <hi>Melvil,</hi> the Founder of Presbytery, and his Confederates, did <hi>affront</hi> the Kings Perſon, and declined his <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>provoked</hi> the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and <hi>Excommunicated</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and was ſo <hi>rude</hi> to the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of Foreign Princes, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60080:38"/>
               <hi>profanely</hi> appointed a Faſt, with no other deſign than to <hi>baſſle the King to his Teeth. Then</hi> let me ask the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> why all this <hi>Apology,</hi> to perſuade the World that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not capable of ſuch <hi>Villanies</hi> as is the <hi>Rabbling</hi> of the Clergy. Nay, I muſt tell him <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> did nothing upon this laſt <hi>Revolution,</hi> but what they Practiſed when they had not ſuch <hi>opportunities</hi> to to vent their Malice. And by this unqueſtionable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory he and all others may ſee, to how little purpoſe his Diſtinction of <hi>ſober Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Cameronians</hi> will ſerve him; for the <hi>Cameronians</hi> have no <hi>Principles diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> from <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> from <hi>Cameronians,</hi> nor is it poſſible to reſute the <hi>Cameronians</hi> by <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, We may gather from the preceeding Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and the conſtant Practice of Presbyterians, that they have no Principles of Unity amongſt themſelves, for, the leſſer number (if more Popular than their Brethren) may remonſtrate with that Inſolence, and Fury, againſt the plurality as to ſtop the whole courſe of Diſcipline, as in the forementioned caſe of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twelſthly, The Spirit of Presbytery, is a Spirit of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and cannot endure to Obey, and therefore ſuch as are fully Poiſoned with its Principles, (whenever the Deciſions of the Publick contradict their own peculiar <hi>Plan</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi>) they immediately fly in the Face of that Authority, they formerly pretended to ſupport, and by general words, which at the bottom have no particular ſignification, but what they pleaſe to put upon them, they pick quarrels, and exceptions againſt all their own Judicatures, Governments <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is viſible as from many inſtances, ſo from the famous <hi>Proteſtations</hi> of ſeveral biggorted Incendiaries againſt the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Presbyterians <hi>Anno</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60080:39"/>
1651. becauſe that General Aſſembly did promote the <hi>Publick Reſolutions</hi> in order to the Reſtoring the King to the Exerciſe of his Government, they pretend <hi>that the General Aſſembly was not rightly conſtituted,</hi> that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Godly</hi> did adhere to the <hi>Proteſtors,</hi> that the Publick <hi>Reſolutioners</hi> had made <hi>defection,</hi> becauſe they were for bringing again into Places of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truſt,</hi> ſuch as would probably ſerve the King againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion then on Foot, upon ſuch <hi>pretences</hi> they decline their <hi>Supreme National Judicatory,</hi> and becauſe that <hi>Print</hi> is known but to very few of the preſent Generation, and ſince it is a Monument of their Villany and Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it may be ſeen at the end of this Letter. I have no more to add, but that I wiſh my Skill to ſerve you, were equal to my Zeal and Affection, for I am in all ſincerity</p>

            <p>HOW gracious God hath been to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in giving her pure Ordinances; we truſt that while we live, it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, with thanfulneſs, by us unto the Moſt High, of whom we deſire Mercy and Grace to adhere unto the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eſtabliſhed in this Land, amongſt the many ſad Tokens of the Lords Indignation and Wrath againſt this Kirk, the preſent Difference of his Servants in the Miniſtry, is looked upon by us, and we believe by all the godly in the Land, as one of the greateſt. And as we hold it a Duty deeply to be humbled before the Lord in the Senſe thereof, and by all lawful and fair means, within the compaſs of our power and ſtation, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the remedy; ſo we do acknowledge a free General Aſſembly, lawfully Called, and rightly Conſtituted, and proceeding with Meekneſs and Love in the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Rule of the Word, and the Acts and Conſtitutions of this Kirk, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the firſt and moſt effectual means appointed of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60080:40"/>
God for obtaining the ſame, and for preſerving Purity, and advancing the power of the Work of Reformation in this Age, and tranſmitting the ſame unſpotted to our Poſterity, and to the Ages and Generations that are to come: but that as the faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church in former times did by his good Hand on them in the right Adminiſtration of free and lawful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies, bring the Work of Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> unto a great Perfoction, and nigh Conformity with the firſt Pattern: ſo unfaithful Men minding their own things more than things of Chriſt, and Usurping over their Brethres, and the Lords Inheritance, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the beauty thereof, firſt by encroaching upon the Liberty and Freedom of Aſſemblies, afterwards by taking away the very Aſſemblies themſelves. Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring and calling to mind the many Bonds and Obligations that lie upon us from the Lord, and being deſirous to be found faithful in this day of Tentation, and to exonerate our Conſciences as in his ſight, and to avoid the acceſſion unto that guiltineſs in which many have involved themſelves. And conceiving that this Meeting is not a lawful General Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in regard that the Election of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to the ſame, have been limited and prejudiced in the due Liberty thereof, by a Letter and Act of their Commiſſioners of the laſt Aſſembly ſent to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, appointing ſuch Brethren as after Conference re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unſatisfied with, and continued to oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions, to be Cited to the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And in regard the Commiſſion of many Burghs and Presbyteries are abſent, as wanting free acceſſ, by reaſon of the Motions of the Enemy: and in regard that many of the Commiſſioners of the laſt General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have carried on a courſe of defection, contrary to the Truſt committed to them, and to the Acts and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Printer had caſt off the former Sheets, there appeared here a ſcurrilous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, intituled an Anſwer to the <hi>Scots Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Eloquence</hi> in three parts. If you would have a Character of the Author you muſt read the Book, and perhaps by ſo doing, you may meet with ſomething that is extraordinary, and which cannot ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fall under words; he appears with all the ſtorm and Thunder that paſſion and rage can furniſh him with, he breaths nothing but violence and indignation, and bluſters with ſo much fury, that at firſt view you may perceive him as great a Separatiſt from good nature and modeſty, as he is from the Chriſtian Church and her Worſhip.</p>
            <p>He divides his Pamphlet into three parts. In the firſt, he complains of cruel Laws made againſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the former Reigns. In the ſecond, he meddles with the Author of the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> In the third, he aſſaults the Sermons and Lives of the Biſhops and Clergy.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and our ſubordinate Governors made no Laws againſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but what they were forc'd to make in their own defence; when the King was reſtor'd to his <hi>hereditary right,</hi> and the Nations deliver'd from their <hi>Egyptian bondage;</hi> the Parliament being call'd they enacted ſuch Laws as were abſolutely neceſſary for preſerving their Liberty and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60080:43"/>
Conſtitution: and becauſe they had ſo ſadly ſmarted under their cruel Taskmaſters (the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) in the late Civil Wars, they took care in the firſt place, by gentle Laws both the reclaim the deluded, and ſecure their own ſafety. The frequent attempts and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> afterwards oblig'd them to make more ſevere Laws, nor did ever any man in that Period ſuffer capital puniſhment, but for high Treaſon againſt the King and State. If their errors and deluſions were purely ſpeculative, and did not upon all turns prompt them to overturn the Government and graſp the Sovereignty, they might live in <hi>Scotland</hi> in all peace and tranquility, as other Diſſenters did. But when the whole <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Hind let looſe. Nepthali Jus populi.</note> Scheme of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as far as they differ from the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal party) is nothing in it ſelf but ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable humor and Rebellion, and when their inſolence became ſo intolerable that they proclaim'd open War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King in his own Dominions, and preach'd to their Hearers that they ought to kill his Servants, and that he had no right to the Crown becauſe he broke the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; what Apology needs there be made againſt the unreaſonable clamours of ſuch deſperate Incendiaries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when their cruelties towards the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> both <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> after the Year 1637. were unparallel'd in Hiſtory, as they were diabolical in their nature. And their Oath of the Covenant impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ranks and degrees of perſons within the Nation, and (Children at the Schools not excepted) with greater tyranny, malice and violence than the Fathers of the Inquiſition ever practiſed.</p>
            <p>VVhat was it then that the King was to be blam'd for, and his Miniſters of State? VVhy; they would not acknowledg that the King had loſt his right to the Crown, they defended his calm and obedient Subjects
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60080:43"/>
from the hands of theſe religious Harpyes who would needs perſuade the Nation, that there was no Sin ſo much to be dreaded, as any the least tranſgreſſion of the ſolemn League and Covenant. The King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State might more plauſibly be accus'd of cruelty, if they had made ſevere Laws againſt the <hi>conſequences of</hi> Presbyterian Opinions, rather than againſt <hi>the open and avowed efforts</hi> of treachery and Rebellion; Prudence and caution might arm them againſt the firſt, but ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence, the Laws of nature and Nations, their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſafety, muſt needs prompt them to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, you will meet with nothing in the firſt part of this Pamphlet, but an ill contriv'd abſtract of the <hi>Hind let looſe,</hi> and you know that the Epiſcopalians took care to compendiſe that Book, and publiſh it of new, that all men might ſee the principles, practices and humors of that Sect whom they oppoſe: nor can there be a better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>King Charles the ſeconds Government,</hi> than the <hi>Hind let looſe,</hi> if duly conſider'd, and upon the whole matter I will only ſay this, that if the Miniſters of State <hi>under King Charles</hi> II. in <hi>Scotland</hi> have done nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but what all wiſe, great, and good Men have done in the like caſes, then the Clamours of this party againſt their Miniſtry are rather an honour to, than an accuſation againſt their proceedings. For as long as there are any Records of publick tranſactions preserv'd in our Nation, the Rebellions under <hi>King Charles</hi> I. <hi>and</hi> II. and the principles by which they have been maintain'd, and the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> King's large Manifeſto.</note> Artifices, made uſe of to delude the people unto miſery and Enthusiasm, can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and if there was no other Book extant but the Acts of their General Aſſemblies, they ſufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>King Charles</hi> II, and his Miniſters of State from any ſhadow of cruelty and rigor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60080:44"/>
But all this and much more is made evident by the <hi>Learned and Loyal</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> in his ſhort and accurate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>King Charles the 2ds. Government,</hi> where he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, and baffles by Reaſon, Law, and the cuſtoms of Nations, the little cavils and exceptions ſtarted againſt the adminiſtrations of that <hi>wiſe and peaceable Monarch.</hi> A Book which ſhall never be anſwered, I do not mean, that they ſhall not write againſt it, but that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, and they may as wiſely run a tilt againſt a Rock, as endeavour to ſhake any part of its main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The reaſonings of it are ſo clear, the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal retorſions ſo undeniable, and the villanies of their factions and combinations ſo tranſparent, that to meddle with that Book will more and more diſcover their folly, as well as renew their correction: and the publiſher of it thinks ſtill he has done the Nation good ſervice; and he is the more confirmed in his Opinion, that he perceives, that the little and hidden Nurſlings of Presbytery are galled by it. <note n="*" place="margin">Anſwer to the Scottiſh Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Eloquence, p. 27.</note> It is a Lye that <hi>Sir George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie</hi> pretended he would not publiſh it, tho he would not allow a Copy <hi>ſurreptitiouſly</hi> procured to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without his immediate orders and directions; and when he ſaw it convenient, he recommended it to his Friend to publiſh it; and it might have been print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good while before he died, if the <hi>publiſher</hi> had not been diverted by many little Occurrences. But let nor this Scribler, or any of his party, blame <hi>Sir George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie,</hi> that their Covenants were added to the Treatiſe lately mentioned; this is ſolely to be imputed to the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> and he needs no Apology for the doing of it, ſince they are <hi>undeniable monuments of their incurable ſtubbornneſs</hi> and Rebellion: and the reaſonings in the Treatiſe it ſelf are frequently related to, and illuſtrated
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60080:44"/>
by thoſe wicked Papers, I mean the <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> of that reſtleſs Faction. But to end this Paragraph, you may tell this Accuſer, that the original Copy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Mr. Andrew Johaſtone</hi> (then <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to <hi>Sir George Mackenzie)</hi> is full in the <hi>Publiſhers</hi> hands.</p>
            <p>The Scribler unwarily does us a great deal of honour, when he <note place="margin">Quis genus Aeaeadum?—<hi>Virg.</hi>
               </note> tells the World that the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> under the Reign of <hi>King Charles</hi> II. <hi>were proſecuted and oppoſed by ſuch as the Duke of</hi> Queenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, <hi>Marquis of</hi> Athol, <hi>Earl of</hi> Linlithgow, <hi>Viſcount of</hi> Tarbat, <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> Drummond, <hi>and Sir</hi> George Mackenzie. If he underſtood the Laws of Conſequence, he might eaſily ſee that Men of their Quality, Senſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt are too great a weight in the oppoſite Scale, and ſince we have juſt reaſon to glory in their parts, honour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, it is very odd that he ſhould be ſo fooliſh, as to own that we are favour'd by perſons of their merit and vertue. 'Tis pleaſant to ſee with what rudeneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity this little Man aſſaults the memory of <hi>Sir George Mackenzie;</hi> ſo have I ſeen ſometimes when a <hi>generous Falcon</hi> drops dead to the ground, the <hi>Kites,</hi> the <hi>Crows,</hi> and the <hi>Jackdaws</hi> gather about him, and ſolemnize a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and yet even when he lies dead they dare not touch one of his feathers. He may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Fable, that when the <hi>Lion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phaedri Fabulae.</note> was expiring, the <hi>Aſs</hi> amongſt other Beasts kick'd him, and inſulted over him. I do not mean by this, that <hi>Sir George Mackenzie,</hi> if he were alive, would have taken notice of his bawling or buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry; but to let him ſee, that he is as void of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and honour, as he is of common ſenſe and modeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60080:45"/>
In this firſt Part he appears very uneaſie, that the Epiſcopal Party are not Perſecuted to the utmoſt, and upbraids us ever and anon with the Lenity that we meet with under the preſent Government, and again muſt needs perſuade the World, that our Principles of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> are <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> more dangerous to the preſent Government, than the Principles of the <hi>Covenant</hi> were to the former. But if there be no more in the caſe than <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> I think the Government needs not be afraid; and if the Epiſcopal Party are not ſo violently Persecuted now, if they do not feel thoſe loads of Miſery that they groaned under from the year 1638. to 1649, (when the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Zealots</hi> were uppermoſt) this is not at all to be imputed to the Lenity of Presbyterians, but to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints that are laid upon them by the oppoſite Biaſs of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and becauſe their moſt terrible Weapon of <hi>Excommunication</hi> is blunted (the Civil Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that formerly did attend it being taken away) this is the true Reaſon why they do not Proſecute their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts with <hi>Excommunications,</hi> becauſe ſuch Cenſures now have no force; ſo that notwithſtanding of all his <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in commendation of their Meekneſs, we look upon them ſtill as <hi>Tygers</hi> Chained, not altered in their Nature, but much more galled and irritated by their reſtraint. If the <hi>Scotch</hi> Epiſcopal Party has any favour in <hi>England or in Scotland,</hi> they ought to <hi>thank God</hi> for it, and his <hi>Inſtruments</hi> whom he directs, and employs to preſerve them. I hope 'tis viſible to the World, with what Induſtry and Application, and by what Engines and Means, Presbyterians are reſolved to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>In the Second Part of his Pamphlet he falls foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Author of the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> in which Scuffle I am not at all concerned. I think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60080:45"/>
of that Collection was to blame, that he did not more particularly relate the times when, the perſons, by whom, and places where, ſuch Stuff was Preached, and perhaps he has been unwary as to ſome Stories which need Confirmation, but ſince there is ſuch variety and multitude of true Stories of that Nature, nothing ſhould be advanc'd to their diſadvantage that is not duly atteſted. As for the Inconſiſtencies charged upon the Author of the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> they are not worth your while to conſider them, nor have I any inclination to examine them, nor am I concerned to offer my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation between them; only let me inform you that the Book of which I ſend you the <hi>General Hiſtory,</hi> contains not one good Conſequence from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>I have heard that the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence</hi> has been much talked off, and therefore I take the liberty to acquaint you with the Reaſons that induce me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there was no injury done the <hi>Scotch Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the publiſhing of that Book.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Printed Accounts cited from their Books are equal to the unprinted relations of their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Prayers.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford's Letters alone</hi> have in them many coarſe and abuſive Metaphors, and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that are mean and loathſome; and though I do not at all in this Letter meddle with his deſign and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet I think it but a modeſt Cenſure to ſay, that there was in thoſe Letters more Popularity than Piety. I know the Party do magnifie him highly, and it is no part of my buſineſs to leſſen their Opinion of him; yet I muſt tell you, that in the eſteem of all impartial Men he muſt fall below the Character they beſtow upon him. He had Read Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and others of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and if any Learning appear in his Books, it is but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60080:46"/>
ſome of the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> he had borrowed from Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De Juſtitiâ Vindicativâ,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us. And he was ſo plunged in theſe <hi>Metaphyſical Whimſies,</hi> that none can make Senſe of what he wrote. Let his Patrons conſider that Chapter in his <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones Apologeticae pro Divinâ Gratiâ,</hi> wherein he pretends to anſwer that Argument, <hi>Quod unuſquiſque tenetur credere,</hi> and then tell me if they can boaſt of his Perſpicuity and Solidity. Of the ſame Stamp are his Metaphysical <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations</hi> annexed to his Book <hi>De Providentia, de Ente Poſſibili:</hi> if I had the Book by me, I think I could give you Divertiſement. I know very well what our Adverſaries will ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that I do not underſtand him, and I muſt ſincerely acknowledge they are in the right of it.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, The moſt blaſphemous Stories in the Book called the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> can be proved by the beſt and moſt undeniable Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Mr. <hi>Urquhart</hi>'s concerning the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> that of Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi>'s concerning the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Abraham run out of the Land of</hi> Caldea <hi>for debt.</hi> Now I agree with this <hi>angry Scribler,</hi> ſo far, that theſe are horrid and blaſphemous expreſſions, and I pitch upon them, becauſe he himſelf thinks that nothing can be worſe, and that theſe Expreſſions alone (if falſely alledged) diſprove the whole Collection. Now we fairly offer to prove theſe three, the firſt againſt Mr. <hi>Urquhart,</hi> the other two againſt Mr. <hi>Kirkton.</hi> This is undeniably juſt by his own Conceſſions <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. and if ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Stories are openly tolerated, what muſt we expect from that Society of Men, and I have in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Treatiſe</hi> given you two inſtances of greater Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Nonſenſe in the Printed Books of Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> than any that's to be found in the <hi>Scotch Eloquence.</hi> As for the Stories cited from the <hi>Scotch Eloquence againſt</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60080:46"/>
Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> and mentioned by him in <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. I do not truly believe them, unleſs I have better Authority for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe that one had a mind to make Stories to the diſadvantage of the <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> yet their <hi>jargon</hi> is ſo coarſly extravagant, that it is not poſſible for any Man to ſpeak their Language, unleſs he had been Educated in their <hi>Gibberiſh,</hi> and the Harmony between their Printed Books, and their unprinted Sermons is ſo exact, that none can doubt of the laſt who Read the firſt. Let me but name one Man, it is Mr. <hi>J. K.</hi> his Fancy is ſo <hi>Comical,</hi> ſo ſurprizing, ſo unimitable, that it is not poſſible to ſay any thing as he ſays it himſelf, nor yet to aſcribe to another what is ſaid by him; and this way of Preaching is no new thing amongſt the Presbyterians. They always accuſed the Epiſcopalians that their Sermons were Cold, and Dry, and Moral Diſcourſes, and were not Calculated to the Capacities and Affections of the People as <hi>theirs</hi> were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they complyed ſo much with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the People that they forgot the Majeſty of Religion, and the diſtinction between things Sacred and Prophane.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There may be ſo many Stories added of their abuſive Diſtorſions of the Scripture with Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick atteſtations, that it were their wiſdom to let this Debate fall. For Preaching after their way is become of late ſo triſling an Exerciſe, that no Man could perform it to the ſatisfaction of their thorow pac'd Diſciples, but he that was either an extraordinary Hypocrite, or well advanced in Madneſs, and whatever Men pretend that have conſidered the affair but ſuperficially, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to expoſe that abſurd, ſenſual, and ludicrous Sect, that Metamorphoſe Religion, and its Solemn Exerciſes unto Theatrical Scenes. If the great things of Religion

be true, if we have any thing that diſtinguiſhes us from the Beaſts that periſh, if our Souls ſurvive our Bodies, and if our belief and hopes of inviſible things, and the ſlate of Retribution be not intirely a Dream: what greater affront can be done to the <hi>Majeſty of God,</hi> the dignity of Human Nature, and the Common Senſe of Mankind, than thus by mock Sermons to Lampoon the great Truths of the Goſpel? Did not our <hi>meek and bleſſed Saviour</hi> chaſtiſe the Hypocriſie of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> with greater ſeverity, than the more open and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed lewdneſs of <hi>Publicans and Sinners?</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> treats them with no other Language, than that of <hi>dogs, evil workers, and the conciſion;</hi> their Character is more at length in the <hi>Epiſtle of St.</hi> Jude; ſuch religious Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do in the moſt effectual manner promote <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and they that Act Devotion after the manner of a Farce, do expoſe it more than the Wits, and the <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this conſideration alone the <hi>Presbyterian Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do more harm to Piety, than the moſt ſubtile Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Ancient and Modern <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported againſt Atheiſm by the ſtrength of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when we are attacked gravely by plauſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: but when we are ſurprized and diſarmed by the ſudden inſinuations of Raillery, we are quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not becauſe we are weak, but becauſe we do not reſolutely encounter the Enemy. One Sermon mixt with ſuch fooleries, as give occaſion to this Digreſſion, do more real hurt than can be imagined; and if it be a fault to Publiſh them, how intolerable is it to Preach them, and to ſupport Societies that ſeem to deſign no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than to ridicule all Religion. But it is the juſt Judgment of God, that they who have forſaken the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church ſhould be <hi>given up to ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>

In the third part of his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> he heaps together ſome monſtrous and ridiculous Stories againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and though one had ſufficient ſtrength to grapple with a <hi>Scavenger</hi> and lay him in the Mire, yet methinks the undertaking is neither generous nor decent. There are a great many of them that he aſperſes that I know nothing off, ſo it is not reaſonable to expect that I ſhould meddle in their affairs, and yet if they were the moſt arrant Villains upon Earth, I am able to demonſtrate, that his Teſtimony againſt them is not Valid. And therefore I humbly beg of all diſintereſted Strangers to conſider but a few Particulars; and then let them judge whether the accuſations of Presbyterians againſt the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>copal Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> are to be valued.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They may remember that this way of Libelling, is the true <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> of the Party, and we need gather no other inſtances to prove this, than the Practiſes of their <hi>General Aſſembly, Anno</hi> 1638. Who (when they Sat) Libelled the <hi>Venerable Archbiſhop</hi> Spotswood, <hi>and all his Brethren of that Order,</hi> of the moſt abominable Crimes, and charged them with the ſins of <hi>Habitual Lying, Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Inceſt, Sodomy,</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they paſt their Cenſures upon them as guilty of theſe Abominations, and inſerted the names of particular <hi>Gentlemen</hi> as Witneſſes, who were never acquainted with this Contrivance: and ordered all the <hi>Miniſters of the Nation</hi> to Read all theſe Libels and Sentences from their Pulpits, as if the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had been fairly examined, and the Witneſſes had appeared before that <hi>Packt Jury</hi> of Mock Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60080:48"/>
Now this was the Solemn Act of the whole Party met in a <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> who concerted thoſe Methods, when they were mutually conſcious to the Knavery of one another, and defying the <hi>Omniſcience of Heaven,</hi> went on reſolutely againſt their own Convictions, as well as the Practice of all former Ages. It is but ordinary for private Men to aſſault the Reputation of others, but what degrees of wickedneſs muſt they arrive to, that Combine together, and own to one another, that the plaineſt Laws of God might be trampled upon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than miſs their end. And this Villany is ſtill upon Record, and to their everlaſting diſgrace undeniable, and will continue ſo, as long as there are any Monuments of that Nation preſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Their Predeceſſors thus United, found Calumny the moſt proper Weapon, and effectual Inſtrument to ſerve their Malice, and to diſgrace amongſt the deluded People, Grave, Learned, Loyal, and Judicious Men; and the People were quickly undeceived, when the Covenanters got into the Saddle: for from the year 1638. to the year 1652. (when <hi>Oliver</hi> grew weary of their inſolence) the Nation groaned under the ſaddest and moſt unutterable Bondage. The <hi>Reader</hi> is therefore deſired to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that no Man can continue a Presbyterian without the Arts of <hi>Calumny. Omne imperium conſervatur iiſdem ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus quibus primò acquiritur:</hi> and when the Varniſh of Hypocriſie drops off, then the Tyranny ſupported by it muſt ſink. The Presbyterians began their Faction with <hi>Calumny,</hi> and they cannot now (if they would) lay it aſide. What could the Epiſcopal Clergy expect from their preſent Perſecutors, leſs than their Predeceſſors
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60080:48"/>
met with in that <hi>General Aſſembly?</hi> Who ſtuck at nothing, how monſtrous ſoever, to promote their end; when they forbear to breath, then it is that they forbear to <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Calumniate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When upon the late Revolution the Presbyterians were impowred more plainly to diſcover their Nature, the firſt thing they betook themſelves to was that of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling;</hi> and when they have now wearied themſelves (if they can be wearied of what is ſo natural to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)</hi> and expoſed their own Reputation by invading that of other Mens, they muſt yet goe on, not that they find this Method ſucceſsful, but becauſe they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; and it is enough for the Reader to know that they cannot name three of the Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived for Immoralities, after all their Inſidious Arts, Libellings, and Clamours ſince the Revolution.</p>
            <p>But to make the Villany of that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly,</hi> I lately named a little <note place="margin">Anno 1638.</note> more conſpicuous, I deſire the Reader may remember a very memorable Story. It is this, The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Biſhops were proved guilty of all the Crimes that were imputed to them, by <hi>ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and therefore they inſerted the names of ſeveral <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and others, in their Sentences, as Witneſſes of the Libels. And in their Sentence againſt the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Spotſwood,</hi> the <hi>Laird of Balfour,</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> was named as a Witneſs, whereas this <hi>Honeſt Gentleman</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any thing of the matter; and all the time of the Sitting of that <hi>Mock Aſſembly,</hi> he had never been from his own Houſe, which is at leaſt <hi>threeſcore Miles</hi>

To which the <hi>Miniſter</hi> answered, that he knew well enough he was <hi>not a Witneſs,</hi> but the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> had inſerted his name, and he durſt not but Read as they had ordered. Now let the World judge what an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> this was, and what Credit ought thoſe Enemies of Mankind and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ever to have, after ſuch a palpable Wickedneſs; that when they had charged the <hi>Fathers of the Church</hi> with ſuch Abominations, they ſhould preſume to abuſe the names of <hi>Particular Gentlemen,</hi> as Witneſſes of their own inventions.</p>
            <p>After this piece of undeniable Hiſtory, I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, whether any Modeſt Man thinks it neceſſary, that a particular anſwer ſhould be returned to the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Libel againſt the unſtained Reputation of that <hi>Pious, Prudent, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Loyal Martyr Archbiſhop Sharp,</hi> who cannot be named, but to the <hi>diſgrace of the Scotch Presbyterians.</hi> I need not upon this occaſion run out into Tragical Exclamations againſt their Impudence,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60080:49"/>
the more they Lye, the more true they are to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Party. They cannot be more kind to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation than they were to his Life, <hi>whom they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murdered, and whoſe Aſſaſſines were magnified in their Pamphlets.</hi> And <note place="margin">

We dare him, and all his Aſſociates, to anſwer what Mr. <hi>Sheilds</hi> has Written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Affair: my meaning is, that this <hi>effort</hi> of their Villany was not the reſult of private Paſſion, but the avowed and juſt Conſequence of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then let their Patrons tell me if they meet with any thing worſe in the Morals of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that are every where ſo juſtly expoſed. They agree in their Notions, but exceed them far by their Bawling, Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Buffoonry. The Jeſuit is Mannerly and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, but the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian ſeems to act by the mechanism of his Nature.</p>
            <p>Slanders and Calumny, being thus Authorized by the Aſſembly, it was no wonder to ſee their Leading Men Practiſe the ſame Villanies; therefore it is that you find Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> Gravely and Maliciouſly, accuſe the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the ſame Crimes, that the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> accuſed them of, in his Preface to <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> which I cannot Cite more particularly, having no Books by me.</p>

Secondly, Such as are Strangers to our affairs, muſt remember that this Trade of Libelling the Clergy is no Reflection upon our Country. For the whole Body of the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Centuries of Scandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters complained of to the Parliament, Anno 1646.</note> were thus maliciously aſſaulted, and all the Crimes Libelled againſt them, that their Enemies could invent. And if ſuch an illuſtrious Body of Eccleſiaſticks were thus rudely treated, can the Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under their preſent Miſeries and Oppreſſions, expect fairer Quarters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I deſire the Reader to conſider with how much Rudeneſs and Ignorance, this <hi>unknown Lampooner</hi> beſpatters <hi>the preſent Clergy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the Laity of her Communion.</hi> It is no part of my buſineſs to tranſcribe his Characters <note n="*" place="margin">You may meet with them at length Page 4. of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.</note>, if he had aſſaulted only ſome private Men, in ſome remote Corners of our Country, he might be thought only to defend his own Party, but when he foams nothing but Spite and Rancour, and Violence, againſt all Men of whatever Rank, Nation, or Dignity, I again wiſh the unbyaſſed Reader to tell me if this Man ſhould be particularly anſwered. It is not poſſible for him to hide his Nature, the paltry cruptions of his Choler are ungovernable. He ſeems to forget his own deſign (which was <hi>to make the</hi> Scotch <hi>Clergy odious in</hi> England) he accuſes <hi>them</hi> before whom he Pleads, as much as <hi>thoſe</hi> who were the firſt Objects of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>

But this is not enough, he attacks not only our prime Nobility and Gentry, but all our Kings ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. I am alraid I have troubled you too much, and therefore I make haſte in a word or two, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Characters he gives of particular men, as far as I know them.</p>
            <p>Some he accuſes as guilty of groſs Immoralities, that were actually for ſuch Immoralities depoſed and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Superiors,</hi> ſuch were <hi>Dean Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, Ninian Paterſon, John Anderſon</hi> of <hi>Terregles,</hi> and <hi>Kockburn</hi> of <hi>St. Bothens.</hi> And is it not very ſtrange that he ſhould accuſe the juſtice of our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Superiors,</hi> becauſe of ſuch vitious perſons as were actually cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by their Authority. So it ſeems in this man's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they are accountable for them whom they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well as for others. Others he names that are not at all of my acquaintance, and it is nothing but what I expected, that the Agents of the party would employ their little Miſſionaries to gather Stories from all corners of the Country amongſt their Diſciples.</p>
            <p>The firſt that he endeavours to abuſe, is Dr. <hi>Paterſon Archbiſhop of Glaſgow,</hi> and that in a ſtile becoming the true race of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> I mean <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> who have no other precedents in Hiſtory, than theſe <hi>impure Sectaries,</hi> whoſe lives were a <hi>diſgrace</hi> to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as a <hi>reproach</hi> to Religion. The VVorld is not yet ſo beſotted as to think that the <hi>Archbiſhop of Glaſgow</hi> needs particular anſwers. Indeed, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Author has pretty well ſecured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt ſuch Apologies: his accuſations are ſo <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60080:51"/>
that no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt name them; and therefore he has hid himſelf in a Cloud of Forgeries, that none can repeat <hi>but a Devil,</hi> and none could invent <hi>but the Author. The Arch-biſhops Character, Merit and Parts,</hi> cannot but draw upon him the <hi>Odium</hi> of the whole Party. And I wiſh with all my heart, they had not try'd his patience by <hi>more terrible methods,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Paſquils</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

            <p>The next of my Acquaintance is <hi>Mr. Brown Miniſter of Dryſdale,</hi> and the fooliſh Notes that he makes him to have preach'd, is a pure Forgery, a Lye in which there is not any mixture of truth. His connivances of the <hi>Adultery of Lockerby with Archbald Johnſtone of Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn's Wife,</hi> is of the ſame ſtamp with the former, for he proſecuted the <hi>Adulterer</hi> ſo vigorouſly, that he got him <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and continued ſo under the <hi>higheſt Cenſures of the Church,</hi> untill the evidences of his <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> obliged the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to abſolve him.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph he mentions <hi>Mr. Cant,</hi> whom he names <hi>underling</hi> to <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and whom he rails at again. <hi>Mr. Andrew Cant</hi> was never <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60080:51"/>
In the next Paragraph to Mr. <hi>Cant,</hi> he mentions ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals who had their Miſſion and Education from the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> and if they preach'd ſuch things, we know to whom they ow it; many of 'em are dead long ſince, and it was not poſſible upon the reſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, ſo ſpeedily to recover the <hi>Clergy</hi> from <hi>Presbyterian fooleries,</hi> for tho they complied with <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> ſuch as grew old under Presbytery, ſpoke ſtill the Language of <hi>Aſhdod:</hi> for being enjoin'd under Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to preach perpetually againſt <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the <hi>Malignants:</hi> they ſtumbled now and then into their former blunderings; and it is pleaſant to ſee this Man accuſe the Church for the ſayings of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who though they complied with <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> upon the <hi>reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Government;</hi> yet ſtill they wore the marks of their former ſlavery in their Phraſe as well as in their Faces, ſuch are moſt of them he names, <hi>Pag.</hi> 66. 67.</p>
            <p>But the moſt impetuous Efforts of his malice are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd againſt <hi>Dr. Canaries.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> told me, That theſe were not the firſt Eſſays of their Civility towards him; for he being employed by ſome of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> to repreſent their grievances at Court, the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> from that very moment fixed their Eye upon him, and proſecuted him with all the Calumnies that their fury and common practices in ſuch caſes could ſuggeſt unto them. But ſtill they found the <hi>Doctor</hi> too hard for them, and the wiſe Men amongſt them have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently own'd to him, that as they hated ſuch Methods, ſo they highly diſapprov'd the particular injuſtice that was done to the <hi>Doctor.</hi> Mr. <hi>Spalding</hi> who was <hi>Clerk</hi> to the firſt pretended <hi>Aſſembly</hi> after the <hi>Revolution,</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60080:52"/>
is now one of the Preachers of <hi>Dundee,</hi> was put upon ſearching after ſuch a Story; but (as he confeſt to Mr. <hi>Carſtairs)</hi> he found there was nothing to be made of it. And the <hi>Doctor</hi> appeals, both to Mr. <hi>Carſtairs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spalding</hi> for the truth of this, and he doubts not but that they will readily do him juſtice in it, and and it is very odd that this Libeller ſhould accuſe him of new, when he ſtood two Trials before the Privy Council, when it was highly Presbyterian, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> with the greateſt rigor: and another before a <hi>Presbyterian Synod,</hi> in which all the Members except three Miniſters, and three ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders, were mighty violent againſt him. And in both theſe Trials he ſo baffled his Accuſers, that the Judicatories treated him with ſpecial Honour, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him from all the Calumnies that were charged upon him, and reproved his Enemies for their malicious libelling of him. And this Narrative the <hi>Doctor</hi> can prove by authentick Extracts, which he has in his own hands. So that the <hi>underling Pedlars</hi> amongſt the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> may write what they pleaſe, 'tis not now in their power to hurt him. And the <hi>Doctor</hi> further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Presbytery of <hi>Selkirk,</hi> when he was there, how readily they would have received him into their <hi>Communion,</hi> ſuch a particular eſteem they had for him. The Story that's <hi>metamorphos'd</hi> by this Accuſer into a prodigious villany is no more than this, That the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> when he was a Boy at the Univerſity, fell into the Company of two other <hi>Young Gentlemen</hi> at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and they three walking about the Fields in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, met in the Evening with ſome Women that were watching in the Fields the Linnen that they had waſh'd, the other two Gentlemen accoſted ſome of theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60080:52"/>
by amorous and fooliſh Embraces, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> over hearing one of them ſqueak, he called them back, and chid them for what they had done, and told them if there was any noiſe made about it, he would declare he had no acceſſion to it. And when this triſling Story was examined before the Presbytery of <hi>Dundee,</hi> both the Women, and the other two Gentlemen acquitted the Doctor, and conſtantly owned that he had no ſhare in it at all. And this is remarkable, that there was no Circumſtance relating to it, but what was examined by Mr. <hi>Rate, then Miniſter of Dundee,</hi> an <hi>Indulg'd Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Doctor</hi> go out of the Nation till two years after that, upon occaſion of his Fathers death. By this Story one may ſee the Malice, and indefatigable Induſtry of that Sect, it was the <hi>Doctors</hi> early fate to be accuſed by the Presbyterians; and though no part of the Story be within any poſſible degrees of Truth: yet the Reader may ſee, how the Libeller Vapours, as if he had the beſt and clearest Evidence. And ſince the <hi>Doctor</hi> has lived eighteen or nineteen years beyond the reach of Calumny, blameleſs, to the Conviction of his Enemies, how fooliſh, and how impious is it to accuſe him.</p>
            <p>As for his being Popiſh he has given an account of that in the Preface to his Sermon Printed at <hi>London</hi> 1686; but that he was a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> is a Lye, for he was never of any Order in <hi>that Church,</hi> and his Zeal againſt Popery did ſufficiently appear, and all that know him, know his Innocence, as to all the malicious Slanders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented againſt him.</p>
            <p>The following Paragraph, pag. 72. mentions Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> commonly called <hi>Doctor Monro.</hi> I am ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60080:53"/>
with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and he ſays ſo little of him, that I may be allowed to examine it particularly. Firſt, He's commonly called Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> and the meaning of this is one of two, either a <hi>Fanatick Squeamiſhneſs</hi> that will not allow the Title of <hi>Doctor</hi> to any Clergy Man; or, an inſinuation that he was <hi>not graduated Doctor in the Univerſity.</hi> If the firſt be intended, 'tis but a piece of <hi>Quakeriſm, the 4th. day of the Week commonly called</hi> Wedneſday. If the ſecond be meant, he was not called <hi>Doctor</hi> until the <hi>Month of February</hi> 1682, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Degree in the <hi>Theological Schools of the New College at St.</hi> Andrews <hi>from the Learned Doctor</hi> Comri, <hi>then Vice Chancellour of the Univerſity.</hi>

            <p>Our Libeller adds that he is a mighty Agent for the Party. If he has any qualities to recommend him, that of a good Agent is none of them. And again, he is repreſented to be one of the <hi>Epiſcopal Pamphleteers.</hi> I do not know what he means by this, unleſs he charges him with publiſhing the <hi>Presbyterian Inquiſition.</hi> It may be he was the Author of that <hi>Narrative,</hi> which he is ready to juſtifie if ever he is fairly tryed (excepting ſtill ſome Marginal Notes relating to Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> to which he had no acceſſion) and this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> contains ſo many ſteps of <hi>Presbyterian Knavery and diſingenuity,</hi> that if he pleaſe he may let it alone.</p>
            <p>But the ſaddest blow againſt the <hi>Doctor</hi> is this, that it is well known that he <note place="margin">Pag. 72.</note> Rode for ſeveral years in the <hi>Pope's Guards,</hi> but I ask, to whom is this known? <hi>To the Presbyterians only, who know all ſecrets, and diſcover Plots in the World of the Moon?</hi> But I muſt tell you that for the time the <hi>Doctor</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60080:53"/>
was abroad, he was never out of <hi>France,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of it, nor nearer to <hi>Rome</hi> than about four hundred and eighty <hi>Italian Miles.</hi> It were more eaſie for this Accuſer to have Copyed the former Libel contained in the <hi>Presbyterian Inquiſition,</hi> than thus to truſt to his own invention.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> comes next, if he mean Mr. <hi>James Gray, Miniſter of Kelſo,</hi> he is remarkable for his <hi>Modeſty, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Veracity,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and he is Charactered in an oppoſite Style, by ſuch as neither know him, nor the vertuos that recommend him to his Brethren.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Henry, Miniſter of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorphen,</hi> is a Man of <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 78.</note> and his other qualifications are undeniable, and he is not capable of any ſuch extravagance of <hi>Paſſion</hi> as this common Accuſer charges him with.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Alexander Ramſay, Miniſter of the Old Kirk of Edinburgh,</hi> was driven from his Reſidence in the Weſt by the <hi>Covenanted Zealots,</hi> and lived ſince in the Eye of the Nation, beloved of all that know him, whether we conſider his blamleſs Life, or Miniſterial Sufficiencies.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Annan Dean of Edinburgh</hi> was known all <hi>Scotland</hi> over, and there was ſcarcely ever a more innocent Man in <hi>Britain,</hi> and he needs no Apology.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis pleaſant enough to obſerve, that in all this Liſt he hath not named <hi>the Author of Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence, nor the Publiſher.</hi>

I have given you a ſhort account of ſuch as I know, for ſuch as I am not acquainted with, I have no reaſon to believe this Libeller. For if they were never ſo guilty, they muſt have other Accuſers than Men of ſuch Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Conſciences. His Civility to the Church of <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>England</hi> alone, makes it appear how little he is to be regarded. He begins his Book with a <note n="†" place="margin">Printed for <hi>Tho. Anderſon</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi> 1693.</note> Lye in the <hi>Title Page,</hi> that it might be all of a piece. As for any Shadows of Argument that are here and there ſcattered, if they be of any weight they ſhall be conſidered when the other Pamphlets, that are threatned by the Party, are made publick.</p>
