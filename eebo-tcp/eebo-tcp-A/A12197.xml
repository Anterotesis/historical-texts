            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The reason of Gods dealing

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2556:18"/>
                     <hi>himselfe;</hi> God will not lose the

will be knowne to be God <hi>onely

<hi>then</hi> especially <hi>when</hi> wicked men

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in regard of his
<hi>tender</hi> care over his children;
they are as the apple of his eye;
and as they are very <hi>neare,</hi> so they
are very <hi>deare</hi> to him; they cost
him deare, they are his <hi>Iewels,</hi>
and hee gave a <hi>Iewell</hi> of infinite
price for them: <hi>he</hi> is interessed

If they bee in any misery, Gods
bowells yearne for them, hee is
alwayes awake and never slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth;
as we see in the parable,
the <hi>Master</hi> of the house waked,
while the <hi>servants</hi> slept. Gods
eye is upon them for good, hee
hath them written in the <hi>palmes
of his hands,</hi> Christ carryest them
alwayes in his <hi>breast:</hi> Christ

the <hi>Churches</hi> to further its best

                  <p>Another reason is <hi>the insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of the enemies</hi> whose <hi>fiercenesse

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, Gods children will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
give him <hi>no rest;</hi> when he seemes
to sleepe they will awake him
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2556:19"/>
with their prayers; <hi>They will not

<hi>so,</hi> and yet doe well at last; but
who tells them this? Is it not a

not like <hi>thunder</hi> and <hi>lightning</hi>

                  <p>To conclude this point, when
we are tempted to any hurtfull
designe, let us look upon Christ
and that great project for our
redemption undertaken by him,
and reason thus with our selves;
Hath he plotted and wrought
my salvation, and shall I plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>him</hi> in his <hi>members?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beseech you stirre up your
hearts to conceive and bring
forth good purposes; Satan is
an enemy to all strong <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and masculine <hi>conceptions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring
to kill them in the
very birth. Alas, how many
good thoughts are conceived
whilest the word is <hi>hearing,</hi>
which yet prove abortive and
sticke in the birth? How few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2556:30"/>
come to their due ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and perfection? I am sure
our incouragements to <hi>good,</hi> are
farre more, than our incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to evill; we serve a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
master, and for better wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<hi>they</hi> may prosper for a time
but nothing is more wretched
than the happinesse of wicked
men; it <hi>first</hi> hardens them,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 32.</note> and
<hi>then</hi> destroyes them.</p>
                  <p>Our onely way is, 1. to get <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

wee shall take and <hi>beare fruit</hi>

and looke with a single eye

                  </p>
                  <p>That which we should espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
labour for is, 1. to bee
good in our selves, and 2. to
doe all the good we can to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

application, sutable to the

the <hi>text</hi> are as parallel as may
be: <hi>Our</hi> gun-powder-plotters
were as pregnant in <hi>mischiefe</hi> as
ever <hi>these.</hi> For <hi>conception;</hi> It
could not but come from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the <hi>Vault;</hi> there was the
very qnintessence of devillish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in it; Sathan emptyed all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2556:36"/>
his bowells (as it were) in this
project. If all the devills in hell
were set a worke to devise the
like they could hardly doe it.
There was scarce from the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, a designe
more prodigious and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
of greater <hi>depth</hi> and extent
of villany: Were not this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary
Commemoration of it,</hi>
posterity would hardly beleeve
that a <hi>plot</hi> so <hi>hollish</hi> could be hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the hearts of men, of
<hi>English</hi> men, of <hi>Catholike</hi> men, as
they would be termed, of men
so borne withall notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their dangerous correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with forraine enemies, and
but halfe subject, their better
parts (their spirits) being subject
to another visible <hi>head,</hi> who can
untye the bond of <hi>Allegiance</hi> at
his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Neither did they onely <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
this hellish wickednesse,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2556:36"/>
but were <hi>bigge</hi> of it, and kept it
close many moneths, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselves in the same as
monstrous and mishapen as it
was; there wanted neither <hi>wit,</hi>
nor <hi>counsell,</hi> nor <hi>combination,</hi> nor
secret <hi>incouragement</hi> to effect it.</p>
                  <p>Nay it was an <hi>holy</hi> villany,
sealed with <hi>oathes, sacrament,</hi> and
all the bonds of <hi>secrecy</hi> that
could be invented; Oh horrible
prophanation, to set <hi>Gods</hi> seale
to <hi>Satans</hi> plot; But God who
delighteth to confound all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
<hi>attempts,</hi> discovered
it when it should have come to
the <hi>birth,</hi> and so it proved but
the <hi>untimely fruit</hi> of a woman.</p>
                  <p>They <hi>brought forth a lye,</hi> for
whereas they intended to have
blowne up <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
Church-men, &amp; Church, States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yea the whole State it
selfe, all at once, without any
warning to prepare themselves
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2556:37"/>
for another world, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
missed of this, but brought
<hi>that</hi> ruine upon themselves
which they intended to others;
whereas they thought for ever
to have established their <hi>(Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
shall I call it, or <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
or) <hi>superstition,</hi> they have by this
meanes made it more odious
than ever before; As the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Gentleman could say,
that though he was not able to
dispute, yet hee had two <hi>arguments</hi>
against Popery, <hi>equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and the <hi>Gun-powder-treason;</hi>
But they turne it off easily (as
they thinke,) Alas it was but
the plot of a company of unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
gentlemen; It was our
happinesse that they were unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
whereas if it had succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
well, they would have had
other termes for it; successefull
<hi>villany</hi> goeth for <hi>vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, <hi>the net is broken,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2556:37"/>
we are delivered; God thought
of us when wee thought not of
him, and <hi>awaked</hi> for us when we
were <hi>asleepe</hi> (here is a place for
<hi>behold</hi>) for what a miserable face
of things would there have been
if their plot had succeeded?</p>
                  <p>Now what returne shall wee
make for all this? <hi>they</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>mischiefe,</hi> let us conceive
<hi>praise,</hi> and travell of holy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to give up our selves to
God, who hath given us our
King, our State, yea our selves
to our selves; He hath given us
our lives more than once every
one of us in particular, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the last heavy visitation;
but had it not beene better for
many in regard; of their owne
particular, to have beene swept
away in that deluge, than to live
longer to treasure up further
wrath to themselves: Many are
not content to goe to hell <hi>alone,</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:2556:38"/>
but they will draw as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as they can into their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
here, and torment <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:</hi>
Oh beloved, the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of such, is but a reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to further iudgement:
What good got the King of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
by being delivered <hi>once,</hi>

What got <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

What are all our remporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
if wee live still in sin,

hath been derived unto us from
those that went before who

                  <p>We see all countryes round

that which God careth most for

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2556:40"/>
if we suffer (as much as in us ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
to take any detriment, God
may justly make us the spectacles
of his wrath <hi>to others,</hi> as others
have beene <hi>to us:</hi> Beloved, God
hath a <hi>cause</hi> and a <hi>people</hi> in the

more than all the world besides
let us therefore <hi>owne</hi> Gods <hi>cause</hi>

prove <hi>the better side.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beseech you consider, what
hurt have wee ever had by the
<hi>reformation</hi> of Religion? hath
it come naked unto us? hath it
not beene attended with <hi>peace</hi>
and <hi>prosperity?</hi> hath God <hi>beene
a barren wildernesse to us?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jerem. 2. 31.</note> hath
not God beene a wall <hi>of fire</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

beene, it is not the <hi>water</hi> that
compasseth our <hi>Iland</hi> could have

<hi>us:</hi> Otherwise (trust to it)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2556:41"/>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>truth</hi> will leave us,
No nation under heaven hath
so much cause to say <hi>Behold,</hi> as
we have; Men are ready upon
all occasions to be sensible of <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
grievances, (as in <hi>Solomons</hi>
time <hi>gold</hi> was as <hi>stones in the
street</hi>) but we should be sensible
of the <hi>spiritual</hi> favours we enjoy;
If wee looke upon other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
abroad, what nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven hath the like cause
to blesse God for <hi>Religion,</hi> for
<hi>Prince,</hi> for <hi>peace, &amp;c.</hi> as we have?
Beloved, we cannot better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
of our <hi>King, Church,</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> than to give up our lives
to God who hath thus blessed
us; The greatest enemies of a
Church and State, are those
that provoke the <hi>highest Majesty
of heaven,</hi> by obstinate courses
against the <hi>light</hi> that shineth in
their owne hearts. It is seriously
to bee considered what <hi>Samuel</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2556:41"/>
saith to the people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if not for love of <hi>our selves,</hi>
yet for the love of <hi>our King, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and <hi>State,</hi> let us take heed
of provoking courses, and take
heed of tyring the patience of
God over-long; To conclude
all, it is <hi>prayer</hi> that gets, but
<hi>thankfulnesse</hi> witnessed by <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
that keepes blessings; and
<hi>what</hi> can our thoughts devise,
our tongues utter, or our lives
expresse <hi>better</hi> than the <hi>praise</hi> of
our good God that even loadeth
us with his benefits? that so
God may delight still to shew
himselfe unto us, in the wayes
of his mercy, &amp; think thoughts
of love towards us, and dwell
amongst us to the worlds end.</p>

He will not preserve me

that we are delivered from the

                  <p>Let us then be thankfull, that

And hath it not been thus with

of Israel in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the

Besides God often awakens
the consciences of his children
and exerciseth them with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

Nay, rather then those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

                     <hi>O Lord rebuke mee

the troubles which a child of

when the <hi>body</hi> is vexed and <hi>spirit</hi>

paines of the very damned in hell.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of this dispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of God are, 1. because we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
are so desperately addicted to

put con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us from these holds (by casting

shall never know what it is to

all other props are puld away;
and when the streame of things

when was this? even when hee

God with <hi>strong cryes</hi> and teares
in a deepe distresse,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> and was also
heard in that which he feared:
strong troubles force from the

shewes, in prosperity,

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Besides, it is meet that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of mens hearts should bee
discovered: for when all is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
we know not the falsehood
of our owne hearts. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-value
their strength as <hi>Peter:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 33.</note>
others underprize themselves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2556:51"/>
and of the gifts and graces of

of God therfore judgeth it meet
that there should bee times of

and our selves may know, what
good or ill is in us: what sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or loosenesse remaines in
our hearts. When therefore
we are wanting in fanning our

fanne into his hand.</p>
                  <p>It is likewife behoovefull,
<hi>that false Brethren may be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi>
Afflictions are wel called
tryalls; because then it is known
what metall men are made of:
whether Pure of Reprobate sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
thinke it not strange then,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2556:52"/>
when our estate seemes despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
it is but with us after the

why should we have a severed

this, that <hi>God, as he suffers
his children to fall into the Lions

and that hee never leaves <hi>his</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in extremity) but in fit
case of soule, to receive the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
comfort, and to render him
the greatest glory, for then it is
knowne to be Gods worke; our
extremity is his opportunity:
God will especially shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at such a time, and make it
appeare that the Church stands
not by mans strength: When
Christians are at a losse, and
know not which way to turne
themselves, then is God nearest

                  <p>And this the Lord doth both

                  <p>Sometimes God speakes of

because indeed the will is mans

and therefore the Scripture
speakes, as though the duty
came from us, because the

as they issue from a higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;

are agents and patients in all

thanke our ill in doing, for our ill

good men are either <hi>hurt</hi> or
<hi>vexed</hi> at it. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>The Lord will deliver
me from every evill worke.</hi> This a
Christian should especially la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for, that God in all things
would keepe him free from sin.
Yea this differenceth a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
from another man; take a
carnall man when hee is like to
fall into danger, he studies how
to get out of suffering evill, not
how to prevent doing evill; hee
plots, devises, and intangles
himselfe in his owne wit, and
makes the matter worse by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation,
and such like sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courses, as we might learne
from the Papists, if we had not
enough from our owne breast.
But <hi>Pauls</hi> care was to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2556:64"/>
from <hi>evill workes:</hi> For a
man indeed is never overcome
(let him be never so vexed in the
world by any) till his conscience
be crackt. If his conscience and
his cause stand upright, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
still,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>In all these things wee
are more than conquerors,</hi> saith
the Apostle. The meaning is,
<hi>sufferings</hi> cannot quell our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
they cannot staine our
conscience, they doe not hurt
the cause, but it gets victory in
despight of them: so that our
courage is undaunted, and our
conscience abides unstained:
let it be our care therefore, to
take heed of evill workes.
Looke into the world and see
what is the care of most men
we converse with, oh, if they
can get such a place, if they can
get such an estate! I, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had without finful abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without cracking of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2556:64"/>
and unlawfull engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
O say they, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
God will pardon all, I care
not so I may have my wish;
this is the heart of many grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
persons that are not led
with heavenly respects. But
take a Christian, and he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beg, doe any thing in the
world, than doe a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
his profession, unbeseeming
<hi>the Gospell,</hi> or that high calling
whereunto hee is called. <hi>Shall
such a man as I doe this?</hi> hee will
not, and therefore his care is to
take heed of ill workes: for
then he is sure to have God his
friend, who hath riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
enough for him, because
<hi>the earth is the Lords and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 1.</note> this is the care of
a judicious wel instructed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                  <p>But marke the (<hi>Extent) from
every evill worke:</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:2556:65"/>
care is not for <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> but that
God would keepe him <hi>from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
evill worke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
                  <p>Because he that truly hates
one sinne,<note place="margin">Why S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evill worke.</note> will hate all the kinds
of it, both come from the same
love of God: he that loves God
as he should, will hate whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God hates: <hi>and have respect
to all Gods Commandements</hi> (as
the Psalmist speakes) partiall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 128</note>
is indeed no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at all: for he that obeyes
one, and not another, obeyes
not simply because of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
to yeeld obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>him:</hi> but onely to satisfie his
owne corrupt nature, picking
and choosing what pleases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which belongs not to an
inferiour, but to a superiour to
doe: And therefore, such make
themselves <hi>gods,</hi> in that they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
out easie things that doe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2556:65"/>
not oppose their lusts, which
are not against their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. and therein perhaps
they will supererogate, and doe
more than they need, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will have a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with God, that he should
quit with them for other things:
I have done that, and therefore
he must beare with mee in this.
Oh, but there is no compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here; a man is never so strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but he may escape without
sinne: there is no pretence will
serve: but we must abstaine
<hi>from every evill worke:</hi> Satan
keepes many men in his snare by
this, and so he hath them safe in
one sinne, hee cares not: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will suffer them to <hi>heare,</hi>
read, and pray, &amp;c. holding
them fast in one raigning sinne,
wherein hee will let them alone
till the time of some great <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
or death; and then he will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2556:66"/>
roare upon them. Oh beloved,
wee cannot provide worse for
our owne soules, than to cherish
a purpose of living in any <hi>one sin,</hi>
for that is enough for the devill
to hold his possession in us by,
and at the houre of death to
claime us for his owne. <hi>If wee
regard any iniquity in our heart,
the Lord will not heare our prayers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note>
I beseech you therefore let us
labour to have cleare conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
freeing our selves from a
purpose to live in any sinne;
that in all our slips and failings
we may say with an honest heart
My purpose was not to do this,
but to refraine <hi>from wickednesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, he speakes of this for
the time to come; the Lord <hi>will</hi>
deliver me from evill: <hi>A true
Christian is as carefull to avoide
sinne for the time to come, as to bee
freed from the guilt of sinnes past.
Iudas</hi> may desire to have his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2556:66"/>
conscience freed from former
sinnes, but <hi>Indas</hi> cannot desire
to be a good man for the time
to come. Nothing argues a
good conscience more than this.
The most wicked wretch that
breathes, may desire to have his
conscience stilled, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any purpose or power
to abstaine from sinne; but like
a <hi>dogge</hi> (after he hath disgorged
himselfe) returne to his vomit
againe. True Repentance is a
turning from former evills, to a
contrary good. Our griefe no
further yeelds comfort of sound
repentance, then it hath care at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for prevention of sinne;
according to that which Christ
said to the woman taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
<hi>Goe, and sinne no more,</hi>
and as <hi>David</hi> prayes <hi>Purge me O
Lord and cleanse me</hi> (but withall)
<hi>establish me with thy free spirit</hi> for
the time to come: As if hee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2556:67"/>
should say, Lord I know it is
not in man to order his owne
wayes, I desire not the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my sinnes, that there by
I might with more liberty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thy Majesty, but with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
grace, I begge preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
grace; No false heart can
move such a desire as this to God
A gracious heart that prayes
aright, prayes as well that God
would preserve him from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sinne, as forgive him his
former sinnes. It is a ridiculous
thing of the Papists, to make
confession of a sinne which they
meane to commit; as some late
Traitors confessed such and such
things which they were to act,
&amp; were straight absolved for it:
So your cursed <hi>duelists</hi> that will
<hi>pray</hi> and <hi>repent</hi> when they meane
presently to fall one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Is this repentance, when
a man is inveigled with the sin
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2556:67"/>
hee meanes to commit: and
cannot overcome himselfe in
the case of revenge? Doe these
men thinke they repent? No
certainely, <hi>repentance</hi> is of sinnes
past, and the carriage of every
true Christian is to avoide evill
for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is here a perpetna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Act; the Lord <hi>will</hi> deliver
me <hi>still</hi> from every evill worke:
whence you see that <hi>In every evil
worke we are tempted to, we need de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
Grace, as to every good
worke assisting Grace.</hi> Indeed our
whole life (if we look upwards)
is nothing but a deliverance, but
if we looke to our selves, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but danger and a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
and therefore wee have
need of a deliverance. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a temptation turnes over a
great man? as sometimes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
winde turnes over your
mighty gallies. We see this in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2556:68"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and (if God
leave us to our selves) even the
strongest man in the world, how
soone is he overturned? in the
midst of sinsull occasions, how
ready are wee to joyne with
them, and betray our owne
soules?</p>
                  <p>But from the whole, take it
as it comes from God altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the truth is thus much, <hi>that
a Christian, who is privy to his own
soule, of good intentions to abstaine
from all ill for the present, may
presume that God will assist him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all ill workes for the time to
come.</hi> I say a Christian that hath
his conscience telling him, that
he meanes to be better, and is
not in league with any sin, may
beleeve this for the time to
come, that God will keepe him
from evill workes. I speak this,
because many who are yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
thinke it in vaine to strive;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2556:68"/>
for they shall never bee better.
What doest thou talke man?
hast thou a minde to be better?
God will meet thee one time or
other: is thy will at liberty?
he that gives thee the will, will
also give thee the deed: is not
this the Promise that God will
deliver thee from every evill
worke? and therefore away
with all discouragements.</p>
                  <p>O but <hi>There are sonnes of</hi> Anak
<hi>mighty Giants,</hi>

thou wilt not be better: thou
art in league with some secret

those that reprove thee of it,
thine owne conscience tells thee
that thy heart is naught: for if
thou wouldst set thy selfe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God in truth, assuredly he
would deliver thy soule. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2556:69"/>
therefore the Apostle to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
such doubts, speakes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<hi>from evill workes,</hi> as
comming from God.</p>
                  <p>But some may object,<note place="margin">Object.</note>

as that God will deliver us from

from such kinde of sins

Now God will deliver his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <p>Nay, <hi>Sometimes he will deliver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                  <p>If a King or a great man
should say to an inferiour, Goe

and safeguard, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
is this to a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <p>But put case wee cannot bee
preserved from <hi>death,</hi> (for so it
was here with the Apostle, hee
dyed a bloody death) Why
let us observe his blessed carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in all this, and doe likewise:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2556:73"/>
I regard not that, saith hee, doe
your worst, God will preserve
me still. So it should be the
bent of a Christians soule to
come to God with this limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in his faith and in his prayer:
Lord if thou wilt not deliver
me from <hi>suffering</hi> ill, preserve
me from <hi>doing</hi> ill: If thou wilt
not preserve mee from death,
preserve me from sinfull <hi>workes.</hi>
This we may build on, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God will preserve us in life,
or if we die, he will preserve us
in death to his heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And <hi>sometimes God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
by not preserving from
death:</hi> for indeed death keepes
a man from all danger whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
hee is out of all gun-shot
when he is once dead: death is
a deliverance and a preservation

What will a man care for cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

wee passe unknowne in the

doe so: God will preserve us to

that we suffer and endure here,
it is but a fitting for that place.
<hi>David</hi> was a King <hi>annointed</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

So wee are apointed Kings as

of heaven, till at

thither.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the use of al uses:
What is the former use which
<hi>Paul</hi> makes of the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
Gods delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? The Lord hath
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2556:82"/>
delivered me; aud therefore he
<hi>will</hi> deliver me: but what use
doth he make of this, that God
will deliver him? <hi>To glorisie
God:</hi> here is the end of all ends,
<hi>to praise God;</hi> happy wee when
<hi>Gods</hi> end and <hi>our</hi> end meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>Hee</hi> hath made all for
his owne glory, and when wee
with a single eye can ayme at
that too, what a sweet harmony
is there?</p>
                  <p>To direct us in this duty in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> praising God, let us with <hi>Paul</hi>
(for I goe no surther than the
text leads me) seriously medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on Gods mercies, both past
and to come; nothing moves
thankfulnesse more than this.
A Christian when hee lookes
backwards hath comfort; and
when he lookes forward, he sees
comfort still: for preservation,
and Kingdomes, and Crownes
abide for him. If a man would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2556:82"/>
praise God therefore, let him
consider how graciously God
hath dealt with him: Hee hath
delivered me already by Jesus
Christ, from sinne and eternall
wrath; and he will deliver mee
from every evill worke to <hi>come,</hi>
that may indanger my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thinke of these things, and
see whether your hearts can bee
cold and dead or no; see if your
spirits can be streightned. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
both heart and mouth
will be full, thou canst not but
say in the apprehension of Gods
mercies: <hi>To him bee glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Consider the kindes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

<hi>positive or privative: spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi>

the Lord will deliver mee
from every evill worke. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,</hi>
the Lord in this life will
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2556:83"/>
keepe me: <hi>spirituall,</hi> he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from the power of sin:
<hi>Eternall, Hee will preserve mee to
his heavenly Kingdome.</hi> Thinke
forward or backwards: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or inward: spirituall or

looke, tell me if you can doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then breake out with
the holy Apostle, in the praises
of so good a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And 3. <hi>Thinke of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all these: the greatnesse of
the deliverance from sinne, and
damnation.</hi> The Apostle to make
himselfe the more thankfull,
saith; he was delivered <hi>out of the
mouth of the Lion:</hi> he had large
apprehensions of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
So should we, beloved,
consider the greatnesse of the
misery we are in by nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
slaves of Satan, in danger
to slip into Hell every moment;
and when God hath secured us
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2556:83"/>
from this, thinke of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the benefit, <hi>a heavenly
kingdome.</hi> When we think not
only of the benefits, but of the
greatnesse of them; it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
incouragement to bee
thankfull. Labour then to have
a due and high esteeme of every
mercy. God hath brought us
out of <hi>darknesse into marvellous
light,</hi> saith the Apostle; <hi>Great is
the mystery of godlinesse,</hi> and <hi>the
unsearchable riches of his grace,</hi> he
had not words bigge enough to
expresse Gods goodnes: <hi>Oh the
heighth, and bredth, and depth,
and length of his love.</hi> When we
consider these dimensions, our
thankfulnesse must be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if you would bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
thankfull; <hi>Labour to have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and then you will sacrifice to

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2556:84"/>
                     <hi>graces, friends, abilities, &amp;c.</hi>
the meeke are fit to pray to God,
<hi>Seeke the Lord yee meeke of the

                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 2. 3.</note> and an humbled meeke
soule is the fittest to praise God
of any other; <hi>he that knowes he is
worthy of nothing, will blesse God
for any thing:</hi> he that knowes he
hath nothing in himselfe, will be
thankfull for the least measure
of grace: an humble soule is a
thankfull soule. We see it was
<hi>Pauls</hi> disposition here; he gives
all to God, which makes him so
breake out in praising his name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Againe, if wee would bee

Heaven upon Earth; <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be assured of salvation,</hi> and

course. The Papists that speake
against <hi>Assurance</hi> and <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
kill <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praising</hi> of
God. Shall a man praise God
for that which he doubts of? I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2556:84"/>
cannot tell whether God will
damne me or not, perhaps I am
but fitted as a sheepe to the
slaughter, &amp;c. how shall a man
praise God for any blessing hee
enjoyes, when these thoughts
are still with him? how shall a
man praise God for salvation,
when perhaps he shall not come
to it? how shall a man praise
God for that which perhaps he
may fall from, before hee die?
when perhaps hee is Gods to
day, and may be the Devills to
morrow? How can there bee
a hearty thankes, but when a
man can say, <hi>The Lord will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from every evill work,</hi> that
by mine owne weaknesse, and
Satans malice, I may occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
fall into, betwixt this and
<hi>Heaven?</hi> Therefore if we would
praise God as we should, let us
worke our hearts to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
assurance of Gods favour,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2556:85"/>
let us redeeme our precious
time, and every day set some

for heaven, which will

                  <p>Thus wee see out of <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
how we should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
here, to be in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

he who praiseth God is so much in

for hee is in that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and is Christ an eternall head?
an eternall King to rule me both

will extend my desires of his

and happy lawes: not
onely to have the Church in his

Church may flourish in those
that stand up when we are gone
the way of all flesh: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to declare the minde of
God, and his favours to us, and
our children, that they may
strengthen their experience,
with their fathers experience,
and say to God, Thou art the
God of my Fathers, therefore
be my God; those that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to places of dignity, should
consider that it is required at
their hands to labour, that there
should be meanes to continue
Religion, even to the worlds
end (if it may be) and to stoppe
all the breaches in this kinde.
And if it were possible, it were
to be wished that there were set
up some lights in all the darke
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2556:87"/>
corners of this Kingdome, that
might shine to those people
that sit in darknesse, and in the

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> One way is, <hi>to have a care that
there be no breaches made upon the
sound doctrine that is left unto us,
and hath beene sealed up by the
blood of so many Martyrs.</hi> Wee
had it dearely, it hath beene
taught by our forefathers, and
sealed with their blood; &amp; shall
we betray it? No, let us labour
to deliver it to our posterity,
from hand to hand, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ; and then wee
shall in effect (and not in word
onely) doe that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith
here, labour to glorifie God
for ever and ever, both in the
Church, and in heaven. Surely
those that will glorifie God in
heaven, hee will have them so
disposed, to glorifie him on
earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:2556:87"/>
It is a dangerous thing when
persons are naught; wee see
what comes of it (especially if
they be great:) It is said of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>
when God had forgiven
him his sinne, yet afterwards
God plagued the Kingdome for
the sinnes that <hi>Manasseh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:<note place="margin">2 Kings 24. 3.</note>
how can this bee? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he by his sinne (though he
repented, himselfe) yet set the
Kingdome in an evill frame.
And no question but hee had
naughty principles: and among
people that are given to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
if there bee any thing
in great men, it will goe to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
after them. So that when
Governours are naught, they
are not onely a poison to the
Church and State, while they
live, but the mischiefe of it is,
after and after still. And so it is
in the best things, if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be good, hee layes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2556:88"/>
of good for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in time to come, as well
as for his owne time.</p>
                  <p>How will it shame a man
when he shall thinke, I doe these
things now, but what will Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
thinke of me? what will
be the remembrance of it when
I am gone? then my name will
stinke. The wicked Emperour
<hi>Nero,</hi> was of this resolution whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he should die: <hi>Let Heaven and
Earth mingle together,</hi> saith he,
<hi>when I am gone:</hi> He knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee so naught, and that
he should be so evill spoken of,
that he wished there were no
posterity, but that the world
might end with him. So it is
the wishes of those that are
wretches themselves, and that
lay a foundation of wretched
times after; they wish that
Heaven and Earth may mingle,
that no man might censure
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2556:88"/>
them when they are gone.
What a shamefull condition is
it for men to gratifie a number
of unrulie lusts, and give such
sway to them, as to doe ill while
they live, and to lay a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of misery for after-times.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, what a good
thing is it (like <hi>Iosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>)
to bee full of goodnesse
while wee live? and to lay a
foundation of happinesse and
prosperity to the Church and
State when we are gone? What
a happy thing is it when a man
is gone, to say, such a man did
such a thing? he stood stoutly
for the Church, for Religion,
he was a publique man; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
his owne private good, for
the publique; he deserved well
of the times wherein hee lived.
What a blessed commendation
is this (next to Heaven) to have
a blessed report on earth? and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2556:89"/>
to carry such a conscience, as
will comfort a man that he hath

in well doing.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you let us thinke of

the honour wee can: as <hi>David</hi>
saith, is there any of <hi>Ionathans</hi>
posterity alive,<note place="margin">2 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 1.</note> that I may doe
good unto them for his sake?
so considering we shal beso glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2556:92"/>
by Christ, and that hee
will doe so much for us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world; Wee should
enquire, Is there any of Christs
posterity here, any of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in this world that I may
doe good unto them? Is
there any way wherein I may
shew my thankfulnesse, and I
will doe it? Let us consider
that wee shall bee for and ever
glorified; the expression of it
is beyond conceit, wee shall
never know it til wee have it.
Let this (I beseech you) stirre
us up to study how wee may
bee thankfull to God, set forth
his glory, and deserve wel of
the Church and times wherein
wee live. God hath children,
and a cause in the world which
hee dearely loves, let us owne
the same, and stand for it to
the uttermost of our power,

of himselfe, <hi>to be with Christ; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
out of his love of Gods
Church and people, <hi>to abide still
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2556:95"/>
in the flesh,</hi> and betweene these
<hi>two</hi> hee is in a great straite not
knowing which to choose; but
the love of the Church of Christ
tryumphed in him, above the
love of his owne salvation; so as
he was content out of <hi>selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
to want the joyes of heaven
for a time, that hee might yet
further comfort the people of
God.</p>
                  <p>In the words you have, 1. S.
<hi>Pauls straites,</hi> 2. his <hi>desires</hi> that
caused them, as in regard of
<hi>himselfe,</hi> which was <hi>to bee with
Christ;</hi> so in respect of the
Church of God, which was <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
still here.</hi> 3. the reasons of
both, 1. <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> is farre
better for mee. 2. <hi>to abide in
the flesh,</hi> more needfull for you:
and 4. his resolution upon all,
being willing for the Churches
good <hi>still to abide here,</hi> rather
than goe to heaven and enjoy
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2556:95"/>
his owne happinesse.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Pauls</hi> soule was as a shippe
betweene two <hi>windes,</hi> tossed up
and downe, &amp; as iron between
two <hi>Loadstones</hi> drawne first one
way, then another; the <hi>one</hi> load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
was his <hi>owne good</hi> to bee in

                     <hi>that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God are oftentimes in
great straits;</hi> some things are so
exceeding bad, that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deliberation or delay at all
we ought presently to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
them, as <hi>Satans</hi> temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to <hi>sinne,</hi> to <hi>distrust,</hi> despaire,
&amp;c. some things also are so <hi>good</hi>
that wee should immediately
cleave unto them, as <hi>matters of
Religion and pietie,</hi> there should
be no delay in these holy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
<hi>deliberation</hi> here argues
<hi>weaknesse.</hi> Some things (againe)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2556:96"/>
are of an ambiguous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature requiring our best
consideration, such was <hi>Pauls
strait</hi> in this place; he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
swaying him on both sides,
and such is the happy estate of a
Christian that whatsoever hee
had chosen, had beene well for
him, onely God who rules our
judgements will have us to make
choise; God might have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
whether <hi>Paul</hi> should <hi>live</hi>
or <hi>die,,</hi> but he would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Pauls</hi> choice; that which is
<hi>good</hi> is <hi>not</hi> good to us, but upon
choice and advice; when God
hath given us abilities to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and examine things hee
will have us make use of them,
and therefore the Apostle useth
reasons on both sides; <hi>It is better
to die</hi> for me, <hi>It is better to live</hi>
for you, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Wicked men have their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations</hi>
and their <hi>straits</hi> too,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2556:96"/>
but it is with the <hi>rich man</hi> in the
Gospell, What they shall doe?
how they may <hi>pull downe their
barnes and build bigger;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their
maine <hi>strait</hi> is at the houre of
death, live <hi>they cannot,</hi> die <hi>they
dare not,</hi> there is so much guilt
of sinne upon their consciences,
they know not which way to
turn themselves; oh what feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
straits will sinne bring men
into? but the Apostle was strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in an higher nature than
this, whether it were better for
the glory of God (which he ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at above all) for him to goe
to heaven and enjoy happinesse
in his <hi>owne</hi> person, or to abide
still for the comfort of Gods
Saints on earth.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this difficulty
and straite, was his present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</p>
                  <p>I have a desire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Desires</hi> are the immediate is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2556:97"/>
of the soule, the motion
and stirring of the same to
something that likes it; when
there is any thing set before the
soule having a <hi>magneticall</hi> force,
as the <hi>Loadstone</hi> to draw out the
motions thereof, we call that,
<hi>desire,</hi> though for the present it
enjoyes it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> desire was, 1. <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
not after <hi>hapinesse</hi> so much
as <hi>holinesse; oh miserable man
that I am</hi> (saith he) <hi>who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this body of death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
his desire of <hi>death</hi> was to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>body of sinne</hi> more
than to be taken out of the <hi>flesh,</hi>
and his desire of <hi>holines</hi> to have
Christs image stamped on his
soule, was more than of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>happinesse; nature</hi> cannot doe
this, its a worke above the <hi>flesh,</hi>
for that will not heare of <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
but rather bids God and
Christ <hi>depart</hi> from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:2556:97"/>
2. This <hi>desire</hi> came from a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
tast of sweetnesse in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Christ; and those desires
that most ravish the soule in
apprehension of heavenly things
are ever the most holy; S. <hi>Paul</hi>
knew what a sweet communion
Christ was.</p>
                  <p>3. It was a <hi>constant</hi> desire, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
doth not say <hi>I desire,</hi> but <hi>I have
a desire,</hi> I carry the same about
me, and that carryes mee to a
love of Christ and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>4. It was <hi>efficacious,</hi> not a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
naked velleity, not a wish of the
<hi>sluggard,</hi> I would, and I would,
but a <hi>strong</hi> desire carrying him
even through death it selfe to
Christ: <hi>desires</hi> thus qualified
are <hi>blessed</hi> desires, as where wee
soe <hi>vapours</hi> arise, there are
<hi>springs</hi> usually below them, so
where these desires are, there is
alwayes a spring of grace in that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2556:98"/>
soule; Nothing characterizeth
a Christian so much as holy and
blessed desires, for there is no
<hi>hypocrisie</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>I desire to depart.</p>
                  <p>There must be a <hi>parting</hi> and a
<hi>departing;</hi> there must be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in this world with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
excellencies, from the
sweet enjoyment of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
there must be a parting
between <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> between
<hi>friend</hi> and <hi>friend,</hi> and whatever
is neare and deare unto us, all
shall determine in death.</p>
                  <p>And there must be a <hi>departing</hi>
also, here we cannot stay long,
away we must, we are for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place. Oh that we could
make use of these common
truths! how farre are wee from
making a right use of the <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of salvation, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make use of <hi>common truthes</hi>
which wee have daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2556:98"/>
of? Holy <hi>Moses</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the suddennesse of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
hence, begged of God
to <hi>teach him to number his dayes
that he might apply his heart unto
wisedome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Death</hi> is but a <hi>departing,</hi> which
<hi>word</hi> is taken from loosing from
the shore, or <hi>removing</hi> of a ship
to another coast; wee must all
be unloosened from our houses
of clay and bee carryed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>to heaven; Paul</hi> labors
to sweeten so harsh a <hi>thing</hi> as
<hi>death</hi> by comfortable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, It is but a sleep, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>home,</hi> a laying aside our
earthly <hi>tabernacle,</hi> to teach us
this point of heavenly wisdome,
that wee should looke on <hi>death</hi>
as it is <hi>now</hi> in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> not as
it was in the <hi>Law</hi> and by <hi>nature,</hi>
for so it is a passage to hell and
lets us in to all miseries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2556:99"/>
Some things are desireable
for themselves as happinesse
and holinesse, some things are
desirable not for themselves,
but as they make way to better
things, being sowre, and bitter
to nature themselves, as <hi>Physicke</hi>
is desired not for it selfe, but for
<hi>health;</hi> wee desire health for <hi>it
selfe,</hi> and physick for health, so
<hi>to be with Christ</hi> is a thing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of it selfe, but because we
cannot come to Christ but by
the darke passage of death,
saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I desire to depart
that so my death may be a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to Christ, so that death
was the object of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> desire
so farre as it made way for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things.</p>
                  <p>I desire to depart, and to bee
with Christ.</p>
                  <p>To be with Christ that came
from heaven to be here on earth
with us, and descended that we
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2556:99"/>
should ascend, to be with him
that hath done and suffered so
much for us, to be with Christ
that delighted to be with us, to
be with Christ that emptyed
himselfe, and became of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
that became poore to
make us rich, to be with Christ
our <hi>husband</hi> now contracted
here, that all may bee made up
in heaven, this was the thing
<hi>Paul</hi> desired.</p>
                  <p>Why doth he not say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I desire
to be in heaven?</p>
                  <p>Because heaven is not <hi>heaven</hi>
without Christ,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it is better to
be in any place with Christ than
to be in heaven it selfe without
him, all delicacies without
Christ are but as a funerall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
where the master of the
feast is away, there is nothing
but solemnnesse: what is all,
without Christ? I say the joyes
of heaven are not the joyes of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2556:100"/>
heaven without Christ; he is the
very heaven of heaven.</p>
                  <p>True love is carryed to the
person; It is adulterous love, to
love the thing, or the gift more
than the person, S. <hi>Paul loved
the person</hi> of Christ, because hee
felt sweet experience that
Christ <hi>loved him;</hi> his love was
but a reflection of Christs love
first, he loved to see Christ, to
embrace him, and enjoy him,
that had done so much and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
so much for his soule, that
had forgiven him so many sins,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, because <hi>it is best
of all;</hi> To be with Christ is to
be at the <hi>spring-head</hi> of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
it is to be in our proper
element, every creature thinkes
it selfe best in its owne element,
that is the place it thrives in, and
enjoyes its happinesse in; now
Christ is the element of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2556:100"/>
Againe, it is farre better;
because to bee with Christ is to
have the <hi>marriage consummate,</hi>
is not <hi>marriage</hi> better than the
<hi>contract?</hi> is not <hi>home</hi> better than
<hi>absence?</hi> to be with Christ is to
be at home; is not <hi>triumph</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than to be in <hi>conflict?</hi> but to
be with Christ is to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all enemies, to be out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans

is perfection, therefore that is
much better than any good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
for all are but shadowes
here, <hi>there</hi> is reality; What is
riches? what are the worme-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

What are the honours of the
earth, but meere shadowes of
good? <hi>At the right hand of Christ
are pleasures indeed,</hi> honours <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>

here; Why? because they
are all stayned, and mixed, here
our <hi>peace</hi> is interrupted with
desertion, and trouble, here
the joyes of the <hi>holy ghost,</hi> are
mingled with sorrow, here the
grace in a man is with combate
of <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> but in heaven
there is <hi>pure</hi> peace, pure <hi>joy,</hi> pure
<hi>grace;</hi> for what is glory but the
perfection of grace; grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is glory here, but it is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with conflict; the Scripture
calls grace <hi>glory</hi> sometimes, but
it is glory with imperfection;
Beloved, <hi>perfection</hi> is better
than imperfection, therefore to
be with Christ is farre better.</p>
                  <p>And is it much farre better to
<hi>die,</hi> that we may be with Christ,
than to <hi>live</hi> here a conflicting
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2556:101"/>
life? Why should we then feare
<hi>death,</hi> that is but a passage to
Christ? It is but a grimme ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that lets us into a glorious
pallace, that striks off our bolts,
that takes off our rags that wee
may bee clothed with better
robes, that ends all our misery,
and is the beginning of all our
happinesse, why should we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be affraid of death? it is
but a departure to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
It is but as <hi>Iordan</hi> to the
children of Israel, by which they
passed to <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is but as the
<hi>red-sea</hi> by which they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that way; therefore we have
no reason to feare death: of it
selfe it is an enemy indeed, but
now it is harmelesse, nay now it
is become a <hi>friend,</hi> amicable to
us, <hi>a sweet friend;</hi> it is one part
of the Churches joynture, death
<hi>All things are yours</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22.</note>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos, life</hi> and

                     <hi>death,</hi> death is ours and for our
good, it doth us more good
than all the friends we have in
the world, it determines and
ends all our misery, and sinne;
and it is the suburbs of heaven,
it lets us into those joyes above.
It is a shame for Christians
therefore, to bee affraid of that
that <hi>Paul</hi> here makes the object
of his <hi>desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But may not a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
feare death?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Not;</hi> so farre as a
Christian is led with the spirit
of God, and is truly <hi>spirituall:</hi> for
the spirit carryes us upward;
but as farre as wee are earthly

                  <p>Beloved, there is none but a

desires it under some notion su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his corruption: for our
desires are as our selves are, as
our aymes are; no carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, but hath carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aymes; a worldly man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
goe beyond the world,
it is his spheare; a carnall
man cannot goe beyond the
flesh, therefore a carnall man
cannot desire heaven, a man that
is under the power of any lust,
can desire nothing but the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of that lust, heaven is no
place for such; none but a child
of God can desire <hi>that:</hi> For if
we consider <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>to bee
with christ,</hi> to be <hi>perfect holines,</hi>
can he desire it that hates holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
here? can he desire the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God upon him that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2556:103"/>
hates it in others and in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
too? can he desire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, that (of all
societies) hates it the most? can
he desire to be free from sinne,
that ingulfes himselfe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in sinne? he cannot, and
therefore as long as he is under
the thraldome, and dominion
of any lust he may desire heaven
indeed, but it is onely so farre
as he may have his lusts there,
his <hi>pleasures, honours,</hi> and <hi>riches</hi>
there too; if he may have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with that, he is contented:
but alas, brethren, heaven must
not be so desired, S. <hi>Paul</hi> did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,

                  <p>4. Againe, <hi>Paul</hi> had got as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he was in Christ by
his union with him; <hi>I live not</hi>
saith he, <hi>but Christ lives in mee:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19.</note>
therefore labour for assurance
of salvation, that you may feele
the spirit of Christ in you, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying,

as if he had had it already.

How few live, as if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any such matter as this, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of salvation, without
which how can we ever desire
to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ? will a man leave his
house, though it bee never so
meane, when hee knowes not
whither to goe? will a man
leave the prison when he knows
he shall be caryed to execution?
Oh no, he had rather bee in the
dungeon still; So when there
is guilt on the soule, that it is
not assured of salvation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath cause to feare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:

No; they had rather abide in

if we would come to <hi>Pauls</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
labour to come to the

he knew whom he had <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:2556:107"/>
he was assured that nothing

                     <hi>nor any thing</hi> whatsoever
could befall him.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Paul</hi> had an art of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the thoughts of death, hee
considered it onely as a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from earth, to heaven,
when death was presented unto
him as a passage to Christ, it
was a easie matter, to desire
the same; therefore it should
be the <hi>Art</hi> of Christians, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death as a passage to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, to labour to bring our
soules into such a condition, as
to thinke death not to bee a
death to us, but the death of it
selfe, <hi>death</hi> dyes when I die, and
I beginne to live when I die; It
is a sweet passage to life, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
live till wee die. This was
<hi>Pauls Art,</hi> hee had a care to
looke beyond death, to heaven,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2556:108"/>
and when he looked upon death
he looked on it but as a passage
to Christ, so let it bee our art
and skill; would we cherish a
desire to die, let us looke on
death as a passage to Christ, and
looke beyond it to heaven: All
of us must goe through this
darke passage to Christ,
which when we consider as <hi>Paul</hi>
did, it will be an easie matter to
die.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the next
words, <hi>Neverthelesse to abide in
the flesh is more needfull for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the other desire of
<hi>Paul</hi> that brought him into this
<hi>straite,</hi> he was troubled whether
he should <hi>die,</hi> which was farre
better for himselfe, or <hi>live,</hi>
which was more needfull for
them, but the love of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did prevaile in holy S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
above the desire of heaven, and

that makes them content
to be without the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for a time, that they may
doe God service, in serving his

                  <p>The reason is, because Gods
manner of dispensation is, to
convey all good to men, by the

for the most part; and this hee

                  <p>If God convey so much good<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
by worthy men to us, then what
wretches are they that maligne
them, persecute them, &amp;c.
speake ill of those that speake to
God for them? doth the world
continue for a company of
wretches, a company of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
blasphemous, loose, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
livers? Oh no, for if
God had not a Church in the
world, a company of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> would fall
in pieces, there would bee an
end presently; It is for good
people (onely) that the world
continues, <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>pillars</hi> of
the tottering world, they are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2556:112"/>
the stakes in the fence, they are
the foundation of the building,
and if they were once taken out,
all would come downe, there
would bee a confusion of all,
therefore those that oppose and
disquiet gracious and good
men, are enemies to their owne
good, they cut the bough which
they stand on, they labour to
pull downe the house that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
themselves, being blinded
with <hi>malice,</hi> and a <hi>diabolicall spirit:</hi>
take need of such a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it comes neare to the sinne
against the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> to hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man for goodnesse; because
perhaps his good life reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us, such a one would hate
Christ himselfe if he were here,
how can a man desire to bee
with Christ, when hee hates his
image in another? therefore if
God convey so much good by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men that are good, let us
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2556:112"/>
make much of them, as publick
persons, as instruments of our
good; take away malice, and
pride, and a poisonfull spirit,
and all their good is ours: what
hinders that wee have no good
by them? pride, and an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A second thing that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
hence is this;<note place="margin">Obser.</note> 
                     <hi>Holy and
gracious men that are led by the
Spirit of God can deny themselves,
and their owne best good, for the
Churches benefit.</hi> They know
that God hath appointed them
as instruments to convey good
to others, and knowing this
they labour to come to <hi>Pauls</hi>
spirit here, to desire to <hi>live,</hi> to
have life in <hi>patience,</hi> and death
in <hi>desire</hi> in regard of themselves;
for it were much better for a
good man to bee in heaven out
of misery, out of this conflicting
condition with the devill and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2556:113"/>
devilish minded men.</p>
                  <p>The reason is,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> because a good
man as soone as he is a good
man, hath the spirit of <hi>love</hi> in
him, and <hi>love seeketh not its owne</hi>
but the good of <hi>another,</hi> and as
the love of Christ and the love
of God possesseth, and seizeth
upon the soule, so <hi>selfe-love</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes;
what is gracious love, but
a decay of selfe-love, the more
selfe-love decayes, the more we
deny our selves.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Gods people have
the spirit of Christ in them, who
<hi>minded not his owne things;</hi> If
Christ had minded his <hi>owne</hi>
things where had our salvation
beene? Christ was content to
leave heaven, and to take our
nature upon him, to be <hi>Emanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of Christ, have a spirit of <hi>selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall</hi>
of their owne, we see the
blessed <hi>angells</hi> are content to be
<hi>Ministring spirits</hi> for us, and it is
thought to bee the sinne of the
devil, <hi>pride,</hi> when he scorned to
stoope, to the keeping of man
an inferiour creature to himself.
The blessed Angells doe not
scorne to attend upon a poore
child, <hi>little ones:</hi> A Christian is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2556:114"/>
a consecrated person, and he is
none of his owne, he is a <hi>sacrifice</hi>
as soone as he is a Christian, he
is Christs, he gives himselfe to
Christ, and as he gives himselfe
so he gives his life, and all to
Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> faith of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
they gave themselves
and their goods to him; when a
Christian gives himselfe to
Christ, he gives all to Christ:
all his labour and paines, and
whatsoever hee knowes that
Christ can serve himselfe of him
for his Churches good, and his
glory; he knowes that Christ
is wiser than he, therefore hee
resignes himselfe to his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 8.</note> and if he die, <hi>he dies

                  </p>
                  <p>Oh beloved,<note place="margin">Vse</note> that we had the
spirit of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the spirit
of Christ to set us a worke, to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2556:114"/>
doe good while we are here, <hi>to
deny our selves;</hi> oh it would bee
meate and drinke as it was to
our blessed Saviour Christ, to
doe good all kinde of wayes;
consider all the capacities and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
wee have to doe good,
this way, and that way, in this
relation, and that relation, that
we may bee trees of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that the more we beare, God
will mend his owne trees, hee
will <hi>purge</hi> them and <hi>prune</hi> them
to <hi>bring forth more fruit,</hi> God
cherisheth fruitfull trees: in the
law of <hi>Moses,</hi> when they besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

them to spare <hi>fruitful trees:</hi> God
spares a fruitfull person till hee
have done his worke; we know

                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 15.</note> and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2556:115"/>
the righteous delivereth the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
Wee see for one servant
<hi>Ioseph, Potiphars</hi> house was bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 3.</note>
                     <hi>Naaman</hi> had a poore <hi>maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant,</hi>
that was the occasion
of his conversion. Grace will
set any body aworke, its puts a
dexterity into any though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so meane, they carry Gods
blessing wheresoever they goe,
and they bethinke themselves
when they are in any condition
to doe good, as he saith in <hi>Hester
God hath called mee to this place,
perhaps for this end:</hi> wee should
often put this <hi>quaere</hi> to our
selves, why hath God called me
to this place? for such and such
a purpose.</p>
                  <p>Now that wee may bee fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as <hi>Paul</hi> was, let us labour to
have <hi>humble</hi> spirits; God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in an humble spirit, and
not in a proud spirit, for that
takes all the glory to it selfe,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2556:115"/>
God delights to use humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that are content to stoope
to any service for others, that
thinkes no office too meane.</p>
                  <p>2. Get <hi>loving</hi> hearts, love is
full of invention, how shall I
glorifie God? how shall I doe
good to others? how shall I
bring to heaven as many as I
can? <hi>love</hi> is a sweet and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
affection, full of holy devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>3. Labour to have sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in our places, that you may
have abilitie to doe good: oh,
when these meet together, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and sufficiencie, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
a large, and gracious heart
and a fit object to do good too:
What a deale of good is done
then?</p>
                  <p>4. And when we finde <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie</hi>
of doing any good, let us
<hi>resolve</hi> upon it, resolve to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, and serve him in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2556:116"/>
spight of flesh and blood: for
we must get every good worke
that we doe out of the fire, as it
were; we must get it out with
travaile, and paines; wee carry
that about us that wil hinder us,
let us therefore labour to have
sincere aymes in that we doe to
please God, and then resolve to
doe all the good we can.</p>
                  <p>To stirre us up to bee more
and more fruitfull in our places,
let us consider wee live for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and not for our selves
when wee are good Christians
once. It was a good speech of
that godly <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> great
grandfather to him that is, <hi>(Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
the godly they called
him) when he was to die, <hi>satis
vobis</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have lived hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
for you, now let me live for
my selfe;</hi> we live here all our life
for others, therefore let us think
while we live how we may doe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2556:116"/>
most good in the Church of
God.</p>
                  <p>For encouragement hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
consider, God will undertake
to recompence all the good we
doe, to a cup of <hi>cold water;</hi> we
shall not lose a sigh, a groane,
for the Church, God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
himselfe dishonoured if
it should not be rewarded, hee
hath pawned his faithfulnesse
upon it;<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee is not unfaithfull to
be unmindfull of your good workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, wee have a present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and contentment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
as light accompanies
fire, so peace and joy accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
nie every good action; All is
not reserved for heaven, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath some beginnings of
happinesse here, when he doth
that that is contrary to flesh and
blood, how full of sweet joy is
a fruitfull soule? those that are
fruitfull in their places never
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2556:117"/>
want arguments of good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of salvation. It is your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie
luke-warme Christian that
wants assurance. Therefore I

<hi>desired</hi> in the world, and die <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,</hi>
labour to be usefull in
your places all you can, to be as

God and man, and not to
<hi>cumber the ground</hi> of the Church
with barrennesse: sinnes of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi>
because men were not
fruitfull in their places was a
ground of damnation: <hi>Cast the
unprofitable servant into utter
darknesse:</hi>

harme, I, but he was <hi>unprofitable;</hi>
such was the cursed disposition
of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> hee brought forth
fruit to himselfe: Oh this loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to our selves, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we make
our selves the begining &amp; the
end of all the good we doe, it is
an argument of a barren person,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2556:117"/>
none ever came to heaven but
those that denyed themselves.</p>
                  <p>I see I cannot proceed in this
point, you may by the spirit of
God inlarge it in your thoughts
and bring home what hath been
said to your ownes soules, labour
that you may bee such as others
may make use of you, and not
be the burthens and calamities
of the time, as many are, that
live for nothing but to doe
good men good by vexing of
them, that is all the good they
doe, by vexing their patience
they exercise their grace a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
way; let us not be bryers
and unfruitfull plants, labouring
to be great by the publique mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serics:
As they say, great fishes
grow bigge by devouring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
little ones; as a dragon comes
to be great by devouring many
little serpents, so many grow
great by the ruine of others;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2556:118"/>
Oh beloved, it had beene better
for such that they had never
beene borne. Therefore as we
desire to have comfort when we
die, let us labour to be fruitfull
while we live. S. <hi>Paul</hi> when the
time came that he should die,
when hee had done his worke,
you see he that was thus full of
selfe-deniall, how gloriously he
ended his dayes; The second
Epistle to Timothy was the last
Epistle that ever he wrote, and
when hee had done his worke,
saith hee,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I have sought a good
fight, I have kept the faith, I have
finished my course, from henceforth
there is a crowne of righteousnesse
reserved for me;</hi> what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
end is here? and indeed
those that are thus carefull, and
fruitfull in their lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
end their dayes full
of comfort, and resigne their
soules to God with full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2556:118"/>
of a blessed change, and
onely those: For you have
many, when they come to die,
what hinders them? Oh I have
beene unfruitfull, I have not
done that good that I might, I
have not <hi>wrought out my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with feare and trembling.</hi> In
such a thing I have done ill, such
a thing I have omitted, so they
are enemies to their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
inlarge this in your owne
meditations, and consider what
will comfort you hereafter
when you shall need most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
So I leave the text, and
come to the occasion.</p>
                  <p>This holy and blessed man
whose funerall now wee solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,
was of S. <hi>Pauls spirit,</hi> hee
did <hi>desire to die, &amp; be with Christ,</hi>
he had a desire while he lived to
take all opportunities to doe
good: I speake of that time
when he lived, that is, when hee
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2556:119"/>
was good, for we live no longer
than wee are good: let us not
reckon that Life wherein we
doe no good. After God had
wrought upon his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rt, he had
a publique heart to doe good.
If I wanted matter to speak of,
I could tell you of his <hi>allyance
and birth,</hi> having two worthy

<hi>cherished</hi> and promoted
his studie and indeavours; but
what should I speake of these
things when hee hath personall
worth enough? I need not goe
abroad to commend this man,
for there were those graces and
gifts in him, that made him so
esteemed, that verily I thinke,
no man of his place and yeares,
lived more desired, and dyed

he was a man of speciall use, and
service; and as he honored God
in his life, so God hath honored
him in his death, as you may see
by this honorable assembly of
worthy people, met in love to
him.</p>
                  <p>His death was (as the death
of strong men useth to be) with

his disease, but with a great deal

Oh saith he, <hi>You keepe

                  <p>Hee had a large heart to doe

yet oft in his sicknesse in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

                  <p>Beloved, shall such a man as

what shall a company of us do?
Beloved, those that have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
their hearts at the fire of
Gods love, they thinke zeale it
selfe to be coldnesse, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to be barrennesse; Love
is a boundlesse affection, hee
spake not this from want of
care, but love knows no bounds,
therefore hee tooke the more
opportunities of doing good.</p>
                  <p>Well, I beseech you beloved,
let not this example Passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making good use of it, God
will call us to a reckoning not

only for what we heare, but for
what we see: he will call us to a
reckoning for the examples of
his people, therefore as wee see
here what a holy disposition
was in <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and in this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

us labour to finde the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

and he is <hi>with Christ,</hi> that is best

on which his mind was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
let us therefore labour
with God in the use of good
meanes, to have the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
And in this moment
let us provide for eternitie:
out of eternitie before, and

some imagine; it is no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But to die well is a matter
of every day, let us daily doe
some good that may helpe us at
the time of our death, every day
by repentance pull out the sting
of some sin, that so when death
comes, we may have nothing to
doe but to die; to die <hi>well</hi> is the
action of the <hi>whole</hi> life, he never
dies well for the most part, that
dies not daily, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith of
himselfe, <hi>I die daily;</hi> he laboured
to loose his heart from the

loose our hearts from the world
and die daily, how easie will it
be to die at last? he that thinks

of the vanity of the world, and
of death, &amp; of being with Christ
for ever, and is dying daily, it
will be easie for him to end his
daies with comfort; but the time
being past, I will here make an
end; Let us desire God to make
that which hath been spoken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,

of darknesse is reserved for them.
As Christ wanted the comfort
of light from heaven, so those

no comfort from any <hi>creature</hi> at

shine upon them, the <hi>earth</hi> shall

have a drop of <hi>water</hi> to coole their
tongues; they were formerly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
against God, and now every
creature is ready to serve the
Lord against them; when the
King is displeased with a man,
which of his servants dare to
countenance him?</p>
                  <p>This darknesse being in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
did likewise portend the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition of the <hi>Iewes</hi> here,
and that <hi>eternall darknesse</hi> in the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another circumstance may be
this, God was a great while ere
he removed his heavy displeasure
from Christ; he was <hi>three houres</hi>
in torment; And though God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
him long, yet hee said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
til now by way of <hi>complaint;</hi>
wee should beware of darknesse
of spirit in trouble; God may
delay helpe to his dearest children

                  <p>Secondly, if he had not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in his <hi>Soule</hi> the sense of

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2556:136"/>
                     <hi>theeves</hi> that suffered by him

suffered in soule indeed.</p>
                  <p>That is not all,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> beloved, but
there were immediate suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
even of his <hi>soule</hi> also,
which he groaned under: God

the Father laid a heavy stroake

affright us with Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
but the inflicting of anger
upon the soule issues immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from the hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
Wee must here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider God as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judge, sitting in heaven
in his judgement seate, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the punishment of the
sinnes of all his people upon
Christ; there was a meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of all the sinnes of the

were) <hi>in one point</hi> upon <hi>him,</hi> and
the punishment of all these was
laid on his blessed <hi>shoulders,</hi> who
suffered for them in both body
and soule.</p>
                  <p>But how could Christ bee
<hi>forsaken</hi> of God,<note place="margin">3. Conclus.</note> (especially <hi>so</hi>
forsaken as to suffer the anger of

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I answer;<note place="margin">Ans.</note> First, the <hi>Paschall

doe that which we should have

Secondly, as in naturall things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the <hi>head</hi> is punished for the fault

his blessed nature
with ours, made up <hi>one</hi> mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<hi>body,</hi> and suffered for us.</p>
                  <p>But upon what ground should

                  </p>

hee was more eminent

knit to the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>2 Christ most willingly gave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
himselfe a sacrifice for us.</p>
                  <p>3 He was designed and <hi>prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated</hi>

to this office, yea, he was

this businesse by God himselfe,
and is not this sufficient ground
why he should become our <hi>sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
especially if we consider,</p>
                  <p>4 That Christ tooke the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
communion of our nature upon

him for this very end, that hee
might bee a <hi>full surety,</hi> that his
<hi>righteousnesse</hi> being derived to

wrath might be satisfied in the
self-same nature that offended.

                  <p>Doe you wonder why GOD
so much hates sinne, that men
so little regard, not onely the

dead-hearted persons, that
set so little by it, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not spirituall sinnes at all,

&amp;c.</hi> cloathing themselves with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2556:144"/>
these things as a comely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Certainly you would not
wonder that God hates sinne, if
you did but consider how sinne
hates God; what is sinne but a
setting of it selfe in Gods room,
a setting the devill in Gods
place? for when wee sinne wee
leave God, and set up the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and by consequence <hi>Sathan</hi>
that brings the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to us,
setting him in our hearts before
God: Beloved, God is very
jealous, and cannot indure that
filthy thing <hi>sinne</hi> to bee in his
roome; sinne is such a thing as
desires to take away God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Aske a sinner when hee is
about to sinne, Could you not
wish that there were no God at
all, that there were no eye of
heaven to take vengeance on
you? Oh I, with all my
heart; and can you then wonder
that God hates sinne so, when it
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2556:144"/>
hates him so, as to wish the
not being of God? oh marvell
not at it, but have such conceits
of sinne as GOD had when hee
gave his Sonne to dye for it, and
such as Christ had, when in the
sense of his Fathers anger hee
cryed thus, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The deeper our thoughts are
of the odiousnesse of sinne, the
deeper our comfort and joy in
Christ will bee after; therefore
I beseech you work your hearts
to a serious consideration what
that sinne is that we cherish so
much, and will not be reproved
for, and which wee leave GOD
and heaven, and all to imbrace;
conceive of it as God doth that
must bee a Judge, and will one
day call us to a strict account for
the same.</p>
                  <p>If Christ cryed out thus, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me?</hi> as being our surety for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2556:145"/>
our sinnes, we may see what to
conceive of sinne, and of GOD
the better.</p>
                  <p>But above all things I desire
you to see often in this <hi>glasse,</hi>
in this booke of Christ <hi>crucified,</hi>
(it is an excellent booke to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
the mercy of God and the
love of Christ, the <hi>heighth,</hi> and
<hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>bredth</hi> of Gods love
in Jesus Christ, which hath no
dimensions: What set God on
worke to plot this excellent
worke of our salvation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by such a surety; was
it not <hi>mercy?</hi> did not that awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>wisdome</hi> to reconcile justice
and mercy to Christ? But what
stirred up this wisdome of God?
Oh, bowels of <hi>compassion</hi> to man;
he would not have man perish,
when the Angels did without
remedy.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us desire to be
inflamed with the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:2556:145"/>
that hath loved us so much: All
the favors of God in Christ tend
(next after satisfaction to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice)
to inflame our hearts to
love him againe, wherefore else
are the favours of creation and
Providence? How sweet is God
in providing for our bodies, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us not onely for necessity,
but abundance, withholding no
comfort that is good for us, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But chiefly in his <hi>Master-piece</hi>
God would have us apprehend
the greatest love of all other,
because there hee hath set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to glorifie his mercy more
than any thing else? therefore
wee may well cry with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Oh the height of his love,
&amp;c.</hi> I beseech you fixe your
thoughts on this, think not now
and then sleightly of it, but
dwell on the meditation of the
infinite love of God in Christ,
till your hearts be inlarged and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2556:146"/>
warmed and inflamed with the
consideration thereof; and then
<hi>love</hi> will set you forward to all
good workes; what need we bid
you be liberall to the poore, to
bee good subjects, just in your
dealings, &amp;c? all this may bee
spared when there is a loving
heart: And when shall we have
loving hearts? when they are
kindled and fired at Gods fire,
when they are perswaded of
Gods love, then the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his love will breed love in
our hearts againe; and that is
the reason why the <hi>Apostles</hi> are
not so punctuall as heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

they force upon men espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

God and Man in one person, the

now the communion before
being so neare and so sweet
unto him, a little want of the

Things the nearer they are,
the more difficult the separation
will be; as when the skinne is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the flesh, and the
flesh from the bones, oh it is
irk some to nature; much more
was Christs separation from the
sense of his Fathers <hi>love.</hi> Those
that <hi>love,</hi> live more in the party
loved, than in themselves; Christ
was in love with the person of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2556:153"/>
his father, and lived in him, now
to want the sense of his love,
(considering that love desires
nothing but the returne of love
againe) it must needs bee death

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Another ground that Christ
was thus sensible, was, because
hee was best able to apprehend
the worth of communion with
God, and best able to apprechend
what the anger of God was; hee
had a large judgement, and a

other, therfore being filld with

to hold more wrath than any

the griese of Christ both in <hi>body</hi>

he was quick and able

oh let us improve this blessed

the life of heaven upon earth;
especially when the Conscience
is troubled with sinne (as Christ
was now with the displeasure

God, &amp; plead with his Majesty,
and we may plead lawfully with
him, <hi>Lord, thy Iustice is better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

it would not bee so much for thy
glory, thou art more glorious in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
thy justice in Christ, than if
thou shouldest damne mee to hell;</hi>
Why? Because Gods justice
is better satisfied in Christ.
Man sinned, but <hi>God-man</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for sinne, man would be like
God in <hi>pride,</hi> God becomes man
in <hi>humilitie,</hi> the expiation of
God is greater than the sinne of
man; <hi>He</hi> prayed for his <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and gave his <hi>life</hi> for them;
doth not this proportion more
the justice of God than the sinne
of man? The Law doth but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a nocent person, a <hi>guilty</hi>
person to suffer; Christ was <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:2556:167"/>
The Law requires that
<hi>man</hi> should suffer, Christ was
GOD; therefore Christ hath
done more than satisfied the
<hi>Law;</hi> the satisfaction of Christ
is more than if <hi>we</hi> had suffered;
Wee are poore <hi>men, creatures;</hi>
that was the satisfaction of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
our sinnes are the sinnes of
finite persons, but he is infinite;
therefore the soule may plead,
<hi>Lord, I am a wretched sinner, but
I should take away thee, and take
away Christ if I should despaire;
I should make thee no GOD, and
make Christ no Christ, if I should
not accept of mercy, for Christ is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to me,</hi> and I labour to make
him mine owne, by laying hold
of him. <hi>Faith</hi> hath a power to
make every thing <hi>its owne</hi> that it

claime to God as <hi>his</hi> GOD,
by giving himselfe to him <hi>onely,</hi>

                  <p>Beloved, the Church of God

delights when wee lay open the

him: If there be a spirit of

wee can lay open the pittifull
state of Gods poore Church,
what a blessing may we obtaine
for them? <hi>It is thy</hi> CHVRCH,
<hi>Lord, thine owne people, thy name
is called upon them, and they call
upon thy name; though they have
sinned, yet thou deservest to bee

mercy for them.</hi> Thus if
wee contend with GOD, and

no rest, <hi>faith</hi> would work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The state of the Church
would not be long as it is, if wee
would all improve our interest

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2556:168"/>
Christ strugled with the
powers of darknesse, and the
wrath of his father a while, but
presently after, all was finished:
so let us contend boldly,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Fight
the good fight of faith,</hi> and not

First,<note place="margin">God provide, for his Church as his owne house.</note> a man provides for his
family, (and hee that neglects it,
is worse then an insidell) so doth
God provide for his Church;
the very <hi>Dragons</hi> and <hi>Ostriges,</hi>
the worst of the <hi>creatures,</hi> al have
some respect to <hi>their</hi> yong ones,
much more will God provide
for his <hi>owne,</hi> And as a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
his house from all enemies,
so will God protect his Church
and people, and be <hi>a wall of fire,</hi>
and a defence round about them.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a mixture in
the Church (as in a <hi>house</hi> of good
and bad vessels; but the godly
are especially Gods house, as for
hypocrites and false professors,
they are no more in the <hi>house,</hi>
then the excrements are in the
body, they are <hi>in</hi> the body, but
not <hi>of</hi> the body, and therefore as
<hi>Ishmael</hi> they must be cast out at

                  <p>And as in every house or buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2556:173"/>
there are some open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The heart of true Christians is Gods private closet.</note>
and some private closets,

private chamber, and his rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

of every true Christian; Hee
counts it not sufficient to dwell
in his <hi>house</hi> at large, but hee will
dwell in the <hi>best</hi> part of it, the

he <hi>knocks at the doores of our hearts

is, that God may governe and

they have no <hi>Idoll</hi> above God in

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2556:173"/>
is no meane favour, that God

                     </gap>ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
in the hearts of the best
of us.</p>
                  <p>Oh what comfort ariseth to
a christian soule from the due
meditation of this point; If wee
are Gods <hi>house,</hi> then God wil be
our <hi>house; Thou art our habitation</hi>
(saith <hi>Moses) from generation to
generation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 90. 1.</note> Howsoever we shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
in the world, as they did in the
<hi>wildernesse,</hi> now here, and
now there, having no certaine
place of abode, but are here to
day, and gone to morrow, yet in
God wee have an <hi>house, thou art
our habitation;</hi> he is ours, and we
are his. And what a comfort is
this that wee are Gods house;
Certainly God will provide for
his <hi>owne house;</hi> hee that layes this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2556:174"/>
charge upon others, and hath
put that affection and care of
<hi>provision</hi> into others for their
<hi>families,</hi> will he neglect his own?
hee that makes us love, and puts
that naturall affection into us of
those that belong unto us, hath
hee not infinitely more in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
when as that which wee
have, is but a beame or ray
from his infinite brightnesse?</p>
                  <p>This should then instruct us
to labour that God may dwell
largely and comfortably in us,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note>
to deliver up all to this keeper
of our house, and suffer him to
rule and raigne in us. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Church is become the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of <hi>Devils,</hi> that which
was Bethel, is now become <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aven.</hi>
Why? because they
would not suffer God to rule in
his owne house, but would have
coadjutors with Christ, as if he
were not a sufficient <hi>head</hi> of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2556:174"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> to govern it, but he must
have a <hi>Vicar</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> who (as if
<hi>Christ</hi> were too weak) will not
suffer him to exercise his <hi>Kingly
office,</hi> unlesse <hi>hee</hi> may support &amp;
help him: thus they set up the
abomination of desolation in
the temple of God.</p>
                  <p>Oh beloved, it much concerns
us, to cleanse and purifie our
hearts, that so wee may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Christ, and he may delight
to abide and dwell with us: you
know how hainously hee tooke
it,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 46.</note> when <hi>his house was made a den
of theeves,</hi> and will hee not take
it much worse, that our <hi>hearts</hi>
should be made the very sinks
and cages of all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes?</p>
                  <p>How should wee begge and
cry to God that he would whip
out these noysome lusts &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
out of the temple of
our hearts, by any sharp correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2556:175"/>
or terrour of conscience
whatsoever, rather then suffer
them to reside there still to

should take a holy <hi>State</hi> upon us
as being <hi>temples of the holy Ghost,</hi>
and therefore too good to be
desiled with sinne: Our hearts
should be as the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi>
And therefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts

both of flesh and spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 1</note> for

(after a certaine time) they will
gather such a burthen of humors

<hi>if any man be in Christ hee is a new

flowes new workes of holinesse

Of <hi>its owne,</hi> whence come inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
as <hi>naturall</hi> as for the tree
to beare fruit, or the Sunne to
shine; so upon the former divine
grounds (for it is a matter of <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fering</hi>
wherein wee must have
pure <hi>Divinity</hi> to support our
soules) The Aposlle comes to
bring a spirituall inference su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the same, in the words
read unto you: <hi>Wherefore</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluding
all to bee true that was
said before, <hi>Let them that suffer,
&amp;c.</hi> Wherein consider, 1. That
the state and condition of Gods
children is to <hi>suffer.</hi> 2. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of that <hi>suffering,</hi> (they
suffer not at all adventures, but)
<hi>according to the will of GOD.</hi>
3. Their duty in this estate,
namely, <hi>to commit the keeping of
their soules to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>duty</hi> we have these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
comprehended. 1. An
action, <hi>To commit.</hi> 2. An object,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2556:233"/>
what wee must commit, <hi>the
soule.</hi> 3. The person to whom, <hi>to
God.</hi> 4. The maner, <hi>in well doing.</hi>
Lastly, the reason which should
move us hereunto, <hi>implyed</hi> in
these words, <hi>as unto a faithfull
Creator.</hi> Whatsoever may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the doubting of a godly
man in any trouble, and inforce
upon him this duty of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his soule to God, is briefly

                  </list>
                  <p>To passe briefly over these,
as not being the thing I ayme at.</p>
                  <p>Gods will concerning our

of those that doe us harme, but
in regard of our patient endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

enjoyned to suffer, and they

                  <p>It seemes then there is some

but his <hi>suffering</hi> will; hee useth
their malice for his owne ends;
God lets the rayne loose upon
their neckes; as a man is said to
set a dogg upon another when
he unlooseth his chaine; so God
is said to <hi>command</hi> them, when
hee lets them loose to doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiese;
they are full of malice
<hi>themselves,</hi> which God useth as
Physitians doe their <hi>poyson</hi> to
cure poyson; God and they goe
two contrary wayes, as a man in
a shipp walkes one way, but is

Christ the will of <hi>Iudas</hi> and the

another; so in all our <hi>sufferings,</hi>
when God useth wicked men,
<hi>their</hi> will is <hi>destructive</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile,
but Gods will is cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
<hi>ayming</hi> at the good of
his people in all this. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>

which inclines to a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

it with a good conscience in

that wee are led with the <hi>cause</hi>

works mightily upon them that

be malicious as <hi>they</hi> are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

<hi>he</hi> is poysoned with <hi>malice,</hi>

what is this to that unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
horrour and despaire, which

No, for immediately

then? why hee will preserve
mee <hi>from every evill worke,</hi> that
is, from every sinfull act, which
may hurt the cause of Christ, or
blemish my profession; this was

our soules are carryed to any

Popery is an uncomfortable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which brings men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire;
they have no reason for
what they maintaine: What
reason can they give for their
doctrine of <hi>doubting, transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
perfect obedience to the

things, the soule cannot yeeld
to such absurdities, it must have
strong reasons to stablish it, as
here, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider Godas a <hi>faithful

of <hi>Religion;</hi> not that any

from the <hi>creature,</hi> but that
there is an <hi>All sufficiency</hi> in the
<hi>Creator</hi> to releive the poor <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
If a man consider in what
<hi>order</hi> God created him, it will
make him trust God; <hi>Paradise</hi>
and all in it were ready for him
so soone as hee came into the
world. God created us after his
<hi>owne Image,</hi> that as he was Lord
of all things, so wee should bee
Lord of the <hi>creatures,</hi> they were
all at his service, that hee might
serve God; therfore after every
thing else was created hee was
made, that so God might bring
him as it were to a table ready
furnished.</p>
                  <p>And not onely in <hi>nature,</hi> but
in <hi>holinesse,</hi> having an immortall
and invisible soule, resembling
God. We must take God here
as a Creator of our whole man,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2556:253"/>
                     <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soule,</hi> and of <hi>the new
creature</hi> in us; God made man at
the first, but that was not so
much as for God to bee <hi>made
man,</hi> to make us <hi>new creatures:</hi>
God created our <hi>bodies</hi> out of
the <hi>dust,</hi> but our soules come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from <hi>himself,</hi> he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<hi>them</hi> into us; and in this
respect hee is a higher Creator
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other; for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had
marred our first making, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more like <hi>beasts</hi> than <hi>men,</hi>
(for indeed every one that is
not like God, sympathizeth
with beasts or Devils one way
or other) God in Christ made
us new againe; yea, God became
<hi>man,</hi> to inrich us with all grace
and goodnesse, to free us from
the hands of Sathan, and bring
us to an eternall estate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with himselfe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for all the old heaven, and
the old earth shall passe away,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2556:254"/>
and the old condition of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and a new life shall bee
given them: God that made
the <hi>new</hi> heaven and the new
<hi>earth,</hi> hath made us for them.
Considering therefore that God
gave us our <hi>first</hi> being, and when
we were worse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naught, gave
us a <hi>second</hi> being, in regard of
our new creation, how should it
stirre us up to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit our soules
unto him? especially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

<hi>move</hi> and have our <hi>being,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act 17. 28.</note> that
there is not the least thought
and affection to goodnesse in
us, but it comes from God,
<hi>wee are</hi> what wee are <hi>by his grace.</hi>

                  <p>What is the reason that love

                  </p>
                  <p>Because a man lookes upon

                     <note place="margin">Ans.</note> and loves
it; now God lookes upon us, as
upon those into whom hee hath
infused mercy and goodnesse,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2556:254"/>
and hee loves his owne worke
upon us, and therefore having
begun a good worke, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the same: Doe not <hi>men</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to polish their <hi>owne</hi>
worke? As in the first creation
God never tooke off his hand
till hee had finished his worke;
so in the second creation of our
<hi>soules,</hi> he will never remove his
hand from the blessed worke of
<hi>grace,</hi> till hee hath perfected the
same; therefore wee may well
<hi>commit our soules to him.</hi>
                  </p>

in his <hi>promises,</hi> and in his <hi>deeds,</hi>
let us make especiall use of it:
Treasure up all the promises we
can, <hi>of the forgivenesse of sinnes,</hi>
of <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>preservation,</hi>
that hee will never leave us, but
be <hi>our God to death,</hi> &amp;c. and then
consider withall, that hee is
faithful in performing the same,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2556:258"/>
when we are affrighted by his
<hi>Majesty</hi> and his <hi>justice,</hi> and other
<hi>Attributes,</hi> then thinke of his
<hi>mercy</hi> and truth; <hi>He hath cloathed
himselfe with faithfulnesse,</hi> (as the
Psalmist saith;) In all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse
of men whom thou
trustest, depend upon this, that
God is still the same, and will
not deceive thee.</p>
                  <p>When we have mans word;
wee have his sufficiency in
minde, for mens <hi>words</hi> are as
<hi>themselves</hi> are. What will not
the word of a King doe? If a
man bee mighty and great, his
word is answerable. This is the
reason why wee should make
so much of the <hi>word of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the word of <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ovah,</hi>
a mighty Creatour, who gives
a being to all things, and can
onely bee Lord and Master of
his word: we know Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
no otherwise than by his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2556:258"/>
                     <hi>word;</hi> till we come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>vision</hi> in heaven, wee
must be content with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Revelation</hi> in the
Word.</p>
                  <p>And in every <hi>promise</hi> single
out <hi>that</hi> which best suiteth with
thy present condition. If thou
art in any great distresse, thinke
upon the Almighty power of
God. Lord, thou hast made me
of nothing, and canst deliver
mee out of this estate; behold I
flie unto thee for succour, &amp;c.
If thou art in perplexity for want
of direction, and knowest not
what to doe, single out the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of Gods <hi>wisedome,</hi> and
desire him to teach thee the way
that thou shouldest goe. If thou
art wronged, flie to his <hi>Iustice,</hi>
and say, <hi>O God, to whom ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance
belongeth, heare and helpe thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
If thou be surprized with
<hi>distrust</hi> and staggering, then goe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2556:259"/>
to his <hi>truth</hi> and faithfulnesse;
thou shalt alwayes finde in God
something to support thy soule
in the greatest extremity that
can be fall thee; for if there were
not in God a <hi>fulnesse</hi> to supply
every exigent that wee are in,
he were not to bee worshipped,
he were not to be trusted.</p>
                  <p>Man is lighter than vanity in
the Ballance; Every man is a
<hi>lyar,</hi> that is, hee is <hi>false:</hi> we may
bee <hi>so</hi> and yet bee <hi>men</hi> too, but
God is essentially <hi>true,</hi> hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceive and bee God too;
Therefore ever when thou art
disappointed with men, retire
to God and to his promises, and
build upon this, that the Lord
will not be wanting in any thing
may doe thee good. With men
there is breach of covenant, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Nation, and man with
man; there is little trust to bee
had in any; but in all confusions
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2556:259"/>
                     <hi>here</hi> is comfort. A religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may cast himselfe boldly in
to the armes of the Almighty,
and goe to him in any distresse,
as to a <hi>faithfull Creator,</hi> that will
not fortake him.</p>
                  <p>Oh let us bee ashamed that
we should dishonour him,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> who
is ready to pawne his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and truth for us; <hi>If wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

us to bee tempted <hi>above that
which wee are able.</hi> When we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe
our selves with doubts
and feares, whether hee will
make good his promise or not,
wee disable his Majesty. Doe
wee not thinke God stands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his truth and faithfulnesse?
undoubtedly hee doth, and wee
cannot dishonour him more,
than to distrust him, especially
in his Euangelicall <hi>promises;</hi> wee
make him a <hi>lyar,</hi> and robb him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2556:260"/>
of <hi>that</hi> which hee most glories
in, (his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi>)
if wee rest not securely upon
him.</p>
                  <p>See the basenesse of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
God hath made all other
things <hi>faithfull</hi> that are so, and
wee can trust them, but are ever
and anon questioning the truth
of his <hi>promise.</hi> Wee may justly
take up <hi>Salvians</hi> complaint in
his time, <hi>Who hath made the
earth faithfull to bring forth fruit</hi>
(saith he) <hi>but God? yet wee can
trust the ground with sowing our
seed; Who makes man faithfull,</hi>
(who is by nature the most slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and unconstant creature of
all other) <hi>but God onely?</hi> yet wee
can trust a vaine man, whose
breath is in his Nostrils, and
looke for great matters at his
hands, before an <hi>Al-sufficient</hi>
God, that changeth not: <hi>Who
makes the seas and the winds faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2556:260"/>
that they doe not hurt us, but
God?</hi> and yet wee are apt to
trust the winde and weather
sooner than GOD; as wee
see many <hi>Sea-men</hi> that will
thrust forth their goods into
the wide Ocean, in a small Bark,
to shift any way rather than
trust God with them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, let <hi>Sathan</hi> by his wicked
Instruments draw a man to
some cursed politique reasons,
(for the Devill doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
converse with the world,
but in his instruments) and hee
will sooner trust <hi>him</hi> than God
himselfe; so prone are our hearts
to distrust the Almighty, to call
his truth in question, and to
trust the lyes of our own hearts
and other mens, before <hi>him.</hi> Let
us therefore lament our inside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that having such an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and faithfull Creator to
relie upon, yet we cannot bring
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2556:261"/>
our hearts to trust in him. There
are two maine <hi>Pillars</hi> Of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians faith.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Power of God.</item>
                     <item>2. The Goodnesse of God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>These <hi>two</hi> like <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Hur,</hi> hold up the armes of our
prayers. Let our estate be never
so desperate, yet God is a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
still; let our sinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
be never so great, yet
hee hath power to heale them.
Oh how should this cheare up
our soules, and support our
drooping spirits in all our stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and conflicts with <hi>sinne</hi>
and <hi>Sathan,</hi> that wee yeeld not
to the least temptation, having
such an Almighty GOD to flye
unto for succour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cursed is that man which makes
flesh his arme;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ieremy.</note> he that we trust in
must bee no lesse than a <hi>Creator;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We must not trust the creature.</note>
                     <hi>Cease from man whose breath is in
his nostrils,</hi> (saith God) hee is a

poore <hi>creature</hi> as thy selfe is, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of nothing, and shall come
to dust againe: If wee would
<hi>beetrusting</hi> as wee needs must,
(for we are dependant persons,
and want many things whilest
wee are here) let us goe to the
<hi>fountaine,</hi> and not to <hi>broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternes</hi>
for comfort.</p>
                  <p>It is no small priviledge for a
Christian to have this free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to God in times of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
be we what wee can bee,
take us at our worst in regard of
sinne or misery, yet we are his
Creatures still; I am the Clay,
thou art the Potter, I am a
sinfull wretch, yet I am the
workmanship of thy hands, O
Lord, thou hast framed mee,
and fashioned mee, &amp;c. No
wicked person in the world can
upon good ground plead in this
manner, though they may say
to God, <hi>I am thy creature,</hi> yet
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2556:262"/>
they have not the grace in their
troubles to plead this unto him.
Why Lord, though I bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
sonne, and am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be called thy servant, yet
<hi>I am thy creature,</hi> though a sinfull
one. Surely had we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>faith,</hi> wee

                     </gap>
windes about and fastens upon
every little help; <hi>faith</hi> will see
day at a little hole, and where it
sees any thing, it will catch at
it; as the <hi>woman of Canaan;</hi> Christ
cals her <hi>Dog;</hi> why, be it so Lord,
<hi>I am a dogg,</hi> yet I am one of the
family, though I be a <hi>Dogge;</hi>
therefore <hi>have mercy on me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh, it is a sweet reasoning, thus
to cling about God, and gather
upon him; it is a speciall art of
<hi>faith.</hi> Though a carnall man may
reason thus, (as having a ground
from the truth of the thing) yet
hee hath not grace to reason out
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2556:262"/>
of an affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereunto; though
hee should say, <hi>Lord, I am thy
Creature;</hi> yet his heart tels him
thus, (if hee would hearken to
it) I am thy creature Lord, but
I have made all my members
that I have received from thee,
instruments to sinne against
thee, and I purpose not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme:
My <hi>tongue</hi> is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of swearing, lying and
prophane speeches; my <hi>hands</hi>
are instruments of bribery and
violence, continually working
mischiefe in thy sight; my <hi>feete</hi>
carry me to such and such filthy
places, and abominable courses;
mine owne heart tels mee that I
fight against thee my <hi>Creator,</hi>
with those very limbes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
which thou hast given me.
Beloved, the conscience of this
so stifles the voyce of a wilfull
sinner, that (not withstanding he
acknowledgeth himselfe to bee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2556:263"/>
Gods creature, yet) hee cannot
with any comfort plead for
mercy at his hand in times of
distresse.</p>
                  <p>But to a right godly man this
is an argument of speciall use
and consequence; in the midst
of troubles he may alleage this,
and it binds God to helpe him.
Wee see <hi>great ones</hi> when they
raise any, (though perhaps there
is little merit in them, yet) they
call them their <hi>Creatures,</hi> and
this is a moving argument with
such to polish their owne worke
still, and not to desert them:
Will it not be a prevailing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
with God then, for a
Christian to pleade with him?
Lord, thou hast raised mee out
of nothing, yea, out of a state
worse than nothing; I am thy
poore <hi>Creature,</hi> forsake not the
work of thine owne hands. We
may see what a fearefull thing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2556:263"/>
                     <hi>sinne</hi> is in Gods eye, that the
works of <hi>our hands</hi> should make
God depart from the worke of
<hi>his hands,</hi> as hee will certainely
doe at the day of judgement,
<hi>Depart you cursed, &amp;c.</hi> though we
bee his <hi>creatures,</hi> yet because
wee have not used those gifts
and abilities which hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us to serve his Majesty; hee
will not indure the sight of us
in that day.</p>
                  <p>But that you may the better
practise this <hi>duty</hi> of committing
your soules to God, take these
directions.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Directions how to commit our soules to, God.</note> see that thou bee thy
owne man, it is an act of persons
<hi>free</hi> to covenant; our soules must
bee <hi>ours</hi> before wee can commit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
them to God. Naturally wee
are all slaves to <hi>Sathan,</hi> the <hi>Strong
man</hi> hath <hi>possession</hi> of us, and
therefore our first care must bee
to get out of his <hi>bondage;</hi> to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2556:264"/>
which purpose we should much
eye the sweet promises and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Gospell, alluring
us to accept of mercy and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from sinne and death,
as, <hi>Come unto mee all you that are
weary and heavy laden, &amp;c.</hi> and so
cast the guilt of our soules upon
God to <hi>pardon</hi> first, and then to
<hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>cleanse,</hi> that we may
no more <hi>returne to folly,</hi> but lead
an unspotted life before him for
the time to come.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a silly course
and dangerous, which poore
worldly wretches take, who
think <hi>Lord have mercy upon them,</hi>
will serve their turne, and that
God will certainly save their
soules, when as they were never
yet in the state of <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi>
with him, nor never had
any <hi>divorce</hi> made betweene
them and their sinnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
never any <hi>league</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:2556:264"/>
betweene God and their soules
to this day.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, when once a man
hath alienated his soule from
God by sinne, hee hath <hi>then</hi> no
more command of it, for the
present it is quite out of his
power; Now when wee would
commit our soules to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
wee must first commit
them to him to pardon the guilt
of sinne in them; when this is
done, God wil give us our soules
againe, and then they may truly
bee said to bee our owne, and
not before. It is the happinesse
of a Christian that hee is not
his <hi>owne,</hi> but that whether hee
<hi>live</hi> or <hi>die</hi> he is the <hi>Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second place,<note place="margin">Direction 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee must
labour to finde our selves in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God;</hi> that is, <hi>to finde him
making good his promises to us;
and our selves making good our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to him;</hi> For a man cannot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2556:265"/>
commit himselfe to God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee finde a disposition in
his heart to bee <hi>faithfull</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>passive</hi> fidelity, and
an <hi>active.</hi> 1. Passive faithfulnesse
is in the things that wee give
<hi>trust</hi> unto, as, such a one is a sure
trusty man, therefore I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
upon him. 2. Active faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
in the soule, is, when we
cast our selves upon a man that
is trusty, and depend upon him;
the more a man knowes another
to be <hi>faithfull,</hi> the more faithful
hee will bee in trusting of him:
and thus wee must trust God if
ever wee expect any good at
his hands; and our dependance
on <hi>him</hi> bindes him to bee the
more faithfull to us. He is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a wicked man <hi>indeed</hi> that
will deceive the trust commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him; <hi>Trust</hi> begets sidelity,
it makes a good man the more
<hi>faithfull,</hi> when hee knowes hee is
<hi>trusted.</hi>

Learne therefore to know
thy selfe to be in covenant with
God, and to trust him with all
thou hast; traine up thy selfe in
a continuall dependance upon
him. Hee that trusts God with
his <hi>soule,</hi> will trust him every
day, in every thing hee hath
or doth; hee knowes well, that
whatsoever he enjoyes is not his
owne but Gods, and this stirres
him up to commit all his waies
and doings to his protection, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
nothing safe but what
the Lord keeps;<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 23.</note> He sees <hi>it is not

his <hi>estate,</hi> his <hi>calling,</hi> his <hi>family,</hi>
whatsoever is neare and deare
unto him to the blessed gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and direction of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
Oh (thinkes he) that I

                  <p>

                  <p>How behovefull it is for
Christians thus to inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to bee acquainted with

how can a man trust God with

the petty things of this life?
<hi>They that give to the poore</hi> are

wee cast our bread upon the waters,
wee shall finde it againe.</hi> Beloved,
hee that parts with any thing to
relieve a poore Saint, and will
not trust God with his promise
to recompence it againe, but

thinkes all is gone, and hee shall

who hath promised to

resigne up your soules to him. A

come what will, whether God
will save him or no, hee will not
breake the peace of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or doe the least evill; hee
is no foole, but foresees what
may befall him for well doing;
this inconvenience may come
&amp; that trouble, yet he sets light

and sees more good to

him his beeing of nothing; and
more good for the time to

there can be ill in the <hi>creature:</hi>
therefore come what can come

his heart is fixed to trust the

displease him, desert his honour

himselfe to God in the greatest
dangers.</p>
                  <p>The ground hereof is this,<note place="margin">Reason of trusting in God.</note>
                     <hi>A Christian is the wisest man in the

hee sees there is a greater good

to offend God to please the
creature, because there is a

his best good in his union with

And thus hee doth wisely, for
hee knowes, if hee lose his life
he shall have a better life of
God than hee hath in his body;
for God is his life, God is his
soule and his comfort, and hee
hath his beeing from God, hee is
his <hi>Creator,</hi> and hee hath a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being in God when hee dyes
than he had when he lived: for
our beeing in God makes us
happy, and therefore Christ
saith, <hi>He that loves his life,</hi> before

and <hi>hee that hates his life</hi> when
Christ cals for it, <hi>loves it,</hi> for hee

                  <p>A true Christian hath his eye

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2556:285"/>
thinkes nothing too good for
God; O Lord, (saith he) of thee
I have received this <hi>life,</hi> this <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
this <hi>credit</hi> and reputation

<hi>selfe,</hi> of my <hi>strength,</hi> thou shalt
have it: If thou wilt serve thy

I will adventure it for thee;
If thou wilt have my life, of thee
I had it, to thee I will restore it,
I will not limit thy Majesty,

to thy wisedome, use mee and
mine as thou wilt, onely be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

goe well with <hi>that,</hi> and I care

exceedingly honour his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,

and cause him to honour us,
and to shew his presence to us
for our good, which hee will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
doe, if we absolutely

kept from <hi>this</hi> danger or that

God, will doe it generally to all

his <hi>trust</hi> extends; hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

hee commits his <hi>estate, liberty,</hi>

Hee can never relye on God

saith, Lord, though it is not in
