            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon a time, walking by my ſelfe, I fell into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of my former life, and of all the miſeries that befell me, either by my inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſſe and raſhneſſe, or Gods juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for my ſins. And although I added weight to ſome of thoſe croſſes, by taking them more heavily then I ought to have done; Yet I found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing crucifi'd me ſo much as my long and tedious going to the Schoole; how many ſhowers of teares? how many ſtreams of blood? And I was cuffed, as if the Meſſenger of <hi>Satan</hi> had beene ſent to buffit me; and after two ſeaven years ſpent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in this <hi>Bride-well,</hi> ſo that I was nineteene or twenty yeares of age, I could not underſtand ſo much <hi>Latine</hi> as a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165450:2"/>
Child, nor ſpeak ſo much as a ſpelling Child; Methought it was ſtrange, that a Child ſhould ſuck in more with Milke, then I ſhould get with ſo many drops of Blood, having ſo much advantage of yeares, but ſome will ſay, it may be you were very dull in learning, if I were never ſo dull, nor never ſo ſtupid, nor never ſo blockiſh; was this cruelty a way to quicken me? But ſome will ſay, wee know the miſery's ſo great, that many of us had rather have our Children ignorant then learn with ſo much torment: Therefore the time will be better ſpent by me in ſhowing the remedy, and that is my task at this preſent.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Remedy.</hi> One remedy againſt this Epidemicall diſeaſe is, let a Boy learn his Grammer <hi>Aſchams</hi> way, which way thoſe learned Schooles beyond Seas doe highly commend, that is, to underſtand within Booke, and to apply every neceſſary Rule: It makes no matter whether he can ſay his Grammer word by word without Booke or no; if he can give the ſence without Booke, and turne to the Rule within Booke, it is ſufficient; No Univerſity man, no great Scholler, can ſay his Grammer word by word without Booke, no, not the Maſter himſelfe; and yet he whips the Schollers for that he cannot doe himſelf; If a man remember there is ſuch a Rule, or ſuch a ſence of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it ſuffices: No Grammer have the ſame words, the ſenſe is all wee looke for; and ſo ſoone as wee come to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity wee forget to ſay our Rules word by word without book, may, ſcorn and deride him that doth it. Thus this many yeares great labour is loſt in a moneth or two, and is ſo farre from profiting, that it becomes rediculous. Conſider alſo, the Grammers which were before <hi>Lilly,</hi> were ſome of them almoſt as bigge as a Church-Bible, if you take out the Apocrypha and Common-Prayer. Now to learne theſe word by word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Booke, was a taske paſſing the patience of an Aſſe; Upon this <hi>Eraſmus</hi> concludeth, that Grammer it ſelfe is enough to make a man ſpend his whole life in tortures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcham,</hi> in his firſt Book hath theſe words; ſo as the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-booke be alwayes in the Schollers hand, and alſo uſed of him as a Dictionary for every preſent uſe, this is a lively and perfect way for teaching of Rules, where the common way u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165450:2"/>
in common Schooles, to reade the Grammer alone by it ſelfe, is tedious for the Maſter, hard for the Sholler, cold and uncomfortable fur them both.</p>
            <p>Now you ſee according to <hi>Aſcham,</hi> the Grammer muſt be uſed as a Dictionary, and he that knowes any thing, knowes that a Dictionary is not to be learned word by word without Booke therefore not a Grammer: He tells you in this place, that it is tedious to a Scholler; let any man conſider who hath not the patience of an Aſſe, what a tedious thing it is to have all the Grammer or moſt part of it lapt up in his head word by word, and preſently to apply every Rule word by word, or elſe up he goes, if he were as good as <hi>George a Greene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read <hi>Aſcham</hi> in his ſecond Booke, theſe are his words; I remember when I was young, in the <hi>North</hi> there went to the Grammer-ſchoole little Children, they came from thence great Lubbars, always learning and little profiting, learning without booke every thing, underſtanding within book little or nothing; their whole knowledge by learning without the booke was tyed only to their tongue and lips, and never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up to the braine and head; and therefore was ſoone ſpit out of the mouth againe; they were as men alwayes going, but ever out of the way; and why? For their whole labour, or rather great toyle without order, was even vaine idleneſſe without profit; Indeed they tooke great paines about lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but imployed ſmall labour in learning; when by this way preſcribed in this Booke, being ſtrait, plain and eaſie, the Scholler is alwayes labouring with pleaſure, and ever going on forward with profit. Here this Scholler famous all over Chriſtendome, and the glory of his Kingdom for Languages, tells you learning without booke, was vain idleneſſe without profit; He tells you, they tooke great paines about learning, but imployed ſmall labour in learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> the reſtorer of the Fathers Greeke and Latine, the greateſt Writer in his time, incomperable for Wit, Learning, and Eloquence, hath the ſame words; ſome make it their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care to learne the Rules word by word without book, which thing ſaith he, I allow not of, for it is great paines to no purpoſe, nor profit all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:165450:3"/>
               <hi>Brinſley,</hi> a famous Schoole-Maſter in his Booke called, A <hi>Conſolation for our Grammer Schooles,</hi> writes of one Maſter <hi>Tovey</hi> a Schoole-maſter equall to the beſt, that teaching <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chums</hi> way; that is, only the ſenſe of the Rules, brought a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman to a perfection beyond all expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comenins,</hi> a man admired for his quickneſſe in teaching the Languages, hath writ ſharply againſt this dog-bolt way; Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the learned men who have ſought to take away the ſervitude and ſlavery that Youth hath undergone; ſome Authors I have quoted in my Animadverſions upon <hi>Cambdens</hi> Greeke Grammer, made for the uſe of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Schoole, and I have ſhewed, and I will ſhew more hereafter;</p>
            <p>That it is a falſe, obſcure, imperfect Gammer, abounding with above twelve groſſe errors, beſides many little ones; and thoſe who are Schoole: maſters of great Schooles, and make men beleeve they know much, when alas it is very little they know; they might bluſh if they had any ſhame, to let ſo many errours goe uncorrected in a Grammer, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Language; If Foundations be falſe and rotten, what will the building be? I need not ſpend much time upon this point, becauſe I have repreſented in a Comedy often acted by my Schollers, the Cruelty, Folly, and Non-ſenſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon School-maſters, which I intend to Print as ſoon as I can.</p>
            <p>Looke upon <hi>Aſchams</hi> ſucceſſe in this way, in his firſt booke he ſpeakes thus of Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> It is your ſhame, I ſpeake to you all (you young Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi>) that one Maid ſhould goe beyond you all in excellency of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge of divers tongues; point forth ſix of the beſt given Gentlemen of this Court, and they altogether ſhew not ſo much, will not ſpend ſo much time, beſtow not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houres, dayly, orderly and conſtantly, for the increaſe of Learning and Knowlidge as doth the Queenes Majeſty here: Yea, I beleeve th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165450:3"/>
both wittily with head, and faire with hand, as ſcarce one or two rare Wits in both the Univerſities have in many yeares reached unto. Among all the Benefits that God hath bleſſed me withall, next the knowledge of Chriſts true Religion, I count this the greateſt, that it pleaſed God to cal me to be one poore Miniſter in ſetting forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe excellent Gifts of Learning in this moſt excellent Prince.</p>
            <p>Looke upon his ſucceſſe in his ſecond Booke, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, one <hi>Witney,</hi> a moſt accompliſhed Gentleman, theſe are his words; I gave him a tranſlation to turne into Latine, which he did ſo choiſely, ſo orderly, without any great miſſe in the hardeſt points of Grammer, that ſome in ſeven yeares in Grammer-ſchooles, yea, and ſome in the Univerſities too, cannot doe halfe ſo well: and this perfection be obtained from Chriſtmas to Alhallowes-tide, &amp; this Scholler was altogether ignorant of the Latine Tongue and the Rules before.</p>
            <p>Now briefly take ſome few Reaſons againſt this way of ſaying word by word without Booke.</p>
            <p>All Arts, as Geometree, Arithmetick, Logick, Navigation, men attaine too, and never learne Rule word by word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, and what offence hath Grammer done that it muſt be cuft into a Boy word by word without booke?</p>
            <p>If learning without booke word by word be neceſſary for the underſtanding of a thing, then it is before a Boy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands or after he underſtands. Now for a Boy to learne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke like a Parret, that he underſtands not, is very labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and rediculous; and to learne without booke after he underſtands, that is to no purpoſe; for the Maſter underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe the ſenſe of the Rule, neglects ſaying word by word without booke, and whips Shollers for that he cannot doe himſelfe: If ſaying without book word by word be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the underſtanding, then he that ſaith beſt without booke underſtands beſt, but this is falſe; there are many that can ſay much Scripture without book, but underſtand not ſo well as thoſe that can ſay none.</p>

            <p>Obſerve Doctor <hi>Webs</hi> words, in his appeale to truth, now if Gammer ſhould be the beſt courſe to Languages, and Kings may have their choice of beſt courſes, I wonder what Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were made by <hi>Mithridates?</hi> and that makes me wonder more, we that have no buſineſſe but a Language, ſpend all our life and are not perfect in one, and he that had a Kingdoms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to look upon, had two and tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nty compleat Languages.</p>
            <p>Now if a Language cannot be got but by learning word for word without book, then <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who had a Kingdomes affairs to look to, muſt learn two &amp; twentie Grammars, word by word without booke; and to learne a Grammer in this manner, will take up five yeares, to be compleat in a Language as he was wil be at leaſt five years more, which reckoned, make up two hundred and twentie yeares. Now <hi>Mithridates</hi> lived not a quarter of the time. Doctor <hi>Webbe</hi> in that learned work quotes above a hundred learned men, who envey bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Grammarians, and he undertakes to prove by learned Authors, that a Language may be learned without a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which needs no proofe at all to men of common ſenſe. How many are there that can ſpeake French and Latine that never ſaw a Grammar? Many young Gentlemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165450:4"/>
have learned to ſpeake French in halfe a yeare, who never knew any Latine.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Webbe</hi> names many Noblemen who ſpeake Latine excellent well at five yeares of age, having nothing but Latine ſpoken to them before.</p>
            <p>And I have knowne many, who ſpoke Latine and French admirable well, and underſtood Greeke very well in a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth. And this is eaſily done, by joyning Doctor <hi>Webbes</hi> way with <hi>Aſchams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had Boyes when I was in London, who had beene but one yeare at moſt with me, and in theſe foure points we challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any Schoole in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who underſtands the Greeke and Latine Grammers beſt in Accents, and Dialects, and all things neceſſary</p>
            <p>Secondly, who underſtands a Greek and Latin Authour beſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, who can prove a Greeke or Latine Verſe beſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, who can make a Greeke or Latine Oration, or a Greeke and Latine Verſe beſt and ſooneſt; and the higheſt of my Schollars was but fifteene yeares of age, and the ſecond to him but ten.</p>
            <p>Some I had I confeſſe, could not doe a quarter ſo much, which was no fault of mine; For I often told them, if they were careleſſe and would not mind, and would not learne without cuffling, pulling, lugging and whipping, they muſt goe to Maſters that delight in this way of teaching; They may be taught in many places very reaſonably this way, as for a noble or ſeven ſhillings a quarter, at ſome Free-Schooles they may have it for nothing. Some Schoole-Maſters thinke they pay me home, when they ſay I make Schollers unfit for other Schooles; truly I conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it, I teach without any correction, and they teach with correction, and in this we differ.</p>
            <p>We teach to underſtand the Rules firſt, and they teach to learne without booke firſt, in this we differ; Our Schollers underſtanding the Rules, and often applying them, the Rules come without booke, whether they will or no. Then we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſeverity.</p>
            <p>Some keepe their Schollers ſo ſtrictly for four or five houres that they allow them not ſo much as a mouthfull of freſh aire,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165450:5"/>
not ſo much as to eaſe nature: I have read, and heard many Schollers ſpeake againſt this ſeveritie. Let a Boy be tyed three or four hours to that Game he likes beſt, and let him be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuft and whipped when he doth not play his Game well, you ſhall ſee this Boy as weary of his play as his Booke, and the reaſon is, becauſe of great ſeverity.</p>

                  </gap>es</hi> the wiſeſt man of his time, and many who have writ concerning the inſtruction of youth, often ſay, Learning muſt be taught with Love: and ſome Schollers at <hi>London</hi> being thus taught, ſeriouſly profeſſe they had rather come to Schoole, then goe about any pleaſure or delight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remedyes</hi> 3. Firſt, there are three things moſt neceſſary in a Language, the Words, the Stile, and the Rule; For the words a Boy may eaſily learne a thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> words in ten dayes, that is, a hundred words in a day. Suppoſe a man allow an houre for twentie words, in five houres he learneth a hundred words. I have taught ſome that have learned a hundred words in an houre, but I doe not meane after the ſilly Fuſtian way of learning in the common Schooles, to ſay them all by rote like a Parriot; but let him have an hundred Engliſh words, and a hundred Latine words printed or writ, he ſhall tell you Latine for Engliſh, and this is the Latine I meane; and he that underſtandeth a thouſand, muſt needs underſtand many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more, for many <hi>Derivatives, Compounds, De-compounds,</hi> are underſtood by the helpe of the <hi>Simples,</hi> and he that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands thus much will underſtand moſt Authors he reades.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remedy</hi> 2. Secondly, for ſtile take this example; there is a certaine Bird called a <hi>Dotterell,</hi> this Bird if you ſee him thruſt out his right wing, thruſt you out your right arme, and if he thruſt out his left leg, thruſt out yours; and thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by imitating of him, you will come ſo neere till you take him in your hands; and ſo in an Author, where you ſee him place his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective, Adverb</hi> or <hi>Conjunction,</hi> doe you ſo too, and by this imitation you will catch the ſtrain of your Author, and come to a great perfection, if you imitate but ſix leavs in a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you may doe in ſix dayes, then you may come neere the ſtraine of your Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remedy</hi> 3. For the Rules teach thus, Conſider there are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:165450:5"/>
eight parts of ſpeech, for the foure that are undeclined, I bid my Scholler take very little care, becauſe they are not varied nor declined at all; you find them every where after the ſame manner. Of the other foure, I bid him take care but of two, that is, a <hi>Nowne</hi> and a <hi>Verb,</hi> for a <hi>pronoune</hi> is much like a <hi>noune,</hi> know one, know the other; a <hi>Participle</hi> that takes part of a <hi>Noune</hi> &amp; a <hi>Verbe,</hi> both thoſe known, the <hi>Participle</hi> is known.</p>
            <p>So here is but two chiefly to be cared for, that is, a <hi>Noune</hi> and a <hi>Verb,</hi> but be ſure to underſtand the definition of every part of Speech, not word by word without Booke, but the ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>I cannot follow this point any further, take ſome <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſition</hi> firſt, My councell is to take away al the Revenus that belong to Free-Schooles, and other Schools, and let it be committed to a Treaſurer, and every one in any part of the Kingdome that makes a Scholler fit for the Univerſity, hee ſhall have ten pounds out of the Common ſtock, and the Scholler preferred, &amp; if he make him fit to be an Apprentice to a Chyrurgion or a Lawyers Clark, he ſhal have five pounds, by this means none ſhall have any mony but thoſe that deſerve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> ſecond, Let any man judge whether they or I teach the beſt; was it ever knowne that any Graduate in the Univerſity, or Maſter of Art, Phyſitian, Lawyer, ever came to their School-Maſters to better themſelves in the Languages, whereas all my gaines and practice many times in the yeare, have been chiefly by theſe men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> third, Their Schollers before they go to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity come to me a Moneth or two to be oyled over, &amp; profeſſe they profited more in that time with me, then they did before in foure Yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> fourth, they will make a man believe that a Boy is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and able to make Theams and Verſes; now theſe Boys can neither ſpeake Latine, nor underſtand an Author; and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think a man to be a Freench Poet, when he cannot ſpeake French, or a good Orator when he cannot underſtand it, theſe Verſes are onely patched up of phraſes (a meere deluſion) ſee more of this in my ſix quoeries to the Free-Schooles, in and about <hi>London,</hi> printed three yeares agoe, and not yet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:165450:6"/>
At that time had I followed my blow, the Free-Schools had been abſolutely routed, and never able to rally or recruit againe: and I ſet up a Challenge in the <hi>Exchange,</hi> to all the Schooles in <hi>London</hi> or thereabouts ſeaven to ſeaven, which ſtood nine dayes. Our Schoole ſtood open to all examination for one whole yeare, and when the beſt Schollers of one of the primeſt Schooles in <hi>London</hi> contended with ours, there was a Gentleman of the Innes of Court, that delivered in a Latin Speech, <hi>Vobis laudem, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llis palman tribuo;</hi> I give you praiſe (ſaith he) to the Schollers of that great Schoole, but I give Maſter <hi>Granthams</hi> Schollers the Victory. All that I ſhall ſay in this great haſt is; I deſire that there may be an act of Oblivion of the abuſes and miſtakes of both parties, and that wee may all joyne together, and ſtudy Reformation of the Schooles, that Schoole-maſters may no longer make Merchandize of the precious time of Youth, which is of that great height, that it is many times the deſtruction of Soule and Body; and if the ſin of ſcandall ſhall deſerve the weight of a Mill-ſtone; what ſhall he deſerve that keepes Youth many yeares in teaching, and can ſhew no progreſſe to the purpoſe: Imployment now cuts me off, but I ſhould be happy in <hi>London,</hi> before Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have a diſpute with theſe Schoole-maſters, and that there may be an account taken of every Boy that goes to Schoole, what he is when he goes, and how much he hath profited when he comes away.</p>
            <p>I Will undertake in two Monethes, to make him that can reade Engliſh, to conſter an Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Latine and Greeke, he ſhall make Greeke and Latine Verſes and Orations, and his progreſſe in Hebrew ſhall be correſpondent; and becauſe men may thinke that a man doeth this for Mony, I will deſire but two ſhillings a day whilſt I teach, for the publike good, and al the reſt ſhall goe for charitable uſes, only I deſire that I may make choyce of what kind of charity the Mony may be beſtowed on.</p>
            <p>Now to that God that hath commanded love and charity amongſt us, be all Honour, and Glory for ever, &amp;c.</p>
