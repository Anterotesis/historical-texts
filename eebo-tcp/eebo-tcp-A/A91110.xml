            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Propoſitions of Accommodation For the compoſing of the preſent Differences between His Majeſtie and the Parliament.</head>
            <p>IN theſe unhappy diſtractions, and miſapprehenſions between His Majestie and this preſent Parliament, fomented and originally occaſioned by the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancie of an adverſe party within this Kingdom, and the unadviſed Councels of many ill-affected perſons neer unto the King; there yet remains a generall Concurrence of loyall and affectionate hearts unto His Majestie, who with all their ſoules deſire, both by their publike endeavours, and their private prayers unto God, (by whom all Kings do reign, and from whom only all power is derived) to reconcile and accommodate theſe Differences; thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inveſt His Majeſtie in the intire and hearty affections of all His Subjects, and to poſſeſſe themſelves again of His gracious favour and good opinion, that ſo there may be a bleſſed reconcilement of all ſuch Differences as have unhappily violated the long ſetled peace and quiet Government of this flouriſhing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And for the more effectuall and ſpeedy conſummation of this generally deſired bleſſing of peace and proſperity to His Majestie and His People, theſe few Propoſitions are here humbly preſented to the conſiderations of both Houſes of Parliament, by him that daily prays for the honour, ſafety, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of His Majestie, and the peace of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T plainly appearing by the late Declaration made in Parliament, That the Commiſſion of Array is againſt the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, and that His Majeſty is graciouſly pleaſed to declare His reſolution, to govern His people onely by the Law; That His Majeſtie would be now pleaſed, for the more apparant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion of that His Royall purpoſe, to re-call His ſaid Commiſsion, and all Inſtructions and commands which have been given therein.</p>
            <p n="2">II. His Majeſty having acknowledged, That in theſe times of danger the Propoſition made unto Him by both Houſes of Parliament for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> was very fit, thereby to put the Kingdom into a poſture of defence, and hath alſo approved of ſuch perſons for the ordering of the ſame, who have been nominated by the Parliament, That he would be graciouſly pleaſed to give His Royall aſſent to an Act of Parliament for the eſtabliſhing thereof for two yeers, which after may be continued or laid down again, as the neceſsity of the times ſhall then require.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That all ſuch perſons ſo nominated by the Parliament, and approved of by His Majeſtie to be Lieutenants in every County for the ordering of the <hi>Militia,</hi> may receive their Commiſsions onely from His Majeſtie, with a Proviſo that they ſhall not be diſplaced, nor their power taken from them, but by conſent of Parliament, thereby to preſerve the Honour of His Majeſtie, and to remove alſo all doubts and fears from His Subjects.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That no Commiſsions either for the Array or <hi>Militia,</hi> which have been made or given by the King or Parliament, may be further executed, but that all Arms ſhall be laid down untill the <hi>Militia</hi> be ſerled by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That a generall Pardon may be granted in ſuch manner as His Majeſtie hath been moſt graciouſly pleaſed to offer unto all His Subjects.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That a particular Declaration in that Act may be made, that neither Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> nor any other perſon ſhall be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for any act done in obedience to the directions and command of both Houſes of Parliament, or which hath been ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and approved of by them.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That the Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> with all the Arms and Ammunition removed from thence, may be delivered into the actuall and peaceable poſſeſſion of His Majeſtie, and that His Majeſtie would be then pleaſed to commit the government thereof, with the ſaid Arms, unto ſuch other perſon which both Houſes of Parliament ſhall nominate; and that no ſuch Governour ſhall be diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor the Arms removed, but by conſent of Parliament, And that <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and all other Towns of ſtrength may be in like manner diſpoſed of.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That all the Lords and Members of the Houſe of Commons that are now with the King, ſhall preſently repair to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall houſes, and not be queſtioned for their abſence.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That His Majeſtie would be pleaſed to return again to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> or ſome other place neer His City of <hi>London,</hi> there to make His reſidence as formerly He hath done, thereby to revive the dejected hearts of His afflicted Subjects, who have thus unhappily been deprived of the comfort and honour of His Royall preſence.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That all diſtractions and miſapprehenſions may be removed by the happy concurrence of his Majeſtie with the Parliament, whereby ſuch good Laws may be made, as may conduce to the eſtabliſhing of a ſetled peace in the whole State.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the relief of the diſtreſſed Proteſtants, his Majeſties faithfull and loyall Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be ſpeedily reſolved on, and their wants ſupplyed, for the ſuppreſſing of the Rebellious Papiſts in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That all abuſes in the Church may be removed in a more perfect Reformation in Diſcipline and Ceremonies, by an aſſembly of ſuch learned Divines as ſhall be named to that purpoſe by both houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And the God of Heaven and Earth bleſſe His Majestie in this happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with His Parliament, and all His people, that we and all our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may ever bleſſe His name, from whom onely every good and perfect gift proceeds.</p>
