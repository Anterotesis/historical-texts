            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Letting pass matters not in controversie, I come to the main drift of your Sermon, <hi>the King;</hi> which word here is either to signifie any supreme Magistrate, or else your latter object of fear is not universal, belongs not at all to many parts of Christendom, that have no King; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, not to us. That we have no King since the putting down of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in this Commonwealth, is manifest by this last Parlament, who to the time of thir dissolving not only made no address at all to any King, but summond this next to come by the Writ formerly appointed of a free Commonwealth, without restitution or the least mention of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right or power; which could not be, if there were at present any King of <hi>England.</hi> The main part therefore of your Sermon, if it mean a King in the usual sense, is either impertinent and absurd, exhorting your auditory to fear that which is not; or if King here be, as it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood for any supreme Magistrate, by your own exhortation they are in the first place not to <hi>meddle</hi> with you, as being your self most of all the <hi>seditious</hi> meant here, and the <hi>desirous of change,</hi> in stirring them up to <hi>fear</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> whom the present Government takes no notice of.</p>
            <p>NOt to contend about the <hi>Large,</hi> or <hi>Limited</hi> Sense of the word KING: since 'tis agreed upon, at all hands, to signify <hi>Supreme Authority;</hi> and, where a <hi>Single Person governs,</hi> to denote the <hi>Monarch.</hi> The issue rests upon this Point: <hi>Is</hi> there, or <hi>is there not</hi> at present, any King of <hi>England?</hi> You say, <hi>No;</hi> I'm of another mind: Compare our Reasons.</p>
            <p>You Argue; <hi>First, the Putting down of Kingship;</hi> and <hi>then,—</hi>the Tacit <hi>confirmation</hi> of that <hi>Act,</hi> by the last <hi>Session:</hi> who <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Address to any King, or Restitution of any Kingly Right, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the next to come by the Writ formerly Appointed of a Free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To your Assumption, that <hi>Kingship was put down;</hi> I cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, till I am better satisfied, <hi>by what Authority: for no Form of Government can be altered, but by consent of all the Parties to it.</hi> In short, the late <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Destroy'd, Kingship Abolish'd,</hi> the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords Disauthoris'd,</hi> and at least 7. parts of 8. of the <hi>Commons Members secluded—by the same Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come to your <hi>Inference</hi> now; <hi>That,</hi> halts of all four, <hi>There</hi>

               <hi>was no King, because they did not mention him:</hi> you are a little bold methinks, to lay your <hi>Brat</hi> at the <hi>Parliament Door:</hi> and Father your opinions upon <hi>them,</hi> that in the case, would not declare their <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reasons of <hi>State,</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Convenierce,</hi> might very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move them to suspend. Suppose they thought it <hi>Prudence</hi> to refer all to the next Convention, without so much as a Debate; whether a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>No:</hi> and upon this point of extreme necessity (the Nation running headlong, into another War without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose of a new Representative) rather dispence with something of Informality in the Writs, than otherwise to hazzard the main Issue of the Publique weal. If all this be not yet enough, I hope the re-minding the <hi>Nation</hi> of the COVENANT; and their <hi>own</hi> refusal of the Oath of ABJURATION, will content you.</p>
            <p>Your 4th Page, runs away in some mistakes concerning <hi>Gideon;—</hi>(a Person, <hi>Call'd</hi> and set apart by God himself; guided by Divine <hi>Inspirations;</hi> and Acting without Partnership, the work he was employ'd upon)</p>
            <p>A little further, you deny the King, <hi>the Power of life and death;</hi> urging <hi>[Page</hi> 4.] <hi>that 'tis against the declared Judgements of our Parliaments, nay of our Laws;</hi> which <hi>reserve to themselves only the power of life and death, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'LL not deny, but a Parliament is above the King: (That is: The King is greater in Conjunction with his two <hi>Houses,</hi> than by <hi>Himself)</hi> but still this weakens not the force of my assertion; which is; that Kings must necessarily have that power: <hi>without</hi> it, they're no Kings (and 'tis the same thing in all Governments whatsoever, 'tis one of the Prerogatives Inseparable from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority) But since you urge <hi>the Declar'd Judgements of our Parliaments,</hi> in favour of your opinion, I should be glad to see them.</p>
            <p>Now for the Laws; 'tis true; they Pronounce Life, or Death; but the King's left at Liberty to Take, or to Remit the forfeiture, at pleasure. Enough is said of this.</p>
