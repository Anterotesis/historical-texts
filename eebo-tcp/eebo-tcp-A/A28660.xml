         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62799:3"/>
lived one <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> a Civill Lawyer, an Advocate of great rank and eſteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of known learning, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence; of great experience; of carriage circumſpect and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; his ſpeech grave and compoſed; his countenance ſharpe and auſtere; every way befitting that authority wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was advanced; endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with outward bleſſings, of wife, and eleven children, and wealth in abundance: what his worſt parts were, I have no other warrant then his own words, which (if not tainted overmuch with the bitterneſs of a deſperate minde, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the countenance rather of paſſion, then of ſober confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) may ſeem to adde a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to all further commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>

               <q rend="margQuotes">I was <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> exceſsive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covetous of mony, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I applied my ſelf to get by injuſtice, corrupting ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by deceit, inventing tricks to delude juſtice: good cauſes I either defended deceitfully, or ſold them to the adverſary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly; ill cauſes I maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all my might; I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly oppoſed the known truth, and the truſt commuted unto mee, I either betrayed or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</q> Thus having worn out forty four yeares, or there abouts, and the news of the new, or rather newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> comming into thoſe parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented an object of novelty unto him; who being as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know, as he was famous for knowledg; ſuffered not theſe wandring opinions to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62799:4"/>
paſs unexamined; but ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Scriptures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all books of Controverſie that he could get, both old and new; and finding more then fame or opinion, he began to taſte their nature ſo well, as he entertains, loves, and ownes them at length; and with ſuch zeal, as he became a profeſſor, yea a teacher of them; firſt to his wife, children, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and after to his friends, and familiar acquaintance; and in compariſon, ſeemed to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all other affaires; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ever to preſs this main point, that <hi>We muſt wholly, and only depend one the free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love of God in the death of Chriſt, as the only ſure way to ſalvation</hi>: and this was the ſumme of all his diſcourſe: and this continued for the ſpace
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62799:4"/>
of ſix years, or thereabouts; even ſo long as this fire could keep it ſelf within private walles; but at length, it brake forth into publique meetings; ſo as the whole Province of <hi>Padua</hi> dawned by the luſtre thereof. The Clergie finding the trade of their pardons to decay; and their Purgatory to wax cold, began to be ſtirre themſelves; gloſing their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, firſt, with calumnious aſperſions upon the whole profeſſion; then more plainly ſtriking at <hi>Spira</hi> with grievous accuſation. And to effect their purpoſe, ſome promiſe labour, others favour, ſome advice, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers maintenance; all joyn to divide, either his ſoul from his body, or both from God.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Iohn Caſa,</hi> the Popes Legate, reſident at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62799:5"/>
being by birth a <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>; and one that wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malice againſt thoſe of this way, nor craftineſs to effect his malicious purpoſes; To him theſe men repaire with out-cries againſt <hi>Spira;</hi> that he was the man that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the received rites of the Church; deluded the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical power, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized the policie thereof; one of no meane rank; being a man of Account and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therunto, learned in the Scriptures, elegant in ſpeech; and in one word, a dangerous <hi>Lutheran</hi>; having alſo many diſciples, and therefore not to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>At this began the <hi>Legate</hi> to caſt his eye on the terrible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration that lately had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Germany</hi>; where, by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62799:5"/>
means of one onely <hi>Luther,</hi> the Romiſh Religion had ſuffered ſuch a blow, as that it could neither be cured by diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor defended by power; but the Clergy muſt either mend their manners, or loſe their dignities: on the other ſide, when he ſaw how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the common people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting in the bordering countries of <hi>Italy,</hi> were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoſe new opinions, he now thought it no time to diſpute, or perſwade; but with ſpeed repairs to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and procures authority from them to ſend for <hi>Spira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spira</hi> by this time had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with himſelf of the nature of his carriage, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and notorious it was, and therefore ſubject to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by ſuch, as neither liked
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62799:6"/>
his perſon nor religion; he perceived that his opinions were neither retired nor ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, but ſuch as aimed at the overthrow of at the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction, and a change of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie; wherein at the beſt, he could expect but a bloudy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and that his enemies wanted neither power nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to call him to account in publique: when he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtatize, and ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give his former life, yea his own conſcience, the lie, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the utmoſt malice of his deadly enemies; or forſake his wife, children, friends goods, authority; yea, his deare Country; and betake himſelf to a forraign peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there to endure a thouſand miſeries, that do continually wait upon a voluntary exile.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62799:6"/>
Being thus diſtracted, and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the reſtleſs waves of doubt, without guide to truſt to, or haven to fly to for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; on the ſuddain, Gods Spirit aſſiſting, he felt a calme, and began to diſcourſe with himſelf, in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why wandreſt thou thus in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, unhappy man? caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fear, put on thy ſhield, the ſhield of faith; Where is thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage, thy goodneſs, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy? reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that Chriſts glory lies at the ſtake: ſuffer thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, &amp; he will defend thee, he wil tel thee what thou ſhalt anſwer; he can beat down all danger, bring thee out of priſon, raiſe thee from the dead; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider</hi> Peter <hi>in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, the Martyres in the fire; if thou makeſt</hi> a <hi>good confeſsion, thou maieſt indeed go to priſon, or death but an eternal reward in heaven
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62799:7"/>
remaines for thee; What haſt thou in this world comparable to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, to everlaſting happineſs? if thou doeſt otherwiſe, think of the ſcandal; (common people live by example, thinking what ever is done, is well done;) fear the loſs of peace and joy, fear hell, death, and eternal wrath; or if thy fleſh bee ſo ſtrong, as to cauſe thee to doubt of the iſſue, fly thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; get thee away, though never ſo far, rather then deny the Lord of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Spira</hi> in reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quiet, being reſolved to yield to theſe weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet holding it wiſedom to examine all things, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults alſo with fleſh and bloud; thus the battaile doth renew, and the fleſh begins in this manner: <hi>Be well adviſed, fond man; conſider reaſons on both
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62799:7"/>
ſides, and then judge: how canſt thou thus overweene thine own ſufficiencie, as thou neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt the examples of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, nor the judgment of the whole Church; doeſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what miſery this thy raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will bring thee unto? thou ſhalt loſe all thy ſubſtance, gotten with ſo much care and travaile; thou ſhalt undergoe the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite torments that malice it ſelf can deviſe; thou ſhalt be counted an heretique of all: and to cloſe up all, thou ſhalt die ſhamefully. What thinkeſt thou of the loathſome ſtinking dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, the bloudy axe, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fagot? are they delightfull? Be wiſe at length, and keepe thy life and honour; thou maieſt live to do much good to good men, as God commands thee; thou maieſt be an ornament to thy Countrey;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62799:8"/>
and put caſe, thy Countries loſs would be of ſmall eſteem with thee; Wilt thou bring thy friends alſo into danger? thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten children, wilt thou now cut their throats, and inhumanely butcher them, which may in time bring honour to their Countrey, glory to God, help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his Church? goe to the Legate, weak man, freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thy fault, and help all theſe miſeries.</hi> Thus did the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, choak the good Seed that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſown; ſo as fearing, he faints, and yields unto the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of this preſent world; and being thus blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he goes to the Legate at <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſalutes him with this news.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having for theſe divers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62799:8"/>
yeares entertained an opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome Articles of faith, contrary to the Orthodox, and received judgment of the Church; and uttered many things againſt the authority of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Biſhop: I humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my fault and Errour, and my folly in miſleading others: I therefore yield my ſelf in all obedience, to the Supreame Biſhop, into the Boſome of the Church of Rome; never to depart again from the traditions and decrees of the holy See: I am heartily ſorry for what is paſt; and I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begge pardon for ſo great an offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Legate</hi> perceiving <hi>Spira</hi> to faint, he purſues him to the utmoſt; he cauſeth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of all his Errors to be drawn in writing, together
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62799:9"/>
with the Confeſſion annexed to it, and commands <hi>Spira</hi> to ſubſcribe his name there, which accordingly he did; then the <hi>Legate</hi> commands him to return to his own Towne; and there to declare this Confeſſion of his, and to acknowledg the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be holy, and true, and to abjure the Opinions of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other ſuch Teachers, as falſe, and heretical: <hi>Man knowes the beginning of ſinne, but who bounds the iſſues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Spira</hi> having once loſt footing, goes down a maine, he cannot ſtay, nor gain-ſay the <hi>Legate</hi>; but promiſeth to accompliſh his whole will and pleaſure: he ſoon addreſſeth himſelf for his Iourney: and being onward in the way, be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62799:9"/>
thinks himſelf of the large ſpoiles he had brought away, from the Conflict with the <hi>Legate</hi>: what glorious teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he had given of his great faith, and conſtancy in Chriſts cauſe: and to be plain, how impiouſly he had denied Chriſt, and his Goſpel at <hi>Venice</hi>; and what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do further in his own Countrey; and thus partly with feare, and partly with ſhame being confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he thought he heard a voyce ſpeaking unto him, in this manner.</p>

            <p>Now was <hi>Spira</hi> in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of doubt, not knowing which way to turn him, nor what to do: yet being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his own Country, and amongſt his friends, with ſhame enough he relates what he had done, and what he had further promiſed to do; and how the terror of God on the one ſide and the terror of this world on the other ſide, did continually rack him; and therefore he deſired of them advice in this ſo doubtfull a caſe: his friends upon ſmall deliberation anſwered; that it was requiſite he ſhould take heed that he did not in any wiſe betray his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all his friends into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62799:11"/>
danger, ſeeing that by ſo ſmall a matter as the reciting of a little Schedule, which might be done in leſs ſpace then halfe an hour, he might both free himſelf from preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and preſerve many that depended upon him: adding moreover, that he could get no Credit in relenting from that which he had already in greateſt part performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legate at <hi>Venice,</hi> and that in the perfect accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, little or no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite could ariſe, more then what by the former action al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he had ſuſtained: on the other ſide, if he did not perform his promiſe made to the Legate, he could neither diſcharge himſelf of the ſhame which he had already incurred; nor avoyd far

more heavy and inſupportable injuries, then probably hee ſhould have endured, if he had perſiſted obſtinately in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Opinions.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt blow of the battaile: and <hi>Spira</hi> utterly overcome, goes to the Praetor, and profers to perform his promiſe made to the Legate, who in the meane time, had taken order to have all things ready, and had ſent the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of abjuration ſigned by <hi>Spira,</hi> to the Praetor, by the hands of a certain Prieſt. All that night the miſerable man ware out with reſtleſs cares, without any minute of reſt; the next morning being come, he gets up, and being ready, he deſperately enters into the publique Congregation, where Maſs being finiſhed, in the

preſence of friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; being by eſtimation neer two thouſand people; yea, and of Heaven it ſelf, he recites that infamous abjuration, word for word, as it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: it being done, he was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at thirty pieces of gold, which he preſently paid: five whereof were given to the Prieſt that brought the abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the other twenty five were imployed towards the making of a <hi>Shryne</hi> to put the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in; then was he ſent home, reſtored to his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, goods, wife, and children: No ſooner was he departed, but he thought he heard a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voyce ſaying to him; <hi>Thou wicked wretch, thou haſt denied me, thou haſt renounced the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of thy obedience, thou haſt

            <p>Now began his friends
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62799:13"/>
ſome of them, to repent too late of their raſh counſel; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not looking ſo high as the Iudgment of God, laid all the blame upon his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke conſtitution; that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing his judgment, wrought in him a kind of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: every one cenſured as his fancie led him, yet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy all agreed in this, to uſe both the wholeſome help of Phyſitians, and the pious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veic of Divines, and therefore thought it meet to convey him to <hi>Padua,</hi> an Univerſity of note, where plenty of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of means was to be had: this they accordingly did, both with his wife, children, and whole family; others alſo of his friends accompanying him: and being arrived at the houſe of one <hi>Iames Ardin,</hi> in

ſhadowed the ſeat of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo corrupted it: this was the ſtate of his diſeaſe, and that outward part that was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the eye of nature; this they indeavoured to reform by purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume, or at leaſt to divert the courſe of thoſe humours from the braine; but all their skill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nothing, which <hi>Spira</hi> noting ſaid: <hi>Alas poore men, how far wide are you? do you think that this diſeaſe is to bee cured by potions? believe me there muſt be another manner of medicine, it is neither plaiſters, nor drugges, that can help a fainting ſoul caſt down with ſence of ſin, and the wrath of God; t' is onely Chriſt that muſt be the Phyſitian, and the Goſpel the ſoul Antidote.</hi>

him after they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the whole truth of the matter, and therefore they wiſhed him to ſeek ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort. By this time the fame of this man was ſpred over all <hi>Padua,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Country; partly for that he was a man of Eſteeme: partly becauſe as the diſeaſe, ſo the occaſion was eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; for this was not done in a corner: ſo as daily there came multitudes of all ſorts to ſee him: ſome out of curioſitie onely to ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: ſome out of a pious deſire to try all meanes that might reduce him to comfort again, or at leaſt to benefit themſelves, by ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of miſery, and of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62799:15"/>
exceedingly chafing and in this fretting mood of his, ſaid: As it is true <hi>that all things work for the beſt to thoſe that love God</hi>; ſo to the wicked all are contrary: <hi>for whereas a plentiful of-ſpring is the bleſsing of God, and his reward, being a ſtay to the weak eſtate of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged parents; to me they are a cauſe of bitterneſs and vexation; they do ſtrive to make me tire out this miſery; I would fain be at an end; I deſerve not this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at their hands; O that I were gone from hence, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would let out this weary Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His friends ſaluted him, and asked him, what he conceived to be the cauſe of his diſeaſe; forthwith he brake out into a lamentable diſcourſe of the paſſages formerly related, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62799:16"/>
that with ſuch paſſionate Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that he cauſed many to weepe, and moſt to tremble. They contrarily, to comfort him, propounded many of Gods promiſes recorded in the Scripture; and many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods mercy: <hi>My ſin</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is greater then the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God..</hi> Nay, anſwered they, the mercy of God is above all ſin; God would have all men to be ſaved: <hi>It</hi>'s <hi>true</hi> (quoth he) <hi>hee would have all that he hath elected, to be ſaved; he would not have damned repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to be ſaved; I am one of that number; I know it, for I willingly, and againſt my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg denied Chriſt; and I feele that he hardens, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to hope.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here they began ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke him; requiring, and charging him that in any wife he did not violate the mercy of God; to which he anſwered: <hi>The mercy of God is exceeding large, and exends to all the elect; but not to me, or any like to me, who are ſealed up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62799:17"/>
to wrath: I tell you I deſerve it, my own conſcience condemnes me; what needeth any other Iudg?</hi> Chriſt came (ſaid they) to take away ſin, and calling for a book, they read unto him the paſſion of Chriſt; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his nayling to the Croſs, <hi>Spira</hi> ſaid: <hi>This indeed is comfortable to ſuch as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but as for mee wretch, they are nothing but grief and torment, becauſe I contemned them.</hi> Thus roaring for grief, and toſſing himſelf up and down upon the bed as he lay, he intreated them to read no more: As <hi>Gribauldus</hi> was comming to ſee him, <hi>Vergerius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Spira,</hi> dear Sir, here is Doctor <hi>Gribauldus,</hi> a godly and faithfull friend of yours, come to ſee you: <hi>He is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>but he ſhall find

me ill: Gribauldus</hi> replyed, Sir, this is but an illuſion of the divel, who doth what he can to vexe you; but turn you to God with your whole heart, and he is ready to ſhew you mercy; the earth you know is full of his mercy; it is he that hath ſaid, that as <hi>often as a ſinner repents of his ſin, he will remember his ſins no more.</hi> Conſider this in the example of <hi>Peter</hi> that was Chriſts fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and an Apoſtle; and yet denied him thrice with an oath, and yet God was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto him: conſider the thief that ſpent his whole life in wickedneſs, and for all that, did not God graciouſly reſpect him in the laſt minute of his life? Is the Lords hand now ſhortned that it cannot ſave? to this <hi>Spira</hi> anſwered;

               <hi>it was becauſe Chriſt beheld him with a mercifull eye; and in that he was pardoned, it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wept, but becauſe God was gracious to him: but God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not me, and therefore I am a reprobate: I feele no comfort can enter into my heart, there's place there but only for torments and vexings of ſpirit: I tell you my caſe is properly mine own; no man ever was in the like plight, and therefore my eſtate is fearful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then roaring out in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of his ſpirit, ſaid: <hi>It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God:</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his paſſion and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſutable, did amaze many of the beholders; inſomuch as ſome of them ſaid with a whiſpering voyce that he was

            </p>
            <p>They obſerving his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ariſe from the ſenſe and horror of the paines of hell, asked him whether he thought there were worſe paines then what he endured for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; he ſaid, that he knew <hi>there were far worſe paines then

thoſe that he then ſuffered: for the wicked ſhall riſe to their judgment, but they ſhall not ſtand in judgment: this I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of: yet do I deſire nothing more, then that I might come to that place, where I may be ſure to feele the worſt, and to be freed from fear of worſe to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I but you are to conſider (ſaid one) that thoſe opinions for which you were accuſed before the Legate, were impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and therefore you are not to think you denied Chriſt, but rather that you confeſſed him, acknowledging the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth of the Catholike Church. <hi>Truely</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when I did deny thoſe opinions, I did think them to be true, and yet I did deny them.</hi>

               <hi>I perceive</hi> (ſaid <hi>Spira) that</hi> I <hi>call on him to my eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for I tell you again, it is a new and unheard of example that you find in mee</hi>: If <hi>Iudas</hi> (ſaid they) had but outlived his dayes, which by nature hee might have done; he might have repented, and Chriſt would have received him to mercy; and yet he ſinned moſt grievouſly againſt his Maſter, which did ſo eſteem of him, as to honour him with the dignitie of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and

did maintain and feed him: He anſwered, <hi>Chriſt did alſo feed and honour mee, neither yet is my fault one jot leſs then that of his; becauſe it is not more honour to be perſonally preſent with Chriſt in the fleſh, then to be in his preſence now, by illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his holy Spirit: and beſides, I deny that ever</hi> Iudas <hi>could have repented, how long ſoever he had lived; for grace was quite taken from him, as it is now from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Spira</hi> (ſaid they) you know you are in a Spiritual deſertion; you muſt therefore not believe what Satan ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts; he was ever a Liar from the beginning, and a meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour, and will caſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lying fancies into your mind, to beguile you withall; you muſt rather believe thoſe

            <p>Then he began to reckon up what fearful dreames and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he was continually trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled withall; that he ſaw the divels come flocking into his Chamber, and about his bed, terrifying him with ſtrange noyſes that theſe were not fancies, but that he ſaw them as really, as the ſtanders by; and that beſides theſe outward terrours, he felt continually, a racking torture of his minde, and a continual butchery of his Conſcience, being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
