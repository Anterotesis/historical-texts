         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>As ſome further</hi> Eſſay <hi>in order to a well grounded Vnity, Peace and Settlement, of theſe poor ſhaken and ſhattered Nations, upon that ſure and durable foundation of Righteouſneſs, which will without doubt, according to the wiſe mans experience, not only eſtabliſh, but exalt a Nation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. FIrſt, Let it be in the fear of the Lord reſolved; That ſingular care ſhall be taken forthwith, and ſo from time to time, that the Arrears of the poor Souldiers, the Pentions of the poor Pentioners, and the Publick faith debts, of the poor Creditors of theſe Nations, (whoſe ſtraights preſſeth them ſore, and makes them to ſigh, and whoſe ſighs and cryes goe up unto Heaven, and will have their returns) may be ſpeedily and out of the firſt receipts diſcharged and cleared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That ſingular care ſhall be taken forthwith, and ſo from time to time, that the poor in general thorowout theſe Nations, which are very numerous now, (by reaſon of the decay of Trade, and other wayes) ſhall be ſo provided for, and in ſuch ſort, that all the Impotent ſhall be releived, and all the able ſhall be imployed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, That there ſhall be a ſpeedy and effectual courſe taken to rectifie the Laws, and the male-Adminiſtration thereof, by bringing them into a Brief, Plain, and eaſie Method and Form; and as neer the Laws of that famous Common-wealth of Iſrael, as the nature and Conſtitution of a Gentile State (under the preſent diſpenſation of light and grace) will admit; and ſo, that as much ſtrife and contention between man and man as may be, by plain and brief Records, Regiſters, and Peace-makers, might be prevented, and what by ſuch a Proviſion cannot be prevented, might be with as much eaſe and ſpeed, and with as little expence of Money and irritation of ſpirit as may be, fully redreſſed; ſo that loving kindneſs, judgment and righteouſneſs, which the righteous Lord himſelf delights to be exerciſed in on the earth, may be found and felt in our Land, to the great contentment and rejoycing of the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, That ſingular care ſhall be forthwith taken about that perplexing buſineſs of Tythes, which being continued as now it is, ſtands but as a relict of Monarchy, and as a witneſs againſt theſe Nations, as if they denyed the change of the Prieſt-hood that was under the Law, or that Chriſt Jeſus is come in the fleſh; is alſo a thing that looks much unlike the maintenance of a true Goſpel Miniſtry, and which is as ſome conceive the very fomenter, and nouriſher of a Perſecuting, and impoſing Spirit in theſe Nations; by reaſon whereof, even under the greateſt Profeſſion of liberty, many tender Conſciences have been daily perplexed, and very much of the Land of the Nation hath laine unimproved, which is rendred by many, as a great reaſon of the ſcarceneſs of Corn, which hazards a Famine oft times in this Nation. Let this be done by altering the Title thereof, and bringing it to a Pound rate, <hi>Sci.</hi> to eight or ſix in the hundred, which may be from time to time without any further charge paid into the publick, and ſo diſpoſed to the proper uſe and end to which it belongs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, That the very much decayed Trade of this Nation, both in theſe famous Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and other Places (ſo univerſally complained of) and by the many ſad effects, ſo fully Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, may now thorow ſpecial care be forthwith revived, by eaſing the troubleſome and vexatious burdens that lies upon it, and by putting it under a good regulation and Government; That the Seas may be ſo guarded, that being propounded as the ground of the Cuſtomes; that the Trade, Treaſure, and ſtrength of theſe Nations, may not ſo often fall into the hands of the enemies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixtly, That all the Relicts and Props of corrupt Monarchy, thorowout theſe Nations, which do but wait and ſerve for its return, and have entrencht upon the free-born Peoples Rights and Liberties, upon a Civil account, ſhall be forthwith diligently enquired into, and ſpeedily removed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, That all the Relicts and Props of ſuperſtitious Hierarchy thorowout theſe Nations, which do but wait and ſerve for its return, and have entrenched upon the Peoples Rights and Liberties, upon a Religious account, ſhall be forthwith diligently enquired into, and ſpeedily removed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eightly, That all thoſe horrible corruptions, abuſes, and miſchiefs, which have crept into houſes that have been erected and maintained by free Donation of perſons for Charitable uſes, and alſo all thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abuſes, That are found in Priſons thorowout theſe Nations, and eſpecially thoſe of the Kings Bench, the Fleet, Newgate, and Ludgate, ſhall be forthwith diligently enquired into, and ſpeedily removed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninthly, That none ſhall be forſt upon any Publick imployment in this Common-wealth againſt his will and conſent; and that whoſoever is imployed from time to time in the management of the affairs thereof, from the higheſt unto the loweſt, ſhall receive out of the publick Revenue, a ſutable recompence and incouragement for his ſervice therein: and then in caſe any ſhall be found taking bribes, either directly, or indirectly, or otherwiſe unfaithful in the truſt committed to him, he ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed, and forthwith caſhiered.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Tenthly, that ſome ſubſtantial Laws, relating to Liberty and Freedome, both upon a Civil, and upon a Religious account, whereby every man may be preſerved ſafe in his perſon, name and eſtate, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of another, under what pretence ſoever, may be laid as Fundamentals in the bottome of your Government, as that which hath been gotten in the late wonderful and hazzardous engagements with very much difficulty, and is the price of very much bloud and treaſure; Let theſe be known to be as the Laws of the <hi>Meads</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that cannot be altered, no not by future Repreſentatives; and among other, let this be one; That in caſe any Repreſentative of the people, ſhall by the Major vote, alter or make void theſe or any of theſe firſt Fundamentals, they ſhall be lookt upon as violating the truſt committed to them, and ſuch act and acts of theirs, ſhall be deemed void and null to all intents and purpoſes, as if the ſame had never been, and ſhall be no wayes obleiging upon the conſciences of the good people of theſe Nations. And moreover, that the perſon, or perſons, who firſt moved therein, ſhall be judged Traitors to the Liberties of the people, &amp; of their country in the higheſt degree, &amp; proceeded againſt accordingly.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Eleventhly, That none of the free-born People of theſe Nations, ſhall be arreſted, impriſoned, baniſhed, condemned, or ſentenced to the loſs of Life, Limb, Eſtate, or Liberty, or be any otherwayes moleſted, or diſtreſſed, after a very ſhort time prefixt, but by the lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by vertue of, and according to ſome known, approved, publiſhed Law, or Laws of theſe Nations.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Twelfthly, That all the Publick Revenue of theſe Nations, ſhall from time to time be brought into the Publick Treaſury, as entire and with as little abatements and unneceſſary charges and expenſes as may be; and to the end it may be ſo, among other things, That there ſhall be ſpecial care uſed that all Perſons who are or ſhall be imployed about the cuſtomes, and all other places relating to money, ſhall be ſuch as have a clear and full character given of them, that they are indeed able provident men, men of truth and hating covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That for the more certain, ſpeedy and thorow effecting hereof, whereby deeds may demonſtrate, that theſe are reſolves by the finger of God ſet on your hearts; Let it be in the fear of the Lord further reſolved, That Seventy men ſhall be found out, pitcht upon, and ſet a part to be imployed, of a ſuitable Spirit to theſe reſolves, with whom you will in the name and fear of the Lord engage to ſtand, or fall, live or die together, in a thorow purſute thereof, in order to the putting of all ſorts of men into a better and more flouriſhing capacity then that wherein now they are; ſo that intereſt may engage them there to remain, and as one man to riſe up and withſtand a return; and alſo in order to the enjoying (as in ancient times) their free Repreſentatives; That the Perſons ſhall be according to <hi>Iethro's</hi> Counſel, able men, fearing God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs, and ſuch as are in a good meaſure freed by the Spirit of the Goſpel, from impoſing upon the conſciences of others, in things that relate to the worſhip and ſervice of God, as having learned by experience, that it is not by might, nor by power, that things of that nature are carried on, and that the wrath of man doth not at all accompliſh the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That theſe Seventy Perſons thus qualified, ſingled out, pitcht upon; and ingaged to carry thorow the former reſolves, in order to the bringing the honeſt Conquering Party, yea, all the free-born people of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, into a fit Capacity, to enjoy (as in ancient dayes) their free Repreſentatives, ſhall be called by the name of the great Council, and for the more ſpeedy diſpatch of that buſineſs, which by the whole Nation in a very ſhort ſeaſon, may be made ſenſible of the advantage thereby, they ſhall caſt them into 10. Committees. That the firſt, ſhall be for the preparing, well ordering, and managing of the buſineſs that relates to the Poor; A ſecond, for that which relates to the Law; A third, for that which relates to Tythes; A fourth, for Trade; A fifth, for finding out and removing the Relicts, and Props of corrupt Monarchy; A ſixt, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and removing the Relicts, and Props of Superſtitious Heirarchy; A ſeventh, for the finding out and rectifying the corruptions, and abuſes in Priſons, and in donations for charitable uſes; An eighth, for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſome ſubſtantial, and fundamental Laws, which ſhall not be altered; A ninth, for Conſidering of grievances, and ordering the publick Revenues; And the laſt, for the Receiving of all Petitions that relates to the former reſolves, or concerning any thing that may be preſented, and to refer the Conſideration of them to the ſeveral Committees to which they belong, and what cannot properly be referred to any of them, to let that be their care ſo to manage, and prepare the ſame, as the reſt of the Committees, for the Conſideration, and determination of the great Council.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That out of this great Council conſiſting of Seventy, Twenty one ſhall be choſen, and called the Council of State, of the moſt able, and moſt eminently qualified for this great work, wherein the Lord, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this whole Nation are ſo greatly concerned, that their work ſhall be to treat with forrain <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> to have the management of the executive part of the Power and Authority of theſe Nations, and of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and Territories thereto belonging; ſo that the placing, and diſplacing of all Officers, both Civil, and Military (the chief of both only excepted) ſhall ſpring from thence, Reſerving notwithſtanding a door of Appeal open to the great Council, in point of diſplacing the next great Officers both in a Military, and Civil capacity.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That ſingular care ſhall be forthwith taken by the great Council, to declare to the Nation, that theſe or ſuch like, are the good things which they have reſolvedly upon their hearts, by the help of the Lord, with all poſſible ſpeed they can, to bring forth, for the putting the whole, and ſo far as is poſſible, every Member thereof into a happy flouriſhing State, and there upon to incite, and provoke the good people of theſe Nations, to a patient waiting for the effecting thereof, and to a chearful Concurrance therein, warning withal the unruly Spirited, and evil Affected perſons of theſe Nations, againſt any tumultuous aſſemblings, riſings, or actings to the diſquieting thereof, or to the hindering, and retarding of ſo good a work as is on the wheele, which being perfected, will undoubtedly prove advantagious to all; adding this, that in caſe they take not warning hereby, they ſhall be puniſhed with exemplary puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That ſingular care ſhall be taken by the great Council, forthwith to put the well affected in theſe Nations, in ſuch a poſture of defence, placing alſo the Power of the Militia in confiding hands, whereby they may be incouraged, and alſo ſtrengthened, as one man to joyn together, not only for the withſtanding the common enemy (in caſe he prove turbulent) but for the bringing forth of common Righteouſneſs, ſo that judgment, and juſtice, and mercy, may run down like a mighty ſtream, to the great refreſhing and cheering of theſe poor Nations.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That ſingular care ſhall be taken by the Council of State, that able men ſo qualified as is above ſpecified, ſhall be forthwith nominated, and appointed for the Office of Sheriff in every County, thorowout theſe Nations, whoſe care it ſhall be to keep the reſpective Counties to which they belong in peace, and free from riſings, and commotions, and for that end ſhall proclaim, or publiſh the Declaration above ſpecified in the moſt noted places thereof, and in caſe notwithſtanding this, there ſhould be riſings, or tumultuous Aſſemblings, that then they ſhall call to their aſſiſtance, the County Troops, or the Power of the County ſpeedily to ſuppreſs the ſame.</p>
