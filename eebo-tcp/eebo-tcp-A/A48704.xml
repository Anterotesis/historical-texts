            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Observations
Concerning the odd Turn of some Shell-snailes, and the
darting of Spiders, communicated to Mr. J. W. and
Published in the Philosophicall Transactions N. 50. 1669.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Can deny you nothing, and you may do what
you please with the Notes I send you. You
would know of me (you say) what I have observed
concerning the <hi>Odd Turn</hi> of some <hi>Shell-snailes</hi> with us in
England, and the <hi>Darting of Spiders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will tell you then of the <hi>first,</hi> that I have found two <hi>(a)</hi>
sorts of them, easily to be distinguisht one from the other,
and from all besides, because the <hi>Turn</hi> of the wreathes is
from the right hand to the left, contrary to what may be
seen in common Snailes. They are very small, and might
therefore well escape thus long the more Curious Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list;
neither of them much exceeding, at least in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a large Oat-corne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> I thus describe: The open of the shell is
pretty round, and the second turne of wreaths is very
large for the proportion, and the rest of the wreaths,
about the number of six, are still lesson'd to a point. This
Turbin or Conical figure is well near a quarter of an inch;
the colour of the shell is duskish, yet when the shrunk
animall gives leave, you may see day through it, and then
it is of a yellowish colour. These shells are extream
brittle and tender, so that I cannot send them in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
You may guess at the figure, if I tell you, they
are som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thing like those of <hi>Aldrovandus de Testaceis,</hi>
markt P. 359. <hi>Turbinum levjum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>second</hi> sort <hi>(b)</hi> I send you inclosed at aventure
halfe a dozen; (you see, in that I can so plentifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the loss of the former, that they are not very rare;)
they seem to be much stronger and thicker shel'd; they
are well near halfe as long again as the other, and as slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56944:3"/>
they have the exact figure of an Oat-corn, being as
it were pointed at both ends, and the middle a little swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
The open of the shell is not exactly round there
being a peculiar <hi>Sinus</hi> in the lower part thereof. I think,
you may number above 10. Spires, having their turn from
the right hand to the left. The colour of the Shell is
of a dark and reddish brown.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of this make described, and with
their respective Cutts, in <hi>Fabius Columna;</hi> but ours
agree not with them in any thing more than the odd
Turn: though it's true, that the other, the third there
described, and call'd by him <hi>Cochlea Terrestris turbinata et
stirata, (c)</hi> is very frequent in the road 'twixt Canterbury
and Dover, and likewise in some woody parts of the
Woles in Lincoln-shire. There are odd differences in
this very Snaile very remarkable, as its having but one
pair of horns (if I mistake not,) as also a hard shelly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
its manner of wearing that cover <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I leave
to another opportunity and place.</p>
            <p>And to return to our two new described Snailes, they,
when they creep, lift up the point of their shells towards
a perpendicular, and exert with part of their body two
pair of horns, as most of their kind do.</p>
            <p>In <hi>March</hi> they are still to be found in paires, <hi>Aristotle</hi>
affirms all these kind of creatures to be of a <hi>spontaneous</hi>
birth, and no more to contribute to the production of
one another, then Trees, and therefore to have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of Sex. I have no reason to subscribe to his
authority, since I have seen so many of them pair'd, and
in the act of Venery. That they engender then, is most
certain; but whether those, that are thus found coupled,
be one of them a male, and the other female, or rather,
as you <hi>first</hi> observ'd, and published to the World in the
<hi>Catalogue of Plants</hi> growing wild about <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
that they are both male and female and do in the act of
generation both receive into themselves, and immit alike
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56944:3"/>
               <hi>penis</hi> (as it seems probable to any man that shall part
them) I leave to further and more minute discovery to
determine.</p>
            <p>Moreover we find in <hi>Aristotle</hi> a Circle of other parts,
but of those we find no mention at all. However the
Romans knew something extraordinary of these kind
of Animals, that made them so choice of them as to
recken them among their most delicate food, and use all
care and diligence to breed and fat them for their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at large discribed to us by <hi>Varro.</hi> Their tast and
relish is none, methinks, of the most agreeable.</p>
            <p>Of late, comparing <hi>Bussy's Historire Amoureuse de Gaule</hi>
with <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> out of whom I was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he had taken two of his Lettes word for word,
beside other Love intrigues; I find, in running him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
what satisfied me; not a little in this very subject of
<hi>Snailes; viz.</hi> That these very Animals, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
odd things in Nature, as <hi>Truffs, Mushroms,</hi> and no
doubt too the <hi>Cossi</hi> or great worms in the Oak (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Roman</hi> dainty) were made use of by the Antients
to incite Venery. You'l there find, that the distressed
and feeble Lover prepares himself with a ragoust of
Snailes necks, <hi>(cervices Cochlearum;)</hi> and indeed in
this part it is that these strange <hi>penes's</hi> are to be found.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> does as it were promise the Anatomy of
this Insect. It were surely worth his paines, and the
Learn'd World would be obliged to him for a piece
of this nature; nothing, accuratly done of the inward
part of any Insect, being
yet published<note n="*" place="margin">When this was written, <hi>Malpigius</hi> de
<hi>Bombyee</hi> was not not publisht.</note>
These Snailes are to be found frequent enough under
the loose barke of Trees, as old <hi>Willows,</hi> and in the
ragged clefts of <hi>Elmes</hi> and <hi>Oak &amp;c.</hi> And in no other
places else, that I could observe.</p>
            <p>You tell me, that it is generally concluded by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
That the reason of the usuall <hi>Turn</hi> of <hi>Snailes</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56944:4"/>
from the left to the right, is the like motion of the Sun,
and that especially more North-ward, there have not
been hitherto discovered any in our parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Turn to the Sun's motion. But this is not the
only case, where they are out, who consult not the Stores
of Nature, but their own phancy. What I am further
about to tell you concerning <hi>Spiders,</hi> is as evident an
Instance against them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>long Threads</hi> in the Aire in Summer, and especially
towards <hi>September,</hi> have been a strange puzel to the wiser
World. It would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ert you, though you know them
as well as I, if I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ckoned up the ridiculous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning them; but I omit them, and proceed
to tell you the certain and immediat Anthors of them,
and how they make them.</p>
            <p>I say then, that all Spiders, that spin a thread, (those
which we call <hi>Shepherds</hi> or long-legged Spiders, never
doe;) are the markes of these threds, so much wondred
at, and in such infinite quantities every where.</p>
            <p>I sent you the last Summer a Catalogue of <hi>thirty</hi> sort,
of Spiders, that I had distinguisht here with us in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
and I must confess, I had well near compleated
that number, with many other Experiments concerning
them, before I discovered this secret. You must not
expect from me any thing more, then what you deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of me; for as for other Experiments, I reserve
them till our meeting.</p>
            <p>I had exactly marked all the way of Weaving, used by
any sorts of them, and in those admirable works I had
ever noted that they still let down the Thred they make
use of; and draw it after them. Happily at length in
neerly attending on one, that wrought a nett, I saw
him suddenly in the mid-work to desist, and turning
his taile into the wind to dart out a thread with the
violence and streame, we see water forced out of a <hi>squirt
or syring pipe:</hi> This thread taken up by the wind, was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56944:4"/>
in a moment emitted some fathoms long, still issuing
out of the belly of the Animal; by and by the Spider
leapt into the aire, and the thread mounted her up
swiftly.</p>
            <p>And after this first discovery, I made the like Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all the sorts of Spiders, I had before distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and I found the Air filled with young and old, sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their threads, and undoubtedly seizeing Gnats
and other Insects in their passage; there being often as
many fest signes of slaughter, as the leggs, wings of Flyes
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> on those threads, as in their webbs below.</p>
            <p>One thing yet was a wonder to me, <hi>viz.</hi> That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these threads, that came down out of the Air,
were not single, but snarled and with complicated
woolly locks, now more now less; and that on those
I did not elways find Spiders, though many times I had
found two or three upon one of them: Whereas when
they first flew up, the thread was still single, or but
little tangled, or, it may be, thicker in one place then in
another. In the end, by good attention I plainly found,
what satisfied me abundantly, and that was this; That
I observed them to get to a top of a stalk or bough,
or sum such like thing, where they exercise this dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of threads into the air, and if they had not a mind
to sail, they swiftly drew it up again, winding it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p
with their fore-feet over the head into a lock, or brok
it off short, and let the air carry it away. This they
will do many times together, and you may see of them,
that have chaines to these locks or snarled thread before
them, and yet not taken flight.</p>
            <p>Again, I found, that after the first flight, all the time
of their sailing they make locks, still darting forth fresh
supplyes of thread to sport and saile by.</p>
            <p>It is further to be noted, that these complicated
threads are much more tender, then our house-webbs.</p>
            <p>In Winter and at Christmas I have observed them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56944:5"/>
busy a darting, but few of them saile then, and therefore
but single threads only are to be seen; And besides, they
are but the young ones of last Autumns hatch, that are
then employed; and it is more than probable, that the
great ropes of Autumne are made onely by the great
ones, and upon long passages and Summer weather,
when great numbers of pray may invite them to stay
longer up.</p>

infinite number of these Insects, and their numerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;

               <head>Extract of a Letter, written to Mr. Oldenbourgh, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in the Philosoph: Transactions, N. 68. 1670. about an
Insect, which besides Pismiers, may probably yield an Acid
juice. Also about the winter Bleeding of the Sycamore
Tree.</head>
               <p>SIR, Concerning the Acid liquour of Pismiers, I have
very lately received from Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> the Account
(I suppose you have it by this time,) that was sent
him from Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jessop;</hi> wherein these two
last Gentlemen make this further Inquiry, whether
there be any other Insect, or Animal, Flesh or Fish,
that will afford an Acid Juice; they having with great
industry tryed many <hi>species</hi> amongst Insects, and other
Animals, without lighting on the like Acid liquor.
I am of the mind, there are; and a ready way to
find such out, may be, that having observed, that a
Pismire bruised and smelt to, emits a strange fiery and
piercing savour, like the leafe of the Herb, by <hi>Botanists</hi>
called <hi>Flammula,</hi> broken at one's nostrills; by this means
I have, since Mr. <hi>Wray</hi> put the question to me, found
an Insect, which I suspect, may yeild an Acid liquour; as
well as the Pismire; and that is the <hi>Long and Round-bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lead-coloured Julus,</hi> distinguished from all other <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipeds</hi>
in that their innumerable leggs are as small as hair,
and white and in going they are moved like waves; not
rare amongst drier rubbish; no <hi>Scolopendra,</hi> ours being
an harmless Insect, and not armed with dangerous <hi>forcipes.</hi>
The body of this <hi>Julus</hi> being bruised strikes the nostriis
exceeding fiercely; but I have not yet any opertunity
to furnish my selfe with any quantity of them for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trials. The Change of Colours in Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is
a subject I have a little considered, and you shall have
my thoughts an Experimen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>amore;</hi> the last year I win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where I pierced a Sycamore about
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56944:6"/>
the begining of <hi>November;</hi> the turgescence of the Buds
invited me thereto, and some hopes in improving the
notion of Winter-bleedings, so happily discover'd by
Mr. <hi>Willughoby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wray.</hi> This succeeded so well
with me, that I did afterwards engage my selfe in
keeping a <hi>Journal</hi> throughout the whole Winter;
from which Journal, I think I may note; 1. That the
wounded Sycamore niver bled, neither in <hi>November,
December,</hi> nor <hi>January,</hi> nor <hi>February,</hi> nor <hi>March,</hi>
(which yet they did above 40. several times, that is,
totally ceasing and than beginning a new,) unless there
<hi>preceded</hi> a sensible and visible Frost; for I had no other
way of recording the temper of the Air. 2. That the
Frost did not always set a bleeding the wounds, they
found made before they came, though sometimes they
did; but upon their breaking up, or very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting,
the wounds either made in that instant of time,
or made many months before, did never fail to bleed
more er less. 3. That particularly upon the breaking
up of the two great and long Frosts (the first of which
hapn'd that year in that Country to be on the third
of <hi>January;</hi> the second, about the 12<hi>th. 13th. 14th.</hi>
of <hi>February,)</hi> all the wounds ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mist plentifully: so
that such times may be looked upon as the most proper
season of gathering great quantities of Juyce from this
Tree. Removing into <hi>Cravon</hi> the latter end of <hi>March,</hi>
and thence to <hi>London,</hi> my Journal was discontinued;
I had yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon my return from <hi>London</hi> unto <hi>Craven,</hi>
some leasvre to prosicute it. Those, I there wounded
the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> did not bleed neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of that month, nor the following months
of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> but had the orifice of the wounds,
made with a small Auger, in a manner quite grown up,
and would scarce admit a Pigeons feathers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> I cut out a square piece of about
two inches of the barke of a large and well-grown
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56944:6"/>
Sycamore, about my hight in the body of it: This
wound began to run the next morning about 9 a clock, so
as to drop; and that was all, and dryed up by 11 in the
morning. it continued in like manner the 21 days following,
that is as long as I had the oppertunity of observing it.
The like cut I made in a young Sycamore the 8th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi>
which in like manner bled the next morning, but
stopp'd before 9 a clock. It did so for 2 or 3 days, but
then totally drying. Afterwards removing to <hi>York,</hi> the
first of <hi>November</hi> I here pierced, and otherwise wounded
two Sycamores; and having observ'd them my self at
times, when, according to my former Observations made
in <hi>Nottingham shire,</hi> I might wel expect to have found them
bleeding; yet they <hi>never</hi> stirr'd, that we could observe,
to this day. Since <hi>Mr. Wray</hi> hath assured me, that those
of <hi>Warwick-shire</hi> bled the 16th of <hi>November</hi> last past co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously;
and since the <hi>Walnuttres</hi> also. And so much for
matter of fact.</p>
               <p>To what cause we may truly refer this Anomalous
Bleeding, is not easie to say. For my part, I am not apt
to think, that there is such a sudden and extemporary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Sap, at such time as these Trees are most disposd
to bleed; but rather, that the Sap, already in all parts
of the Tree, is some ways notably <hi>alter'd</hi> in its temper
and consistance: And this Bleeding by stress of weather
may in these Trees probably be look'd upon as a violence
done to their natures from an unkind Climate; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Walnut</hi> and <hi>Sycamore</hi> as strangers, and not natives
of England. 'Tis indeed true, there are many sorts of
<hi>English</hi> Plants, which will bleed in Winter; but note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that such Plants never refuse to do so at any time of
the year, no more than a Man, who may bleed a vein
when he pleaseth, But let the Hypothesis be what it will,
I am perswaded, we shall have but dark and imperfect
notions of the motion of the Juyces in Vegetables, until
their true Texture be better discover'd. To conclude
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56944:7"/>
this subject, I now put these two <hi>Quaries;</hi> 1. Whether
the Juyce of Trees, whil'st alive &amp; vegete, can properly be
said, at any time of the year, to descend, or to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any part, or not to be therein in a much like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity?
2. What condition the Soil is of, where such
Trees are planted, that shall either bleed or refuse to do
so; whether Sandy, as that of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> or a wet
Clay, as that of the two Trees, I have observ'd here
at <hi>York.</hi>

               <head>An Extract of another Letter written Febr. 8th. 1670.
Containing some Experiments about the Bleeding of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camore,
and other Trees; as also, a considerable Note of
Pliny about the Mulberry-Tree. Ibidem.</head>
               <p>COncerning the <hi>Bleeding</hi> of the <hi>Sycmore,</hi> let me acquaint
you with the following Experiment. The first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
it froze, the Wind at <hi>North;</hi> the Frost and Wind
continued (some little Snow and rain falling) the 2d,
3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, until the 7th in the morning, when the
Wind came about to the South-East, and the weather
broke up a pace. The Sycamores bled not all this while,
but the 7th about Noon all Trees of that kind bled very
freely, both at the Twigs and Body, and I struck above
a dozen.</p>
               <p>At this same Critical season I was willing to repeat
the Experiment upon other Trees; and to this end I
forthwith struck the <hi>Hawthorn, Hazel, Wild-Rose, Goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-bush,
Apple-tree, Cheery-tee, Blather-nut, Aprickcock,
Cherry-Lawrel, Vine, Walnut;</hi> yet none bled but the last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
and that faintly in comparison of the <hi>Sycamore.</hi>
This is consonant to our former Experiments: And if
it did happen (as I said in my former Letter,) that these
Sycamores bled not all this Winter afore at the wounds
made the first of <hi>November,</hi> I do now think, that if new
wounds had been still made at every break of Frost, some
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56944:7"/>
signes, at least of our <hi>York-shire</hi> bleeding, might have
been discover'd before now. But I affirm no more, than
I have seen and tried.</p>
               <p>In all the Monuments of the Antients, collected by the
great industry of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I find but few instances of this
nature. Amongst those few, there is one that is rgistr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with two or three remarkable circumstances to our
purpose. He tells us, that the Physitians of old, when
they had a mind to draw the Juyce of the Mulberry-tree,
were wont to strike it skin-deep only, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hours after Sun-rise. This Experiment is twice
mentioned by him, and in both places as a strange <hi>Phoen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To continue our Experiments concerning the motion
of the Sap in Trees; <hi>Febr.</hi> 11th, all was here cover'd
with a white Frost betwixt 9 and 11 in the morning.
The weather changing I made the Experiments, which
follow, upon the <hi>Sycamore, Watnut, Maple.</hi> A twig cut
asunder would bleed very freely from that part remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56944:8"/>
to the Tree; and, for the part separated, it would
be altogether dry and shew no signs of moisture, although
we held it some prety time with the cut end downward;
But, if this separated twig was never so little tipp'd
with a knife at the other end, it would forthwith shew
no moisture at both ends. The same day, late in the
after-noon, the weather very open and warm, a Twig
cut off in like manner as in the morning, would shew
no moisture at all from any part. These Experiments
we repeated very many times with constant and like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
on all the Trees abvoe-mentioned. I enter'd this
Experiment with these <hi>Quaries</hi> for the next opportunity.
1. Whether a Twig, or the small part of a Root cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
will not bleed faster, upon the breaking up of a
Frost, from the part remaining to the Tree, than from
the part seperated; and whether the part seperated will
bleed at all, and shew no more signes of moistule, than
a Twig cut from the top of the Tree, unless that small
Root be likewise cut off at the other end also? 2.
Whether when it shall happen, that a <hi>Sycamore</hi> shall be
found to bleed upon the setting in of a great Frost, the
top twigs and small roots will not both of them bleed
freelier from the parts separated, in proportion to their
bigness? 3. And if it shall not so prove in the Tryal,
that in cold weather the Sap moves <hi>inwards</hi> from Root
and Branch to the Trunk to the extremities of both Root
and Branch; I say; if this prove not so, whether there be
any different motions of Sap at a time in the divers parts
of one and the same Tree; and where such motions of
Sad begin, and whither they tend? 4 Whether the Sap,
when it will run, moves longer in the Branches than in
the Roots; or whether it begin not to move in all parts
of a Tree at a time, and rest every where at a time; 5.
When it rests, whether it retires to the Body of the
Tree, from the Roots and Branches, or sinks down to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56944:9"/>
Root, or is any way spent by insensible steams, or is quiet
and lodged in every part of the Tree in proportion?</p>
                  <p>I shall long to hear the success of your Experiments
in the Question of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Sap. I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years been inclin'd to think, that there is some such
motion in the Juyces of Vegetables. The reasons which
induced me, are; 1. Because I finde, that all the Juyce
of a Plant is no extravasate and loose, and like Water in
a Spunge; but that there are apparent Vessels in Plants,
analagous to Veins in Animals: which thing is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
and clear in such Plants, whose Juyce is either
White or Red, or Saffron colour'd; for instance, in each
kind of Juyce we propose <hi>Latuca, Atractilis, Cbelidonium
majus.</hi> 2. Because that there are very many Plants (and
these last named are of the number) whose Juyce seems
never to be at rest, but will spring at all times Iteely, as
the Blood of Animals, upon Incision.</p>
                  <p>The way of Ligature by Metalline Rings, by you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
is an Expedient I have not used; but other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures
I have, upon a great number of our English
Plants, not without the discovery of many curious <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</hi>
The success of an Experiment of this Nature
upon <hi>Cataputia minor Lobel.</hi> was as followes: I tied a
silk-thread upon one of the Branches of this Plant, as
hard as might be, and not break the skin; there follow'd
no greater swelling, that I could discern, on the one side
than on the other; although in often repeating the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
some silks were left hours and dayes unloos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet the dimple which the thread had made in
the yielding branches, had a little raised the immediate
sides, but both alike: the Plant in like manner would
bleed very freely both above and under the Tye. This
was also, I thought, very remarkable, amongst other
things, in this Experiment, that in drawing the Rasour
round about the branch just above or below the Tye, the
Milky Juyce would suddenly spring out of infinite small
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56944:9"/>
holes, besides the made orifice, for more than half an
inch above and below the Tye: which seems to argue,
that though there was no Juyce intercepted in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from any turgescence, (as in the like process upon the
members of a Sanguineous Animal) yet the Veins were
so over-thronged and full, that a large orifice was not
sufficient to discharge the sudden <hi>impetus</hi> and pressure of
a some-ways streighten'd Juyce.</p>
                  <p>I have endeavou'rd many wayes to discover the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration
of the Veins of Vegetables and their other
constituent parts and Texture; but enough of this in
one Letter.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the end that I might satisfie my self about some
of the doubts I sent you, I have been most concern'd,
according to former thoughts and inclinations, in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth of these Quaeries,</hi> viz. Whether Saps are not
to be found at all seasons of the year in a much like Consistence
and Quantity in the respective parts of a Vegetable; and what
Communication one part of a Plant may have with another in
relation to the Ascent and Decent of Sap?</p>
                  <p>Now, because Sap is then said to Ascend from the
Root, when it is found to move in Tapping; I lopp'd
off certain Branches of a <hi>Sycamore,</hi> the morning betimes
of a hard Frost <hi>(Febr. 21.)</hi> before they would bleed, or
shew any signe of moisture. This I did to vary the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
not willing to wait the Change of the Weather,
and the <hi>Suns</hi> heat; but brought them within the Air of
the <hi>Fire:</hi> And by and, as I expected, they bled apace,
without being sensibly the warmer.</p>
                  <p>The Experiment repeated afforded me divers <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
which follow; and proved <hi>almost</hi> an Universal way
of Bleeding all sorts of Trees, even those, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would not shew any signes of moisture.</p>
                  <p>1. Poles of <hi>Maple, Sycamore</hi> and <hi>Walnut,</hi> cut down in
open weather, and brought within the warmth of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56944:10"/>
Fire, did bleed in an instant. Also <hi>Willow, Hazel, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Wood-bind, Blather-nut, Vine, Elder, Barbery, Apple-tree,
Ivy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whicking Egge-berry</hi> Tree (i. e. <hi>Padus Theophrasti)</hi>
tried in the same manner in <hi>Craven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Briar</hi> and <hi>Rasberry-rcds</hi> were more obstinate. <hi>Ash</hi>
utterly refused, even heated hot.</p>
                  <p>3. Branches, that is, Poles with their tops entire and
uncut bled also when brought to the Fire side; but
seem not so freely to drink up their Sap again when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
as when made Poles.</p>
                  <p>4. The same <hi>Willow-Poles,</hi> left all night in the grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spot,
and returned the next day to the Fire-side, bleed
afresh.</p>

again and again, if quickly withdrawn and balanced in
the hand, and often inverted to hinder the Falling and
and Expence of Sap: Yet being often heated, they will
at length quite cease, though no Sap was at any time
sensibly lost. And when they have given over bleeding,
that is, shewing any moisture, by being brought within
the warmth of the Fire, the Bark will yet be found very
full of Juyce.</p>
                  <p>6. An hard Ligature made within a quarter of an inch

any part.</p>
                  <p>8. One <hi>Barbery,</hi> or <hi>Pipridge-pole</hi> bared of its Bark,

Circles, which lay under the bark.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56944:10"/>
would not shew any moisture on the planed sides, but at
the ends only.</p>
                  <p>11. A Pole of <hi>Ivy</hi> did of it self exudate and shew a
liquid and yellowish rosin from the bark and near the
pith; but when brought to the Fire-side, it bled a dilute,
thin and colour-less Sap from the intermediat wood
Circles.</p>
                  <p>12. A Pole of <hi>Willow</hi> (for Example) bent into a

or by the Fire.</p>

of Juyces in Vegetables, and removing some differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
noted the in next fore-going Letter.</head>
               <p>SIR, Yours of the 4th instant came safe to my hands.
This last Month hath been a busie time with me in
my private concerns, so that I have but a few things to
return to what you have been pleased to communicate
to me, in relation to the further discovery of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juyces in Vegetables. And I must acquaint you,
that these Notes following are above 14 dayes old; for
I have scarce busied my head, or put my hand to any
Experiment of later date.</p>
               <p>One or both ends of the pith of a <hi>Willow-pole</hi> seal'd
up with hard wax, will yet freely bleed by the warmth
of the Fire. This was tried, when the last Experiment,
I sent you, were; and was then, I think, omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 23th, was the greatest Frost and Snow we
have had this Winter in these parts about <hi>York.</hi> Some
Twigs and Branches of the very same <hi>Willow-tee,</hi> as
formerly, and likewise of many other Willow-trees, taken
off this morning, <hi>March</hi> 23th, when brought within the
Air of the Fire. would shew no moisture at all; no not
when heated warm, and often and long turn'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56944:11"/>
                  <hi>March</hi> 24th, the same <hi>Willow-branches,</hi> which yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
would not bleed, and were thrown upon the Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spot
all night,; did, both they and others, new cut
down by the Fire-side, freely shew moisture and bleed
this morning upon the breaking up of the Frost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ash-poles</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> this day, nor yesterday, would
by the Fire-side, be no more moist, than when I form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
tried them.</p>
               <p>The same morning <hi>March</hi> 24th, a Twig of <hi>Maple,</hi>
which had had the top cut off the 7th of <hi>February</hi> last
past<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which then bled, this day being quite taken
off from the Tree, and brought within the Air of the
Fire, and held with the formerly cut-end down-wards,
did not run at all at the end, but held on in that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it did run apace at the other new-cut end upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
so as to spring and trickle down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this doth well agree with my Experiments
made the last year at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where I observ'd
wounds of some months standing to bleed apace at the
breaking up of every hard Frost. For <hi>first,</hi> in these parts
there hath been no hard Frost this year, not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the last year. <hi>Again,</hi> those <hi>Nottingham</hi>-trees I
wounded in the Trunk, and they stood against a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
and the wounds were on the side next it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
had Horse-dung stopp'd in all of them for some
reasons; which things did undoubtedly defend them
much from the Air and Winds, and keep the wounds
still green and open: Wheras the tops of these <hi>Maple-twiggs,</hi>
spoken of in the last Experiment, were expos'd
in an open hedge to the Air and Winds; as also the two
<hi>Sycamores</hi> here at <hi>York</hi> mention'd in my <hi>former</hi> Letter
to have been wounded in <hi>November</hi> last, and not to have
shew'd any signes of moisture, for that very cause, that
they were not fresh struck at Bleeding times.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Bleeding of <hi>Poles</hi> and entire Branches
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56944:11"/>
held perpendicular, Mr. <hi>Willboughby</hi> is in the right, and
some Experiments in my last to you of <hi>March</hi> 17th con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it. Yet it is very true what I observ'd, though the
Cause I did not then well take notice of, when I first made
the Experiment and sent you an account of it. For, I
held the Twigs, which I had cut off, a slope, joyning
and holding up the cuts together in my left hand, that
I might the better observe, which part or cut would bleed
or not bleed the faster; and because I found, that the
cut of the separated Twig did not in that posture (hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it upwards, as I said, for the advantage of my eye)
bleed at all, when as the Cut of the Branch remaining
to the Tree did freely bleed; I therefore inverted the
separated Twig and held it perpendicular with the cut
end downward, and found, that that little they were
expos'd to the Air in an upright posture, had so very
much check'd the motion of the Sap, that I concluded
they would not bleed at all; and yet striking off their
tops, and making Poles of them, I found some of them,
if not all, that I chanc'd to try, as I remember, would
shew moisture: But I am convinced since, that it was
was rather some unheeded accident, as violently bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, or perhaps the warmth of my hand and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or place, which caused this new motiom of Sap,
than meerly the striking off their Tops.</p>

               <head>Some Observations, touching Colours, in order to the
Increase of Dyes, and the Fixation of Colours 15. 1670.</head>
               <p>TWo things, I conceive, are chiefly aimed at in the
Inquiry of <hi>Colours,</hi> which subject you desire my
thoughs of; the <hi>one,</hi> to increase the <hi>Materia Tinctoria,</hi>
and the <hi>other,</hi> to <hi>fix,</hi> if possible, those colours we either
have already, or shall hereafter discover for use. As to
the <hi>first,</hi> Animals and Vegetables, besides other Natural
Bodies, may abundantly furnish us. And in both these
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56944:12"/>
kinds <hi>some</hi> Colours are <hi>Apparent,</hi> as the various col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of Flowers, and the juices of fruits, &amp;c. and the
<hi>sanies</hi> of Animals: <hi>others</hi> are Latent, and discovered to
us by the effects, the several Family's of Salt and other
things may have upon them, Concerning the <hi>Apparent</hi>
colours of Vegetables and Animals, and the various ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
of different Salts in changing them from one col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to another; we have many Instance in Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
And if we might, with the good leave of that Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Learned person, range them after our fashion,
we should give you at least a new Prospect of them,
and observe to you the conformity and agreement of
the effects of Salt on the divers parts of Vegetables:
<hi>Viz.</hi> 1. That <hi>Acid</hi> Salts <hi>advance</hi> the colours of Flowers
and Berries, that is, according to the Experiments of Mr.
<hi>Boyle,</hi> they make the infusious of <hi>Balaustium</hi> or Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granat-Flowers,
Red-roses, Clove-jilly flowers, Meserion,
Pease-bloom, Violets, Cyanus flowers, of a fairer red;
also the the juices of the Berries of <hi>Ligustrum,</hi> of black
Cherris, Buck-thorn-berries, of a much fairer red: and
to the same purpose Acid Salts make no great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the white flowers of Jasmin and Snow-drops.
2. That <hi>Vrinous</hi> Salts, and <hi>Alcaly's,</hi> on the contrary,
quite alter and change the Colours of the same flowers
now named, and juices of the said Berries also, from red
to green; even Jasmin and Snow-drops. 3. Again, that
in like manner <hi>Vrinous</hi> Spirits and <hi>Alcaly's</hi> advance, at
least do not quite spoyle the colours of the juices of
leaves of Vegetables, of their Wood and Root. Thus
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> tells us, that <hi>Vrinous</hi> Spirits and <hi>Alcaly's</hi>
make the yellow infusions of <hi>Madder-roots</hi> red; of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil-wood,</hi>
purplish; of <hi>Lognum Nephriticum,</hi> blew; the
red infusion of <hi>Leg-wood,</hi> purple; of the Leaves of <hi>Sena,</hi>
red. 4. That on the contrary, <hi>Acid</hi> Salts quite alter and
change the said infusions from red or blew, to yellow.</p>
               <p>In the next place we would note to you the effects of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56944:12"/>
Salts upon <hi>Animals</hi> in the production and Change of
colours; but the Instances are very few or none, that I
meet with in any Author; the <hi>Purple-fish</hi> being quite out
of use, and <hi>Cochineil</hi> and <hi>Kermes</hi> are by most question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether they are Animals or no; but I think, we
may confidently believe them both to be <hi>Insects,</hi> that
is, Worms or <hi>Chrysalys</hi>'s of respective Fly's <hi>in proxima
faetura.</hi> We find then, and have tried concerning <hi>Cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neil</hi>
(which of it self is red,) that upon the affusion of
most the Oyl of Vitriol, that is, an <hi>Acid</hi> Salt, it striks the
vivid <hi>crimson</hi> that can be imagined; and with <hi>Vrinous</hi>
Salts and <hi>Alcaly's</hi> it will be again changed into an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
colour 'twixt a violet and a violet and a purple.
<hi>Pliny</hi> somewhere tells us, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> in his time could
dye with Vegetables, what the Romans with so much
danger and pains sought for in the bottom of the Sea.
Indeed, we find many Plants mentioned by the same
Author, for dying which either are not known to us at
this present, or neglected.</p>
               <p>To what we have briefly observed out of Authors,
we will subjoyne some of our own Considerations and
Tryals, And <hi>first,</hi> concerning the <hi>Apparent</hi> Colours in
Flowers, we think we may insert; 1. That generally all
Red, Blew and White flowers are immediately, upon
the affusion of an <hi>Alcaly,</hi> changed into a Green colour,
and then, in process of no long time, turned Yellow.
2. That all the parts of Vegetables, which are green,
will in like manner strike a Yellow with an <hi>Alcaly.</hi> 3.
That what Flowers are already yellow, are not much
changed, if at all, by an <hi>Alcaly</hi> or <hi>Vrinous</hi> Spirit. 4. The
Blew seed-husks of <hi>Glastum Sylvestre</hi> old-gathered and
dry, diluted with water, stain a Blew, which upon the
affusion of Lye striks a Green, which Green or Blew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
touched with the Oyl of Vitriol dyes Purple;
all these three colours stand. 5. On the tops of <hi>Fungus
tubulosus,</hi> so called by M. <hi>Wray</hi> in his late Catalogue of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56944:13"/>
the Plants of <hi>England,</hi> are certain red knots; these, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the affusion of Lye, will strike a Purple, and stand.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Latent</hi> Colours in Vegetables and Animals;
to be discovered to us by the affusion of Salts; they
likewise, no doubt, are very many. We will set down
only a few instances in both kinds, which have not been,
that we know of, discovered or taken notice of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<hi>Latent Vegitable</hi> colours, 1. The Milky juice of
<hi>Lactuca Sylvestris costâ spinosa,</hi> and <hi>Sonchus asper &amp; laevis</hi>
upon the affusion of Lye, will strike a vivid flame-colour
or Crimson, and after some time quite degenerate into a
dirty yellow. 2. The Milk of <hi>Cataputia minor,</hi> upon
the affusion of Lye, especially if it be drawn with a knife,
and hath any time stood upon the blade of it, will strike
a Purple or Bloud-red colour, and by and by change into
an ignoble yellow. <hi>Latent Animal</hi> dyes, 1. The common
Hawthorn-Catter-pillar will strike a Purple or Carnation
with Lye, and stand. 2. The heads of Beetles and Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
&amp;c. will with Lye strike the same Carnation-colour,
and stand. 3. The Amber-coloured <hi>Scolopendra</hi>
will give with lye a most beautiful and pleasant <hi>Azure</hi>
or <hi>Amethystine,</hi> and stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> we might consider the <hi>Fixing</hi> of colours for
use; but we are willing to leave this to more experinced
persons, as also the Philosophizing on the particulars we
have produced, to better Heads. Some obvious Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
we may venture to take notice of; 1. That in
all the Instances above mentioned, whether Vegetable
or Animal, there is not one colour <hi>truly</hi> fixed, however
there may, I conceive, be some use made of them, as
they are. I say, <hi>truly fixed,</hi> that is, proof of Salt and
Fire; for, what seem to <hi>stand</hi> and be <hi>Lye-proofe,</hi> are
either wholly destroyed by a different Salt, or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a much different colour; which must needs
prove a stain and blemish, when it shall happen in
the use of any of them. 2. That both the apparent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56944:13"/>
and latent colours of Vegetables are <hi>fixable:</hi> An
instance whereof we may observe in the seed-husks
of <hi>Glastum,</hi> and the Use Diers make of the leaves after
due preparation. 3. It is probable from the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that we may learn from the colour of some
part of the Fruit or Seed, what colour the Leaves of
any Vegetable and the whole Plant might be made to
yeild for our use. 4. That the <hi>Latent</hi> colours are prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent,
and not produced; from the same instance of
<hi>Wood,</hi> and likewise from this that the <hi>Milky</hi> juyce of
<hi>Lactuca Silvestris</hi> doth afford it self a <hi>Red</hi> Serum. 5.
That the change of colours in Flowers is gradual and
constant. 6. That the colours of Flowers, which will
not stand with Lye, seem to be wholly destroyed by it,
and irrecovrable: Thus it happens in the Experiment;
that one part of a Violet-leaf, upon the affusion of Lye,
is changed very soon into yellow, and will never be
revived into a red by an Acid salt; but if another part
of the same leaf be still green, it will be revived, 7. That
the Dryness seems to be a means, if not of <hi>fixing,</hi> yet
bringing the Vegetable colour into a condition of not
wholly and suddainly perishing by the otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
<hi>Alcaly.</hi> 8. That those Plants or Animals that
will strike different and yet vivid colours upon the affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of different Salts, and stand, as the <hi>Cochinel</hi> and <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi>
are probably of all others to be reckoned as the
best Materials.</p>
               <p>It would have been a much safer way, to have put
these Inferences in the <hi>Quaeri't;</hi> but besides that I affirm
no more but matter of fact, it is lawful for our encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement
(as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> advises) to set up rests by
the way, and refresh our selves with looking back, though
perhaps we have not much advanced. You will be
pleased to excuse the little cohaerence that I have used
in these notes, and attribute it to the readiness and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
I have to answer such inquiries as you put to me.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56944:14"/>
I never yet did make this subject any part of my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,
but the desire I have to search after and examine
the Medicinal qualities of things iu Nature, hath by the
by presented me with such <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> as I was not
willing to leave unnoted, nor to refuse them you, though
in a confused way, because you desire them. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
how immethodical and barren these papers may
seem; yet the consideration of them hath led me to a
way of <hi>Fixing</hi> colours, which I willingly forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
until I may have an oppertunity of shewing the
Experiment before the R. <hi>Society.</hi> I have found out a
Colour most exquisitely black, &amp; comparable to the best
ink; even in the use of the pen, and which will not
change by Fire or Salt. This an <hi>English</hi> Vegetable yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and for ought I know (for I have not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the trial on any thing else) the like method will
succeed to good purpose, I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

or Insect-husks,
of the <hi>Kermes</hi>-kind,
which I had some years
since observ'd on Plum-trees.
This instant <hi>May</hi>
hath afforded me the
same Observation, and
some little improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the same <hi>Patellae.</hi> Husks indifferently on <hi>Vine-branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Cherry-Laurel, Plvmb-trees,</hi> and the <hi>Cherry-tree,</hi>
also on the <hi>Apricock-tree.</hi> The <hi>Figure</hi> of the Husk is
round, save where thy cleave to to the branch; for <hi>bignes,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56944:14"/>
somewhat more than the half of a grey pea. These, I
say, cleave to their branches, as <hi>Patellae</hi> do to the Rocks:
For <hi>colour;</hi> they are of a very dark Ches-nut, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
smooth, and shining membran-like. They adhere
most commonly to the under side of a branch or twig,
and so are best secur'd against the injuries of weather,
as too much Sun and Rain. They are well fastned to the
branches single, and some will be double and sometimes
many in company. They are seldom found without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
as Pismires, &amp;c. which, I guess, pierce them and
pray upon them. Thus much for the entire <hi>Coccum.</hi> If
you open one of them, that is, cut off dextrously the top
of the husk with a rasor, you'l find somtimes five or more
small white magots of the Wasp or Bee-kind, that is,
sharp at both ends. When these are carefully taken out,
you will further observe the remainder of their provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of meat, and a partion 'twixt them and the branch,
where, what they excerne, is reserv'd. Lastly, if, when
you have clear'd the Husk of Maggots, Bee-meat, and
excrements, you then rub the inside of the empty mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran
upon white paper it will freely and copiously tinge
the paper with a beautiful purple or murrey. At the <hi>date</hi>
of this, none of the Maggots were yet in <hi>nympha,</hi> so that
you cannot expect from me a description of the Bee or
Wasp they will turn to, when they come to perfection.
Before the season be over, the Curious may satisfie
themselves forthwith about it, and verifie and improve
it. Few <hi>Cherry-trees,</hi> I suppose, in any place, but will
yield them some of these Berries. However, if they
shall not be so fortunate as to light on them, I shall
furnish you with them, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>Some general Enquiries concerning Spiders</head>
               <p>1. WHat sorts of Spiders to be found with us in
<hi>England,</hi> and what is the best method to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them and to reduce them to <hi>Classes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56944:15"/>
2. Whether Spiders come not of Spiders, that is, of
creatures of their own kind? And whether of Spiders
are bred Grashopper, <hi>Cicadae,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Interpreters</hi> falsly
make <hi>Aristotle</hi> to say, first <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and lately <hi>Kircher</hi>
(V. <hi>Arist. Hist. Nat.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 19. Confer Interpret.
<hi>The: Gazae, Scaliger, Aldrov.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Whether Spiders are not Male and Female; and
whether Female Spiders growing bigger than the Male,
be sufficient to distinguish Sexes.</p>
               <p>4. Whether all kinds of Spiders be alike, as to the
place and number of <hi>Penis's;</hi> and whether all the thread-yeilding
kinds, are not furnished with a double <hi>penis,</hi>
that is, if the <hi>Cornicula</hi> or certain knobbed Horns, by
which all Males are best distingushed, be not each a
<hi>penis,</hi> and used in the <hi>Coit</hi> alternatively?</p>
               <p>5. Whether the Eggs in Spiders be not formed, and
very large before the time of the <hi>Coit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. What Spiders breed in Spring, and what in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn?
what Spiders are content with one brood in the
year, and to lay all their Eggs at a time? What seem
to breed every Summer month, at least to have many
subordinate broods; and whether the Eggs be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
distinguishable in several <hi>Matrices</hi> or Cells in the
body of of the Female.</p>
               <p>7. Whether Spiders do not take their form and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the Egg, and are not thence hatched necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
at a stated and set time, that is, after a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of days, as 21, compleat Animals of its own kind?
and whether the presence of the Female be necessary in
order to the hatching the Eggs, at least for three days,
as the Ancients seem to affirm?</p>
               <p>8. Whether the perfectly-round eggs of Spiders
ought to be called and esteemed Worms,
as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> will have them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aist. Nat.</hi> lib. i. c. 27. lib. 3. c. 9.</note> that
is, in <hi>Swammerdam</hi>'s phrase and doctrine,
Whether they be <hi>Puppets</hi> in the egg, and undergo all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
accordingly, before they be thence hatched
perfect Spiders?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56944:16"/>
9. What different colours observable in the Eggs of
Spiders, as well of pulps as shell, as white, yellow, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,
purple, greenish? and what respective tinctures
they will give, or be made to strike with the several
families of Salts?</p>
               <p>10. Whether there be not Eggs of some sorts of Spiders,
which the Worms of certain slender Wasps (the kind in
general being called by <hi>Mouffet Muscae tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piles)</hi>
delight to feed on?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist. Hist. Nat.</hi> ib. 5. cap. 20.</note> and whether
the Fable of <hi>Vespae Iehneumones,</hi> told us by
the Ancients, be not to be made out by the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
of these Wasp-worms feeding on the Eggs,
and perfected into Wasps in the very webs of Spiders?</p>
               <p>11. After what manner do Spiders feed; whether in
sucking they devour not also part of their prey? How
long can they live without food, since they store up
nothing against Winter?</p>
               <p>12. Whether Spiders feed only of their own kind of
Creatures, as of Insects, that is, of Flyes, Beetles, Bees,
Scolopendrae and even of one another? or whether
they kill Snakes too, as the Ancients affirm, for food
or delight?</p>
               <p>13. Whether some of them choose not to feed on
one sort of Fly or other Insect only; and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
such have?</p>
               <p>14. When, and how oft in the year they cast their
Skins, and the manner of their casting it? What varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of colours immediatly after the shifting the Hackle
in one and the same species of Spider, that may, if not
well heeded, make the history of them more confused?</p>
               <p>15. What mean the Ancients by Spiders casting their
threads,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist. Hist. Nat.</hi> lib. 9. cap. 39.</note> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> compares to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupins</hi>
darting her quills, or bark-starting
from a Tree; and <hi>Democritus</hi> to Animals voiding of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56944:16"/>
16. Whether the thread be formed in the Body of
the Animal such as it comes from it; I mean, whether
it be, as it were, unwound of a stock or clew, as I may
say, and which indeed to me seems to have been <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
meaning; or whether it be drawn off of a liquid
mass, as in spinning of Glass or melted Wax, which
seems to have been <hi>Democritu</hi>'s sense, in saying it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
corrupted or fluid at certain times?</p>
               <p>17. Whether the Spiders-thred being glutinous, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing sticking to it upon the lightest touch, be not
so much the reason of the Spiders taking his prey, as the
Figure of the Net.</p>
               <p>18. Whether a Web be not uninflammable; and
whether it can be dissolved, and in what Menstruum?</p>
               <p>19. What difference 'twixt the thred of Spiders, and
that of the Silk-worm or Caterpillars? What strength
a Spiders thread is of, and what proportion it bears with
the like twist of Silk? Whether there be not stronger
thread from some sort of Spiders than from others, as
there are threds from them of very different colours, as
white, greenish, blewish, dark hair-colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the strength of the <hi>Barmudo</hi> nets to hold a Thrush,
mentioned in one of the <hi>Transactions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nu. 50. <hi>p.</hi> 795.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the thickness only, or much too in the
nature of thred?</p>
               <p>20. Whether its being to be easily drawn out at any
time and at what length one pleases, and many threds
together in spight of the Animal, be not as advantageous
to the working of it up and twisting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
the Cods of Silk-worms.</p>
               <p>21. Whether either the viscous substance of their
Bodies or Webs be healing to green-wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the
Ancients have taught us, and we use vulgarly? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some one kind of them be not preferable, for this
purpose, before others?</p>
               <p>22. What use may be made of those Animals, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56944:17"/>
devour Spiders for their daily food, as <hi>Wrens, Red-breast,
&amp;c.?</hi> Whether Spiders be a cure for sick Poultry, as
the good Wives seem to experiment?</p>
               <p>23. Whether the reason why Spiders sail not in the
air until Autumn, be not because they are busily emply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Summer months in breeding, or what other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may be assigned?</p>
               <p>The first article of Enquiry I have in part answered,
by sending you enclosed a Scheme, which, after some
years observation, I have corrected and enlarged to
what it is: yet I must acquaint you, that such Draughts
will be ever lyable to change and improvement, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the measure of knowledge a continued Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may bring us to. However it is the first, that I
know of, that will be extant, on this subject, and it may
be acceptable to the curious.</p>

               <head>May 30. 1671; concerning an Insect feeding upon Henbain,
together with the colour yeilded by the Eggs of the same,
&amp;c.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu may please to annex a late Observation to the
last I sent you: both being chiefly concerning the
improvement of colours, and from the Insect-kind.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Cimex</hi> of the largest size, of a red colour
spotted black, and which is to be found very frequently
and plentifully, at least in its season, upon <hi>Henbain:</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in my private notes have formerly intitled it, <hi>Cimex
ruber maculis nigris distinctus super folia Hyoscyami frequens.</hi>
This Insect in all probability doth feed upon this plant (on
which only we have yet observed it) if not upon the leaves
by striking its trunk (the note of distinction of the kind
of Insect from the rest of the Beetle-kinds) into them,
and sucking thence much of its substance, like as other
sorts of <hi>Cimices</hi> will upon the body of man <hi/> yet upon
the unctuous and greasy matter, with which the leaves
seem to touch to abound. It is further observable, that
that horrid and strong smell, with which the leaves of this
plant do affect our nostrils, is very much qualified in this
Insect, and in some measure Aromatick and agreeable,
and therefore we may expect, that that dreadful <hi>Narcosis</hi>
so eminent in this plant, may likewise be usefully temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Infect; which we refer to tryal. About the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>May</hi> and sooner, you may find adhering to the
upper side of the leaves of this plant, certain oblong O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-coloured
Eggs, which are the Eggs of this Infect.</p>
               <p>Note 1. that these Eggs yet in the belly of the Females
are white, and are so somtime after they are layd; but
as the young ones grow near their time of their being
hatched, they acquire a deeper colour, and are hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Cimices,</hi> and not in the disguise of worms.</p>
               <p>2. As to the colour, these riper Eggs yeild, if they be
crushed upon white paper, they stain it of themselves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56944:18"/>
(without any addition of Salt) with as lively a Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
or <hi>couler de seu,</hi> as any thing I know in nature;
<hi>Cochneil</hi> scarce excepted when assisted with oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.
Whether this be not precisely so, I refer to the
tryal and judgment of the Curious. I have sent you a
couple of the <hi>Cimices</hi> themselves, though you will scarce
find a Henbain-plant without them. I add concerning
the <hi>Purple-husks,</hi> whereof I gave you an account in my
last, that I have found them since on Rose-tree-twiggs
also, and that very dark coloured ones, yeilding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
Murrey: so that I conclude, that the Tree they
may be found on, scarce contributes any thing to the
colour or vertue of the husks, but they are the sole
work and product of the Mother-Insect, indifferently
choosing a twig of any tree in order to the convenient
placing and hiving her Eggs.</p>

by the figure of the Worm, of Bees, but certainly
the least, that I ever yet saw of that Tribe as not much
exceeding in their whole bulk the half of a Pismire.
They are very compact and thick for the bigness; of a
cole-black colour. They seem to want neither stings,
nor the three balls in a triangle in their fore-head; which
yet are things to be referred to the testimony of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope.
That which is very remarkable to the nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eye, is a white or straw-colour large and round spot
on the back: Of their four Wings the upper pair are
shaded or darked-spotted, the undermost pair are clear.

and not Medicaments, unless wary and safe Tryal shall
discover to us if they have any Medicinal qualities,
as use and custom hath made us believe the Exotic have
in an high degree. One of the husks, I sent you, ad
hered to a Rose-tree-twig, and other to a Cherry-tree.
But a Rose-bush since hath afforded me some scores
of these <hi>patellae,</hi> many of which are hatched in the box
I put them. It is to be further observed, 1. that
those that look the blackest, yield the deepest and best
purple: 2. That as the Bees come to maturity the dye
seems to be spent, and the Husks grow dry. 3. That
the young ones make their way out at several small
holes; whereas the true <hi>Kermes</hi> husk seems to be pierced
but in one place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second;</hi> The discovery of our <hi>English Kermes</hi>
hath very much pleased some of it the Curious in these
parts; who resolve upon Tryals of it the next season.
I think I advertised you formerly, that that deep pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or violet, with which the insides of the husks are
lin'd, is much spent, if the husks be not taken whilest
the Bees are in <hi>vermiculo;</hi> and the blackest husks are
richest in colour. Yesterday in very good company we
compar'd our English <hi>Purple-kermes</hi> with the <hi>Scarlet-kemers</hi>
or Grains of the Shops, and found them in every
point to agree save in the colour of their Juices; and
particularly (finding in some parcels of the Shops many

yet sticking to little twigs of the <hi>Ilex,)</hi> we confidently
affirm that those as well as ours are only contiguous to
the Ilex-branches, and are not <hi>excrescencies</hi> of the Tree,
much less <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>berries;</hi> by which abusive names they
have been too long known; But that they are the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

more convenient hiving and nourishment of her young.</p>

<hi>Vegetable Excrescencies;</hi> and yet not wholly to deny
you the satisfaction of what you seem much to desire,
I am willing to think again upon the same subject, at
least to recollect part of my former thoughts, as my
memory will serve me.</p>
               <p>The occasion then of that Letter was upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given us by You in <hi>Numb. 57,</hi> of the opinion of
the Italian <hi>F. Redi; Viz.</hi> that some live Plants or their
Excrescencies do truly generate some Insects. To which
opinion of <hi>F. Redi</hi> I told my friend, as I remember, that
I indeed had observed, that the By-fruits of some Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
as of the <hi>Oak</hi> and <hi>wild Rose,</hi> for example, did
grow up together with their respective worms in them
from small beginnings to fair and large fruit, some of
them emulating even the genuin off-spring of the plant,
<q>—&amp; miratur non sua poma,</q>
               </p>
               <p>And further, that I did believe, the worms were furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with food in and from them; but not by any Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connexion,
as that Author fancies, and which I said, to
me was unintelligible, and that I should be glad of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

which might make out to me such monstrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as half animal half vegetable, or which is all one,
Vegetable vessels inserted into an animal, or, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Strange Oeconomy!</p>
               <p>That it had never been my good fortune (what ever
diligence I had used) to discern Eggs in the Center of
<hi>Galls,</hi> but a worm constantly, even at the very first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
as near at least as my fortune led me. Yet I
would not deny, but that diligence might one day dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the egg it self, which I was of opinion was affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to or near the place by the parent-Insect, where
the Gall rose.</p>
               <p>That I ever found the worms in all the excrescencies,
that I had yet met with, perfectly at liberty; and for the
filaments, our Author mentions, it was very possible he
might be mistaken, it being very hard, and a matter not
yet treated of in my publick paper, which and what are
the vessels that enter into the Texture of a Vegetable,
as of a large Tree, for example; much more hard would
it be to say, this is a vessel in a small Gall. That there
were many By-fruits of different figure and shape (though
perhaps of a like Texture) upon one and the same plant,
every one of which did nourish and produce a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
race of Insects: Whence, I told him, I thought
might rather be argued the diverse workmanship of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Insects, then one and the same principle of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to be Author of several sorts of Animals.</p>
               <p>That the Animals themselves, produced of such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerscencies,
were of such a Genus many of whose Species
were well known to us to be otherwise generated of
animal parents, and therefore it was probable, that these
were so too, as well as their tribe-fellows.</p>
               <p>That the Insect-Animals produced of such Excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
were <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female;</hi> and that, if so, we might
argue with <hi>Aristotle</hi> (lib. 1. c. 1. <hi>de Generat. Animal.)</hi>
that Nature made not such in vain, and that, if from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56944:20"/>
the coit of these Animals, which have their birth from
no Animals, Animals should be born, they would <hi>either</hi>
be like their parents and of the same species with them,
and if so, it would necessarily follow (since in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of all other creatures it so comes to pass) that
their very parents had such origin too: <hi>or</hi> unlike them,
and if so (if these also were <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female)</hi> of this
second unlike off-spring a third race of different animals
or <hi>species</hi> would be begot, and of them a fourth, and so
<hi>in infinitum.</hi> And that these Insects, which he and I
had observed to be produced of the Excrescencies of
some vegetables, we had good cause to suspect they
were <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> since some of them had slings and
were tripilous, and others not <hi>(vide Catalog. plant. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab.
ad Rosam caninam &amp; alibi.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were some at least of the Arguments, as far as
I remember I used, when I formerly wrote on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to my friend; but since that Letter, I have perused
the Book of <hi>F. Redi</hi> it self, and do find, that the said
opinion is barely proposed as thing not unplausible, but
the proofs thereof are reserved, till the publishing of a
curious piece, concerning the <hi>Excrescencies</hi> of the <hi>Oak;</hi>
and therefore I shall be less earnest in the refutation of
that opinion, which perhaps a more accurate search into
Nature will in time make the Author of it himself find
erroneous.</p>
               <p>I presume not to venture to decide this controversy,
my experience in these matters being too insufficient,
and my leisure and health but little to hasten a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
stock of particulars, and a due examination of
them; yet before I leave this subject, I am willing to
run over and present you with a few abreviated instances
of some of the several kinds of Vegetable Excrescencies,
and likewise some un-obvious ways of Insects feeding
on plants; and these I shall deliver in confirmation of
the following Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56944:21"/>
1. That all are not truly Vegetable Excrescencies
that are reputed such. And here we may justly name
the <hi>Purple-Kermes,</hi> for example, whose history you were
pleased to publish in <hi>Numb. 73.</hi> This, I say, both gives
a clear light to the discovery of the nature of the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-Kermes,</hi>
(a thing wholly unknown to the Ancients,
as far as we can see by their writings, and no less ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
by the moderns, and yet, which is admirable, in
very great esteem and continued use for some thousands
of years,) and also is an evident instance, that some
things, confidently believed Vegetable Excrescencies,
are no such matter, but Artificial things meerly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
to the plant, and which have no other relation
to it than the <hi>patella</hi>-shellfish to the Rock it cleaves.</p>
               <p>2. Generally, Insects Eggs laid upon the leaves of
plants, or their respective feeding on them do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
or raise Excrescenies. This truth every body,
that hath been the least curious, is an Eye-witness of.</p>
               <p>Thus, for example, the Eggs of the common <hi>Red
butter-fly,</hi> laid upon the Nettle, are thereon hatched
without blistering the plant into an Excrescence, and
the stiff haired or prickly <hi>Catterpillars</hi> hatched from
them Eggs, feed upon the leaves without any ill impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion,
puncture, or prejudice, save that they make clean
work, and eat all before them. I could produce some
hundreds of instances, if this were to be doubted of.</p>
               <p>3. Some Insect-eggs, laid upon the leaves or other
parts of plants, do, as soon as hatched, pierce and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
within the plant to feed. To give you a convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instance of the truth of this proposition, take this
from my notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May 22,</hi> I observed on the back or underside of the
leaves of <hi>Atriplex olida,</hi> certain small milk-white ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
Eggs, on some leaves four, on others fewer, or
more; these Eggs were on some plants yet unhatched,
but on many of the same plants I found the Egg-shells
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56944:21"/>
or skins yet adhering to the leaves, and the little mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
already enterd (through I know not what invisible
holes) within the two membranes of the leaf, and
feeding on the inward pulp or substance of the leaf:
in other leaves of that plant, (he that shall make the
observation after me, will find plants enough of this <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
seized on, to vary, as I did, the observation in one
day,) I found those maggots grown very great, and
yet the two membranes, that is, the uppermost and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost
skin of the leaf, entire, but raised and hollow
like a blather. Note 1. That those maggots were of a
Conick shape. 2. That in <hi>July</hi> they shrunk into <hi>Fly
Chrysalis</hi>'s and accordingly came to perfection, &amp;c. To
this unobvious way of feeding we may refer all worm-eaten
fruits, wood, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Worms feeding within some of the parts of some
plants do cause Excrescencies. Thus the head or seed-vessels
of <hi>Papave. Spont. Sylv. Ger. Emac.</hi> &amp;c. are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
for having worms in them, and grow thrice as
big, as the not seased ones. This is also plain in the
Excresc. of <hi>Pseudo teucrium,</hi> and <hi>Barbarea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. The substance or sibrous part of many Vegetable
Excrescencies is not the food of the worms to be found
in them. The instances given in confirmation of the last
proposition do also confirm this: neither is an <hi>Oak-apple</hi>
properly worm-eaten, or the <hi>Shagged Galls,</hi> or <hi>Sponges</hi>
of the <hi>Wild Rose,</hi> or the <hi>Smooth</hi> ones on the leaves of
the same plant, or the Baggs upon the leaves of the
<hi>yellow dwarf Willow</hi> or the <hi>Elm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the sum of what I to say at present concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this subject being very unwilling to advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than my own private observations will suffer me.</p>

N. 74. P. L. about Musk sented Insects; adding some
Notes upon D. Swammedam's book of Insects, and on
that of M. Steno concerning Petrisy'd Shells.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have observed the two Insects, which Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> saith,
smell of Musk, which indeed they do in an high
degree. The <hi>small Bees</hi> are very frequent in the Wooles
in <hi>Lincoln-shire,</hi> and about the latter end of <hi>April</hi> are
to be found in pastures and meadows, upon the early-blown
flowers of a sort of <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> as You have
been rightly inform'd; but it is something improper to
say Bees feed on flowers: And likewise the same Bees
are no less frequent on the flowers of <hi>Dens Leonis,</hi> &amp;c.
The <hi>sweet Beetle,</hi> is a very large Insect, and well known
about <hi>Cambridge.</hi> All the trials I have made to preserve
them with their smell, have proved ineffectual: For,
both sorts of these Insects will of themselves in very few
weeks become almost quite sent-less. To these I shall
add another sweet-smelling Insect, which is a Hexapode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm
feeding on <hi>Gallium luteum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Observation of the <hi>Vespae Ichneumones,</hi> as it hath
relation to Spiders, I willingly reserve for other Papers:
yet I may tell you in general, that this kind of Insect
is one of the greatest puzzels<note n="†" place="margin">See more of this in my Notes upon <hi>Goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dartious</hi>
                  </note> in nature; there being
few Excrescencies of Plants, and very many births of
Insects, wherein these slender Wasps after divers strange
ways are concerned.</p>
               <p>Though I be at present from my Books, yet I well
remember the passage, which Mr. <hi>Willoughby</hi>
refers you to in <hi>Musset</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Numb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 74. p. 2221.</note>. And he is well
able to judge, whether the Observation be
made upon the same sort of Insect. I conceive it a fault
not consistent with Ingenious Spirits, to pass by in
silence the Industry of Moderns as well as Ancients
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56944:22"/>
Writers; according to that of <hi>C. Celsus: Oportet neque
recentiores viros in his fraudare, quae vel repererunt, vel
rectè secuti sunt; &amp; tamen ea, quae ab antiqui-oribus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita
sunt, authoribus suis reddere.</hi> You can best inform
me, what D. <hi>Swammerdam</hi> does in a matter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
when I read in the Account given us by you of his
Book, <hi>Numb. 64;</hi> that Snails are both Male and Female;
that Catterpillars may teach us, by their feeding, the
correspondence of the vertues of Plants,  I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous
to know, whether he quote Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> for the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
as having publish't the Observation ten years ago
at least; and for the <hi>latter,</hi> the Learned and Noble <hi>Fab.
Columna,</hi> who did propose the way of essaying the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Plants by the palats of Insects in the beginning of
this Age.</p>
               <p>But I leave this,<note place="margin">Coehlitz, or Petrified shells ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> and proceed to a remark of my own;
and it shall be, if you please, concerning <hi>Petrified Shells;</hi>
I mean such Shells, as I have observed in our English
stone-Quarries. But Sir, let me premise thus much, that
I am confident, that you at least will acquit me, and
not believe me one of a litigious nature. This I say in
reference to what I have lately read in <hi>Steno's Prodromus,</hi>
that, if my sentiments on this particular are somewhat
different from his, it proceeds not from a spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
but from a different view of Nature. First
then, we will easily believe, that in some Countries, and
particularly along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea,
there may all manner of Sea shells be found <hi>promiscuously</hi>
included in Rocks or Earth, and at good distances too from
the Sea. But, for our English-inland <hi>Quarries,</hi> which also
abound with infinte number and great varieties of shells,
I am apt to think, there is no such matter, as Petrifying
of Shells in the business (or, as <hi>Steno</hi>-explains himself p.
84. in the English Version, <hi>&amp; alibi,</hi> that the substance of
those shells, formerly belonging to animals, hath been
dissolved or wasted by the penetrating force of juices,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56944:23"/>
and that a stony substance is come in the place thereof,)
but that these Cockle-like stones ever were, as they are
at present, <hi>Lapides sui generis</hi> and never any part of an
Animal. That they are so at present, is in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by <hi>Steno</hi> in the above cited page; and it is most
certain, that our English Quarry-shells (to continue that
abusive name) have no parts of a different Texture from
the rock or quarry they are taken, that is, there is no such
thing as <hi>shell</hi> in these resemblances of shells, but that Iron-stone
Cockles are all Iron stone; Lime or marble all
Lime-stone and Marble; Sparre or Chrystalline-shells
all Sparr, &amp;c. and that they never were any part of
an Animal. My reason is: That Quarries of different stone
yeild us quite different sorts or species of shells, not only
one from another (as those Cockle-stones of the Iron-stone
Quarries of <hi>Adderton</hi> in <hi>York-shire</hi> differ from
those found in the Lead-mines of the neighbouring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untains,
and both these from that Cockle-Quarrie of <hi>Wans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>-bridge
in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> and all three from
those to be found in the Quarries about <hi>Gunnerby</hi> and
<hi>Béavour-Castle,</hi> ) but, I dare boldly say from any
thing in nature besides, that either the land, salt, or fresh
water doth yeild us. 'Tis true, that I have picked out
of that one Quarry of <hi>Wansford</hi> very resemblances of
<hi>Murices, Telinae, Turbines, Cochleae,</hi> &amp;c. and yet I am
not convinced, when I particularly examined some of our
English shores for shells, also the fresh waters and the
fields, that I did ever meet with (N. B.) any one of those
<hi>species</hi> of shells any where else, but in their respective
Quarries; whence I conclude them <hi>Lapides fui generis,</hi>
and that they were not cast in any <hi>Animal-mold,</hi> whose
species or race is yet to be found in being at this day.</p>
               <p>This argument perhaps will not so readly take place
with those persons, that think it not worth the while e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xactly
and minutely to distinguish the several <hi>species</hi> of
the things of nature, but are content to acquiesce in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56944:23"/>
                  <hi>figure, resemblance, kind,</hi> and such general notions; but
when they shall please to condescend to heedful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
descriptions, they will, I doubt not, be of that
opinion, which an attentive view of these things led me
into some years ago. Though I make no doubt, but the
Repository of the <hi>R. Society</hi> is amply furnished with
things of this nature; yet if you shall command them,
I will send you up two or three sorts of our English Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle-stone
of different Quarries, nearly resembling one
the other and all of them very like a common sort of Sea-shell,
and yet if there shall not be enough specifically
to distinguish them, and hinder them from being sampled
by any thing of the spoils of the Sea or fresh waters or
the land-Snails; my argument will fail, and I shall be
happily convinced of an Errour.</p>

               <head>Another Letter, from York Sept. 13 1671. enlarging
his former Communications in Numb. 75. about Veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Excrescencies, and Ichneumon-Wormes.</head>
               <p>IN my last Paper about <hi>Vegetable Excrescencies,</hi> I was
wholly-silent of the opinion, which Mr. <hi>Willoughby</hi>
is pleased to favour; and because that worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath so far made it probable, that now it seems only
to depend upon the good fortune of some lucky Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server,
I am willing to reassume my former thoughts,
that all those odd Observations, we have made of the
<hi>Births</hi> of <hi>Ichneumons,</hi> do but beget in me a strong belief,
that they have a way yet unheeded, whereby they do as
boldly, as subtly, convey their Eggs within the Bodies
of Insects and parts of Vegetables.</p>
               <p>A fifth and last proposition of that Paper * was, that
the <hi>substance of many Vegetable Excrescencies
seemed not to be the food of the worms to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound in them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Numb. 75. p. 2254.</note> My meaning was, that the
substance of the Vegetable Excrescencies in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56944:24"/>
which those <hi>Ichneumon</hi> worms were to be found, was
rather augmented, than diminished or worm-eaten. And
the like conformity of their feeding within Insects is well
observed by Mr. <hi>Willoughby</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See above in this very Tract.</note>, that the
impraegnated Caterpillars seem not to be
concerned, though their bodies are full of
Insects of a quite different kind, but go
on as far as they may towards the atchievement of the
perfection of their own species. Thus I have seen a <hi>Poppy-head</hi>
fwoln to a monstrous bulk, and yet all the Cells
were not receptacles of <hi>Ichneumons,</hi> but some had good
and ripe feed in them. I shall not refuse Mr. <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
(though you know upon what grounds I have twice
done it to you) the satisfaction of an Answer to my 10<hi>th
Quaere,</hi> by him resolved negatively: It is true, the swarms
of the <hi>Ichneumons,</hi> coming out of the sides of Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars,
do immediatly make themselves up into bunches,
and each particular <hi>Theca,</hi> from the Cabbage-Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar
(for example,) is wrote about with yellow silk,
as those from the black and yellow-<hi>Jacobaea</hi>-Catterpillar
with white; but as for web to cover those bunches of
<hi>Theca's,</hi> I never observed it but in the green Catterpillar
so common in our <hi>Lincoln-sheir,</hi> heaths, which are affixed
to Bents or other plants. These in truth never deceived
but my expectation, for I verily thought I had found,
when I first observed them, a Caterpillar equivalent to
the <hi>Indian</hi> silk-worm; but having cut them in two, and
expected to have found a Caterpallars <hi>Chrysalis</hi> in the
middle, there presented themselves a swarm of <hi>Ichne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umons.</hi>
These are as large many of them as my thumb,
that is, at least four times bigger then the <hi>Folliculus</hi> or
Egg-bag of any English spider that I ever saw yet. By
good fortune I have not thrown away the boxes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I made the Observation concerning <hi>Ichneumons</hi> feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Eggs of certain Spiders. I have had them
in several boxes, some 8, some 10, some 12 days in <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculo,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56944:24"/>
feeding upon the very cakes of Spiders-eggs,
before they wrought themselves <hi>Theca's</hi> for further
change; and they seldome exceeded the number of 5
to one cake of Eggs, &amp;c. so that you may assure Mr.

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56944:25"/>
Concerning the fifth and last proposition of the <hi>first</hi>
paper, it might be more intelligibly experssed thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the substance or <hi>fibrous</hi> part of <hi>many</hi> Vegetable
Excrescencies <hi>seems</hi> not to be the food of the worms
found in them: My meaning is, that the worms in those
Vegetable Excrescencies, which produce <hi>Ichoneumons</hi>
(to which kind of Insect we would limit this proposition,
and therefore expunge all other instances,) these worms,
I say, do not seem to devour the substances or fibrous part
of them, as other worms eat the Kernels of nuts, &amp;c.
but that (what-ever their manner of feeding is, and we
doubt not but that they are nourish't in and upon some
part of them,) the Vegetable Excrescencies still mightily
increase in bulk, and rise as the worms feed.</p>
                  <p>It is observable (to endeavour a Solution) that some of
the <hi>Ichneumons</hi> delight to feed of a liquid matter, as the
Eggs of Spiders, the juices (if not Eggs) within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Caterpillers and Maggots: Whence we conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that those of the same <hi>Genus,</hi> to be found in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Excrescencies, may in like manner suck in the juices
of the equivalent parts of Vegetables. And <hi>this</hi> the dry
and spongy texture of some of those kind of Excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
seems to evince: For, if you cut in Pieces a <hi>wild-poppy-head,</hi>
for example, (or the great and soft balls of
the <hi>Oak)</hi> you'l find in those partitions, wherein these
worms are lodged, nothing but a pithy substance like
that of young Elder; and if there chance to be any cells
yet unseised, (which I have sometimes observed) the
feeds therein will be found yet entire and ripe. Whence
very probably they feed upon or suck-in by little and
little the yet liquid pulp of the tender seeds, and leave
the substance or fibrous part to be expanded into an
Excrescence.</p>
                  <p>As for matter of Fact, to clear the truth of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the divers races of <hi>Ichneumons</hi> are generated
by their respective Animal-parents, and particularly that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56944:26"/>
which the divers Excrescencies of Vegetables produce,
are not <hi>plantigenous,</hi> I am in great hopes, the instance of
<hi>Poppy-heads,</hi> swoln into Excrescencies, will favour us the
next season. My expectation is chiefly grounded upon
the condition and nature of that plant; which is such,
that nothing can pierce the skin of it and wound it but
it must necessarily leave a mark of its entry, the milky
juice springing upon the lightest puncture, and drying
and <hi>concreting</hi> suddainly into a red scar: And this, I
think, I may affirm, that of the many heads grown into
Excrescencies, which I gathered this Summer, all had
more or less of those marks upon them. But our aim is
heer only to make way for the Observation against the
next season; to which purpose also we propose the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Quaere's;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Whether the shagged balls of the <hi>Wild Rose</hi> are
not Excrescencies grown from the bud and very fruit
of the plant; like as the <hi>Wild-Poppy</hi>-heads are apparently
not for worms but seed.</p>
                  <p>2. Whether the large and soft balls of the Oak are
not in like manner the bud and acorn with all the parts
of a sprouting branch, thus monstrously perverted from
the first design of nature?</p>
                  <p>3. Upon what parts or juices the <hi>Ichneumons</hi>-wroms,
supposed to be thrust into Caterpillars and other Maggots
can be thought to feed: And whether there be not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Eggs in Caterpillars and Maggots (as there are to
be observed in their respective <hi>Chrysalis</hi>'s) sufficient to
serve them for food?</p>
                  <p>

In turning over my Notes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56944:27"/>
made some years agoe, I find, among other things of this
nature, some few Observations concerning the <hi>Veins</hi> of
Plants, or such <hi>Duct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>'s as seem to contain and carry in
them the noblest juices of Plants. Of these there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no mention made in this curious <hi>Tractate,</hi> unless
under the notion of <hi>Pores.</hi> And because I am of the
opinion, that they will prove vessels Analogous to our
<hi>Hu man Veins,</hi> and not meer <hi>Pores,</hi> they shall, if you please,
be the subject of your entertainment in this Letter; and
the rather that, if they prove <hi>Veins</hi> (as I little doubt them)
they are not to be passed over in silence, but are early
to be accounted for in the Anatomy of <hi>Vegetables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To avoid ambiguity; Those parts of a Plant, which
<hi>Pliny (lib. 16. 38.)</hi> calls by the names of <hi>Venae</hi> and <hi>Pulpae,</hi> are
nothing else, in my opinion but what our late Author,
Dr. <hi>Crew,</hi> calls <hi>Fibres</hi> and <hi>Insertments,</hi> or the <hi>Lignous</hi> body
interwoven with that which he takes to be <hi>Cortical,</hi> that
is, the several distinctions of the <hi>Grain.</hi> Now, that the
vessels, we are about to discourse of, are not any of the
<hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Lignous</hi> body (to use the <hi>Doctors</hi> terms) is
plain in a traverse Cut of <hi>Angelica Sylvestris magna vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatior
J. B,</hi> for example; the Veins there very clearly
shew themselves to an attentive view to be distinct from
<hi>Fibres,</hi> observable in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the same Cortical
body together with themselves; the Milky juice still
rising <hi>besides</hi> and not <hi>in</hi> any <hi>Fibre.</hi> Also in the like cut
of a <hi>Burdock</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> the like juice springs on this and
on that side of the <hi>radii</hi> of the Woody circle, that is, in
the <hi>Cortical</hi> body and <hi>pith</hi> only. Again, where there
is no <hi>pith,</hi> there is none of these <hi>Veins</hi> as in the Roots
of plants, and Trunks of trees; but ever in the <hi>Bark</hi> of
either. I need not here enumerate the many Plants,
wherein these particulars are most plainly observable,
as in <hi>Sphondylium, Cicutaria,</hi> many of the <hi>Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sle</hi> kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, Neither are they probably of the number of
the <hi>Pores,</hi> described by our <hi>Author in the Cortical</hi> body,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56944:27"/>
or <hi>Pith.</hi> Not surely of those <hi>Pores</hi> extended by the
<hi>breadth,</hi> because the course of the juice in these vessels
is by the <hi>length</hi> of the plant; as I have sometimes very
plainly traced in the pith of a dryed <hi>Fennel-stalk,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them by dissection quite through the length of
the pith. It remains, that, if <hi>Pores,</hi> they are of those pores
of the <hi>Cortical</hi> body, that are supposed to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>length</hi> thereof; which yet seems (to me at
least) not enough, but we think them vessels invested
with their own proper membranes, analogous to the
Veins of our Humaine body; for these reasons: 1. Because
they are to be found in the <hi>Pith,</hi> and sometime in the
<hi>Cortical</hi> body of a plant, not included within the <hi>common</hi>
Tunicle of any <hi>Fibres,</hi> as is above noted: (that Fibers,
or the Seminal root are cloathed, is most plain in some
plants, as in <hi>Fern</hi> and <hi>Geranium Batrachoides,</hi> the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
of the former are coated, at least in some parts of
the plant, with a black skin, in the <hi>latter</hi> likewise with
a red one:) And in these cases, had they not, I say, their
own proper membranes, we see no cause, why the very
porous and spongy body of the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Cortex,</hi> should
not be in all places filled alike with the juice, and not
rise (as most plainly it doth) in a few determinate and
set places only, that is, according to the position and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of these vessels. 2. Again the Experiment I made,
which you were pleased to publish<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Numb, 70.</hi> p, 2122, &amp; 2123.</note>, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the effect of a ligature on <hi>Catapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
minor L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bel.</hi> viz. the sudden springing
of the Milky juice out of infinite pores besides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision:
(the cause of which <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> I take be, the
dissected veins impetuously discharging themselves of
part of their juice within the porous <hi>Panenchyma</hi> of the
Bark;) whence it is probable, that, if there was no
coated vessel to hold this milky juice, we might well
expect its springing upon the bare ligature, as when we
squeez a wet Sponge; the external Cuticle of the plant,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56944:28"/>
as this Experiment shews, being actually perforated.</p>
               <p>In the next place it is very probable, that these ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are in <hi>all</hi> Plants whatsoever. For as it is truth-like
of all the other <hi>substantial</hi> parts of plants, though speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by divers accidents in Figure and Texture; so of
these <hi>Veins,</hi> which, though they be discernable mostly
in those plants where they hold <hi>discouloured juices,</hi> yet
we may very probably think, that they are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where the eye finds not that assistance in the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
of them. And in these very plants, where they
are <hi>least</hi> visible, there is yet a time when they are, if
not in all, yet in some parts of these plants, plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the naked eye: The tender shoots of the
Greater and Lesser <hi>Maple,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> are full of a milky
juice; <hi>viz</hi> the known liquor of these Veins. Again to
this purpose, If you apply a clean knife blade to a
travers cut of the like Shoots of <hi>Elder,</hi> the Gummy liquor
of these Veins will be drawn forth into visible strings,
as is the nature of Bird-lime of the bark of <hi>Holly,</hi> or
the milk of <hi>Cataputia minor Lobel.</hi> Further, The leaf
stalks of our <hi>Garden Rubarb</hi> do sometimes shoot (by
what accident, we enquire not here) a transparent and
very pure Chrystallin <hi>Gumm,</hi> though the Veins, that
held this gummy juice, are by no ordinary means visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in them, and yet by comparing the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this Gum, with that of the Gums of other
Vegetables to be of theirs, by the same comparative
Anatomy. Lastly, we think, that even <hi>Mushromes</hi> (that
seemingly inferiour and imperfect order of Vegetables)
are not exempt and destitute of these Veins, some of
them yielding a milky juice, hot and fiery, not unlike
some of the <hi>Spurge</hi> kind, or <hi>Euphorbium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might be expected, that I should add somethings at
least, concerning the Original and Productions of these
Veins, if not an exact description of them, the course of
the juices in them, and their more immediate and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56944:28"/>
uses in the matter of Vegetation: But I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that (besides the season is not now proper
to improve and verifie, if I had leisure, the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
formerly noted, and that they were things thrown
into my <hi>Adversaria</hi> without other order, than that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should slip from me in the quest of Medicaments,
that might be of light) although I find indeed many
scattered particulars (besides them already delivered)
concerning the Position, Order, Number, Capacity, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
Differences, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of these Veins; you
will be pleased to take it in good part, if I think fitting to
reserve them until the opportunity of another Summers
review: It seeming to me no small matter, to have fairly
hinted the existence of them to such curious persons as
shall have the leisure, and find themselves in better cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
than I can pretend to, as to those great
advantages of Glasses. Designing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude with the <hi>primary</hi> use of these <hi>Veins;</hi>
which is, in my opinion, to carry the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> because, where they are not, there is no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation;
as it is seen, if an ingrafted Branch or Arm
be bared and stripped off the clay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> all the
course of Vegetation will appear to have been made only
by the <hi>Bark,</hi> and not by the <hi>Wood,</hi> that is, in the place
only, where these veins are. A <hi>secondary</hi> use is the rich
furniture of our Shops; for, from these <hi>Veins</hi> only it is,
that all our <hi>Vegetable Drugs</hi> are extracted, and infinite
more might be had, by a diligent enquiry, and easy
means, which I have not unsuccefully put in practice;
witness the <hi>black Resin,</hi> I not long since sent you a

               <head>An Account of a Stone cut out from under the tongue of

               </opener>
               <p>IN obedience to your Grace's Commands, I have pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Circumstances of a not common Medical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
viz. the Excision of <hi>a stone</hi> from under the
tongue. And I here with present your Grace also with
the stone its self, as I had it from the person it was taken.<note n="*" place="margin">This Stone is now in the custody of the <hi>R, Society,</hi> to whom it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented afterwards.</note>
As to the occasion and time of its birth,
he tels me, (My Lord, you may be pleas'd
to give firm Credit to every particular,
that he hath answered me at your Grace's
instance) it was from a winter Sea-voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
which lasted much longer than he expected, and
wherein he suffered an exceeding cold; and that, not
long after his landing, he found a certain <hi>Nodus</hi> or hard
lump in the very place whence this stone was cut. There
was about 8 years betwixt its breading and being
taken away.</p>
               <p>As to its growth, and the inconveniences thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensuing;
he further saith, that upon all fresh-cold tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he suffered much pain in that part especially; and
yet, that cold once being over, that part was no more
painful than the rest of his mouth. He adds, that towards
the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> year it did often cause sudden swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in all the Glanduls about the mouth and throat
upon the first draught of beer at meals; which yet would
in a short time fall again.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as to the particulars remarkable at the time
of its being taken away, he relates; That it began its
work with a sudden <hi>vertigo;</hi> which vertiginous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
continued more or less from Spring 'till <hi>August;</hi>
in which month, without any praevious cause save rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the place where it was lodged suddainly swelled,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56944:29"/>
and ran purulent matter at the aperture of the <hi>duct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
Whartouianus:</hi> that it suddainly stopped of its running
(which he cannot attribute to any thing but Cold,) and
swelled with a great inflammation, and very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of choaking; it being scarce credible, what pain the
party suffered in endeavouring to swallow even beer
or any liquid thing.</p>
               <p>This extremity lasted 5 days, in all which time, the
party had so vast a flux of spittle runing from him, that
it was not possible for him to repose his head to sleep,
without wetting all the bed about him; insomuch as
that it was very much questioned by some friendly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitants,

made use of Mercurial medicines.</p>
               <p>The varieties or degrees of this <hi>spontaneous salivation</hi>
were such, that he urged me not to omit them in the
relation I was to make to your Grace, as thinking
them very notable.</p>
               <p>The first day, the <hi>saliva</hi> ran thin and transparent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
like water without any bubles. The 2 day it ran
frothy; it tasted salt, (which yet he is apt to think hot
rather, than really salt, because that day the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was at the height). The 3 day it roaped exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
on which day a small pin-hole broak directly
over the place of the Stone and ran with purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as formerly. The 4 day the <hi>saliva</hi> ran <hi>insipid,</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
cold in the mouth; (which again confirms me in
that opinion, that the former sharp tast was the effect
of heat, and not the immediate quality of a salt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;)
very little forthy. The 5 day (which was that
of the incision,) it ran as on the 4 <hi>th</hi> but left an extream
claminess on the teeth, insomuch that they often clave
together, as though they had been joyned together
with glue.</p>
               <p>Upon the inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first. As to the Stone it self, it was so hard as to
endure the <hi>forcipes</hi> in drawing it forth: it was covered
over with grass green matter, which soon dryed, and left
the stone of a whitish colour, as it is to be seen. It is but
light in proportion to its bulk, weighing about 7 grains;
and its much of the shape of our ordinary horse-beans.
There are visible impressions upon it of some Capillary
and small vessels, it was bred amongst. Lastly, it is
scabrous or rough, sand-like, although the substance
is Tophaceous.</p>
               <p>The Accidents accompaning the working away of this
Stone, (for the incision was meerly obstetrical,) and
the place of its birth give occasion to call the distemper
a <hi>Ranula.</hi> Yet in truth this was nothing else but one
of those Tumours called <hi>Atheroma,</hi> and therefore we
will name it <hi>lapis Atheromatis.</hi>

                  <salute>Sir.</salute>

               <p>I Cannot discover any thing new and rare in natural
Philosophy, but I must forthwith make you parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
of my good fortune; and I assure you, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
I am about to make you, is of a thing very
surprising.</p>
               <p>It hath been credibly reported, that <hi>Horse-hairs</hi> thrown
into water will be animated; and yet I shall shew you
by an unquestionable observation, that such things as
are vulgarly thought animated Hairs are very Insects,
nourished within the bodies of other Insects, even
as <hi>Ichneumons</hi> are within the bodies of Caterpillars.</p>
               <p>I will premise the particulars concerning this Ainmal,
as I find them collected by the Industry of <hi>Aldorvaudus,</hi>
and save you the trouble of that voluminous Author.</p>
               <p>This Insect (saith he) seems to have been unknown
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56944:30"/>
to the Ancients; as it is called by the moderns <hi>seta aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi>
or <hi>vermis set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rius,</hi> either from the most slender figure
of the body; or because it is thought to be generated of
an horse-hair putrifying in water. The Germans call
them by a name rendred <hi>Vituli aquatici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is bred in corrupt waters; perhaps of horse-hair,
for (saith <hi>Albertus</hi> upon his own frequent trial, as I find
him quoted by <hi>Aldrovandus,)</hi> these hairs, put into stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water, move and are animated or, as he words it, <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
&amp; spiritum accipiunt, &amp; moventur.</hi> Other have
thought them to have their birth from weeds hanging
down from the banks into ponds and Rivers. Others from
Locusts and Grashoppers <hi>(ex Bruchis;)</hi> which last though
it be near the matter, yet it is rejected by <hi>Aldrovandus</hi>
himself, as the most unlikely.</p>
               <p>They have been fouud in cold and good springs, and
elsewhere, (which is a wonder, saith <hi>Aldrovandus,)</hi>
upon a leafe in a Garden. And this, which was there
found, was 5 or 6 fingers-breadth long; the thickness of
a bristle Horse-hair, with a duskish back, and a white
belly; and the tail on every side white.</p>
               <p>I saw (saith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> a black one thicker than
the whitish one. Other Authors otherwise descibe them,
as <hi>Bertruius, Albertus, &amp;c.</hi> Some affirming them to have
been a cubit long; others, two cubits others, 9 inches
long at the least: that they are white of colour, and so
hard as scarce to be crushed with ones foot: to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where of the same thickness: that they move not
as wormes move, but <hi>snake-like,</hi> and knit themselves up
into knots: that their skin is one continued thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Incisures; and therefore some would exclude them
from the Insect-kind: that they have no head, but swim
both waies, and therefore may be called <hi>amphisbaena a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatica:</hi>
that they are poyson, drunk down into the
stomack, but not venom to touch.</p>
               <p>And thus much out of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> concerning the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56944:31"/>
name of this Insect, the place of its birth and original,
the place where they are to be found, its description,
different species, nature, poyson &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our observation is this. <hi>April. 2.</hi> there was thrown
up out of the ground of my Garden, in digging amongst
other things of this nature, a certian cole-black Beetle
of a midle size, and flat shape, and which I have observed
elsewhere common enough. These Beetles I dissected
upon the account of some curiosity, wherein I had a
mind to satisfy my self. But I was surprised to find in
their swollen bellies of these <hi>Hair-wormes,</hi> in some three,
in others but one onely. These particulars we carefully
noted: 1. That upon the incision they crawl'd forth of
themselves. 2. That putting them into water, they lived
in it many daies, and did seem to endeavour to escape
by lifting up their heads out of the water, and sastning
them to the side of the vessels; very plainly drawing the
rest of their body forward. 3. That they cannot be said
to be <hi>amphisbaena,</hi> but do move forward only by the
head, which is fairly distinguishable from the Tail by a
notable blackness. 4. That the three, I took out of the
body of one Beetle, were all of a dark hair-colour with
whitish-bellies, somewhat thicker then hoggs bristles;
but I took out of the body of another beetle one that
was mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and by measure just five Inches and a half long;
whereas all the rest did not exceed three inches three

               <p>1. That we have this year seen the very Gumm of the

that they seem to be distended and to war

               <p>3. That they are fill'd with a sort of <hi>Mites;</hi> that small
powder (which I said to be Excrement,) being <hi>Mites</hi>
as well as that <hi>Liquamen</hi> or softer pulp (which I took to

pretty well assur'd by my own, and also by my ingenious

               <p>4. That the Bee-grubbs actually feed on Mites, there
being no other food for them.</p>
               <p>5. That there are other <hi>Species</hi> of Beesor Wasps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

to make these Mites their food: Dr. <hi>Johnson</hi> having
open'd one Husk, with one only large Maggot in it.</p>
               <p>6. That there are probably different sorts of Mites

Mites, enclosed in a fine white Cotten, the whole Husk
starting from the Twiggs, shrivelling up, and serving
only for a Cap or Cover to that company of Mites,
Other Mites I have seen white, and (which is most usual)
the Husks continuing intire and not coming away from
the Twigg they adhere to, and but little Cotton at the

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE have formerly given you certain reasons for
the Existance of <hi>Veins,</hi> (analogous to those in
Animals) in all Plants whatsoever, not Mushromes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
To which we might add others of later notice;
as the skin of a plant may be cut sheer off with part of
the spongy <hi>parenchyma,</hi> and no signs of Milky juice
follow, that is, no breach of a vein. Again, we have
stript the Plant of its skin, by pulling it up by the roots,
and exposing it to the wet weather, untill it became
flaccid as a wet thong, without any injury to the Veins,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56944:33"/>
which yet upon incision would freshly bleed. These Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
I say, make against the general opinion of one
only sap loosely pervading the whole plant, like water
in a sponge.</p>
               <p>And though we have made these and many other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
to facilitate an ocular demonstration of these
Veins; yet we have not been able to effect it to our
mind, and subject them as nakedly to our eye as we could
wish, for a through-information of their Use, and a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute
and accurate discovery of all the particular Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
belonging to them as such vessels. This, I say,
is a work of much labour and patience; and that which
renders matters very difficult, is the infinite number,
smallness and perplexity of these Veins.</p>
               <p>In the Transverse cuts of Plants, we see as it were a
certain Order and Number the bloody orifices of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected
veins. We observe also in a Leaf, which we
take to be the simplest part of a plant.</p>
               <p>1. That the Veins keep company with the Ribbs and
Nerves (as we vulgarly call them,) and are distributed
into all the parts of the Leaf, according to the subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of those nervous lineaments, and are disposed with
them into a certain net-work; whether by Inosculations
or bare contact only, we pretend not to determine.</p>
               <p>2. That in a Transverse cut of a Leaf, the middle
Fibre or nerve, for example, seems to yeild one big drop
of a Milkie juice, springing as it were from one vein;
yet the Miscroscope plainly shews us, that there are
many veins which contribute to the making up of that
drop.</p>
               <p>3. That if a Fibre or nerve be carefully taken out of
the Leaf, the Veins will appear in it like so many small
hairs or pipes running along and striping the nerve.</p>
               <p>4. That those many veins are all of an equal bigness,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56944:34"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to be more certain of the
ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ifications of the Fibres, wherein those veins are, we
yet are so, that those veins do any where grow less and
smaller, though probably it may be so. That which
makes us doubt it, is the exceeding smallness of these
veins already, even where we might probably expect
them to be Trunk veins and of the largest size; and
being there also in very great Numbers and running in
direct lines along the fibre, we guess, that one or more
of them may be distributed and fall off on either hand
with the subdivisions of the fibres, and not suffer any
diminution in their bulk.</p>
               <p>6. That we cannot discern any where throughout the
whole plant larger or more capacious veins, than those
we see adhering to the fibres of the Leaves; which do
also appear from comparing the bleeding Orifices in a
transverse cut. I have found it a difficult and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
task, to trace and unravel them throughout the
whole plant.</p>
               <p>Our opinion is, that these Veins do still keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with their respective Fibres. And as all the Fibres
of the Leaf are joined in the Stalk of the Leaf, and that
stalk explicated in cloathing the Twig or Stem of the
plant, (which we take to be the reason of the orderly
breaking forth of the Leaves.) so do we think of the
Veins, their perpetual companions. And, as we have
said, the Fibres of the Leaves are joined in the Twig;
so are those of the Twigs in the Branches; those of the
branches in the Trunk or body of the tree: The like also
in an inverted order we seem to observe in the several
Coats and Ramifications of the Root. This the several
Circles of bleeding Orifices in tranverse cuts seems to
confirm.</p>
               <p>But more in the Roots of plants, if a simple Coat be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56944:34"/>
separated and exposed betwixt your eye and the light,
the Veins appear to be strangly intangled and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and not in the simple order, as in the Leaves. The
like we think of the Bark of the bodies of Trees, which
we cannot distinguish from the Roots of plants; though
there is, indeed, something (at least at certain seasons
of the year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in the Root, which is not to be found in
any part of the plant besides.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, it may well be doubted,
whether there is any <hi>sinus</hi> or common Trunk, into which
all the veins are gathered? But rather, each existing
apart by it self. We indeed have found it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
so to exhaust the plant of its milkie juice, as to kill
it, though we have given it very many incisions to that
purpose. Divers other instances there are, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Discontinuance of the Veins, and the little
relation and intercourse they have with one another;
as one branch of a Tree having fair and well grown
fruit, before the other branches of the same tree and
fruit blossom or have leaves; from the different situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and other circumstances of culture; the indefinite and
perpetual growth of a Tree; the Cyon governing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus far we have taken our information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these Veins, partly by the appearance they
make in transverse cuts, and partly by the help of a
Microscope; which last indeed has shewed us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their number, magnitude, order, distributions,
&amp;c. And yet neither of these helps in our hands has
satisfactorily discovered to us other particulars belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to these vessels, as external Figure, Coats, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The substance of these veins seems to be as truly
<hi>Membranous,</hi> as the Veins of Animals: A Leaf will not
give way and be extended, but the Veins in a leaf, if
freed of all the woody Fibres, will be stretched out
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56944:35"/>
to one third part at least, and vigorously restore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
again, just like a Vein, Gut, or any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
<hi>ductus</hi> of an Animal. Again these membranous
Pipes are exceeding thin and transparent, because they
suddainly disappear and subside after their being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
of their Juice; and particularly in that we see
the liquor, they hold, quite through our Veins, or (in
<hi>Chelidonium majus,</hi> for example) a tincture of Saffron
in Crystalline Pipes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the External Figure of these Veins and
Cavitie, as well as other Accidents, we thought, they
would have been made more apparent to us, if it were
possible to coagulate the Juice they hold without much
shrinking the plant. We were in hopes, <hi>Freezing</hi> would
have effected this; which though it did not succeed as
we promised our selves, in respect of the manifestation
of these Accidents; yet it gave us some further light
into the nature of the Juice of these veins. In the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
frost, which hapned the other winter, we dissected
the frozen leaves of the <hi>Garden Spurge.</hi> Here we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that all Juice (besides that which these veins
hold) was, indeed, frozen into hard Ice, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
out in the figure of the containing pores; but
the Milkie-Juice was as liquid as ever, but not so brisk
as in open weather.</p>
               <p>This Experiment we take to be good proof of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of this Milkie Juice, and that it hath within it
self so great a degree of fermentation, that it preserves
it self and consequently the whole plant from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of the weather; that is, the plant owes it life to it.
Thus we have seen Insects (as <hi>Hexapode</hi>-worms, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
ly frozen upon the snow into very lumps of Ice, which
did not only cause the glass to ring we struck them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
but did endanger the breaking of it: And yet,
put under the glass and exposed to the warmth of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56944:35"/>
fire, they quickly recovered their legs and vigour to
escape; which we think could not be, unless
the Vital liquor of their veins, as in this Instance
of plants, had been untouched and little concerned in
the frost. Further, we hence also argue the different
<hi>Vses</hi> as well as <hi>Natures</hi> of these Juices, and look upon
the frozen Icicles or that copious dilute and Limpid
sap as <hi>Alimental;</hi> the Milkie and not frozen Juice, as
as the only proper <hi>Venal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the motion of these Juices, these things are certain;</p>
               <p>1. That the <hi>Milkie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Juice alwaies moves and spring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
briskly upon the opening of a vein; the <hi>Limpid</hi> sap but
at certain seasons, and as it were by accident, and not
(as I judge) from any vital principle or fermentation
of its own.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>vena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> juice hath a manifest intestine motion
or fermentation within it self; witness (besides what hath
been just now said of it) its contributing (and the long
continuance of) that motion to the most insensible li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors;
and likewise its thick and troubled bleeding,
sike the rising of yeast, which yet in a few hours after
drawing falls, and the juice becomes transparent, as the
Gum of the <hi>Virginian Rhus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I shall not desire any person to acquiesce wholly in
a bare fermentation; but endeavour a happy discovery
of the Frame of <hi>all</hi> the parts of a plant, on which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this motion may much depend. In the mean time
we must indeed needs think (according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we yet have of the parts of plants,) that these juices
move by a far different contrivance of parts from that
of Animals; not yet here discovering any uniting of
veins into one common Trunk, no Pulsation, no sensible
stop by ligature, no difference in veins, &amp;c. All which
difficulties notwithstanding may, I hope, in time may be
happily overcome; and the Analogie betwixt Plants and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56944:36"/>
Animals be in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

of the heads of Poppies from a pendulous pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and particlarly the <hi>Vermicular</hi> motion of the
veins when exposed to the air. Again, the Veins of
Plants may indeed be different, though at present we
cannot tell wherein they are so. The Arteries within
our heads are hardy to be known by the eye from the
Veins. Further there are natural and spontaneous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
or venting of superfluous moisture in plants,
visible and constant, in the <hi>Crown Imperial, Rorella, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guicula,</hi>
&amp;c. As to the Ligature, as it hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
applied by us, it is not to be relyed on for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of this motion; the Veins only of plants being
the parts probably distendable.</p>
               <p>Lastly we shall not omit to tell you, that either we
must take that away from the other reasons given of
the necessity of the Circulation of the blood in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<hi>viz.</hi> the hindring of its breaking and clodding;
or we must grant the same motion to the <hi>Venal</hi> juice in
Plants: we having undeniable Experiments to shew,
that the Venal juice of Plants and the <hi>Blood</hi> of Animals
agree in this, that they both, when they are once drawn
from their respective veins, do forth-with break and
coagulate, and that the <hi>serum</hi> in the one as well as in
the other becomes a stiff gelly by a little standing.</p>
               <p>But of the different natures of the juices of these viens
in divers Plants and their motion we will remain your
debtor, and acquit our selves when we shall find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
at present; only acquainting you, what variety
of Experiments hath taught us, that probably more

               <head>A Letter dated May 21. 1673. in York, concerning the
unalterable Character of the Whiteness of the Chyle
within the Lacteal Veins; together with divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
observed in the Guts, especially several sorts of
Worms found in them.</head>
               <p>—I Come to your Letter, where the Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Veins in Plants and the Nerves in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
hinted by Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> is a considerable notion,
and I shall set my self a task e're long to examine them
both again on purpose, and to give you my thoughts.
In the mean time, I will entertain you, if you please,
with some Anatomical Observations and Experiments.</p>
               <p>It hath been long in my thoughts and desires to have
discovered the <hi>Actual passage</hi> of the Chyle into the <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teal
Veins;</hi> of which yet I never doubted, as I find some
do at this day. The difficulty lyes in the certain and
unalterable character of the Chyle's <hi>Whiteness,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when received into those Veins. And yet it is as
certain, that in a <hi>Diabetes</hi> the Urine retains all the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the liquor drunk. Also in that famous instance
of those that eat the fruit call'd the <hi>Prickle-pear</hi> (if I
remember aright,) their Urine hath affrighted the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the colour of bloud, that is, with the not-alter'd
colour of the Juice of the Fruit. In these instances at
least we cannot doubt but the Chyle, even in the <hi>Lacteal
Veins,</hi> was qualified according to the food and drink.</p>
               <p>To effect then something to this purpose, we have
formerly, and that very often, repeated the Experiment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56944:37"/>
of injecting highly tinged liquors into the Guts of a live
Animal. It would be too tedious and impertinent, to
write down the circumstances of many different tryals:
We will only in short tell you the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it and the success.</p>
               <p>We laced the skin of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of a dog loosly
for a hands breadth, and then opening it underneath the
stitches, we took out either the <hi>duodenum,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>tennia intestina.</hi> The Gut, took out, we
open'd with a very small orifice, and having ready the
tinged liquor luke-warm, we injected it upward and
downward: Carefully stitching up the gut, and then
drawing the Lace, we unloosed two of the Dogs feet,
laying him on his side for what time we thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
The tinged liquors we used, were good <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bado</hi>'s
Indigo, in fair water, and filtrated; also lumps
of Indigo thrust down his throat; good broath (as they
call it) of a blew fat; Indigo in Milk; Saffron in Milk.
Again, we tried in some Dogs fed before hand, and
injected the liquors in the very hight of the Chyle's
distribution; into others yet fasting, and that for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or shorter time.</p>
               <p>The Success was so constant, that we cannot say,
we ever did find the least discolouring of Chyle on the
other side the Guts, that is, within the Lacteous Veins,
but ever white and uniform. Whence we judge it not
very feasable to tinge the Venal Chyle in a well and
sound animal. And He that would demonstrate the
matter of fact to the Eye, must probably do it by giving
him some such thing in the food, as shall cause a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes,</hi>
or some distemper equivalent to it.</p>
               <p>Though we have observ'd many odd things in the
several Exercises of this nature; yet we shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you at present with any other particulars, than what
we have further observ'd in the <hi>Guts,</hi> to which we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56944:37"/>
shall confine our paper. Of these we shall proceed to
speak though possibly the the things may be better
known to you already.</p>

And first of the <hi>Lumbrici lati</hi> or <hi>Tape worm.</hi> Of these,
I say, we found in the guts of one Dog, perhaps more
than an hundred in all. The <hi>duodenum</hi> was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stuffed out and extended with them. Which also
well agrees with an other Observation I made in a

of these worms for <hi>kind,</hi> which were contained in
it: For <hi>kind,</hi> I say; for these <hi>Tape-worms</hi> were of a quite
different shape from those of the Dog, or any that I
have ever yet seen. To proceed, we found them also
in the Dog's <hi>Jejunum</hi> and <hi>Ileon;</hi> but not any one lower
than the <hi>Valv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a coli,</hi> nor any higher than the <hi>duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
or within the <hi>Pilorus.</hi> Below the <hi>duodenum</hi> they
lay at certain distances one from another, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by pairs or more of them twisted together. Near
them was constantly to be observed an Excrement of
their own, distinct, for colour (the observation being
made in a Dog plentifully fed for other purposes;) just
as we find in worm-eaten tracks of wood, where the

through their bodies: These worms lay mostly with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56944:38"/>
the small ends upward, as feeding upon and expecting
the Chyle in its descent. These <hi>lumbrici lati</hi> were none
of them above one foot long, and most of them of an
equal length and bigness. The one end was as broad
as my little finger-nail, and pointed like a <hi>lancet;</hi> the
other end, coming small gradually for the whole length
of the Animal, was <hi>knoted,</hi> or ended in a small button
like a pin-head. They were every-where and in all
parts of them alike milk white, of a flat and thin sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
like fine Tape, divided into infinite rings and
incisures; each incisure having <hi>sharp angles,</hi> on both
sides, <hi>looking</hi> to the broader end standing out beyond
each other: else the sharp corners of the <hi>annuli</hi> would
necessarily hinder the Ascent of the Animal; whereas,
if the contrary be true, they serve to keep it up. Each
ring hath also on the one side only, and that alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,
one small pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uberance, much like the midle feet
of the body of some Caterpillers.</p>
               <p>After I have thus described them to you, I desire
you to view the Cut of <hi>Tulpius</hi> in the last years Edition
of his <hi>Medic. Observat. l. 2. 42;</hi> where he retracts the
first <hi>figure,</hi> given us in the Edition of that book in the
year 1652. And yet I cannot say, that all in this last
is true; for, to me, the <hi>rictus</hi> and eye in the there
supposed head of the animal seem to be the meer fancies
of the painter; not to say, that probably the smaller
end is the head, which, indeed, is in this Cut wholly
neglected. Comparing our Animals with that Cut of
<hi>Tulpius,</hi> it was not very easy for me to observe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the great resemblance, the specifick difference
of the <hi>lumbrici lati</hi> of Men, and those of this Animal.</p>
               <p>I was not so happy as to discover any motion in any
part of them, in water or out of it, nor did they seem,
if pricked or otherwise hurt, much if at all) to contract
themselves or shorten the <hi>Annuli,</hi> so that they then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea'd
to me as things without motion or sense.</p>

There is an other sort of <hi>lumbrici lati</hi> to be met with
very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>requently also in Dogs, called <hi>Cucurbitini</hi> from
the likeness each <hi>annulus</hi> or link hath to a cucumber

more often broken into shorter pieces. The <hi>former</hi> by
us discribed is undoubtedly a compleat and entire Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;
but there is great reason of suspition, that <hi>this</hi>
is a <hi>chain</hi> of many Animals linked together. These Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
for Kind have been observed to have been voided
by Men, and found enclosed in a Gut or Membrane of
a prodigous length: And (which is more notable,) a
person of great integrity and worth, Mr, <hi>F. I.</hi> affirmed
to me, that he once assisted at the opening of a Dog,
in which one of the Kidneys was observed to be quite
wasted and become a perfect bladder, and in that blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they found something like an Animal of a monstrous
shape, which being dissected, was nothing else but a
skin full of these <hi>lumbrici cucurbitini.</hi>

               <p>And because these sort of Wormes are sometimes said
to be found out of the Guts, their most proper place,
we shall conclude with a very recent observation of
the last month in this City. A Chirurgion brought me
about 20 worms, which he had just then taken out of an
ulcerated Ankle of a Girle of about eight years old. I
had the curiosity to go my self and see it. I found the
leg found all but the Ankle, which was vastly swell'd,
and the Girle otherwise hearty and well coloured, She
had been in great misery for some months; had been
sent up to <hi>London,</hi> where she was touched and dressed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56944:39"/>
for the Evil. Sometimes after her return, her pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
a young Puppy was opened and applyed to the
Soars. The Chirurgeon, who took off the puppy, found
it, to his great admiration, full of worms, at least 60.
in number, what those he found in the body of the
Puppy, and what he drew out of the soar Ankle; into
which, he said, they crawled down as worms do into
the Ground. The same puppy was again applyed, and
it was then (at the second taking of the puppy) that I
made the visit, and saw only one worm got out into the
puppy, but a very live and stirring one. Many were
afterwards kill'd injections. These worms I affirm, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my best Knowledg, (and I had the opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of comparing them) were of the very <hi>Species</hi>
of the <hi>Lumbrici teretes,</hi> which Children familiarly void
from the Guts. They were betwixt three and four inches
long; all, about the matter, of an equal bigness, as of
one brood; something thicker than a Ducks quill; very
sharp at both ends; stiff, and exactly round; without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisures,
visible at least, and yet could move and twist
themselves readily enough. All the difference was in
the colour, these being much whiter than any I have seen
from the Guts. <hi>Vid. Barthol. in Hist. 60. Cent. 5.</hi> where

into the <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> though not by force, yet
by the consent and introduction of nature her self.
The successe of some late Experiments we made to this
purpose, we shall further acquaint you with.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Experiment,</hi> I caused a Dog to be fed, and after 4
hours, or therabouts (having ready by me a cleer Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Indigo dissolved in fair water filtred) I opned the
<hi>Abdomen,</hi> and making a small incision in the <hi>Jejunum,</hi>
(as was formerly discribed) I injected one ounce or two.
this done, the Gut and all we stitched up again, and the
Dog turned upon his leggs. After one hour and one
quarter we cut the stitches, where we beheld a copious
distribution of Chyle and turgid <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> but as
white as ever; And yet carefully searching the Guts,
we perceived none of the liquor injected any where.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Experiment,</hi> An other Dog which was kept fasting
40. houres, a very little flesh, without water, given him,
some 5 houres before the injection of the Tincture
of Indigo, which was done after the same manner, as
before related, only the Tincture was well warmed, and
some 12. ounces throughn up the <hi>duodenum,</hi> and down
the <hi>Ileon.</hi> Here were empty Guts, nor the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56944:40"/>
of any <hi>Lacteal Veins</hi> in the Mesenterie. After
full 3 hours the stiches were cut again (some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
businesse hindring me from doing of it sooner)
and carefully examining the Mesenterie, we found many
<hi>Lacteal Veins</hi> of an azure colour, and cutting some of
the biggest of them asunder we did plainly see a thick
blewish <hi>Chyle</hi> to issue forth, and to spread it self over the
transparant Membrane of the Mesenterie. This is a very
truth, which the Chirurgion, I imployed to assist me in
the Experiment can well witnesse, and whose eyes I
used as well as my own in carefully examining these
matters. whence, although it hath been doubted of by
some, yet it is most evident, that the <hi>Lacteal Veins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
what they carry, from within the Cavitie
of the Intestines.</p>
                  <p>As to the bunches of <hi>Glandulae</hi> within the Guts, I
have observed them in several kinds of Animals at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, and do therefore think them natural and
not adventitious or morbous, as some were pleased to
object. These <hi>Glandulae</hi> protuberate, and are thereby
visible in any part of the small Guts, where they are
to be found. In the <hi>duodenum</hi> of a Dog, I have seen
many clusters of them, some as broad as my nail, and
all disposed in an oval figure, like the half of a <hi>Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi>
or <hi>Mulberry.</hi> They are very visible in the Guts
of <hi>Mice,</hi> where each grain seems much larger than in
a Dog. Again the part, where these <hi>Glandulae</hi> are,
seems more thin than the rest of the Gut, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Gut slit, and held betwixt the light of your
eye these grains are very conspicuous. Further these
<hi>Glandulae</hi> (like the rest of the Conglomerate kind) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
themselves into the Guts, which is manifest by the
comparison of them, and therefore serve for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of some Saliva-like juices, but whether they may
not also introduce the Chyle, I will not determine here.</p>

                     <p>I did not think of explaning my sense of the use of the
<hi>Caecum</hi> until I had had the Leisure and opportunty
of purposely examining the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>testines</hi> of most kind of
Animals. But because I am much mistaken by the
person, who, as you tell me, is desirous to be <hi>anonimous</hi>
to me, him I mean who raised the scruples you sent me,
upon the Second Paragraph, which says, the use of the
<hi>Intestinum Caecum</hi> to be subservient to that of the <hi>Colon,</hi>
and <hi>Rectum;</hi> manifest in such Animals where Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
a certain, and determinate Figure to the Excrements.
I shall be forced to tell you, what I presume may
prove, as neer the truth, as any one of the many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
extant in Authors, about the unknown use of
this part. I understand by determinate figure. <hi>First,</hi> the
Excrements divided into many small parts of a like
shape, such as Sheep, Deer, Conies, Rats, Mice, Horses
Catterpillers, Some Snailes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doe void. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a
greater Latitude, I oppose figured Excrements to Liquid,
as <hi>C. Celsus</hi> in some place doth; Thus the dung of
Pigeons, and Geese, of Men, Dogs, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be
said to be figured. Now the <hi>Caecum,</hi> in my opinion, is
subservient in some measure to the figuration of both, but
most manifestly in the first kind. My meaning is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the use of the <hi>Caecum</hi> is to keep the Excrements,
that passe into its cavitie (and I believe all, or most part
of them do in sound Animals) so long, until they are
sufficiently drained, baked, hardned, or of a due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
(as clay is temperd for the mould) to receive the
Figure to be given from the <hi>Colon</hi> and <hi>rectum.</hi> This
use I say of the <hi>Caecum,</hi> seems to me to be much more
manifest in such Animals, as have figured Excrements
of the first kind. In Ratts for example, (whose Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56944:41"/>
are the most elegantly and constantly a like figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
of any Sanguineous Animal I have met with) the
<hi>Caecum</hi> is more large, and capacious, than the stomack
it self, and perhaps than all the small guts put toga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But its use in receiving the Excrements or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
Chyle, is not more apparent, from its large
capacity; than that other of further draining and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
them to a stiffnesse, for the service of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
from the admirable contrivance, and structure, of
this latter Gut, which is a <hi>Phaenomon</hi> that deserves
further consideration: it is I say to be noted, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
under the Value of that Gut, in this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
are certain Spiral Fibres, which make a kind of
screw. Now it seems to me, that the Excrements,
after they are brought to a due Consistence by the
<hi>Necessarie stay</hi> they make in the <hi>Caecum,</hi> and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out thence into the Spiral folding, or screw of
the <hi>Colon,</hi> cannot descend in a perpendicular, as formerly
through the small Guts, but still gently glide very lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surly
by the vinding of the screw; whence arises
their Figure.</p>
                     <p>And I am apt to believe, that if the <hi>Caecum</hi> of a <hi>Ratt,</hi>
or any of the first kind of Animals mentioned, was tyed
up, or otherwise hindred from its receit, the Animals
would unavoidably fall into a <hi>Diarrhaea:</hi> there being, I
say, no reason, that I can foresee, why the yet liquid
Excrements or exhausted Chyle, such as we constantly
find it, even at the very bottom of the small Gut, should
slop at the entrance of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and not speedly glide
through the screw, in a down right descent, that is,
elude the devise of nature, and make the configuration
of that so curiously contrived part uselesse, we I say
supposing the Experiment to have taken away the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
<hi>Diverticulum</hi> and repositarie of the unprepared
Excrements, in tying up the <hi>Caecum.</hi>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56944:41"/>
I know not, whether the observation will hold good
in general Terms, because I say, I have not yet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posily
examined divers Animals in nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the more accurately figured the Excrements of any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
are, the more capacious is the <hi>Caecum,</hi> and on the
contrary the lesse figured and liquid they are, the lesser
the <hi>Caecum,</hi> or none at all. This is true certainly that
some Animals, which are naturally loose have no <hi>Caecum</hi>
at all or very little, as the <hi>Talpa,</hi> the <hi>Echinus terrestris</hi> the
<hi>Gulo,</hi> a certian kind of voracious Woolfe, mentioned
by <hi>Bartholine</hi> in his Observations.</p>
                     <p>We shall not trouble you at present with our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
concerning the different Figure of Excrements
in the divers Species of Animals already by us examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor of the place and of their becoming so figured.
Also we shall passe by our thought for the present of
the manner of the <hi>Caecums</hi> reception and preparing
the Excrements.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Colon,</hi> we likewise sorbear to offer some
doubts we have, concerning natures end, in the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
Figuration of Excrements in some Animals, as
first to prevent <hi>Diarrhaeàs;</hi> Secondly to abide hunger
the better; thus Snails in Winter rest with full Intes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines;
Thirdly to heighten the firmentation and diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the stomack and small guts.</p>
                     <p>What we have hastly writ at present, being only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the better uuderstanding of that Paragraph,
and not all that this subject would incite me to say.</p>
                     <p>If it shall be objected, that grant the reception of the
exhausted Chyle to be made in the <hi>Caecum,</hi> before it
passe into the <hi>Colon:</hi> yet it seems that either we must
give a power of <hi>choice</hi> to the <hi>Caecum,</hi> or what just comes
in, will first be thrown out, it still being uppermost,
that is, the lesse prepared excrement. I answer, that
I do not conceive, what <hi>choiee</hi> or distinction Sheep, can
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56944:42"/>
make of the meat not ruminated, in the stomack, from
that, which is but just now ruminated, and swallowed
down, since all the many stomacks of a sheep are but
one stomack and but one Gula, that is, in that respect
of ruminating the stomack and <hi>Gula</hi> of a Sheep or Cow,
is an other <hi>Caecum;</hi> and yet in ruminating nature has its
aime, and chews not things oftner over, than needs must;
the like we think of the office of the <hi>Caecum,</hi> which
parts only with what is duly prepared, and retains the
yet liquid Excerment.</p>

Some probable thoughts of the whitenesse of Chyle; and

N. B. I am not altogether of the same Opinion Now; yet,
they were my thoughts than.</head>
                  <p>1. IN digestion of meat in the stomack, there is made
a Separation or solution of Urinous salts; no ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herwise,
than in the <hi>rotting</hi> of Animals, or Plants.</p>
                  <p>2. The Chyle is hughly impregnate with this Urin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Salts.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Whitenesse</hi> of the Chyle is from the Ferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entation
it hath from its mixture with Urinous salts;
and that if desolv'd with fair water, it is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of that colour, the firmentation ceasing.</p>
                  <p>4. The Salt Chyle is conveyed into the Venal blood,
and with it enters the heart; and it is thence thrown
out, Chyle as it comes in by a continued pulsation
into the Artery.</p>
                  <p>5. That as oft as it enters the emulgent Arteries,
it there leaves behind it part of its salinous liquour
or Urine, and consequently abates of its colour.</p>
                  <p>6. That when sufficiently freed of its Urinous salt,
it becomes a <hi>Lympha;</hi> which we think nothing else, but the
residue of the Chyle, not yes made into the nature
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56944:42"/>
of blood, as not sufficiently depurate of its Saline
Particles.</p>
                  <p>7. That probably it circulates long under the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>Lympha;</hi> after visiting all the parts of the body
by the Arteries, and returning again to the Hart, partly
by its own vessells, and partly by the veins.</p>

extravasation and coagulation.</p>
                  <p>11. In the Coagulation of extravasate blood there is
no praecipitation of parts, as in curdled Milk <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
if the Chyle be freshly distributed into the Masse of
blood, it will again separate it self, as Oyl will from
water; and in like manner is it with the <hi>Lympha</hi> or old
Chyle, neither of them being as any essential part of
the blood.</p>
                  <p>12. The Venal and Arterial blood have probably both
a like quantity of <hi>Lympha</hi> to dilute them; but the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in Coagulating involves within its Crassamentum
more than the Venal: the reason may be, for that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
is fuller of air, which rarifies and renders the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Crassamentum more porous and capacious, of lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <head>An Account of two uncommon Mineral Substances, viz.
of Bitumen, and a White Liquor. January 7. 1674.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THat this Letter may be the more acceptable to
you, I shall communicate some <hi>Excerpta,</hi> taken
out of the Letters, which that Inqusitive and Learn'd
Gentleman Mr. <hi>Jessop</hi> is pleased to honour me with.
I will give, (saith he) the best answer I can in short to
the Questions, you put to me in your last.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Fungus subterraneous,</hi> I sent you a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of, was gotten in a Rocky Lime-stone ground, on
a Common about two miles distant from <hi>Castleton</hi> in
the Peake of Darby-shire, 15 or 16 yards deep, in the
<hi>Old man</hi> (as they call a Mine formerly wrought and
stopt up) covered with earth, that had either fallen or
was thorwn in. There is no coal-bed that is knowu
of within five or six miles of the place.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Fungus,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Jessops</hi> procurement, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a good quantity; and yet I am not able to
say, in what form it grows. It does not seem to me
to have any constant shape; at least the pieces that
I receiv'd are much like Pears or Turff, cut up in the
high moosr, bothe in the sooty colour and inward
substance; this ouly is more clammy and tough, and
dries not. And some of the fungous substance is very soft
and like gel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. In and about the more solid pieces, (of
which I have some, half a soot square,) are many big
lumps of a <hi>bituminous</hi> substance. This <hi>bitumen</hi> is very
inflammable like Rosin; it is very light, it breaks firm,
and shines like good Aloes; and for colour, it is not much
unlike it, save that it is more dark color'd and purplish;
yet there is much of it of a dark green colour. We di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd
a parcel of it, which yielded us an Acidulous lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56944:43"/>
water; then, a white liquor, which was, I guess,
from some of the Oily parts precipitate. And in the last
place, a copious yellow Oyl, not unlike that of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum</hi>
or Pitch. In the neck of the Retort we could
discern no Volatil Salt, as in the like process upon Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Whether this ows its Original to a Vegetable,
or is truly a concret Mineral Juyce and a fossil Bitumen
I forbear to determine. I have not read of any such
fungous Earth, in which <hi>bitumen</hi> naturally grows and
adheres: And the finding of it in an Old mine doth much
favour the first opinion of being a Vegetable substance;
<hi>either</hi> the very substance of the props of Wood, they
make use of in lining and supporting the Grooves, thus
alter'd, <hi>or</hi> certain <hi>fungus</hi>'s growing out of them. That
Birch, (of which there is great plenty and hath been vast
woods all these mountanous parts of <hi>England</hi> over) will
yeild a <hi>bitumen,</hi> as limpid as the sap is which runs from
it by tapping, if we now had the skill to extract it, <hi>Pliny</hi>
is very express, <hi>l. 16. c. 18. Bitumen ex Betula Galli ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quunt.</hi>
And more-over it is certain, that much of
that wood, if not all, which is dugg up in the high moors
of <hi>Craven,</hi> and which the people there call and use for
<hi>Candle-wood,</hi> is no other than <hi>Birch,</hi> as it appears from
the grain and bark; and yet this wood kindleth flames,
and exudats a rosin, which makes many pronounce it
very <hi>Firr-wood.</hi> Whatever this <hi>bitumen</hi> is, which this
<hi>Fungus subterraneous</hi> yeilds, it much differs from the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Shopps; and you may command a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi>
of it, that it may be better examin'd by more
skilful Naturalists.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There is an other Mineral Juyce in these parts of</hi>
England, <hi>which I have much inquir'd after, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see; and now I am likely to be satisfied, as you
may think by Mr.</hi> Jessops <hi>words:</hi> Captain Wain, <hi>(saith
he)</hi> a diligent and knowing person in Mines, gave me a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56944:44"/>
White Liquor, resembling Cream both in colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
which he found in great quantities at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of a Coal-pit, 49 yards deep, which I reserve for you.
<hi>But this is not all the information that hath been given
me about this White Liquor. Mr.</hi> George Plaxton, <hi>a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and very intelligent person, writes thus to me
from</hi> Sheriff Hales <hi>in Shropshire:</hi> I shall trouble you
with an Observation, I lately met with in our Iron-mines,
especially that which the Country people here call the <hi>White
Mine,</hi> which yeilds the best Iron-stone. The Miners do
commonly, upon the breaking of a Stone, meet with a
great quantity of a whitish milky Liquor, inclosed in the
Center of it; they sometimes find a Hogshead contain, d
in one cavity. 'Tis in taste sweetish; only it hath a Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolick
and Iron-like twang with it.</p>

               <head>A Description of certain Stones, figured like Plants,
York Novemb. 4th. 1673.</head>
               <p>IN this paper I send you an Account of some of the
Parts of certain <hi>Stones</hi> figured like Plants; which
<hi>Argicola (5 Fossilium)</hi> calls <hi>Trochitae,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
ones <hi>Entrochi;</hi> we in English, St. <hi>Cutberds beads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agricola</hi> will have them akin for substance to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides
Judaici;</hi> and, indeed, these are of an opaque and
dark coloured Sparr; though I have of them from some
parts of <hi>England</hi> of a <hi>white Sparr</hi> or <hi>Cawke,</hi> as our Miners
call it: They all break like Flint, polished and shining.</p>
               <p>Put into Vinegar <hi>(saith he)</hi> they buble: <hi>Atque etiam
reperitur interdum qui se tanquam</hi> Astroites <hi>moveat de
loco.</hi> But this is true of all Fossils of what figrue so
ever, that Vinegar will corrode and dissolve as a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum;</hi>
provided they be broken into indifferent small
grains, and the bottom of the Vessel hinder not, they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56944:44"/>
will be moved from place to place by it.</p>
               <p>The figure of the <hi>Trochitae</hi> is cylindrical; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
round or Circle (we speak of one single joynt,
which <hi>Agricola</hi> calls <hi>Trochites)</hi> is in general smooth,
both the flat-sides are thick drawn with fine and smal
rayes, from a certain hole in the middle to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
From the shooting of these rayes like Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
and because a large Peice of this Stone of many
joynts resembles the bole of a Tree, <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> (who
yet elsewhere discourses of this Stone, after <hi>Agricola</hi>
and <hi>Gesner,</hi> under the name of <hi>Trochitae</hi> and <hi>Entrochi)</hi>
not improperly terms it <hi>(Musae: Metallici lib. 1. pag. 188.)
Stelechites Stibii facie;</hi> and there gives us a true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igure
of it. Two, three, or more of these <hi>Trochitae</hi> joyned
together, make up that other Stone, which he calls <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trochos.</hi>
The <hi>Trochite</hi> or single joynts are so together,
that the Rayes of the one enter into the other Furrows,
as in the Sutures of the skill. Hitherto we agree to what
<hi>Agricola, Gesner, Boetius, Aldrovandus, and Wormius</hi> have
said of them: We proceed upon our own Observations,
which go much further.</p>
               <p>The Places where we find them very plentifully, are
certain Scarrs in <hi>Braughton</hi> and <hi>Stock,</hi> little Villages in
<hi>Craven.</hi> The Stones of the abovesaid described Figure,
as many as have yet come to my hands from those places,
have afforded us these Particulars. As to their <hi>bigness,</hi>
I never yet met with any much above two inches about;
others there are as small as the smallest pinn, and of all
magnitudes betwixt those proportions. These are all
<hi>broken bodies;</hi> some shorter Pieces, some longer, and of
them, indeed, <hi>Trochitae,</hi> that is, but single joynts. I
never fonnd one intire piece much above two inches
long, and that very rarely too; in some of which long
pieces, I have reckned about 30 joynts. And as they
are all broken bodies, so are they found <hi>dejected</hi> and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56944:45"/>
lying confusedly in the Rock, which in some places,
is soft and <hi>shelly</hi> (as they call it,) that is, rotten
and perished with the wet and air. And though in
some places they are but sprinkled here and there in
the Rock, yet there are whole <hi>bedds</hi> of Rock of vast
extent, which are made up of these, and other figur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Stones, as <hi>Bivalve, Serpentine, Turbinate,</hi> &amp;c. as at
<hi>Braughton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the injuries they have received in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
from the natural <hi>posture,</hi> if not place of their
growth and formation, they are manifest. For, besides
their being all broken bodies, we find many of them
depressed and crushed, as if the joynt of a hollow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Cae should be trod under foot: These Crushes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also real Cracks of a stone or glass. Again these
stones consisting of many <hi>vertebrae</hi> or joynts, they are
many of them strangely dislocated; sometimes two,
three, or more of the joynts in a Piece are slipped and
out of order or rank, and sometimes a whole <hi>series</hi> of
joynts, as when a pack of Crown pieces leans obliquely
upon a Table. Futher, others I have that are twisted
like a Cord, if this possibly may be reckoned amongst
the injuries. Lastly, some have their joynts, indeed,
even and in file, but are yet stuffed with a forrain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as when bricks are layed in motrer.</p>
               <p>There is great variety as to the thickness of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitae</hi>
or single joynts: some are so thin, that they are
scarce the full of the 24<hi>th.</hi> part of an inch; others are
a full quarter of an inch thick; of these latter I only
found at <hi>Stock:</hi> These, I say, are the extream propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as far as my Observations have yet gone; there
are joynts of all measures betwixt those two Extreams.
This is true in divers Pieces, for mostly the joynts are
of an equal thickness in one and the same Piece. Note,
that there are slender and small <hi>Entrochi</hi> or Pieces,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56944:45"/>
which have as thick joynts, as the biggest and fairest
Pieces.</p>
               <p>There is also some difference in the seames or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the joynts: Some are but seemingly joynted;
which appears by this, that if they be eaten down a
while in distilled vineger, the seeming Suturs will vanish,
as in some I had out of <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> from about <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resford</hi>
upon the <hi>Dove:</hi> Others and all here at <hi>Braugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Stock</hi> are really joynted, and the Sutures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented;
which indentures being from the terminating
of the rayes, they are more fair or large, according to
the differenc of the rayes, but even, equal, and regular.</p>
               <p>We have said, that generally the outmost Circle of
each joynt is flat and smooth; yet are there many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
differences to be noted as to that Part: Very por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
because they are Parts or Pieces of different
<hi>Species</hi> of <hi>rock-Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That the smooth-joynted (to say no more of them
here) are of different thicknesses as to the joynts.</p>
               <p>2. On some <hi>Entrochi</hi> betwixt, Suture and Suture in
the middle of each joynt, are certain Knots in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
the joynts thus distinguished are very deep and
large, and are very frequent at <hi>Stock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There are likewise of these with a circle of knots,
which have many knots besides upon each joynt and
look rugged.</p>
               <p>4. Some with much thinner joynts, which yet have
a Circle of knots in the middle of joynt; and this also
looks as though it was all over knotted, and these are
found at <hi>Braughton</hi> only, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>5. As some have but one Circle of knots, others,
are knotted all over the joynt and rought; so are there
some others, which have a Circle of larger knots in
the middle of each joynt, and a circle of lesser on each
side close adjoyning to the border or verge of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56944:46"/>
Suture. This is huge pretty, and they are found at
<hi>Stock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Others betwixt Suture and Suture in the middle
of each joynt rise with a circular edge.</p>
               <p>7. A smooth <hi>Entrochos</hi> with a large or much risen
edg on the middle of one of the joynts, and a much
smaller on the middle of an other joynt and that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lernatively.</p>
               <p>8. The same alternate difference, the joynts only
much rounder and blunt, and here the joynts are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
one thicker than the other.</p>
               <p>9. The same with alternate edges knotted.</p>
               <p>10. A double edg in the middle of every joynt; this
makes the joynts look as though they were exceeding
thin and numerous, but indeed they are not so.</p>
               <p>11. A double edg in the middle of every joynt
knotted by intervals, or as it were serrate edges.</p>
               <p>And these are some of the differences, that I have at
present been able to make out. Some of the Pieces of
most, if not all, of the differences of these <hi>Entrochi</hi> are
ramous, having lesser branches deduced from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that without order. Some have but few branches
on a Piece; others I find so thick of branches, that
they resemble a ragged Staff. These <hi>Branches</hi> are deep
inserted within the stemm, and by being separated, leave
great holes in the sides of it. The rayes in the joynts
of the branches run cross to the rayes of the stemm. On
thick stemms, are somtimes very small branches, but
mostly the bigger the Stem the thicker the branches.
Some of these branches are branched again: Yet I find
not any of them above one inch intire, and yet adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inserted into its stock o bole, and for the most
part not above a joynt or two. The Branches are known
from the stemm, by being a little crooked and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tapering or Conic.</p>
               <p>We meet but with few Pieces (besides the branches)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56944:46"/>
that are not exactly Cylindrical, setting aside the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
above mentioned, that is, that are not as thick at
one end as at the other, and perfectly round, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that we said, that there are of them of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of magnitude within the proportions above-named.</p>
               <p>And, as we said, it is rare to meet with a Piece, that
is not exactly cylindrical; so amongst those few that are
not so, some we find tapering at both Ends, and much
swelled in the middle. And this is the other <hi>Species</hi> of
this Stone, according to the division of <hi>Agricola: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trochi
duae sunt Species; aut enim aequaliter teres est;
aut teres quidem, sed par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ejus media tumet, utrumque
caput angustius est.</hi> But this must not be understood, as
though both ends were compleat; for these, are but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Pieces, as the rest, more swelled in the middle.</p>
               <p>Others there are figured like a kind of Fruit, or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
Judaicus;</hi> but these also are truly <hi>Entrochi,</hi> and are
joynted notwithstanding this shape. Upon a small Stalk
of two or three joynts is suddainly raised an Oval bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
broken off also at both ends.</p>
               <p>To these we shall add what seems to have been <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitates</hi>
or <hi>fastigia;</hi> long and slender Pieces with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
jointed buttom, hollow on the very top; which top
seems not to have been divided or broken off from any
thing else.</p>
               <p>I must not forget, that as they are hollow in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
(and so it was easy to string them like <hi>beads,</hi> which
gave occasion to the <hi>English</hi> name;) so these hollows
are someetimes filled with earth, and sometimes an
other <hi>Entrochos</hi> is inclosed like a pair of screws, and
which is (as it were) pith to the other. Of these inward
<hi>Entrochi</hi> some I have which are transparent. <hi>Note,</hi> that
the hollows or piths are of different bores, but most are
round. And yet there are of them in great plenty at
<hi>Stock,</hi> whose hollow in the middle is in the elegant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of a <hi>Cinquefoil;</hi> and the rayes of the joynts of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56944:47"/>
                  <hi>Entrochi</hi> are much deeper and fewer in number, than
of any other yet observed by me. These are smooth-joynted.
This is most surprising, and I know not any
Vegetable, whose Pith is perforate in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Lastly we in these Rocks find <hi>rude Stones,</hi> of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Walnuts, which have many impressions of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitae</hi>
upon them, as though they had been the roots
of them. And when these have been a little cleansed
in Vinegar, these impressions appear more than casual;
for, the substance that covers them (if not the Stones
themselves) is Sparr, and the impressions are round
holes, which, we said above, the Branches made in the
sides of the stock, when broken out from them. <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi>
makes mention of these also: <hi>Saepenumero</hi> lapis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis
<hi>reperitur unà cum Trochite &amp; Entrocho, Rotae in
se continens figuram; quae in eo quasi quaedam</hi> radix, <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitis
jam abruptis, remansit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although there are indeed certain <hi>lapides informes,</hi>
which may with some colour be thought to have been
the Roots, from whence some <hi>Entrochi</hi> have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
yet are not all such lumps of Stone, on which we
discern the <hi>Vestigia</hi> of <hi>Entrochi</hi> to be called <hi>lapides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes,</hi>
some of them being most elegantly figured. One
or two of them, which I found intire and compleat at
<hi>Stock,</hi> amongst very many others strangely shattered and
defaced, I shall describe to you.</p>
               <p>1. The first is in the fashion of a Pine Apple or Cone,
with a hollow bottom: On the very Top is the round
figure of an <hi>Entrochos</hi> broken off; round about the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
or <hi>basis</hi> are five single feet at equal distances, in the
figure of Crescents. This Stone is <hi>incrustate</hi> or made
up of angular Plates; <hi>viz.</hi> the bottom is composed of
five plates, which we call Feet; the middle of the Stone
of five other plates, all of a Sexangular figure; and the
Top Stone. All other plates are smooth on the outside.</p>
               <p>2. The sccond is a large Stone of the bigness of a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56944:47"/>
Walnut, much after the pyramidal fashion of the other;
the bottom convex, about one inch and a quarter over;
on the top is the lively impression of an <hi>Entrochos</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

all broken of somewhat in the figure of Crescents. This
Stone also is incrustate or covered with Sex-angular
plates, which are rough. I can compare the inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustating
of these stones to nothing so well, as to the skins of
the <hi>Piscis Tringularis,</hi> which <hi>Margravius</hi> describes: <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
Cutis (nam caret squamis) figuris Trigonis, tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonis,

               </p>
               <p>Of these figured plates I find so great variety in the
Rocks, both as to the number of Angles and other beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ornaments, that it has caused in me great admiration.
And it will not be amiss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since they manifestly belong,
as parts, to the above described stones, to enumerate
them, at least, as many as have yet come to my hands.
Some of these <hi>angular plates,</hi> I said, are yet visible in
their natural place and posture in the described stones:
But I find the greatest part of them broken up and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in great confusion in the Rocks. And it
will be as hard to set them together, as to skill to tell
you, what the figure of an intire <hi>Entrochos</hi> (or the stone
to which all the above described parts seem to belong)
is: But we will omit no part, that we can justly say
belongs unto it. We shall begin with <hi>Pentagonous</hi>
plates.</p>
               <p>1. The first is a <hi>Pentagonous</hi> Stone, as broad as my
thumb-nail (we speak of the fairest of them,) hollow on
the one side, like a Dish; convex on the other side,
where are certain eminent knots, about the bigness of
small pinn-heads, set iu a kind of square order: This
plate is somewhat thinn at the edges and yet blunt.</p>
               <p>2. The second is also <hi>Pentagonous,</hi> and not much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56944:48"/>
than the other: It is, indeed, somewhat convex
above, but not hollow underneath; it is smooth on both
sides, at least without those eminent knots, which are
so remarkable in the other plate: The edges of these are
as thinn as of a knife, and sharp.</p>
               <p>3. The third <hi>Pentagonous</hi> Plate is not near so broad,
as either of the former; yet one I found amongst a 100
of this sort, that is full as any of the above described:
These are all convex on the one side and somewhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
on the other; thick edged; one of the 5 sides only
is indented; the indented side is ever the thinnest, and
the stone is most sloped towards that side. <hi>Note,</hi> that
there are many amongst these last indented sorts of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
which are channelled on the concave side and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
notched.</p>
               <p>4. All these <hi>Pentagonous</hi> plates are to be found plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
at <hi>Braughton</hi> or <hi>Stock.</hi> But I shall not omit in
this place the mentioning of one, I by chance espied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
certain figured Stons, which I had out of the
Quarrie near <hi>Wansford</hi>-bridg in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and
it probably belongs to these kind of plates I am now in
hand with. It has one of the five sides thick indented;
the convex part has in the middle a raised <hi>Vmbo,</hi> like
some antient shields, and round about the sides list of
smaller Studds. We have since had some plates much
like this from <hi>Bugthorp</hi> under the Woolds in <hi>York-shire.</hi>
We proceed to remarke some differences in the <hi>sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular</hi>
plates.</p>
               <p>5. All these stones are but small, save here and there
one: The first of them is but little hollow on the one
side, and convex-side most elegantly wrought with rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or embossed work, that is, with an equilateral tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
bestriding each Corner, and a single right line in
the midst; or, if you will, two Triangles one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
These we found at <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raughton-fear</hi> only.</p>
               <p>6. That Plate-stone which is most common in these
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56944:48"/>
Rocks, there being a 1000 of these to be found for one
of the other, is <hi>sexangular,</hi> a little hollow on the one
side and convex side or scabrous only; some are much
thicker than others; some being as thick as broad, but
most are Plate-like; the sides are very unequal, as in
Crystals; sometimes five broader sides and one very
small; again two sides broad and four much narrower,
and infinite other differences as to the inequality of Sides.</p>
               <p>Words are but the arbitrary symboles of things, and
perhaps I have not used them to the best advantage.
Good Design (and such is that I send you, done by that
ingenious young Gentleman and excellent Artist, my
very good friend, Mr. <hi>William Lodge.)</hi> or the things
themselves, which I have all by me, would make these
particulars much more intelligible and plain to you.</p>

               <p>I Herewith send you the <hi>first</hi> part of our <hi>Tables</hi> of
<hi>Snails,</hi> and some <hi>Quaere's</hi> upon that subject, I reserve
by me the <hi>Sea-shells</hi> and <hi>Rock-stones.</hi> That part, I
send you at present, being at a stand with me, these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
increase upon my hands daily; which though <hi>that</hi>
be not a sign of perfection (for there is undoubted work
for many ages,) yet it is of good advancement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress;
<hi>this</hi> other of the copiousness of the subject. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
in that part of the Tables, you have from me,
Authors are very little concern'd; in the others of <hi>Sea-shells</hi>
and <hi>Stone-like Shells</hi> there are many authors, which
are to be consulted and taken in, if possibly we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them treating of the same species. As for <hi>Rcok-shells</hi>
in particular, they come in to me in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
than I could ever have imagined. And I can assure
you, that of near 30 <hi>Species,</hi> I have now by me, found
in this County alone, not any one can be sampled by any
<hi>Sea, Fresh-water</hi> or <hi>Land</hi>-Snail, that I have, or ever saw.
So that you see, I have still good reason to doubt of
their Original, besides many other arguments that my
Observations about <hi>Fossils</hi> do afford, and which you
may possibly one day see. And that there are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
representations of even <hi>Bivalve-shells,</hi> which never
ow'd their original to any Animal, I can demonstrate;
and think none, that hath considered the thing with me,
yet hath denyed: Of which hereafter. But whether

            <div type="questions">
               <head>Some general Quaere's concerning Land and
Fresh-water Snails.</head>
               <p>1. Whether there are other Shell-snails at land, than
Turbinate;</p>
               <p>2. Whether this kind of Insect are truly <hi>Androgyna,</hi>
and equally participate of both Sexes, as Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> first
obseru'd; and whether both them two, which shall be
found in the act of Venery, do accordingly <hi>spawn,</hi> or
lay those perfectly round and clear Eggs so frequently
to be met with in the surface of the Earth and in the
Water too; and the circumstances of those Eggs
hatching?</p>
               <p>3. Whether the way of fatting Snails, in use amongst
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that is, to make little paved places incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
with water, be not also very expedient in order to
the true noting the manner of their Generation?</p>
               <p>4. What light the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of this Kind of Insect may
give to the rest?</p>
               <p>5. Whether the black spots, observable in the horns
of some Snails, are Eyes, as some Authors affirm, and
not rather parts equivalent to the <hi>antennae</hi> of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect;
as the flat and exceeding thin shape, also the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
horns, in other Species of Snails seem to confirm?</p>
               <p>6. Whether the <hi>coccinea Snails,</hi> which some of our
Water-snails freely and plentifully yield, be not a <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
rather than an <hi>extravasated blood:</hi> The like may be
thought of the Juyce of the <hi>Purple-fish,</hi> now out of use,
since the great plenty of <hi>Cochineil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. In what sort of Snails are the <hi>Stones,</hi> mentioned
by the Antients, to be found? And whether they are
not to be found (in such as yield them) at certain times
of the year? And whether they are a cure for a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
or what other real vertues they have?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:56944:50"/>
8. What medicinal vertues Snails may have, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative
to Hectic persons; and what credit the <hi>Romans</hi>
may deserve, counting them, especially the necks of
them, highly venereal; <hi>Celsus</hi> also particularly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to be <hi>boni succi,</hi> and <hi>stomacho aptas.</hi>
               </p>

                  <head>I. Of the Efforescence of certain Mineral Glebes.</head>
                  <p>I keep by me certain big pieces of crude Allom-Mine,
such as it was taken out of the Rock. I had also in
the same Cabinet like peices of the ordinary Fire-stone
or Marcasite of the Coal-pits, which here we call <hi>Brass
lumps.</hi> In process of time both these Glebes shot forth
<hi>Tufts</hi> of long and slender fibres or threads; some of
them half an inch long, bended and <hi>curled like hairs.</hi>
In both these Glebes, these Tufts were in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
transparnt and crystalline. These Tufts did as often
repullulate, as they were struck and wiped clean off.</p>
                  <p>Herein these fibres differ'd in tast; the All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very Allomy and pleasantly pungent; the Vitriolick
stiptique and odious. Again, the Allom-ones, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssolv'd
in fair water, raised a small ebullition; whereas
the Vitriolick fibres dissolved quietly. The Allom-fibres
were generally smaller, and more opaque, snow-like;
the Vitriolick larger, many fibres equalling an horse-hair
in thickness, and more crystalline.</p>
                  <p>The water, wherein the Allom-fibres were dissolv'd
did give no red Tincture with Gall; not by all the means
I could devise to assist them; whatever hath (and that
with great confidence) been said to the contrary, by
some of the Writers of our <hi>York-shire</hi> Spaws: The Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolick
did immediately give a purple tincture with Gall.</p>
                  <p>Having laid pieces of the same Marcasite in a Cellar,
they were in a few moneths cover'd over with <hi>green
Copperas,</hi> which was these Fibres shot and perhapps <hi>again

                  <p>I have not observ'd any Rock or sort of stone, whether
Metalline or more Vulgar, which hath not its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
sort of <hi>Sparr,</hi> shot in some part or other of its bed
or seams. And these Sparrs differ not only in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and other accidents, but eminently too in their
Figure. To pass by divers, which I have collected, I shall
describe one of a very curious Figure, and which (though
very common in our blew-Lime-stone Rocks, out of
which plently of Lead-Ore is got,) yet is not, that I
know of, mention'd by any Author.</p>
                  <p>These Crystals are mostly of a black water, like the
black flint in Chawk-hills; but there are of them, which
have a purplish or amethystine colour; and there are
as clear as crystal. They adhere to the seams of the
rock, be it betwixt bed and bed, or where-ever there
are cross and oblique veins through the very substance
of the bed.</p>
                  <p>The smaller the veins, the less the <hi>Iris.</hi> You will
find of them as small as wheat-corns, and others an
hundred times bigger. They shoot from both sides the
the seam, and mutually receive one the other.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56944:52"/>
They are figured thus, <hi>viz.</hi> a column consists of three
quin-angular plains, very little rais'd in the middle:
these plains too are very unequal. Let them hug one
another, or be any ways straightned and compressed
in their shooting; yet the number of plains meution'd,
both of the column and top, is most certain. The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

a little swelled in the middle, and narrower towards

Vegetable Rosin.</head>
                  <p>It so hapned, that having occasion in <hi>July</hi> to view
certain Fossils, which I had dispos'd of into divers Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in a Cabinet made of <hi>Barmoudos Cedar,</hi> I observ'd
many of the stones to be thick-cover'd over with a liquid
Rosin like Venice Turpentine. Examining further, there
was not a Drawer, wherein there was not some more
some fewer stones thus drenched.</p>
                  <p>That this could be no mistake, as from dropping,
the bottoms of the Drawers are of Oak. Again, many
stones, which were lapped up in papers, were yet wholly
infected and cover'd with this Rosin. Besides, after
diligent search there appear'd no manner of exudation
in any part of the Cabinet.</p>
                  <p>Two thing, I thoughts very remarkable: 1. That of
the many sorts of Stones I therein had, divers escaped,
but not any of the <hi>Haematites</hi>-kind; having therein
<hi>Manganes, Scistos, Botryides,</hi> &amp;c. which were all deeply
concern'd. 2. That amongst perhaps 500 pieces, of the
<hi>Astroites</hi> here and there one or two in an appartment,
and sometimes more, were seised, and the rest dry;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56944:53"/>
as it fares with people in the time of the Plague in one
and the same house. I further observed, that stones
of a soft and open grain, as well as those of a hard and
polish't <hi>supeficies,</hi> were concern'd in a manner alike.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, that the whole body of the Turpentine
of the Cedar-wood was carried forth into the Air, and
floating therein was again condensed into its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
form upon these stones.</p>
                  <p>This makes it more than probable, that Odoriserous
bodies emit and spend their very substante. Thus <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir</hi>
is said, if not well secured, totally to fly away.
Again, it is hence evident, that there is great difference
betwixt the <hi>Distillation</hi> of Vegetable Juyces, and the
<hi>Emission</hi> of Effluviums or this <hi>natural</hi> Distillation; <hi>that</hi>
really separating and dividing the substance into diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

the opinion, that they are Plants of their owu kind,

B. The texture of the Gills is like a paper prickt full
of pin-holes. In <hi>August</hi> this is very frequent under hedges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in the middle of the Moors in many places of this
Country. It seems to me (and, no doubt, it will to
any person that shall well examine it, (that the Gills of
this Mushrom, are the very slower and seeds of this Plant.
When it is ripe, the Gills here are easily seperated from
the rest of the head: Eech seed is distinct from other,
and hath its impression in the head of the Mushrom,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56944:53"/>
just as the seeds of an Artichoak hath in the bottom
of it. The bigger end of the seed is full and round; and
they are disposed in a spiral order just as those of the
Artichoak. The like we do think of all other Mushroms,
however differently figured.</p>
                  <p>And if it shall happen to him that shall sow them,
that these will not produce their kind, but be steril;
it is no strange thing amongst Plants, there being whole
genus's of Plants that come up, and flower, and seed,
and yet their seed was never known to produce Plants
of their kind, being naturally steril, and a volatil dust,
as all the <hi>Orchides</hi> or <hi>Bee-flowers.</hi>

                  <p>We shall not here omit to tell you futher concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Mushrom, that, when fresh gather'd, it is of a
buff-colour inside outside; and yet, cut through the
middle, it will in a moment change from a pale-yellow
to a deep purple or blew, and stain linnen accordingly.
A drop of the juyce, leisurely squeezed out, will change,
holding it betwixt your eye and the light, through all
the colours of the Rainbow, in the time of its falling,
and fix in a purple, as it doth in the springing out of
its veins.</p>

                  <head>VII. Of the speedy Vitrifying of the whole body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
by Cawk.</head>
                  <p>The several vitrifications of <hi>Antimony</hi> are either
opaque or transparent. To the first kind I shall add one,
which is in it self very curious, and hath these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
above the rest, that it is done with great ease and
speed; and by it I have performed some things upon
Minerals and Mettals, which with crude Antimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
I could not effect.</p>
                  <p>Take of Antimony one pound; flux it clear: Have
an ounce or two of the Cawk-stone (by and by to be
discribed) in a lump red-hot in readiness. Put it into
the Crucible to the Antimony; contiune the flux a
few minutes; Cast it into a clean and not greased Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56944:54"/>
decanting the melted liquor from the Cawk.</p>
                  <p>This Process gives us above 15 ounces of <hi>vitrum</hi> of
<hi>Antimony,</hi> like polish't Steel, and as bright as the most
refined Quicksilver. The Cawk seems not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish't
in its weight, but rather increased; nor will be
brought incorporate with the Antimony, though flux't
in a strong blast.</p>
                  <p>This Cawk-stone is a very odd Mineral, and I always
looked upon it to be much a kin to the white milky
Mineral juyces, I formerly sent you a <hi>specimen</hi> of: And
this Experiment is demonstrative, that I was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
for, the milky juyce of the Lead-Mines vitrifies
the whole body of Antimony in like manner.</p>
                  <p>That this Vitrification is from the <hi>proper</hi> nature of
Cawk, I little doubt; for, I could never light upon
any one Mineral substance, which had any such effect
upon Antimony; and I have tryed very many <hi>Lapis
Calaminars,</hi> Stone-Sulphur; or <hi>Sulphur vivum, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctites,
Sulphur Marcasite, Allom-glebe,</hi> divers <hi>Sparrs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Cawk is a ponderous white stone, found in the Lead-Mines;
it will draw a white line like Chawk or the
<hi>Galactites:</hi> And though it be so free yet it is more
firm, and hath a smooth and shining grain, Sparr-like,
yet not at all transparent. Of the Spirit, it yields by

what I have observ'd of the <hi>Astroites;</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56944:54"/>
which are stones also jointed like the other, but not found,
that I know of, in the same Rocks. And we must cross
the plain Country, and seek for them hard under the
<hi>York-shire</hi> Woolds: For, what store I could porcure of
them, were brought me from <hi>Bugthorp</hi> and <hi>Leppington.</hi>
At the fromer place, my self have seen them dugg out
of a certain <hi>blew clay</hi> on the banks a of smal rivulet,
betwixt the Town and the Woolds. There are plenty
of them washed into the brook; but the most fair and
solid are those we get out of the Clay.</p>
               <p>I pretend not, to discover to you their Original, no
more than I did of the <hi>Entrochi;</hi> but having used some
diligence in causing the places, where they are found,
to be a little more searched than is usual, I was by that
means furnish't with a good quantity of them; which
gave me the opportunity to make the following Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
What light may be hence had, I leave to more
judicious persons, acknowledging my self at persent not
to be able to demonstrate (if they are not Stones of
their own kind,) what they have been before petrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>It is very little and inconsiderable, what any Author,

               <p>The Matter and substance of these Stones, if broken, is
flint-like of a dark shining politure; but much softer,
and easily corroded by an acid <hi>Menstrum.</hi> † (a) Vinegar
indeed, makes them creep; but a stronger spirit, as of

Lime.</p>
               <p>These Stones (as we now find them) are all <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
as we have noted of the <hi>Entrochi:</hi> Either one
single joint, or 2, 3, or more joints set together, making
a pentagonous Cylindrical figure or five-sided column.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56944:55"/>
And I have not yet had any piece much above one inch
long, which consisted of 18 joints; but I have seen one
piece, somewhat shorter than the former, which had 25
joints. These last thin-jointed pieces are quite of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
make, as to all circumstances, from the other, as
will appear.</p>
               <p>Every joint consists of 5 Angles, which are <hi>either</hi>
drawn out and sharp, and consquently the sides of these
pieces, made up of such joints, are deep-channeled;
(and this is the condition of some of the thick-jointed
pieces, as well as of all the thin-jointed ones;) <hi>or</hi> the
Angles are blunt and round, and the sides plain or very
little hollowed. There are as big, and as smal pieces
of this sort, as of any other more sharp-angled; and
therefore I account them a 3d. species of <hi>Star-stones.</hi>
And of this sort was, I guess, that piece which <hi>Wormius</hi>
describes; which therefore, he saith, is more like the
blown Flower of <hi>Pentaphyllum,</hi> than a <hi>Star.</hi> Besides,
the manner of the engraving of the joints in every one
of the 3 respective species is also very different, as will
be declared.</p>
               <p>Where the joints are thin or deep, they are <hi>so</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
throughout the whole piece; yet there are some,
but very few, exceptions to this also, of pieces which
consist of joints of the unequal thickness. Many of thick-jointed
pieces have certain joints a thought broader, or
a very litle standing out at the Angles, and thereby
the joints are distinguish't into certain Conjugations of
2, 3, or more joints: And these Conjugations are very
observable in the thin-jointed stones, and are marked out
with a sett of Wyers; of which by and by.</p>
               <p>The thickest piece, which hath yet come to my hands,
is not above one inch and a half about, and those very
rare too: From which size to that of a smal pin, I have
all the intermediat proportions; and these so exceeding
smal pieces are as exactly shaped, as the greatest. Most
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56944:55"/>
peices, if not all, of any considerable length, are not
straight, but visibly bent and inclining. All the pieces
of any sort are much of an equal thickness, or but litle
tapering; yet one of the ends, by reason of a Top-joint,
is visibly the thickest.</p>
               <p>This Top joint hath 5 blunt Angles, and is not hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or engraven, or but very faintly, on the outside. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
joint else of a piece (save the top joint) is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglia,</hi>
and deedly engraven on both sides alike; and
will accordingly serve for a Seal. The middle of each
angle is hollow, and the edges of the angles are thick
furowed: The terminations of these hatchings are the
indented futures, by which the joints are set together;
the ridges of one joint being alternately let into the
furrows of the other next it. The Hatchings of the flat-sided
pieces are in circular lines; but of the other two
species, they are straight lines, or near the matter.</p>
               <p>In the very center of the 5 angles is a smal hole, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
in most joints. Note also, that in the middle
of each joint, betwixt angle and angle; in very future,
is another such like smal pin-hole very apparent, if the
stones be first well scoured.</p>
               <p>Besides all the former particulars, there may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
in the deep-jointed pieces, just under the top-joint,
above discribed, the <hi>Vestigia</hi> of certain Wyers
rather than branches; and sometimes 2, 3, or more of
the joints of the Wyers yet adhering. These Wyers
are ever <hi>five</hi> in number, viz. one in the middle or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
part betwixt angle and angle. Again in <hi>thin</hi>-joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pieces there are ever <hi>five</hi> of these Wyers, or a <hi>sett</hi>
of them inserted into every conjugation of joints; so that
it were some representation of the thing, to imagine
the stalk of <hi>Asperula</hi> or <hi>Equisetum.</hi> Also I have seen,
but that very rarely, (not in one peice amongst 500,)
a sett of Wyers in the middle of a <hi>deep</hi>-jointed piece.
One thin-jointed piece I have by me, where a Wyer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56944:56"/>
of 20 joints and upwards (and how much longer they
may be, I know not,) lyes double within the hollow side,
and by that accident was preserved in its natural place.
Further, some lumps of Quarry I have from the same
place above-nam'd, where the Wyers as well as the
Stones themselves are seen in long pieces. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that these Wyers are knocked off, and but very
rarely found adhering to the Stones they belong to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very small and slender, of a round figure and smooth-jointed,
being sett together <hi>per harmoniam</hi> and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
future. Nothing that I can think of, is so like
these Wyers, as the <hi>antennae</hi> of Lobsters. Lastly, some
of these Wyers are knotted, and others of them farely
subdivided or branched.</p>
               <p>I have, by the assistance of Mr. <hi>Lodge,</hi> illustrated all
these particulars with <hi>Figures:</hi> Of which this is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</p>
               <p>1. The Top-joint of an <hi>Astroites,</hi> figur'd on both
sides; on the one it is deep engraven, on the other the
hatches are scarce visible. Also the ends of the 5 An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
are very blunt.</p>
               <p>2. A second or sharp-angled joint with fair hatchings
on both sides.</p>
               <p>3. A piece with very narrow and sharp angles. Also
the Top-joint designed, as it naturally appears smooth
and without hatchings.</p>
               <p>4. A round-angled joint.</p>
               <p>5. A flat-sided piece; where the hatchings are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Circular.</p>
               <p>6. A thin-jointed piece: Where note also, that the
angles are much narrower, and of a protracted Oval
figure.</p>
               <p>7. The biggest piece I have yet seen. Note also its
bending.</p>
               <p>8. The smallest piece I have yet met with.</p>
               <p>9. The longest piece; where every 4th joint is a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56944:56"/>
thought bigger or more prominent than the rest; as in
the 7th fig. also is well designed.</p>
               <p>10. A large and round-angled or flat-sided piece; to
which belongs that single joint noted fig. 4.</p>
               <p>11. A flat or not hollow-sided piece; of which sort
also is the 5th figure: The 10th and 4th not much
differing.</p>
               <p>12. A thin-jointed piece; where the conjugations
are marked out by the <hi>vestigia</hi> of the several sets of
Wyers or branches.</p>
               <p>13. A piece where the joints are un-equal in thickness.</p>
               <p>14. A piece with some part of the Wyers yet adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their natural order at the biggest end of the piece.</p>
               <p>15. A thin-jointed; where note on the left side a
single Wyer accidentally preserved in its natural place,
though snapt asunder.</p>
               <p>16. A thick-jointed piece with a set of Wyrs in the
middle of it.</p>
               <p>17. A good long piece of a Wyer, and a single joint
thereof.</p>

only in the relation they may have to the advancement
of Natural Philosophy and Arts.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Roman Vrnes</hi> are found in very many places
throughout the whole Kingdom; but the different work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of these Vessels, their composition, and places
where they made them, have been little that I know
of taken notice of by any. I have observed what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of these matters:</p>
               <p>Here then are found at <hi>York,</hi> in the road or <hi>Roman-street</hi>
without <hi>Mickle-gate;</hi> and likewise by the River
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56944:57"/>
side, where the Brick Kilns now are, Urnes of three
different tempers, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Of a bluish grey colour, having a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of course Sand wrought in with the Clay.</p>
               <p>2. Others of the same colour, having either a very
fine sand mixt with it full of <hi>Mica,</hi> or Catsilver, or made
of clay naturally sandy.</p>
               <p>3. Red Urnes of fine Clay, with little or no Sand
in it. These Pots are quite throughout of a Red colour
like fine Bole. Also many of these red pots are elegantly
adorned with Figures in Basso Relievo, and usually the
Workmans name, which I think others have mistaken
<hi>[Burtons C. Ant. It. p. 183, 230.]</hi> for the persons
name buried therein, upon the bottom or cover; as
<hi>Januarius</hi> and such like; but that very name I have seen
upon several red Pots, found both here and at <hi>Aldbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>
After all, these are glazed inside and outside
with a kind of Varnish of a bright Coral colour.</p>
               <p>The composition of the first sort of Pots, did first give
me occasion to discover the places where they were
made: The one about the midway betwixt <hi>Wilber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sosse</hi>
and <hi>Barnbie</hi> on the <hi>More,</hi> Six miles from <hi>York</hi> in the
Sand-Hills, or rising grounds, where now the Warren
is. The other <hi>Roman</hi> Pottery on the Sand-Hills at <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
not far off <hi>Brigg</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> In the first place
I have found widely up and down broken pieces of
Urnes, Slagg, and Cinders. At the latter place there
are yet remaining, (though it is a moveable Sand, and
burried every way by the Wind, and has by that means
covered the places all over) some of the very Furnaces;
whose ruins I take to be some of those <hi>metae</hi> or sandy
Hillocks. Besides here are many pieces of Pots and
Urnes of different shapes, and much Slagg and Cinders;
This Potterie having taken up much Ground, as to one
that shall diligently view the place, it will appear. 'Tis
remarkable, that both the above mentioned Potteries
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56944:58"/>
are within less than a mile of the <hi>Roman Road,</hi> or <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary-high-way.</hi>
Nothing is remembred in either of those
places, of any Pottery that was known in those parts,
nor indeed could I learn where any good clay for that
purpose was to be had near those Sands: which yet
our modern Potteries chiefly seek after, which has made
them to be forgotten and disused; The materials of
our modern Pots being much altered, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Urns above discribed differ in these
particulars, from what Pots are now usually made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us. (1) That they are without all manner of
glazing with lead, which perhaps is a Modern inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
(2.) That a far greater quantity of Sand is used
than clay, which thing alone made it worth their while,
to bring their clay to the <hi>Sand-Hills.</hi> (3) That they
were baked either with more leisure after long and
through drying, or immoderate contact of the Flames:
which I am induced to believe, because there seem to
be fragments of such things to be found. 'Tis certain
the natural colour of the Clay is not altered by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So that both the degrees of heat and manner of
burning might be different. And one of these Potsherds
as I have tried, baked over again in our Ovens, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
red. As to the two last kind of Urns, its likely the
first of them with their particles of <hi>Mica</hi> in it, were
made of a sandy blue Clay, of which nature there is
good plenty among the Western Mountains of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and particularly at <hi>Carleton</hi> in <hi>Oatley</hi> Parish not
far off <hi>Ickley</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> station. The red Urns seem to
have been their Master-piece, wherein they shewed the
greatest Art, and seemed to glory most, and to eternize
their names on them. I have seen great varieties of
Embossed work on them. And lastly for the elegant
manner of glazing, it is far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eater indeed, and more dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than our modern way of Leading, which is apt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56944:58"/>
to crack and crase, both with wet and heat: and at the
fire is certainly unwholsome, by reason of the fumes Lead
usually emits, being a quick vaporable Metal. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
glazing seems to have been done by the Brush, or
dipping; for both inside as well as outside of the Urn
are glazed, and that before the Baking. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Materials of it seems to be remembred by
<hi>Pliny Lib. 36.</hi> C. 19. <hi>Fictilia ex bitumine Inscripta
non delentur.</hi> The Painting of Pots with bitumen is
indelible. And again, <hi>Tingi solidas exbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

glazing.</p>
               <p>The great plenty of these Urns found in many parts
of <hi>England</hi> seems to argue them also of <hi>English</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
but where I cannot guess, unless wrought at
the Bole Mines (of which Clay alone they seem to be
made) in <hi>Cleveland;</hi> for that that barren tract of Land,
called <hi>Blackmoor,</hi> was well known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
Jet Rings taken up withthese <hi>Vrns</hi> doth sufficiently
testifie. Now Bole and Jet are no where that I know
of to be found with us in <hi>England</hi> but in that Tract;
beings Fossils peculiar to those Mountains. Of these
Jet Rings some are plain, and others wrought, but all
of them of an extraordinary bigness, being at least three
Inches diameter, and yet the inward bore is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an inch and an half, which makes them too little
for the Wrists of any Man, as they are much too big
for the Fingers, so that probably they were never
worn either as <hi>Armilla</hi> or <hi>Anuli.</hi> One of each sort I
have by me, which I carefully redeemed of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
besides many others which were broken, found
about a sort of Urns in <hi>York</hi> fields. And since we are
upon the subject of Plasticks, or the <hi>Roman</hi> Clay-work,
we cannot but take notice of the opinion of <hi>Cambden;</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56944:59"/>
Who will have the Obelisks at <hi>Burrow-Briggs</hi> in this
County Artificial, when in truth they are nothing less,
being made of a course Rag, or Milstone-grit; but
without doubt, the bigness of the Stone surprized him,
either not thinking them portable, or perhaps not any
<hi>English</hi> rock, fit to yield natural Stones of that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But <hi>Roman</hi> Monuments I suppose none doubt them,
because pitched here by a very remarkable and known
<hi>Roman</hi> station, <hi>Isurium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then consider what trifles these are, compared
with the least obelisks at <hi>Rome.</hi> And as to the Rocks
whence they might be hewn, there are many of that
Stone near the River <hi>Nid,</hi> and upou the Forest of
<hi>Rnasborough;</hi> and a little above <hi>Ickly,</hi> (another <hi>Roman</hi>
station) within sixteen miles of <hi>Burrow-Briggs</hi> there is
one solid Bed of this very Stone, whose perpendicular
depth only will yield obelisks, at least thirty foot long.
And yet at <hi>Rudstone</hi> near <hi>Burlington</hi> in the <hi>York-shire</hi>
Woolds, full forty miles wide of these Quarries, is an
obelisk of the very same Stone, shape and magnitude
of these before mentioned. But we cannot let this
pass without noting, That almost all the Monuments
of the <hi>Romans</hi> with us were of this sort of Stone; As
the ancinet walls of this City, as appears by what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the ancient Gates, and the great quantities of
it that is wrought up in most of the Churches, and is
still daily dug out of Foundations: But a most undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
instance is, a vast <hi>Roman</hi> head, perhaps of some of
the Emperors, upon a neck or square to pedestal of one
solid Stone, with the point of the square to the eye, of as
course a grit as that of the Obelisks above mentioned.
This Stone is now in Mr. <hi>Hilliards</hi> Garden, and was
dugg out of the Foundations of some Houses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
The only remaining Inscription that I could
find at <hi>Burrow-briggs,</hi> yet imperfect as well as odde, is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56944:59"/>
upon this sort of Stone in the Street Wall of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
Tankards</hi> House.
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Also two <hi>Roman</hi> Alters I have seen of this Stone;
one the original of that at <hi>Ickley</hi> mentioned in <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
Another in the possession of that ingenious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
Mr. <hi>Thirsby</hi> late of <hi>Leeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I think sufficient to disprove that mistake
of <hi>Cambden,</hi> That the Stones at <hi>Burrow-briggs</hi> are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.
There is but one only instance that I ever yet
met with of the <hi>Romans</hi> ever having used in these parts
of <hi>England</hi> any other sort of Stone; yet is it not the
common lime stone, but a certain Stone had from the
Quarries about <hi>Malton,</hi> because of the <hi>Lapides Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daici,</hi>
by me formerly described to be seen in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it. It is small but elegant Alter with Figures
in <hi>Basso Relievo,</hi> of Sacrificing instruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
has suffered an unlucky accident by the stupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Masons, who were ordered by the late
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56944:60"/>
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to place it upon a Pedestal in the Court
of his House at <hi>YORK.</hi> Yet the Inscription which they
had miserably defaced, was by chance preserved.

by Vomit; Phi: Coll. Num. 6.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Send you (here inclosed) the true and exact shape
of a Worm, which a man Vomited up here the
last week. I found it my self in the Blood, which
came up with it, having caused it to be washt for
the more careful examination of it, much of the Blood,
being clods of a kind of skinny and fleshy substance,
<hi>Haud alitèr, quàm in Mulierum molis excernendis acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
solet.</hi> Of this kind of Blood there was about two
pound weight saved in the washing, and this odd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
amongst it; which was easily discovered by me,
being of a <hi>dark green</hi> colour like a Horse-Leech, and
spotted not unlike some of them. I could perceive
(when I fouud it) no life or motion it had; the Girle
that washed the Blood having almost beaten off a Finn,
and part of one of the forks of the Tail; and burst the
belly of it; yet it was curiously and regularly shaped
in all its members, as is fully exprest by the pains of a
most excellent Artist, who Limmed it by the thing it
self, not two hours after I had it under my eye, that
nothing might be added, but what was very true and
natural. The Spirit of Wine in which I put it, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
changed it as to its colour: but yet it still
remains perfect enough to satisfie any curious person.</p>
               <p>This honest man, a Baker, imagined he drank it the
last Summer in pond water; of which he was used to
drink after sore labour in his calling. This is certain,
he had about his Stomach and right side a most exquisite
and tormenting pain, for at least four Months last past;
which many times threw him into horrours and chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ague-like; and indeed when he vomited this up,
he was the sickest-man I ever saw not to dye: He also
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56944:61"/>
voided Blood by Stool several dayes also, and now I
do believe, he will recover, although his pains are not
wholly ceased.</p>
               <p>To say what this Creature is, I dare scarce venture.
You know how long I have made it my diversion to
search into the nature of <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ects,</hi> and it is no small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
I have made therein, yet I am at a loss where to
place this Animal; for that it is not like any thing I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet saw in Nature: However it makes me give more
credit than I did to several stories of a like nature which
we frequently meet with in <hi>Medical History,</hi> and those
recorded as very truths by sober, learned and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons. But though I now believe there was much
truth in most of them, yet I fear little care was taken
to describe exactly the Animals, otherwise than by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
either in respect of the words or painting, which
has gone a great way in rendring all such stories use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>This Animal was about four inches long, and in the
thickest place three Inches about; it had three Finns
of a side, all near the head, and the upper pair most
exactly and elegantly figured, as is described; all these
Finns were thick and fleshy: but the forked Tail was
finny and transparent, and to be extended; it was placed
<hi>horizontally,</hi> not as that of most, (if not all) small Fish,
and even Neuts and Tadpoles or Froggs in disguise, in
which particular it differs from them all, as well as in
the fleshiness of the Finns.</p>
               <p>Besides this odd Animal I found the <hi>head of another</hi>
of a different shape, as is exprest; but of a dark green
colour also as the other: the body of it had not been
lost, or this other so ill treated, if I had expected to
have found, what we never looked for.</p>
               <p>But what shall we say this Monster was? give me
leave to speak my mind without prejudice, and with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56944:61"/>
submission to the better Sentiments of the Honourable
and Learned Society: I am apt to think (and I believe
few will deny it me) that we often drink and eat what
is alive; and it is certain some things will live on in
our Stomacks in despight of concoction; not to instance
in the many sorts of Gut-worms natural to us, and which
are bred with us, perhaps in some Children even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are born; these Worms I say, do freely wander
up and down the Guts and Stomach at pleasure, and
receive no prejudice from the concoctive faculty of
them: And for this reason we see <hi>Insectivorous</hi> Birds
so solicitous to kill Worms and all other sorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
by drawing them again and again through their
Bills as Canes through a Sugar-Mill, that they may
be verliy dead before they swallowed them, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
is the great wisdom of undebauched nature:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
admirable instances there are of Animals living
within Animals; of which in the Insect kind, the Royal
Society shall ere long receive some notes of mine upon
<hi>Godartius.</hi> And yet I am of the mind that what was
accidentally swallowed by us alive, and that shall have
the power to live on within us, (especially if it shall
be young and tender, and yet growing) may have its
designed form and shape monstrously perverted, so as
to appear to us quite another thing than naturally and
really it is; and this I take to be the case of this odd
Creature, the present subject of our Discourse: and so this
might have been the Spawn or Embryo of a Toad or
Neut.</p>
               <p>But we must also account for the much fleshy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or shinny lumps of Blood vomited up with it,
which I think easily intelligible thus; That that Spawn
or <hi>Embryo</hi> of a Toad or Neut might well venome the
Stomach or Gut, in which part soever or wrinkle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it chanced first to rest or stick, and cause an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56944:62"/>
there, and so have it self swelled aud closed up

               <head>An Account of a Roman Monument found in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of Durham, and of some Roman Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at York, Phil. Tran. N. 145.</head>
               <p>I Have with much trouble got into my hands a Piece
of <hi>Roman Antiquity,</hi> which was but a very few
years ago discovered upon the South Bank of the
River <hi>Tine,</hi> near the <hi>Sheilds</hi> in <hi>Bishoprick.</hi> It is a very
large and fair <hi>Roman Alter</hi> of one entire Stone. But
after all my cost and pains, I am sorry to find the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
very ill defaced, that much of it is not legible.
And I believe it hath been mis-handled by those who
endeavoured to read it; whereas if the remainder of
the Letters had been exactly measured, and the face
blackt and lightly washt off again, as in Prints, some
things more might have been spelled.</p>
               <p>As to the nature of the Stone it self, it is of a course
<hi>Rag,</hi> the same of that with that of the <hi>Pyramids</hi> at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Briggs.</hi>
It is 4 foot high, and was ascended to by
steps, which appeareth, in that all the sides, but the Front,
have two square holes neare the bottome, which let-in
the Irons that joyn'd it to the Steps.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56944:62"/>
I have carefully described it in all it's sides, and have
given the Plane of the Top also; which if you please
we will survey in order.</p>
               <p>1. The Back-side, opposite to the Inscription; on
which is Ingraven in Basse-reliefe, a <hi>Flower pot</hi> furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I suppose with what pleased the Stone-cutter, for
these men need not to be more curious than the Priests
themselves, who were wont to make use of the Herbs
next hand to adorne the Alters. and therefore <hi>Verbenae</hi>
is put for any kind of Herb. Yet if we will have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
any thing with us, I think it is most like, if not
truly <hi>Nymphaea,</hi> a known and common River Plant.</p>
               <p>2. One of the sides, which is somewhat narrower than
the Front or Back: On this are Engraved in Bass-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the <hi>Cutting-knife (cesespita)</hi> and the <hi>Ax (securis).</hi>
The Knife is exactly the same with that on the other
Alter formerly by me mentioned in the Philosophical
Collections of Mr. <hi>Hook;</hi> but the <hi>Ax</hi> is different; for
here it is headed with a long and crooked point, and
there the head of the <hi>Ax</hi> is divided into 3 points.</p>
               <p>3. The other side; on which are engraved after the
same manner an <hi>Eure (Vrceolus)</hi> and a <hi>Ladle,</hi> which
serve for a <hi>Sympullum.</hi> This I call rather a <hi>Ladle,</hi> than
a <hi>Mallet,</hi> it being perfectly Dish-wise and hollow in the
middle, altho <hi>Camden</hi> is of an other opinion in that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<hi>Sculpt</hi> of the <hi>Cumberland</hi> Alter, And the very
same Utensil I have seen and noted on the <hi>Ickley</hi> Altar,
which is yet extant at <hi>Middleton Grange</hi> near that
Town; but the Stone which <hi>Cambden</hi> saies supports a
pair of Stairs there (as at this day it does in the very
Road) is but an ill Copy of it, and not the Original.</p>
               <p>4. The Plane of the Top; which is cut in the Figure
of a <hi>Bason (discus</hi> or <hi>lanx,)</hi> with <hi>ansae</hi> on each side, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a pair of links of a chain, which rest upon,
and fall over two Rowles; And this was the <hi>Harth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56944:63"/>
5. The Front; which hath an Inscription of nine
lines in Roman Letters, each Letter a very little more
than two inches deep of our measure; now remaining
as in the prefixt Sculpture, <hi>Fig. 5.</hi> which I would read
thus, <hi>Dis deabus<expan>

               <p>The <hi>Deae Matres</hi> are well interpretted by <hi>Selden.</hi> It
is much his Safety and Return both vowed, should be
so seperated in the Inscription; but I have not <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er</hi>
by me to compare this with the like. <hi>Caracalla</hi> say the
Historians<note n="*" place="margin">Xiphilinus Herodianus &amp;c.</note> after his Fathers death at <hi>York,</hi> took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the Command of the Army alone, and the whole
Empire; he went alone against the Enemie, who were
the <hi>Caledonij</hi> inhabiting beyond the Wall, which his
Father had built, he made Peace with them, received
their Hostages, slighted their fortified places, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And this seems to be confirmed by the Inscription;
for undoubtedly upon this his last Expedition of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
without his Brother <hi>Geta</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> was this Altar
erected to him alone, at a place about Two Stations on this
side the Wall. So that the Vow might be as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of his Return from this expedition, as for his Safetie
and return to <hi>Rome;</hi> which mi-thinks should be true, or
his Mother and Brother <hi>Geta</hi> would scarce have been left
out, at least so early. For yet the Army declared for them
both, according to their Fathers Will.</p>
               <p>Further, it seems also to have been erected by those
who flatter'd him, and who were afterwards killed by
him; and for this reason the persons Names, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
it, seem to me to be purposely defaced, the 6
and 7th Lines of the Inscription being designedly cut
away by the hollowness of them, and there not being
the least sign of any Letter remaining, and this I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
might be part of their disgrace, as it was usual to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56944:63"/>
deface and break the Statutes and Monuments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
executed, of which this Monster made strange
havoc.</p>
               <p>But since worn Inscriptions admit of various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
because some Letters are worn out, and some more
legible, whereby not prejudiced people may conceive
them diversly, I will therefore tell you an other read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of part of the two first lines, which I do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow,
but that it will agree well enough with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Severus,</hi> tho his <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> or solemn deifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was not performed till he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the
manner of which Funeral Pomp <hi>Herodian</hi> is very large;
it was of that excellent Antiquarie Dr. <hi>Johnson</hi> of
<hi>Pomfret</hi>

               <p>The rest as follows in mine,</p>
               <p>Which shews the hight of Flattery of those times. So
that they paid their Vowes to the lately dead Father
the Conservator of <hi>Britain,</hi> for the safety of the Son;
and the Story tells us how gladly he would have had
him made a God long before, even with his own hand.</p>
               <p>I think it not amiss, if I give you the rest of my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
concerning these matters, which I have met
with in this City.</p>
               <p>1. A large <hi>Pedestal</hi> of the same sort of Stone, found
deep in the ground, on the West side of the River,
which by the Stone, and its mouldings, was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<hi>Roman,</hi> and must have been for a Pillar in some
large building.</p>
               <p>2. A Broken Inscription in the Church-wall in <hi>All-Saints</hi>
North-street, with the Figure of a Naked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Bass-relieve on the left side of it. The Letters
(as many of them as remain) are exceeding fairly cut,
beyond any thing I have yet seen of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56944:64"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> and the Stone of a finer grain than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
It is a Monument of <hi>Conjugal Affection.</hi>

               <head>2. A Relation of a Man biten with a mad Dog,
and dying of the disease called Hydrophobia:
Philosophical Trausactions. N. 147.</head>
               <p>I Have formerly entertained the R. S. with odd
cases in Phisick; as the Stone cut from under the
Tongue of a Man; of <hi>Lumbrici teretes</hi> found in the
Ancle of a Child; of a monsterous Worm vomited,
&amp;c. And I therefore think by the kind acceptance of
those, this I am about to relate of a man bit with a mad
Dog, and dying of the disease called <hi>Hydraphobia,</hi> will
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56944:64"/>
be wellcome. It is by Gods providence that it is a rare
case, for <hi>Gallen</hi> calls it <hi>omnium morborum pessimus:</hi>
And since it is in that great Physitians opinion the worst
of diseases, it is an extraordinary blessing to mankind
that it happens so rarely; especially if we consider how
infinitly fond we are of so poisonous a Creature, and
what vast numbrs we keep out of meer wantonness and
pleasure more then any real use or service they can do
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James Corton,</hi> a very strong and well built youg man,
was bit with a mad Dog in the right hand, the wound
heal'd of it self, and the thing was forgotten by himself
and wife; but as he said (after the disease of <hi>Aquae pauor</hi>
had seiz'd him, and that it was given him by me as a
reason of his not drinking) he told his wife he wondred
why the Dog, which used to be so familiar mith him,
should then bite him. But this was all forgot; And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
about five or six weeks he complains of Pain all over
his bones, but especially his back and round about his
Stomack, looks very pale, hollow eyed, &amp;c. The third
day after this complaint, <hi>viz,</hi> Sunday in the evening
<hi>March</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 1682, he called for burnt brandy, drank it,
went to bed, and vomited it up; after this he had a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
night, and in the morning found himself very ill,
with a strange rising in his Stomack, and though no thirst,
yet an impotence to drink, and even to swallow his <hi>Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
which was death to him as he often said. <hi>Diascor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
and a bottle of <hi>Cordial water</hi> was brought to him
by an Apothecary that morning, The <hi>Diascordium</hi> he
took, but was not able to drink of the <hi>Cordial</hi> one Spoou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
This on Munday morning; about one a Clock
that day I first saw him, and found him upon this Bed,
his Pulse very slow, and sometimes unequal, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
frighted from the rising of his Stomack; his flesh cold,
his tongue not dry, but flexable and moist, a little white.
I caused him to rise off the bed, and set him full in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56944:65"/>
light; and then because he mightily complained of I
know not what sickness about his stomack, I offered him
of the <hi>Cordial,</hi> but he started, and trembled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
of it. This I exceedingly admired, whereof I
called for a glass of Wine or Water, and a Tumbler of
water was brovght me up, which I gave him to drink;
but he vehemently startled at it, and his Stomack swell'd
and rise, after I knew not what odd and strange manner;
and I could then find his Pulse very trembling and
disturbed. I still urged him to drink; But as I put it
forwards to his mouth, he the more affrighted drew back
his head, and sighed, and eyed it with a most gashly look,
not without Screeking and Noise. This I most mightily
admired, and was at a great loss what should be the cause
of this strange Symtom, when at length it providentially
came into my minde, that this was <hi>Aquae pavor;</hi> and then
I tryed him again and again to drink; and found him
more disordered at the sight, especially at the drink.
Wherefore I ask't his mother in Law and the Maid, who
stood about him, where the wound was he last had had;
at which question they seemed concerned, and replyed,
they wondred what I meant. I then told them he had
been bitten by a Dog; It is true (he said all in a fright,)
I was bit by such a Neighbour's Dog, about five or six
weeks ago, here in my hand, but it has been long well.
I then bid him lye down, and so left him, calling his
Wife and Mother and Friends to me below Stares,
and telling them that he would certainly dye, that there
was but small hopes of his recovery, it being too late;
that none should be suffered to go to him but keepers,
some strong man or two, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I forthwith ordred a Vein to be opened in the arm
which was bit, caused the wound to be scarified and
drawn with <hi>Vesicatories,</hi> and the same Plaister to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
unto the neck and leggs and the inside of the arms;
I ordered the usual and famed <hi>antidotes</hi> to be given him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56944:65"/>
as of <hi>Theriaca, Cinis cancorum, Ruta, Agaricus,</hi> &amp;c. In
Bolus's. For it is to be noted, that solid things in a Spoon
he could take, but yet not without much trembling, and
fear, and Caution, and an earnest request that no body
would suddenly offer them to him, but give them into
his hand gently; and then he would by degrees steal
his hand softly towards his mouth, and of a suddain chop
the Spoon in and swallow what was in it, <hi>velut canis ad
offam;</hi> and this he did more greedily and readily then
any other man could do. Of these antidotes in Bolus
he took a Dram every hour, and alwayes in this manner,
for at least a dozen times taking; and every like drink
was profferred him in the night, but he could not see it
without horrour, and the same motions from his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.
Nay he did affirm that as oft as he by chance
swallowed any Spittle it went to his heart, even as tho he
should dy that very Moment. This night passed wholy
without any sleep or rest.</p>
               <p>Tuesday morning I viewed his blood, which was both
to the <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Cake</hi> well coloured, and in such propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as is usual in healthful persons, and of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
               <p>He had now a violent Feavour upon him, and a very
quick Pulse. Water was offered him by my order, but
in vaine; He begging he might dye unmolested, nothing
being such a terror to him as the approach of any drink;
and that none might come suddenly upon him, or offer
him any thing more, for all things frighted him; And
that he found he must shortly dye, for that his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to faile him; and indeed he look'd exceeding pale
and hollow and thin visag'd.</p>
               <p>I then with much difficulty perswaded him to cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cross the bed upon his belly (for he had his Cloaths
loosely about him) hanging his head over the other
side; perswading my self that this posture might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to his drinking, since that in the erect posture
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56944:66"/>
of a man he could not so much as endure the approach
of liquor. In this posture then of a Dog, he suffered a
large Bowl filled with <hi>small Beer</hi> to be brought under
his head, and imbracing it with raptures of joy, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he was infinitely refreshed with the smell of it;
that he now saw it with delight, and assured us he
should be able soon to drink it all off. And he that now
thought himself a dying man talked pleasantly, and said
many passionate things to his brother, wife, &amp;c. won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
extolling this invention, and thanking me for it.
He endeavoured with great earnestness to put down his
head to it, but could not; his Stomack rise as often as
he opened his Lips; at length he put out his tongue and
made towards it as tho he would lap; but ever as his
tongue never so little touched the Surface of the beer,
he started back affrighted. And yet all this while was
pleased with the thoughts of drinking; and would not
suffer the Maid servant to take it away from nuder his
head; and if she did a little withdraw it, he said he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it by the <hi>smell</hi> with delight, snuffing with his
nostrils. After a long time being mightily foiled, he
alleadged that the faint smell of the <hi>small Beer</hi> hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from drinking, and therefore desired a <hi>Bowl of
Ale;</hi> which was brought him; but after much striving,
and exerting his tongue a thousand times, he could not
drink of it; and lapping with great affrights, as oft as
his tongue touched it he started back with his head,
bringing it down again gently to the Bowl a hundred
times, but all in vain. And in this posture, what upon
his belly and what upon his hands and knees, he kept
himself at least an hour thus <hi>Tantilizing</hi> himself; but it
was not in his power to drink. We than gave him a
<hi>Quill</hi> which consisted of two or three Joints, the one
end in his mouth and the other in the liquor; but he
could not manage it, nor suck no more than a Dog. I
perswaded him to give all over and lye down; which he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56944:66"/>
did; and not long after my going away, he fell into a
Convulsion Fit, bit and snarl'd and catch'd at every body,
and foamed at the mouth. After this was over he took
an <hi>Elleborism</hi> in a <hi>Bolus,</hi> which was taken like the rest,
and very willingly by him; it wrought about 3 or 4 times
very Plentifully, and he declared himself wonderfully at
ease by it; but yet now and then fell convulsed, and
then always insensible. After four hours I returned to
him again, and found the <hi>Minister</hi> with him; he talked
very sensibly to him, prayed very earnestly with him,
saying the Prayers after him, and desired the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
which in these cirumstances could not be given.</p>
               <p>He was again solicited to drink, and he now readily
enough put himself into the former posture, and with as
much earnestness as ever used all the little shifts to
drink, while the Bowl was under his head; but all in
vain. He had a little Silver Tumbler fill'd with drink
put into his hands, which suddainly, when he had as it
were stolen it near his mouth, he would have thrown
it into his throat, as he did the <hi>Bolus</hi>'s, but it hit against
his teeth &amp; fell into the Bowl. I cannot say he ever went
to stool or made water all this time, and therefore had
a Glyster given him; but upon parting with it, which
he did immediatly almost as soon as given, he died con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsed:
But his not making water, as well as a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>Priapisme</hi> which he complained of, when upon his
knees, might proceed from the Blistering Plaisters, as
well as from his Disease.</p>
               <p>That nothing may be omitted which relates to this
case; the day after his interment I accidentlly met with
his Cozen Mrs. S. who told me that her Daughter
was in fear, for just that very day fornight before his
death she had been at his house, and he would go home
with her to her Mothers; that she remembred his hand
trembled and his body shake'd, that he was in a cold
sweat, and in a great disorder, so that she asked him what
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56944:67"/>
he ail'd: he told her, that after his work (for he was
an Upholster) it had been of late usual with him: And
which was remarkable the very Dog which bit him came
at that time along with him to her Mothers house; and
was alive and well at the mans death.</p>
               <p>To this we add that Mr. <hi>Widdow</hi> a Mercer doth affirm,
that about the very time that Mr. <hi>Corton</hi> was thought
to be bit with <hi>Suttons</hi> Dog, a black Dog, which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believes to be the same, came and bit a Whelp of
his in his Shop. The next day the Whelp ran mad up
and down the House, and bit both him and the Maid;
him in the hand, and the Maid in the leg, and dyed that
very day. About a month after he was bit he found
himself not well, and was troubled with a pain at his
heart, and had a fearfulness and trembling upon him, and
got no rest for three nights, upon which he had had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
blooded, and found himself better; his Maid doth
not yet complain of any harm.</p>
               <p>Thus far for matter of fact, delivered with care in all
circumstances that came to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is very hard to give a probable reason of this <hi>Aquae
pavor:</hi> what <hi>Galen (de Theriaca)</hi> says of their much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
water, because of the <hi>intollerable thirst</hi> upon
them, agrees not with our case. For this man was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thirsty nor distracted, as he would have them; he
was all the time in his Witts, did very well consider, and
rationally discourse of the thing, and exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at the impossibility of his drinking: was well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Minister who told him of his incapacity of
the receiving the Cup in the Sacrament; and did often
say he was not thirsty, which appeared by the moisture
and flexibility of his tongue, (even after his taking many
hot and piperate <hi>Antidotes,)</hi> for this was by me even to
the last carefully viewed. Besides, those who are very
thirsty, and distracted in the most violent Feavers, do not
only drink readily enough without dread; but on the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56944:67"/>
contrary have an exceeding greedy Appetite to it.</p>
               <p>Nor can I well understand what <hi>Julius Palmarius (de
morbis Contagiosis)</hi> means by the third Paroxism of an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophobia,</hi>
before which he would have his never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Antidote to be given, which our dispensatory calls
<hi>pulvis Antilissus;</hi> I suspect he took the disease, as he
ownes he did the Medicine, upon trust; indeed it seems
to me not to have many things in it of the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes.
This our man certainly had the disease of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae
pavor</hi> upon him continually from the first Moment
to his death, which was near 48 hours without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission;
for as oft as drink was shewed him, or he
swallowed his own Spittle, his disturbance was most
grievous and terrible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in this (as in all things else he treats of)
is most sober, and to be credited; <hi>Quidam, qui jam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae
metum sentirent, sumpto Helleboro, simul ac primum
morbi impetum experirentur, sanati sunt: nam &amp; jam
vitio tentatos nemo unquam servare potest.</hi> This very
well agrees with out case; The latter person who had
a sense of the evil, had it prevented by bleeding; but
our man which had the evil; that is the <hi>Aquae pavor</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, not bleeding, or the most famed Antidotes, or
even <hi>Hellebore</hi> could in the least save, tho not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
given him.</p>
               <p>The case indeed rarely occurs, and therefore cannot
well be observed in all due circumstances in order to
its clearer understanding, and consequently cure; we
shall venter however to lay down some few things to
salve it by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>J. Corton</hi> had some of the organic parts of
his body transformed into, or affected after the nature
of a Dog, especially the <hi>Gula, Tongue</hi>  so that what
was offer'd to him in the erect posture of a man was very
frightful, as well as difficult for him to take, because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>new nature,</hi> as much as it would be for us to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56944:68"/>
get a dog to drink standing upon his hinder legs.</p>
               <p>But yet this is not all, for when he was turned upon
his belly, and would have acted the Dog, he yet could
not drink; and tho' he frequently put out his tongue and
lapt, yet he could not endure to take any thing into his
mouth of liquor, as tho something had hindred him within.</p>
               <p>Therefore we may imagine he was also <hi>convulsed</hi> in
those parts, or <hi>swelled:</hi> but this we cannot grant, for
the contrary does plainly appear, because he could cast
any thing into his mouth and swallow it; as he did very
many times stif <hi>Bolus</hi>'s, more nimbly, as to the swallow,
then any man reasonably could be supposed to do, that
was so weakened: for I saw no difference betwixt those
he swallowed an hour or two before his death, and the
very first he took.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That his <hi>Spittle was envenomed;</hi> for as oft as
he swallowed it, (his Stomack vehemently abhorring it)
it went to his heart (as we say), and was even present
death to him; And so liquid things coming nearer to
the consistance of Spittle might the rather <hi>movere sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi>
and therefore gave him a greater terror and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to swallow, then solid things.</p>
               <p>And that his Spittle chiefly was infected with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
of the Dog, seems also. 1. Because the Dog bit
him, whose Spittle alone to be venomous to
the touch<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. de locis affec. lib. 6.</note> there are many credible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in Medical History. 2. He was most
like a Dog in the mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> where are the proper
Organs of the <hi>Saliva.</hi> 3. The bite of a man so bitten
is alike in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ctions; but otherwise innocent.</p>
               <p>But it may be askt how comes it to infect his Spittle,
and not other humors and the blood. I answer, The
blood in part was undoubtedly affected, as the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
arising before the <hi>Aquae pavor</hi> (which yet is the
onely true <hi>Pathogmonick</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the disease) demonstrate.
Again the blood is not <hi>one liquor</hi> (as is generally thought),
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56944:68"/>
but many distinct liquors circulated together <hi>in one set
of common Vessels;</hi> and so it might infect that liquor,
which it was most a kin to, as the <hi>Saliva</hi> of a Dog to
the <hi>Saliva</hi> of a man. Concerning the truth of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
I have formerly writ some things to you; and
more I intend to entertain you with; you will excuse
me at present if I do not think it convenient to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate

               <head>An account of part of a Wall, built in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Time.</head>
               <p>I Carefully viewing the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
what might relate to the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi>
of which this place had been a seat, And the <hi>dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of at the least two of the <hi>Emperors, Severus</hi> and
<hi>Constantine,</hi> I found a part of a <hi>Wall,</hi> yet standing, which
is undoutedly of that time; it is the South Wall of the
<hi>Mint-Yard,</hi> being formerly an Hospitall of S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                  <hi>Lowrance,</hi>
looking towards the River; it consists of a Multangular
Tower, which did lead to <hi>Bootham-bar,</hi> and about—yards
of Wall, which ran the length of <hi>Conning-street:</hi>
As he who shall attentively view it on both sides may
discerne.</p>
               <p>But the outside Towards the River is most worth
taking notice of, it is faced with a very small <hi>Saxum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratum</hi>
of about four Inches thick, and laid in Levells
like our Moderne brick-work: This sort of building
<hi>Vitruvius (Lib. 2. Cap. 9.)</hi> calls after the Greekes,
<hi>Iso domum, cum omnia Coria aequá crassitudine fuerint,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56944:69"/>
structa;</hi> but the length of the stones is not observed, but
are as they fell out in hewing; From the Foundation
twenty courses of this small squared Stone are layd; And
over them five courses of <hi>Roman bricks;</hi> These bricks
some of them are layed length-waies, and some end-waies
in the Wall; And were called <hi>Lateres Diatoni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After these five courses of Bricks, other twenty two
courses of small Square stones, as before described, are
laid, which raise the Wall 3 Foot higher; And then five
more courses of the same <hi>Roman Brick</hi> are over laide;
beyond which the Wall is imperfect and capt with modern
building. Note that in all this height there is no Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Loopehole, but one intire and uniforme Wall;
from which we guess the Wall to have been built some
courses higher after the same order.</p>
               <p>The reason of this order of Brick-worke intermixt
with Stone the same <hi>Vitruius</hi> gives, and in this particular
the <hi>Romans</hi> after his time, and upon his admonition, and
recommendation, in all probability, did imitate the Greeks.
<hi>Longitudines coriorum</hi> (saies he) <hi>alternis coagmentis
in crassitudinem instruentes,</hi> and a little further;
<q>
                     <hi>inter ponunt singulos perpetua Crassitudine utraque parte
Frontatos (latcres) quos</hi> Diatonos <hi>appellant, qui maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè
Religando confirmant parietum soliditatem;</hi>
                  </q>
These Bricks were to be as <hi>Throughs,</hi> or as it were so
many <hi>new Foundations</hi> to that which was to be Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;
And to bind the two sides together firmly;
for the Wall it self is only faced with small square stones;
And the middle thereof filled with Morter and Pebles;
<hi>Frentibus serviunt</hi> (saith the same Author) <hi>&amp; medio
farciunt;</hi> which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> discomends in the <hi>Romans</hi> of
his time; And therefore the later <hi>Romans</hi> (the builders
of our Wall) did, as I said, correct this Errour, and
the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And least it should seem strange, that Bricks should
give a firmness to Stone buildings, the same <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56944:69"/>
testifies, and therefore commends Brick building before
stone (our men indeed, for wholesomeness, which also
is true, and to be much considered in a cold and moist
Climate) even for the duration; And therefore in
<hi>Rome</hi> abatement was ever made for the use of Sone build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
none for that of Brick, provide it kept its level and
stood upright upon its Foundation; And therefore to
excuse it he at large gives a relation why the <hi>Romans,</hi>
suffered not Brick buildings to be made within the City
of <hi>Rome;</hi> as a thing not of choice, but necessity. Those
Brick buildings being certainly in that great Architects
opinion to be preferred, the Law (sayes he) suffers not
a Wall to be made to the street ward (for so give me
leave to interpret <hi>communi loco)</hi> above a Foot and a
halfe thick, and partition Walls the same, least they
should take up too much rome. Now Brick Walls of a
Foot and a halfe thick, (unless they were <hi>Diplinthij,</hi>
or <hi>triplinthij),</hi> cannot bear up above one Story; but
in so vast and Majestic a City (as <hi>Old Rome)</hi> there
ought to be innumerable habitations; Therefore when
a plain <hi>Area,</hi> or building of one story could not receive
such a Multitude to dwell in the City, therefore the
thing it self did compell them to it, that the Houses
might be raised higher, and therefore they had strange
contrivances of out jetting, and over hanging stories,
and Belconies, &amp;c. Which reasons if rightly considered
are great mistakes; <hi>Our men</hi> at this day have taught
the World better things; And have demonstrated that
a firm building may be raised to many stories heighth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a foot and a half thick wall. The oversight of the
<hi>Romans</hi> was the vast bigness of their Bricks; for the lesser
the Brick the firmer the worke, there being much greater
firmness in a multitude of Angles, as must be produced
by small Brick, then in a right line; And this is the
reason of the strength of Butresses, and Mult-angular
Towers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These Bricks are about 17 Inches of our measure long
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56944:70"/>
and about 11 Inches broad, and two Inches and a half
thick. This, (hauing caused severall of them to be
carefully measured) I give in round Numbers, and do
find them very well to agree with the notion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Foot, which the learned Antiquary <hi>Greaves</hi> has left
us, <hi>viz.</hi> Of its being of halfe an Inch less then ours;
they seem to have shrunk in the baking more in the bredth
then in the length; which is but reasonable, because of
its easier yeelding that way; And so, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
more in the thickness, for we suppose them to have
been designed in the Mould for three <hi>Roman</hi> Inches.</p>
               <p>Now that this was properly the <hi>Roman Brick,</hi> we
have the testimony of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and <hi>Pliny:</hi> of <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,
"fiunt Laterum tria genera; unum quod Grece
Didoron appellatur, quo nostri utuntur,</hi> &amp;c." And
of Pliny; "<hi>Genera eorum tria Didoron, quo vtimur
longum sesquipede, latum pede;</hi>" But we are to note,
that the Coppy of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> where it describes the
measure of the <hi>Didoron</hi> is vicious. And is to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by <hi>Pliny;</hi> And had not <hi>Vitruvius's</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
been more a friend to his Author, than to truth, he
had not perswaded the contrary; for the Bricks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do demonstrate at this day <hi>Plinie's</hi> measures to be
right and not that of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> as they are extant: which
makes me much wonder at the confidence of <hi>Daniel
Barbarus</hi> affirming the Bricks, now to be found are all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Vitruvius</hi> and not <hi>Plinte's</hi> measures; for all
that I have yet seen with us in <hi>England,</hi> are of <hi>Plinie's</hi>
measures; as at <hi>Leister</hi> in the <hi>Rome</hi> Ruine there, called
the <hi>Jews Walls;</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                  <hi>Albons,</hi> as I remember; and here
with us at <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to goe no farther for Arguments, than that Chap.
of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> the <hi>diplinthij parietes</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> were against
Law, and the single Brick-wall was only allowed as Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;
<hi>viz.</hi> A foot and a halfe thick wall, or one <hi>Roman</hi>
Brick a length, as was above Noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56944:70"/>
                  <hi>Pliny,</hi> lived some time after <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>Transcriber,</hi> and, as it appears from this very place,
having taken the whole business of Brick <hi>Verbatim</hi> out
of him and not differing in any one thing in the whole
Chapter, but in this; <hi>viz.</hi> in the measure of the <hi>Dido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
And the Bricks demonstrating the truth of that
differance, it is but reasonable we should make <hi>Vitru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's
longum pede, latum semipede,</hi> a fault of <hi>Vitruvius's</hi>
Coppiers.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this differance with this remark:
That proportion and a plaine Uniformitie, even in the
minutest parts of Building, is to be observed, as this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Ruin of <hi>Roman</hi> workman-ship shews: In our <hi>Gothic
Buildings</hi> there is a totall neglect of the measure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Courses, as tho that was not much materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the beauty of the whole, whereas, indeed, in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
works,</hi> It is from the <hi>Symmetrie</hi> of the very <hi>Graine,</hi>
whence ariseth much of the beauty of the thing. Indeed,
if I was never to come nearer a building, and to view it
alwayes at such a distance, this might be excused as to
me; And so in <hi>Artificiall things,</hi> as in Pictures, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
to be seen on high: But yet in my opinion 'tis
but an excuse of Laziness to tell me such and such rude
dashes will have a marvelous effect at a distance; as
though things Painted or Carved to addorn our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
low Roomes were distanced. And this <hi>Noble
Art,</hi> in my opinion, has of late in nothing suffered so
much with us as in admitting of this vile <hi>(not to say
Impudent)</hi> Excuse, whereas indeed, What is well done
and most exactly finished in the most minute parts of a
thing Painted? I am sure if it pleaseth me near the Eye,
it will never displease me at a distance.</p>
