            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> because the <hi>Dictators</hi> (for that time) had this absolute power, which some Greekes named a lawfull tyrannie for a time. As I remember, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (who of all writers hath most absolutely &amp; methodically trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the diuision and natures of common wealthes) maketh this sort of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be one kind of kings. But all commeth to one effect: for at the first, all kinges ruled absolutely, as they who were either the heades &amp; most ancient of their families, deriued out of their own bodies, as <hi>Adam, Noa, Abraham, Iacob, Esau,</hi> reigning absolutely ouer their owne children and bondmen as reason was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else in the rude world amongest barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; ignorant people, some one then whom God had endewed with singular wisedome to inuent thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the nourishing and defence of the multitude, and to administer iustice did so farre excell other, that all the rest were but beastes in comparison of him, and for that excellencio willingly had this authoritie giuen him of the multitude, and of the Gentils when he was dead &amp; almost when he was yet lyuing, was taken for a God, of others for a Prophet.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18192:8"/>
done, ech diuideth himselfe from others as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if one man had as some of the olde Romanes had (if it be true that is written) v. thousande or x. thousande bondmen whom he ruled well, though they dwelled all in one citie, or were distributed into diuerse villages, yet that were no common wealth: for the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no communion with his master, the wealth of the Lord, is onely sought for, and not the profit of the slaue or bondman. For as they who write of these thinges haue defined, a bondman or a slaue is as it were(sauing life and humane reason) but the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Lord, as the axe, the saw, the chessyll and goluge is of the charpenter. Truth it is the charpenter looketh diligently to saue, correct and amend all these: but it is for his owne profit, and in consideration of him selfe, not for the instrumentes sake. And as these be instruments of the carpenter, so the plow, the cart, the horse, oxe or asse, be instrumentes of the husbandman: and though one husbandman had a great number of all those and looked well to them, it made no common wealth nor could not so be called. For the priuate wealth of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is onely regarded, and there is no mutuall societie or portion, no law or pleading betweene thone and thother. And (as be sayth) what reason hath the pot to say to the potter, why madest thou me thus? or why dost thou breake me after thou hast made me? euen so is the bondman or slaue which is bought for monie: for he is but a reasonable and lyuing instrument the possession of his Lorde and master, reckoned among his goods, not otherwise admitted to the societie ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill or common wealth, but is part of the possession and goods of his Lorde. Wherefore except there be other orders and administrations amonst the Turkes, if the prince of the Turkes (as it is written of him) doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all other his bondmen and slaues (him selfe and his sonnes onely freemen) a man may doubt whether his

               <p>Then if this be a societie, and consisteth onely of free men, the least part therof must be of two. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralest and first coniunction of two toward the making of a further societie of continuance is of the husband &amp; of the wife after a diuerse sorte ech hauing care of the familie: the man to get, to trauaile abroad, to defende: the wife, to saue that which is gotten, to tarrie at home to distribute that which commeth of the husbandes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for the nurtriture of the children and family of them both, and to keepe all at home neat and cleane. So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath forged ech parte to his office, the man sterne, strong, bould, aduenterous, negligent of his bewtie, &amp; spending.

Either of them excelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wit and wisedome to conduct those thinges which appertaine to their office, and therefore where their wisedome doth excell, therein it is reason that ech should gouerne. And without this societie of man, and woman, the kinde of man coulde not long endure. And to this societie men are so naturally borne that the prince of all Philosophers in consideration of natures was not afraide to say that a man by nature is rather desirous to fellow him selfe to another and so to liue in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18192:9"/>
couple, than to adherd himselfe with many. Although of all thinges or lyuing creatures a man doth shew him selfe most politique, yet can he not well liue without the societie &amp; fellowship ciuill. He that can liue alone saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> is either a wild beast in a mans likenes, or else a god rather than a man. So in the house and familie is the first and most naturall (but priuate) apparance of one of the best kindes of a common wealth, that is called <hi>Aristocratia</hi> where a few &amp; the best doe gouerne, and where not one alwaies: but sometime and in some thing one, &amp; sometime and in some thing another doth beare the rule.

Thus a few being heades and the chiefe of their families, equall in birth and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and not much different in riches, gouerned their owne houses and the descendentes of them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and consulted in common vpon publike causes, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also vpon certaine lawes and orders to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. So the best, chiefest and sagest did rule, and thother part had no cause to striue with them, nor had no cause nor apparance to compare with anie of them, neither for age nor discretion, nor for riches or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. The rulers sought ech to keepe and maintaine their posteritie, as their sonnes and nephewes, and such as shoulde succeede them and carie their names when they were deade, and so render them being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall by nature immortall by their fame and successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of posteritie: hauing most earnest care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine still this their cousinage and common familie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well against forraigne and barbarous nations, which were not of their progenie, tongue, or religion, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

For two thinges being such as for the which men in society and league do most striue, that is honour and profitte, no man of free courage can be contented to be neglected therein, so that they were faine of necessitie to come to that, that the more part should beare the price away in election of magistrates and rulers. So that either by course or by lot ech man in turne might be receaued to beare rule and haue his part of the honour, and (if any were) of the profit, which came by administration of the common wealth. For whosoeuer came of that old great grandfathers race, he accompted him selfe as good of birth as any other. For seruice to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth all or such a number had done it, as they coulde not be accompted few. And if a few would take vpon them to vsurpe ouer the rest, the rest conspiring together would soone be master ouer them, and ruinate them wholly.

               <p>TO make all thinges yet cleare before, as we shal go, there ariseth another diuision of the partes of the common wealth. For it is not enough to say that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth

In which consideration also we do reiect women, as those whom nature hath made to keepe home and to nourish their familie and children, and not to medle with matters abroade, nor to beare office in a citie or common wealth no more than chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and infantes: except it be in such cases as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is annexed to the blood and progenie, as the crowne, a dutchie, or an erledome, for there the blood is respected, not the age nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sexe. Whereby an absolute Quéene, an absolute Dutches or Countesse, those I call absolute, which haue the name, not by being maried to a king, duke, or erle, but by being the true, right &amp; next successors in the dignitie, and vpon whom by right of the blood that title is descended: These I say haue the same authoritie although they be women or children in that kingdome, dutchie or earledome, as they shoulde haue had if they had bin men of full age. For the right and honour of the blood, and the quietnes and suertie of the realme, is more to be considered, than either the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age as yet impotent to rule, or the sexe not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (otherwise) to intermeddle with publicke affaires, being by common intendment vnderstood, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages neuer do lacke the counsell of such graue and discreete men as be able to supplie all other defectes.

But as in Fraunce the kinges eldest sonne hath the title of the daulphine, and he or the next heire apparant to the crowne is monsire, so in Englande the kinges eldest sonne is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the prince.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18192:14"/>
for some great seruice done, or some good hope through the vertues which do appeare in them. And they are made either by the king himselfe, or by his commission and royall authoritie, giuen for the same purpose, or by his liuetenaunt in the warres, who hath his royall and absolute power committed to him for that time. And that order seemeth to aunswere in part to that which the Romanes called <hi>Equites Romanos,</hi> differing in some pointes, and agreeing in other, as their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth and ours do differ and agree: for neuer in all pointes one common wealth doth agree with an other, no nor long time any one common wealth with it selfe. For al chaungeth continually to more or lesse, and still to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse &amp; diuerse orders, as the diuersity of times do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, and the mutabilitie of mens wittes doth inuent and assay new wayes, to reforme and amende that werein they do finde fault. <hi>Equites Romani</hi> were chosen <hi>ex censu,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is according to their substance and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

               <p>When the Romanes did write <hi>senatus populusque Romanus,</hi> they seemed to make but two orders, that is of the Senate and of the people of Rome, and so in the name of people they contayned <hi>equites</hi> and <hi>plebem:</hi> so when we in England do say the Lordes and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the knights, esquires &amp; other gentlemen, with citizens, burgeses &amp; yeomen be accompted to make the commons.

This hath his reason, for the Etimologie of the name serueth thefficacie of the worde. <hi>Gens</hi> in Latine betokeneth the race and sirname, so the Romaines had <hi>Cornelios, Sergios, Appios, Fabios, AEmilios, Pisones, Iulio, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, Valerios,</hi> of which who were Agnati, and therefore kept the name, were also <hi>Gentiles</hi>: and remaining the memorie of the glorie of their progenitors fame, were gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that or that race. This matter made a great strife among the Romanes, when those which were <hi>Noui homines</hi> were more allowed, for their vertues new and newly showen, than the olde smell of auncient race newly defaced by the cowardise and euill life of their nephewes and discendauntes could make the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be.

               <p>But as other common wealthes were faine to doe, so must all princes necessarily followe, that is, where vertue is to honour it: and although vertue of auncient race be earlier to be obtained, aswell by the example of the progenitors, which encourageth, as also through habilitie of education and bringing vp, which enableth, and the lastly enraced loue of tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; neybors to such noblemen and gentlemen, of whom they holde and by whom they doe dwell, which pricketh forward to ensue in their fathers steps. So it all this doe faile (as it were great pitie it should) yet such is the nature of all humaine thinges, and so the world is subiect to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, that it doth many times faile: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth, the prince and common wealth haue the same power that their predecessors had, and as the husbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath to plant a new tree where the olde fayleth, so hath the prince to honour vertue where he doth finde it, to make gentlemen, esquiers, knights, barons, earles marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; dukes, where he seeth vertue able to beare that honour or merits, and deserues it, &amp; so it hath alwayes bin vsed among vs. But ordinarily the king doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make knights and create barons or higher degrees: for as for gentlemen, they be made good cheape in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For whosoeuer studieth the lawes of the realme, who studieth in the vniuersities, who professed libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sciences, and to be shorte, who can liue idly and without manuall labour, and will beare the port, charge and countenaunce of a gentleman, he shall be called master, for that is the title which men giue to esquires and other gentlemen, and shall be taken for a gentleman: for true it is with vs as is saide, <hi>Tanti eris

               <p>A Man may make doubt &amp; question whether this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making gentlemen is to be allowed or no, &amp; for my part I am of that opinion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is not amisse. For first the prince looseth nothing by it, as he shoulde doe it it were as in Fraunce: for the yeomen or husbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no more subiect to taile or taxe in Englande than the gentleman: no, in every payment to the king the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is more charged, which he beareth the gladlier and dareth not gainesaie for to save and keepe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation. In any shew or muster or other particular charge of the towne where he is, he must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his purse wider and augment his portion above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or else he doth diminish his reputation. As for their outward shew, a gentleman (if he wil be so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted) must go like a gentleman, a yeoman like a yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a rascall like a rascall: and if he be called to

the warres, he must and will (whatsoever it cost him) array himselfe and arme him according to the vocation which he pretendeth: he must shew also a more manly corage &amp; tokens of better education, higher stomacke and bountifuller liberallitie than others, and keepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute him idle seruauntes, who shall doe nothing but waite vpon him. So that no man hath hurt by it but he himselfe, who hereby perchance will beare a bigger saile than he is able to maintaine. For as touching the policie and goverment of the common wealth, it is not those that haue to do with it, which will magnifie them selves, and goe in higher buskins than their estate will beare: but they which are to be appointed, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons tryed and well knowen, as shall be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

This sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confesse themselves to be no gentlemen, but giue the honour to al which be or take vpon them to be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and yet they haue a certaine preheminence and more estimation than laborers and artificers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly liue welthilie, kéepe good houses, &amp; do their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; trauaile to acquire riches: these be (for the most part) fermors vnto gentlemen, which with grasing, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of markettes, and kéeping seruauntes not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle as the gentleman doth, but such as get both their owne liuing and parte of their maisters, by these meanes doe come to such wealth, that they are able and daily doe buy the landes of vnthriftie gentlemen, and after setting their sonnes to the schoole at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, to the lawe of the Realme, or otherwise lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them sufficient landes whereon they may liue without labour, doe make their saide sonnes by those meanes gentlemen. These be not called masters, for that (as I saide) pertaineth to gentlemen onely: But to their surnames, men adde goodman: as if the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name be <hi>Luter, Finch, White, Browne,</hi> they are called, goodman <hi>Luter,</hi> goodman <hi>White,</hi> goodman <hi>Finch,</hi> goodman <hi>Browne,</hi> amongest their neighbours, I meane not in matters of importance or in lawe.

                  </gap>: these tende their owne businesse, come not to meddle in publike matters and iudgements but when they are called, and gladde when they are delivered thereof, are obedient to the gentlemen and rulers, and in warre can abide trauaile and labour as men vsed to it, yet within it soone at an ende that they might come home &amp; liue of their owne. When they are foorth they fight for their Lordes of whom they hold their landes, for their wiues and children, for their countrey and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for praise and honour, against they come home, and to haue the loue of their Lorde and his children to be continued towardes them and their children, which have aduentured their liues to and with him and his. These are they which in the old world gat that honour to Englande, not that either for witte, conduction, or for power they are or were euer to be compared to the gentlemen, but because they be so manie in number, so obedient at the Lordes call, so strong of bodie, so heard to endure paine, so couragious to aduenture with their Lorde or Captaine going with, or before them, for else they be not hastie nor neuer were, as making no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of knowledge of warre. These were the good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in times past, and the stable troupe of footemen that affaide all France, that would rather die all, than once abandon the knight or gentleman their Captaine,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18192:19"/>
who at those daies commonly was their Lorde, and whose tenauntes they were, readie (besides perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all shame) to be in danger of vndoing of them selues, &amp; all theirs if they should showe any signe of cowardise or abandon the Lorde, Knight or Gentlemen of whom they helde their liuing. And this they haue amongest them from their forefathers tolde one to an other. The gentlemen of France and the yeoman of Englande are renowned, because in battle of horsemen Fraunce was many times too good for vs, as we againe alway for them on foote. And gentlemen for the most part be men at armes and horsemen, and yeomen commonlie on foote: howesoeuer it was, yet the gentlemen had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the conduction of the yeomen, and as their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were either a foote or vppon a little nagge with them, and the Kinges of Englande in foughten bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles remaining alwaies among the footemen, as the French Kinges amongst their horsemen. Each Prince therby, as a man may gesse, did shew where he thought his strength did consist. What a yeoman is I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, but from whence the worde is deriued it is hard to say: it cannot be thought that yeomen should be said a young man, for commonly wee doe not call any a yeoman till he be married, and haue children, and as it were haue authoritie among his neighbours. Yonker in lowe dutch betokeneth a meane gentleman or a gay fellowe. Possible our yeomen not beeing so bolde as to name themselues gentlemen, when they came home, were content when they had heard by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation with lowe dutchmen of some small gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (but yet that would be counted so) to be called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them, yonker man, the calling so in warres by mockage or in sport thone an other, when they come home, yonker man, and so yeoman: which worde now signifieth among vs, a man well at ease and hauing honestlie to liue, and yet not a gentleman: whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

The first day of the parliament the Prince and all the Lordes in their robes of parliament do meete in the higher house, where after prayers made, they that be present are written, and they that be absent vpon sicknes or some other reasonable cause (which the prince will allowe) do constitute vnder their hande and seale some one of those who be present as their procurer or atturney to giue voice for them, so that by presence or atturney &amp; proxey they be all there, all the princes and barrons &amp; all archbishops and bishops, and (when abbots were) so many abbots as had voice in parliament. The place where the assembly is, is richly tapessed and hanged, a princely and royal throne as appertaineth to a king, set in the middest of the higher place thereof.

But these that sit on the woolsacks haue no voice in the house, but onely sit there to aunswere their knowledge in the law, when they be asked if any doubt arise among the Lordes.

And fourthly, that if there came any doubt, whereupon they shal desire to haue thaduise or conference with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie or with any of the Lordes, that they might doe it: All which he promiseth in the commons names that they shall not abuse, but haue such regarde as most faithfull, true and louing subiectes ought to haue to their prince.</p>
               <p>The Chauncelor answereth in the princes name, as apperteyneth. And this is all that is doone for one day, &amp; sometime two. Besides the Chauncelor, there is one in the vpper house who is called Clarke of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who readeth the bils. For all that commeth in consultation either in the vpper house or in the neather house, is put in writing first in paper, which being once read, he that will, riseth vp and speaketh with it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: and so one after another so long as they shall thinke good. That doone they goe to an other, and so another bill. After it hath bin once or twise read, and doth appeare that it is somewhat like as reasonable, with such amendment in wordes and peraduenture some sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as by disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seemeth to be amended. In the vpper house the Chauncelor asketh if they will haue it engrossed, that is to say put into parchment: which doone, and read the third time, and that eftsoones
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18192:22"/>
if any be disposed to obiect disputed againe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, the Chauncelor asketh if they will goe to the question: and if they agree to goe to the question, then he sayth, here is such a lawe or act concerning such a matter, which hath béene thrise read here in this house, are ye content that it be enacted or no? If the not contentes be moe, then the bill is dashed, that is to say the lawe is annihilated and goeth no further. If the contentes be the more, then the Clarke writeth vnderneath: <hi>Soit baille aux commons.</hi> And so when they see time they send such bils as they haue approued by two or three of those which doe sit on the woolsacks to the commons: who asking licence, and comming into the house, with due reuerence, sayth to the speaker: Master speaker my Lordes of the vpper house haue passed among them and thinke good, that there should be enacted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament such an act, and such an act, and so readeth the titles of that act or actes. They pray you to consider of them, and shew them your aduise, which doone they goe their way. They being gone and the doore againe shut, the speaker rehearseth to the house what they sayde. And if they be not busie disputing at that time in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bill, he asketh them streightwaie if they will haue that bill or (if there be mo) one of them.</p>
               <p>In like maner in the lower house the speaker sitting in a seate or chaire for that purpose somewhat higher, that he may see and be seene of them all, hath before him in a lower seate his Clarke, who readeth such bils as he first propounded in the lower house, or be sent down from the Lords. For in that point, ech house hath equal authoritie, to propounde what they thinke meete, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thabrogating of some law made before, or for making of a newe. All bils be thrise in three diuerse dayes read and disputed vpon, before they come to the question. In the disputing is a meruelous good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vsed in the lower house. He that standeth vppe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18192:23"/>
beareheadded is vnderstranded that he will speake to the bill. If moe stande vppe, who that first is iudged to arise, is first harde, though the one do prayle the law, the other diswade it, yet there is no altercation. For euerie man speaketh as to the speaker, not as one to an other, for that is against the order of the house. It is also taken against the order, to name him whom ye doe confute, but by circumlocution, as he that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with the bill, or he that spake against the bill, and gaue this and this reason. And so with perpetuall O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not with altercation, he goeth through till he do make an end. He that once hath spoken in a bill though he be confuted straight, that day may not replie, no though he would chaunge his opinion. So that to one bill in one day one may not in that house speake twise, for else one or two with altercation woulde spende all the time. The next day he may, but then also but once.</p>
               <p>No reuiling or nipping wordes must be vsed. For then all the house will crie, it is against the order: and if any speake vnreuerently or seditiouslie against the Prince or the priuie counsell, I haue séene them not onely interrupted, but it hath béene moued after to the house, and they haue sent them to the tower. So that in such a multitude, and in such diuersitie of mindes, and opinions, there is the greatest modestie and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of spéech that can be vsed. Neuerthelesse with much doulce and gentle termes, they make their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as violent and as vehement the one against the other as they may ordinarily, except it bee for vrgent causes &amp; hasting of time. At the afternoone they kéepe no parliament. The speaker hath no voice in the house, nor they will not suffer him to speake in any bill to moue or diswade it. But when any bill is read, the speakers office is as brieflie and as plainely as he may to declare the effect thereof to the house. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons doe assent to such billes as be sent to them first
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18192:23"/>
agréed vpon from the Lords thus subscribed, <hi>Les com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons out assentus,</hi> so if the Lordes doe agrée to such billes as be first agréed vppon by the Commons, they sende them downe to the speaker thus subscribed, <hi>Les Seigneurs out assentus.</hi> If they cannot agrée, the two houses (for euerie bill from whence soeuer it doth come is thrise reade in each of the houses) if it be vnderstoode that there is any sticking sometimes the Lordes to the Commons, somtime the Commons to the Lords doe require that a certaine of each house may méete together, and so ech part to be enformed of others mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and this is alwaies graunted. After which mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the most part not alwaies either parte agrées to others billes.</p>
               <p>In the vpper house they giue their assent &amp; dissent ech man seuerallie &amp; by himselfe first for himselfe, and then for so manie as he hath proxie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chaunceler hath demanded of them whether they will goe to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the bill hath béene thrise reade, they saying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content or not content, without further reasoning or replying: and as the more number doeth agrée, so it is agréed on or dashed.</p>
               <p>In the neather house none of them that is elected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight or Burges can giue his voice to an other nor his consent nor dissent by proxie. The more parts of them that be present onely maketh the consent or dissent. After the bill hath béene twise reade, and then engrossed and eftsoones reade and disputed on ynough as is thought: the speaker asketh if they will goe to the question. And if they agrée be holdeth the bill vp in his hande and sayeth, as many as will haue this bill goe forwarde, which is concerning such a matter, say yea. Then they which allowe the bill crie yea, and as many as wil not, say no: as the crie of yea or no is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, so the bill is allowed or dashed. If it be a doubt which crie is the bigger, they diuide the house, the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18192:24"/>
saying, as many as doe alowe the bill goe downe with the bill, and as many as do not sitte still. So they diuide themselues, and being so diuided they are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred who make the more part, and so the bill doeth spéede. It chaunceth sometime that some part of the bil is allowed, some other part hath much contrariety and doubt made of it: and it is thought if it were amended it would goe forwarde. Then they chuse certaine <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> of them who haue spoken with the bil &amp; against it to amende it, and bring it in againe so amended, as they amongest them shall thinke méete: and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is engrossed, yea &amp; some time after. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these <hi>committees</hi> is no preiudice to the house. For at the last question they will either accept it or dash it as it shall séeme good, notwithstanding y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the <hi>committees</hi> haue doone.</p>
               <p>Thus no bill is an act of Parliament, ordinaunce, or edict of law, vntill both the houses seuerallie haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vnto it, after the order aforesaide, no nor then neither. But the last day of that Parliament or session the Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in person in his Parliament robes, and sitteth in his state: all the vpper house sitteth about the Prince in their states and order in their robes. The speaker with all the common house commeth to the barre, and there after thankesgiuen first in the Lordes name by the Chaunceller &amp;c. and in the commons name by the speaker to the Prince, for that hee hath so great care of the good gouernement of his people, and for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them together to aduise of such thinges as should be for the reformation, establishing &amp; ornament of the common wealth: the Chaunceller in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes name giueth thankes to the Lords &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons for their paines and trauailes taken, which he saith the Prince will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and recompence when time and occasion shall serue, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he for his part is ready to declare his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure concerning their procéedings, whereby the same
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18192:24"/>
may haue perfect life &amp; accomplishment by his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie authoritie, and so haue the whole consent of the Realme. Then one reades the title of euerie act which hath passed at that session, but only in this fashion: An act co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning such a thing &amp;c. It is marked there what the Prince doth allowe, and to such he sayth: <hi>Le roy</hi> or <hi>la royne le veult.</hi> And those be taken nowe as perfect lawes and ordinances of the Realme of Englande and none other, and as shortlie as may be put in print, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be some priuate cause or lawe made for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or preiudice of some priuate man, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were wont to call <hi>priuilegia.</hi> These be onelie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified vnder the seale of the Parliament, and for the most part not printed. To those which the Prince li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not, he answereth, <hi>Le roy</hi> or <hi>la royne saduisera,</hi> &amp; those be accounted vtterly dashed and of no effect.</p>
               <p>This is the order and forme of the highest and most authenticall court of Englande, by vertue whereof all those things be established whereof I spake before, and no other meanes accounted vailable to make any new forfaiture of life, member, or landes of any English man, where there was no lawe ordayned for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               <head>Of the Monarch King or Queene of Englande. CHAP. 3.</head>
               <p>THe Prince whom I nowe call (as I haue often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Monarch of Englande, King or Quéene, hath absolutelie in his power the authoritie of warre and peace, to defie what Prince it shall please him, and to bid him warre, and againe to reconcile himselfe and enter into league or truce with him at his pleasure or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18192:25"/>
the aduice onely of his priuie consell. His priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell be chosen also at the Princes pleasure out of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or baronie, and of the Knightes, and Esquires, such and so many as he shal thinke good, who doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult daily, or when néede is of the weightie matters of the Realme, to giue therein to their Prince the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice they can. The Prince doth participate to them all, or so many of them, as he shall thinke good, such lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and messages as come from forren Princes, such letters or occurrentes as be sent to himselfe or to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, and kéepeth so many ambassades and letters sent vnto him secret as he will, although these haue a particular oth of a counseller touching faith and secrets administred vnto them when they be first admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that companie. So that héerein the kingdome of Englande is farre more absolute than either the duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Uenice is, or the kingdome of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was. In warre time, &amp; in the field the Prince hath also absolute power, so that his worde is a law, he may put to death, or to other bodilie punishment, whom he shall thinke so to deserue, without processe of lawe or forme of iudgement. This hath béene sometime vsed within the Realme before any open warre in sodden insurrections and rebellions, but that not allowed of wise and graue men, who in that their iudgment had consideration of the consequence and example, asmuch as of the present necessitie,, especiallie, when by anie meanes the punishment might haue béene doone by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of lawe. This absolute power is called marciall lawe and euer was and necessarilie must be vsed in all campes and hostes of men, where the time nor place do suffer the tariance of pleading and processe, be it neuer so short, and the important necessitie requireth spéedie execution, that with more awe the souldier might be kept in more straight obedience, without which neuer captaine can doe anie thing vaileable in the warres.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:18192:25"/>The prince vseth also absolute power in crying and decreeing the mony of the realme by his proclamation onely. The mony is alwayes stamped with the pinces image and title. The forme, fashion, maner, weight, finenesse, and basenesse thereof, is at the discretion of the prince. For whom should the people trust more in that matter than their prince, seeing the coine is only to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the goodness of the mettall and the weight, which is affirmed by the princes image and marke? But if the prince will deceaue them and giue copper for siluer or golde, or enhaunce his coyne more than it is worth, he is deceaued himselfe, as well as he doth go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deceaue his subiectes. For in the same sorte they pay the prince his rentes and customes. And in time they will make him pay rateably or more for meate, drinke and victualles for him and his, and for their labour: which experience doth teach vs nowe in our dayes to be doone in all regions. For there euer hath béene &amp; euer will be a certaine proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwéene the scarcity and plentie of other thinges, with gold and siluer, as I haue declared more at large in my booke of monie. For all other measures and weightes, aswell of drie thinges as of wet, they haue accustomed to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished or altered by the Parliament, and not by the princes proclamation only.</p>
               <p>The prince vseth also to dispence with lawes made, whereas equitie requireth a moderation to be had, and with paynes for transgression of lawes, where the payne of the lawe is applyed onely to the prince. But where the forfaite (as in popular actions it chaunceth many times) is part to the prince, the other part to the declarator, detector or informer, there the prince doth dispence for his owne part onely. Where the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall action is intended by inquisition (that maner is called with vs at the princes suite) the prince giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth absolution or pardon: yet with a clause, <hi>modo stet
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18192:26"/>
rectus in curia,</hi> that is to say, that no man obiect against the offendor. Whereby notwithstanding that he hath the princes pardon if the person offended will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him the accusation( which in our language is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the appeale) in cases where it lieth, the princes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth not serue the offendor.</p>
               <p>The prince giueth all the chiefe and highest offices or magistracies of the realme, be it of iudgement or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, temporall or spirituall, and hath the tenthes and first fruites of all Ecclesiasticall promotions, except in the Uniuersities and certaine Colledges which be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt.</p>
               <p>All writtes, executions and commaundementes be done in the princes name. We doe say in England the life and member of the kinges subiectes are the kinges onely, that is to say no man hath <hi>hault</hi> nor <hi>moyenne</hi> iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice but the king, nor can hold plea thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those pleas, which touche the life or the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of man, be called pleas of the crowne, nor can be dooke in the name of any inferior person than he or shée that holdeth the crowne of Englande. And likewise no man can giue pardon thereof but the prince onely: Although in times past there were certaine countie Palatines, as Chester, Durham, Clie, which were <hi>hault</hi> iusticers, and writtes went in their name, and also some Lorde marchers of Wales, which claymed like priuiledge. All these are now worne away. The supreme iustice is done in the kinges name, and by his authoritie onely.</p>
               <p>The Prince hath the wardshippe and first mariage of all those that hold landes of him in chiefe. And also the gouernement of all fooles natural, or such as be made by aduenture of sicknes, and so continue, if they be landed. This being once graunted by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (although some inconuenience hath béene thought to grow thereof, &amp; sith that time it hath béene thought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18192:26"/>
verie vnreasonable) yet once annexed to the crowne who ought to go about to take the clubbe out of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> hand. And being gouerned iustly &amp; rightly, I see not so much inconuenience in it, as some men would make of it: diuerse other rights and preeminences the prince hath which be called prerogatiues royalles, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the king, which be declared particularly in the bookes of the common lawes of England.</p>
               <p>To be short the prince is the life, the head, and the authoritie of all thinges that be doone in the realme of England. And to no prince is doone more honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence than to the King and Queene of Englande, no man speaketh to the prince nor serueth at the table but in adoration and kneeling, all persons of the realme be bareheaded before him: insomuch that in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of presence where the cloath of estate is set, no man dare walke, yea though the prince be not there, no man dare tarrie there but bareheadded. This is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the subiectes of the realme: For all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers be suffered there and in all places to vse the manner of their countrie, such is the ciuilitie of our nation.</p>

               <p>PLeas or actions criminall be in English called pleas of the crowne, which be all those which tende to take away a mans life or any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of him, for his euill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing against the prince and common wealth.</p>
               <p>And this name is giuen not without a cause. For taking this for a principle that the life and member of an Englishman is in the power onely of the prince and his lawes, when any of his subiectes is spoyled either of life or member, the prince is endammaged thereby, and hath good cause to aske accompt, how his subiectes should come to that mischiefe. And againe for so much as the prince who gouerneth the scepter, and holdeth the crowne of Englande hath this in his care and charge, to see the realme well gouerned, the life, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and possessions of his subiectes kept in peace and assuraunce: he that by violence shall attempt to breake
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18192:28"/>
that peace and assuraunce, hath forfeited against the scepter and crowne of England: and therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause in all inquisitions and inditementes, if any be found by the xii. men to haue offended in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, streight the prince is saide to be partie, and he that shall speake for the prisoner shall be rebuked, as speaking against the prince. Neverthelesse it is neuer defended, but the prisoner and partie defendant in any cause may alleadge for him, al the reasons, meanes and defenses that he can, and shall be peaceablie hearde and quietlie: But in those pleas &amp; pursuites of the crowne, procurer or aduocate he gettes none,<note place="margin">

               <p>TWo things may be moued in question here, how all Englande (being so long and so large, and hauing so many shyres and prouinces therein) can be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of iustice in one place, and in 3. benches be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great? An other (whereas the kinges bench is exercised in criminall causes and in all pleas of the crowne, and the common place in all ciuill causes, reall and personall) what place then hath the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie?</p>
               <p>The first question will séeme more maruelous and haue more occasion of doubt, when I shall also tell that the lawe is not open at all times, no not the third part of the yeare. But where all other cities and common
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18192:29"/>
wealthes had all the yeare pleas, suites, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, except for certaine holy daies and haruest and vintage, or when for some vrgent cause the lawe was commaunded to be stopped, which is called <hi>Iustitium</hi>: Contrarie in ours, it is but fewe times open. That is onely foure times in the yeare which they call termes. After Michaelmas about ten daies, during fiue or sixe wéekes at the least. After Christmas about a moneth, enduring by the space of thrée wéekes. Then from xvij dayes after Easter by the space of thrée wéekes &amp; odde dayes. Likewise from the sixt or seuenth day after Trinitie sunday, during two wéekes and odde daies. All the rest of the yeare there is no pleading, entring nor pursuing of actions. This small time, and all that but in one place may séeme verse iniurious to the people, who must be faine to suffer much wrong for lacke of Iustice and of place and time to pleade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that héereafter I entende to answere more fully, and in the meane while that shall suffise which the wise <hi>Cato</hi> answered to one who mooued that the pleading place in Rome might be couered ouer with canuas as their theaters were, to the intent that the plaintifes and defendauntes that were there might plead their matters more at ease, and not be in so much danger of their health by the heate of the sunne striking full and open vpon their heades, which was no smal griefe and disease, specially at Rome. Nay (saith <hi>Cato</hi>) for my part I had rather with that all the waies to the place of pleading were cast ouer with galthrops that the féete of such as loue so well pleading, should féele so much paine of those prickes in going thither as their heades doe of the sunne in tarrying there: he ment that they were but idle, whot heades, busie bodies, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some men in the common wealth that did so nourish pleading: good labourers and quiet men could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ende their matters at home by iudgement of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18192:30"/>
their neighbours and kinsfolke without spending so their money vpon procurers and aduocates whom we call attornies, counsellers, Sergeants, and generallie men of lawe. Those be accounted profitable citizens, who attende their honest labour and businesse at home, and not stande waiting and gaping vppon their rolles and processe in the lawe: as for the other by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was no matter what mischiefe they suffered. To the other question of the chancerie, this I answere: That our lawe which is called of vs the common lawe as ye would say <hi>Ius ciuile,</hi> is and standeth vpon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>Ius summum</hi>: and their maximees be taken so straitlie that they may not depart from the tenour of the wordes euen as the olde ciuill lawe was. And therefore as that lacked the helpe of a <hi>Praetor</hi> (which might <hi>moderari illud ius summum,</hi> give actions where none was, mitigate the exactnesse and rigour of the lawe written, give exceptions, as <hi>metus, doli mali, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris aetatis, &amp;c.</hi> for remedies, and maintaine alwaies <hi>aequum &amp; bonum</hi>:) the same order and rancke holdeth our chauncerie, and the chauncellor hath the verie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie héerein as had the <hi>Praeter</hi> in the olde ciuill law before the time of the Emperours. So he that putteth vp his bill in the chauncerie, after that he hath declared the mischiefe wherein he is, hath reléefe as in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <hi>forum.</hi> And for so much as in this case hee is without remedie in the common lawe, therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the chauncellor according to equitie and reason to prouide for him and to take such order as to good conscience shall appertaine. And the court of the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie is called of the common people the court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, because that the chauncellor is not strained by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour or forme of wordes of lawe to iudge but <hi>ex aequo</hi> and <hi>bono,</hi> and according to conscience as I haue saide.

As for other ordinarie rentes of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall landes and most commonly for the taxes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, and subsidies, there be particular receiuers and collectors which doe answere it into the exchequer. The sherife hath vnder him an vnder sherife at his

Lath, and rape I take to be names of seruice, for that so many townes in old time, and in the first pouertie of the Realme did méete together in one day to carrie the Lordes corne into his barne, which is called in olde English a Lath. Or that they mette at commaundement of the Lorde to reape his corne.</p>
               <p>Wapentake I suppose came of the Danes or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture of the Saxons. For that so manie townes came by their orders then, to one place, where was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a mouster of their armour and weapons, in which place from them that could not finde sufficient pledges for their good abearing, their weapons were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: weapen or wapen in olde English doe signifie all armes offensiue, as sworde, dagger, speare, launce, bill,

And whosoever is possessioner and owner of a mannor, may holde from thrée wéekes to thrée wéekes, or at his pleasure of his tennantes and amongest his tennantes a court called a court Baron. And there his tennantes being sworne make a Iurie which is not called the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but the homage. These principallie doe enquire of the copie holders, and other frée holders that be dead sith the last court, and bring in their heires, and next successours, and likewise of incrochment or intrusion of anie of the tennantes against the Lorde, or among themselues. They make orders and lawes amongest themselues, the paine of them if they be after broken, commeth to the Lorde.

and euill orders in alehouses, and tauernes, for punishment of idle and vagabund persons, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally as I haue saide, for the good gouernement of the shire, the Prince putteth his confidence in them. And commonly euery yeare, or each seconde yeare in the beginning of summer or afterwardes, (for in the warme time the people for the most part be more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulie) euen in the calme time of peace, the Prince with his counsell chooseth out certaine articles out of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lawes alreadie made for to represse the pride and euill rule of the popular, and sendeth them downe to the Iustices, willing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looke vpon those pointes, and after they haue mette together and consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, howe to order that matter most wisely and circumspectly, whereby the people might be kept in good order and obedience after the lawe, they diuide themselues by thrée or foure: and so each in his quarter taketh order for the execution of the saide arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And then within certaine space they méete againe and certifie the Prince or his priuie counsell how they do finde the shire in rule &amp; order touching those pointes and all other disorders. There was neuer in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth diuised a more wise, a more dulce and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor a more certaine way to rule the people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are kept alwaies as it were in a bridle of good order, &amp; sooner looked vnto that they should not offend, than punished when they haue offended. For séeing the chiefe amongst them, their rulers to haue this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall charge and doe call vpon it, and if occasion so doe present, one or two presently either punished or sent to prison for disobedience to those olde orders &amp; lawes, they take a feare within themselues, they amende and doe promise more amendment. So that it is as a newe forbushing of the good lawes of the realme, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall repressing of disorders, which doe naturally rest among men. But as the inuention of this, and

This hue and crie from parish to parish is caried, till the théefe or robber be founde.

               <p>The empanelling of this enquest, and the viewe of the bodie, and the giuing of the verdict, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the stréete in an open place, and in <hi>Corona populi:</hi> but I take rather that this name commeth because that the death of euerie subiect by violence is accounted to touch the crowne of the Prince, and to be a detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto it, the Prince accounting that his strength, power, and crowne doth stande and consist in the force of his people, and the maintenaunce of them in securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and peace.</p>

               <head>Of the Constables. CHAP. 22.</head>
               <p>THese men are called in the elder bookes of our lawes of the Realme <hi>custodes pacis,</hi> and were at the first in greater reputation than they be nowe. It may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that there was a credit giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnlike to that which is now giuen to the Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace. To this day if any affraie chaunce to be made, the Constables ought and will charge them that be at debate to kéepe the Princes peace: and whosoeuer refuseth to obey the Constable therein, all the people will set streight vpon him, and by force make him to render himself to be ordered. Likewise if any be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of theft, or receiuing, or of murther, or of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, the Constable may take such persons, yea enter into any mans house with sufficient power to search for such men till he finde them: and if hee sée cause kéepe the suspected persons in the stockes, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie, til he bring them before a Iustice of the peace to be examined. But for so much as euerie litle village hath commonly two Constables,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>One or two Constables, hedboroughes or tithingmen.</hi>
                  </note> and many times ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, labourers and men of small abilitie be chosen vnto that office, who haue no great experience, nor knowledge, nor authoritie, the Constables at this present (although this they may do vppon their owne authoritie) yet they séeme rather to be as it were the executors of the commaundement of the Iustices of peace. For the Iustice of peace as soone as he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by complaint that any man hath stolen, robbed, slaine, or any seruant or labourer without license hath departed out of his maisters seruice, or any that liueth idle and suspectly, knowing once in what parish he is, he writeth to the Constable of the parish, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18192:40"/>
him in the Princes name to bring that man before him: the Constable dareth not disobey. The man is brought and examined by the Iustice, and if the Iustice doe finde cause, hee committeth him to the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable to conuey him further to the Princes gaole, where the partie must lie till the Iustices of peace doe méete either at their quarter sessions, or at their gaole deliuerie, and that the lawe hath either condemned or acquited him. These Constable are called in some places headborowes, in some places tithingmen, and be like to them, who are called Consuls in manie townes and villages in Fraunce. The Constables are commonlie made and sworne at the Léetes of the Lordes, chosen thereto by the homage, and they kéepe that office sometime ij. iij or iiij yeare, more or lesse, as the parish doth agrée. What headborow doth betoken it is easily knowen, our language doth declare him as the head or chiefe of the borowe or village: likewise tithing man is the chiefe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tithing. Constable sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me to come of our old English worde <hi>kinnyng,</hi> which is <hi>Kinnyngstable,</hi> as ye would say a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the king, for such thinges as appertaineth to pleas of the crowne &amp; conseruation of the Kings peace, &amp; as I saide at the first were in some more reputation, approching to that authoritie which the Iustices of peace nowe doth holde.</p>

and crie, partly by information, and partly by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Justices of peace and the Constables, and howe that at the quarter sessions they be indicted, or else by the Coroners yee haue hearde before. Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as yee may perceive by that which is also gone before) is but a former iudgement of xij men which be called enquirers, and no definitiue sentence, but that which in latin is called <hi>praeiudicium,</hi> it doth but shewe what opinion the countrey hath of the malefactor: and therefore commonly men be endicted absent, not called to it, nor knowing of it. For though a man be endicted, yet if when he come to the arainement, there be no man to pursue further, nor no euidence of witnesse or other triall and <hi>indices</hi> against him, he is without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie acquited. No man that is once indicted can be deliuered without arainement. For as xij, haue giuen a preiudice against him, so xii againe must acquite or condemne him. But if the prisoner be not indicted, but sent to prison vpon some suspition or suspitious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and none doe pursue him to the enditement, first being proclaimed thus. <hi>A. B.</hi> prisoner standeth héere at the barre, if any man can say anything against him, let him now speake, for the prisoner standeth at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueraunce; if no man doe then come, hee is deliuered without any further proces or trouble, agréeing first with the gaoler for his fées. And these be called acquited by proclamation. Twise euerie yeare the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in lent what time there is vacation from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Westminster hall, the other is in the vacation in summer. The Prince doth sende downe into euerie shire of Englande certaine of his Iudges of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hall, and some Sergeantes at the lawe with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to heare and determine ioyntly with the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the peace all matters criminall and all prisoners which be in the gaoles. These Iudges doe goe from shire to shire till they haue doone their circuit of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18192:41"/>
shires as be appointed to them for that yeare: at the ende of the terme going before their circuit it is written and set vp in Westminster hall on what day and in what place they will be. That day there mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the Justices of the peace of that shire, the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife of that shire, who for that time beareth their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and asketh after allowance for it in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. The shirife hath readie for criminall causes (as I writ before at the sessions of inquirie) iiii. v. or vi. enquestes readie warned to appeare that day to serue the Prince, and so manie more as he is commaunded to haue readie to go in civill matters betwixt priuate men, which they call <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> because that worde is in the writ.</p>
               <p>In the towne house, or in some open or common place, there is a tribunall or place of iudgement made aloft vpon the highest bench, there sitteth the two Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which be sent downe in Commission in the midst. Next them on eche side, sitteth the Justices of peace, according to their estate and degrée. In a lower bench before them, the rest of the Justices of the peace, and some other gentlemen or their clarkes. Before these Iudges and Justices, there is a table set beneath, at which sitteth the <hi>Custos rotulorum,</hi> or kéeper of writtes, Thexchetor, the vndershirife, and such clarkes as doe write. At the end of that table, there is a barre made with a space for thenquestes and xii. men to come in when they are called, behind that space another barre, and there stand the prisoners which be brought thither by the gaoler all chained one to another. Then the cryer crieth, and commaundeth silence. One of the Iudges briefely telleth the cause of their comming, &amp; giueth a good lesson to the people. Then the prisoners are called for by name, and bidden to aunswere to their names. And when the <hi>Custos rotulorum</hi> hath brought foorth their enditements, the Iudges do name one or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18192:42"/>
two or thrée of the prisoners that are endicted, whom they will haue arraigned. There the clarke speaketh first to one of the prisoners: <hi>A. B.</hi> come to the barre, hold vp thy hand. The clarke goeth on: <hi>A. B.</hi> thou by the name of <hi>A. B.</hi> of such a towne, in such a countie, art endicted, that such a day, in such a place, thou hast stolen with force and armes an horse, which was such ones, of such a colour, to such a valor, and carried him away feloniously, &amp; contrarie to the peace of our soueraigne Ladie the Quéene. What sayest thou to it, art thou guiltie or not guiltie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he will not aunswere, or not aunswere directly guiltie or not guiltie, after he hath béene once or twise so interrogated, he is iudged mute, that is dumme by contumacie, and his condemnation is to be pressed to death, which is one of the cruellest deathes that may be: he is layd vpon a table, and an other vppon him, and so much weight of stones or lead laide vppon that table, while as his bodie be crushed, &amp; his life by that violence taken from him. This death some strong &amp; stout hearted man doth choose, for being not condemned of felonie, his bloud is not corrupted, his lands nor goods confiscate to the Prince, which in all cases of felonie are commonly lost from him and his heires, if he be foreiudged, that is condemned for a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon by the lawe. If he confesse the enditement to be true, then when he is arraigned, no xii, men goeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, there resteth but the Iudges sentence, of the paine of death.</p>
               <p>If he pleade not guiltie, as commonly all théeues, robbers, &amp; murtherers doe, though they haue confessed the fact before the Justice of the peace that examined them, though they be taken with the maner, which in Latine they call <hi>inflagranti crimine,</hi> howesoever it be, if he pleade there not guiltie, the Clarke asketh him howe he will be tryed, and telleth him he must saie, by God and the Countrie, for these be the words formall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18192:42"/>
of this triall after Inditement, and where the Prince is partie: if the prisoner doe say so, I will be tryed by God and the Countrie, then the Clarke replyeth, Thou hast béene endicted of such a crime, &amp;c. Thou hast pleaded not guiltie: being asked how thou wilt be tryed, thou hast aunswered by God and by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Loe these honest men that be come here, be in the place and stead of the Countrie: and if thou hast any thing to say to any of them, looke vpon them well and nowe speake, for thou standest vpon thy life &amp; death. Then calleth he in the first Juror, <hi>B. C.</hi> come to the booke, and so giueth him an othe to goe uprightlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prince and the prisoner, &amp;c. If the prisoner obiecteth nothing against him, he calleth an other, and so an other, till there be xii. or aboue: and for the most part the prisoner can say nothing against them, for they are chosen but for that day, and are vnknowen to him, nor they know not him, as I said being substantial yeomen, that dwell about the place, or at the least in the hundred, or néere where the felonie is supposed to be committed, men acquainted with daily labour and trauaile, and not with such idle persons, as be readie to doe such mischiefes.</p>
               <p>When the enquest is full, and the prisoner hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected nothing against them, as in déede seldome he doeth, for the cause aboue rehearsed: The clarke saith to the cryer, <hi>countes,</hi> (in French as ye would say rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) and so nameth all those that be on the quest. The crier at euerie name cryeth aloude, one, then ij. iij. iiij. and so till the number be full of xii. or more, &amp; then saith good men and true: and then sayth aloude: If any can give euidence, or can saie any thing against the prisoner, let him come nowe, for he standeth vpon his deliuerance. If no man come in, then the Iudge as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth who sent him to prison, who is commonly one of the Justices of peace. He if he be there deliuereth vp the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18192:43"/>
examination which he tooke of him, and vnderneath the names of those whom he hath bound to giue euidence, although the malefactor hath confessed the crime to the Iustice of the peace, and that appeare by his hande and confirmation, the xij. men will acquite the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but they which should giue euidence pay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizaunce. Howbeit this doth seldome chaunce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in small matters, and where the Iustices of peace, who sent the prisoner to the gaole, is away. If they which be bound to giue euidence come in, first is read the examination, which the Iustice of peace doeth giue in: then is heard (if he be there) the man robbed what he can say, being first sworne to say trueth, and after the Constable, and as many as were at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the malefactor: and so many as can say any thing being sworn one after an other to say truth. These be set in such a place as they may sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges and the Iustices, the enquest and the prisoner, &amp; heare them, and be heard of them all. The Iudge first after they be sworne, asketh first the partie robbed, if he knowe the prisoner, and biddeth him looke vpon him: he saith yea, the prisoner sometime saith nay. The partie pursuiuaunt giueth good ensignes <hi>verbi gratia,</hi> I knowe thée well ynough, thou robbedst me in such a place, thou beatest mée, thou tookest my horse from mée, and my purse, thou hadst then such a coate and such a man in thy companie: the théefe will say no, and so they stand a while in altercation, then he telleth al that he can say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after him likewise all those who were at the apprehension of the prisoner, or who can giue any <hi>indices</hi> or tokens which we call in our language euidence against the malefactor. When the Iudge hath heard them say inough, he asketh if they can say any more: if they say no, then he turneth his spéeche to the enquest. Good men (saith he) ye of the enquest, ye haue heard what these men say against the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18192:43"/>
prisoner, you haue also heard what the prisoner can say for himselfe, haue an eye to your othe, and to your duetie, &amp; doe that which God shall put in your mindes to the discharge of your consciences, and marke well what is saide. Thus sometime with one enquest is passed to the number of ij, or iij. prisoners: For if they should be charged with more, the inquest will say, my Lord, we pray you charge vs with no more, it is y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our memorie. Many times they are charged but with one or two. At their departing, they haue in writing nothing giuen them, but the enditement, the clarke repeating to them the effect of it, and shewing more, that if they finde him guiltie, they shall enquire what goods, lands, and tenements, the saide person had at the time of the felonie committed: and if they finde any, they shal bring it in: if no, they shal say so. If they finde him not guiltie, they shall enquire whether he fled for the felonie or no.</p>
               <p>And there is a bailife to waite vpon them, and to sée that no man doe speake with them, and that they haue neither bread, drinke, meate, ne fire brought to them, but there to remaine in a chamber together till they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. If they be in doubt of any thing that is saide, or would heare againe some of them that giue euidence to interrogate them more at full, or if any that can giue euidence come late: it is permitted that any that is sworne to say the trueth, may be interrogated of them to enforme their consciences. This is to be vnderstood although it will séeme straunge to all nations that doe vse the ciuill Lawe of the Romane Emperours, that for life and death there is nothing put in writing but the enditement onely. All the rest is doone openlie in the presence of the Iudges, the Iustices, the enquest, the prisoner, and so manie as will or can come so neare as to heare it, and all depositions and witnesses giuen aloude, that all men may heare from the mouth of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18192:44"/>
depositors and witnesses what is saide. As of this, so is it of all other prisoners after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same sort. By that time that the enquests for the prisoners be dispatched, it is commonlie dinner time, the Iudges and Iustices goe to dinner, and after dinner returne to the same place: if the enquest be not readie for the prisoners, they goe to some other enquests of <hi>nisiprius,</hi> which be ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and priuate to driue out the time. The enquests haue no sooner agréed vpon their charge one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but they tell the Bailife, and pray to be heard, and considering that they be themselues all this while as prisoners as I saide before, it is no maruell, though they make expedition. The prisoners be sent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the barre, the enquest which hath agréed, is called for eche one of the Iurie by his name, to which he answereth. Then the clarke asketh if they be agréed, and who shall speake for them. One or moe saith yea. He that speaketh for them all is called the foreman, and commonlie it is he that is first sworne: then the prisoner is bidden to holde vp his hande. The clarke saith vnto him, Thou art endicted by the name of <hi>A.</hi> of such a place, &amp;c. being therefore arraigned thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thereto not guiltie, being asked howe thou would be tryed, thou saydst by God and thy countrie. These honest men were giuen to thee by God &amp; thy Prince for thy Countrey: Hearken what they say. Then he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the enquest, what say you? Is he guiltie or not guiltie? The foreman maketh aunswere in one worde, guiltie, or in two, not guiltie: the one is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the other acquiteth the prisoner. So that neither Iudge nor Iustice hath to doe, or can reuerse, alter or chaunge that matter, if they say guiltie. The clarke asketh what landes, tenements, or goods, the prisoner had at the time of the felonie committed, or at any time after. Commonlie it is aunswered that they knowe not, nor it shall not greatly néede, for the Sherife is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18192:44"/>
diligent enough to enquire of that, for the Prince and his owne aduantage, and so is the excheator also.</p>
               <p>Of him whom the xij. men pronounce guiltie, the Iudge asketh what he can say for himselfe: if he can reade, demaundeth his Clergie. For in many felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as in theft of oxen, shéepe, money, or other such things which be no open robberies, by the high way side, nor assaulting one by night in his house, putting him that is there in feare, such is the fauour of our Lawe, that for the first fault the felon shalbe admitted to his Clergie, for which purpose the Bishop must send one with authoritie vnder his seale to be Iudge in that matter at euerie gaole deliuerie. If the condemned man demandeth to be admitted to his booke, the Iudge commonly giueth him a Psalter, and turneth to what place he will. The prisoner readeth as well as he can (God knoweth sometime very slenderly:) then he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Bishops commissarie, <hi>legit vt clericus?</hi> The commissarie must say <hi>legit</hi> or <hi>non legit,</hi> for these be wordes formall, and our men of Lawe be very precise in their words formall. If he say <hi>legit,</hi> the Iudge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth no further to sentence of death: if he say <hi>non,</hi> the Iudge foorthwith, or the next day procéedeth to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which is doone by word of mouth onelie: Thou <hi>A.</hi> hast béene endicted of such a felonie and thereof ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, thou hast pleaded not guiltie, and put thy selfe vpon God and thy Countrie, they haue found thée guiltie, thou hast nothing to say for thy selfe, the Lawe is, thou shalt first returne to the place from whence thou camest, from thence thou shalt goe to the place of execution, there thou shalt hang till thou be dead. Then he saith to the Sherife, Sherife doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: he that claimeth his Clergie, is burned forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the presence of the Iudges in the brawne of his hand with a hot yron marked with the letter <hi>T.</hi> for a théefe, or <hi>M.</hi> for a mansleer, in cases where Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie

Attempting to impoison a man, or laying await to kill a man, though he wound him daungerously, yet if death followe not, is no fellony by the lawe of Englande, for the Prince hath lost no man, and life ought to be giuen we say, but for life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And againe, when a man is murdered, all be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals and shall die, euen he that doth but hold the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del to giue light to the murderers. For mitigation and moderation of paines, is but corruption of Iudges as we thinke. Likewise, torment or question which is vsed by the order of the ciuill lawe and custome of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countreis to put a malefactor to excessiue paine, to make him confesse of him selfe, or of his fellowes or complices, is not vsed in England, it is taken for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile. For what can he serue the common wealth after as a frée man, who hath his bodie so haled and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if he be not found guiltie, and what amends can be made him? And if he must die, what crueltie is it so to torment him before? Likewise, confession by torment is estéemed for nothing, for if he confesse at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the tryall of the xij. goeth not vpon him: If he denie, the fact, that which he said before hindereth him not. The nature of English men is to neglect death, to abide no torment: And therefore he will confesse rather to haue done any thing, yea, to haue killed his own father, than to suffer torment, for death our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not so much estéem as a mean torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In no place shal you sée malefactors go more constantly, more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, &amp; with lesse lamentation to their death than in England. Againe, the people not accustomed to sée such cruell torments, will pitie the person tormented and

abhorre the Prince and the Iudges, who should bring in such crueltie amongst them, and the xij. men the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absolue him. There is an olde lawe of England, that if any gaoler shall put any prisoner being in his custodie to any torment, to the intent to make him an approuer, that is to saie an accuser or <hi>Index</hi> of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, the gaoler shall dye therefore as a felon. And to say the trueth, to what purpose is it to vse torment? For whether the malefactor confesse or no, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he saith, if the enquest of xij. do find him guiltie, he dyeth therefore without delaye. And the malefactour, séeing there is no remedie, and that they be his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men, and such as he hath himselfe agreed vnto it, do finde them worthie death, yéeldes for the most part vnto it, and doeth not repine, but doth acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate him selfe to aske mercie of God. The nature of our nation is frée, stout, haulte, prodigall of life and bloud: but contumelie, beatings, seruitude and seruile torment &amp; punishment it will not abide. So in this nature and fashion, our auncient Princes and legislators haue nourished them, as to make them stout hearted, coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and souldiers, not villaines and slaues, and that is the scope almost of all our policie. The xij. as soone as they haue giuen their verdict are dismissed to goe whither they will, and haue no manner commoditie &amp; profit of their labour and verdict, but onely do seruice to the Prince and commonwealth.</p>

There is plaints heard of riots. Riot is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our English terme or speache, where any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is assembled with force to doe any thing: and it had the beginning, because that our being much accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18192:50"/>
either in foreine wars, in Fraunce, Scotland, or Ireland, or being ouermuch exercised with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres within the Realme (which is the fault that falleth ordinarily amongest bellicous nations) whereby men of warre, Captaines and souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come plentifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which when they haue no externe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice wherewith to occupie their buisie heads &amp; handes accustomed to fight and quarell, must néedes séeke qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and contentions amongest themselues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so readie to oppresse right among their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as they were woont before with praise of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, to be in resisting iniurie offered by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. So that our nation vsed hereunto, &amp; vpon that more insolent at home, and not easie to be gouerned by Lawe and politike order, men of power beginning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fraies, and the stronger by factions and parties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering too much iuiurie to the weaker, were occasions of making good Lawes. First of reteiners, that no man should haue aboue a number in his Liuerie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: then of the enquirie of routs and riots at euerie Sessions, and of the lawe whereby it is prouided that if any by force or by riot enter vpon any possessions, the Iustices of the peace shal assemble themselues &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the force, &amp; within certain time enquire thereof. And further, because such things are not commonlie done by meane men, but by such as be of power &amp; force, &amp; be not to be dealt withal of euerie man, nor of meane Gentlemen: if the riot be found &amp; certified to the Kings Counsell, or if otherwise it be complained of, the partie is sent for,<note place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18192:51"/>
and of those chiefe personages of Englande, one after an other handeling him on that sort, that what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage soever he hath, his heart will fall to the grounde, and so much the more, when if he make not his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the better, as seldome he can in so open violence, he shalbe commaunded to the Fléete, where he shall be kept in prison in such sort as these Iudges shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him, lie there till he be wearie aswell of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of his libertie, as of the great expences, which he must there sustaine, and for a time be forgotten, whiles after long suite of his friendes, he will be glad to be ordered by reason. Sometime as his deserts be, he payeth a great fine to the Prince, besides great costs and dammages to the partie, and yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherefore he attempteth this riot and violence is remitted to the common lawe.

So that to be a gardian or tutor was accounted among them to be a charge or trouble, a thing subiect to much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbraunce and small profite, so that diuerse meanes were sought for, to excuse men from it. With vs this is cleane contrarie, for it is reckoned a profite to haue a warde. For the Lorde of whom the warde doeth hold the land, so soone as by the death of the father the childe falleth warde vnto him, he seaseth vpon the body of the ward and his landes, of which (so that he doeth nourish the ward,) he taketh the profite without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18192:52"/>
and beside that offering to his ward couena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mariage without dispergement before the age of xxl. yeres if it be a man, or xiiii. if it be a woman. If the ward refuse to take that mariage, he or she must pay the value of the mariage, which is commonly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the profite of his landes. All this while I speake of that which is called in French <hi>garde noble,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardian in cheualry, and gardian in Socage.</hi>
                  </note> that is of such as holde lands of other, by knight seruice, for that is an other kinde of seruice which we call in Frenche <hi>gard returier,</hi> we call it gard in socage, that is of such as doe not holde by knight seruice, but by tenure of the plough. This wardship falleth to him who is next of the kinne, and cannot inherite the land of the warde as the vncle by the mothers side, if the land doe discend by the father and of the fathers side, if the lande discend by the mother. This gardian is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the reuenues and profites of the land, as the tutor by the ciuill Lawe to the warde or pupill so soone as he is of full age.</p>
               <p>The man is not out of wardshippe by our lawe till xxj. yere olde, from thence he is reckoned of full age, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as in the Romane lawes at xxv. The woman at xiiij. is out of warde, for shée may haue an husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe knightes seruice say our bookes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our wiues be in the power (as I shall tell you hereafter) of their husbands, it is no reason, she should be in two diuerse gards.</p>
               <p>Many men doe estéeme this wardship by knightes seruice very vnreasonable and vniust, and contrarie to nature, that a Fréeman and Gentleman should be bought and solde like an horse or an oxe, and so change gardians as masters and lordes: at whose gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely his bodie but his landes and his houses should be, to be wasted and spent without accounts, and then to marie at the will of him, who is his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lorde, or his will who hath bought him, to such as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18192:52"/>
he like not peraduenture, or else to pay so great a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. This is the occasion they say, why many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen be so euil brought vp touching vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and but onely in deintinesse and pleasure: and why they be maried very young and before they bee wife, and many times do not greatly loue their wiues. For when the father is dead, who hath the natural care of his childe, not the mother, nor the vnckle, nor the next of kinne, who by all reason would haue most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall care to the bringing vp of the infant and <hi>minor,</hi> but the Lorde of whom he holdeth his land in knights seruice, be it the King or Quéene, Duke, Marquesse, or any other, hath the gouernement of his bodie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or else who that bought him at the first, second or thirde hande. The Prince as hauing so many, must néedes giue or sell his wardes away to other, and so he doeth. Other doe but séeke which way they may make most aduauntage of him, as of an oxe or other beast. These all (say they,) haue no naturall care of the infant, but of their owne gaine, and especially the buyer will not suffer his warde to take any great paines, either in studie, or any other hardenesse, least he should be sicke and die, before he hath maried his daughter, sister or cousin, for whose sake he bought him: and then all his money which he paide for him should be lost. So he, who had a father, which kept a good house,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>But the Lorde shalbe puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for the wast, by losse of the ward: or treble dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, if that suffice not.</hi>
                  </note> and had all things in order to maintaine it, shall come to his owne, after he is out of wardshippe, woods decayed, houses fallen downe, stocke wasted and gone, land let foorth and plowed to the baren, and to make amends, shall pay yet one yeres rent for reliefe and sue <hi>ouster le maind,</hi> beside other charges, so that not of manie yeres and peraduenture neuer he shall be able to recouer, and come to the estate where his father left it. This as it is thought was first graunted vpon a great extremitie to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 3. for a time
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18192:53"/>
vpon the warre which he had with his Barons, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, increased, and multiplied to more and more persons and grieuances, and will be the decay of the nobilitie and libertie of England, Other againe say, the ward hath no wrong. For eyther his father pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the lande, or it did discend vnto him from his auncesters with this charge. And because he holdeth by knightes seruice, which is in armes and defence, séeing that by age he cannot doe that whereto hee is bound by his lande, it is reason he aunswere that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to the Lorde, whereby he may haue as able a man to doe the seruice. The first knights in Rome, those that were chosen <hi>equites Romani,</hi> had <hi>equum publicum</hi> on which they serued, and that was at the charge of widowes and wards, as appeareth by <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> because that those persons could not doe bodilie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the common wealth. Wherfore this is no newe thing, but thought reasonable in that most wise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and to the prudent King <hi>Seruius Tullius.</hi> As for the education of our common wealth, it was at the first <hi>militaire,</hi> and almost in all things the scope and deseigne thereof is <hi>militaire.</hi> Yet was it thought most like, that noble men, good knights, and great captaines would bring up their wards in their owne feates and vertues, and then mary them into like rase and stocke where they may finde and make friendes, who can better looke to the education or better skill of of the bringing vp of a gentleman, than he who for his higher nobilitie hath such a one to holde of him by knights seruice, or would doe it better than he that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth or may claime such seruice of his ward, when age and yeres will make him able to doe it. That which is saide that this maner of wardship began in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 3. cannot séeme true. For in Normandie and other places of Fraunce the same order is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18192:53"/>And that statute made in King <hi>Henrie</hi> the thirds time touching wards, to him that will wey it wel, may séeme rather a qualification of that matter, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the fashion of wardship was long before: but of this matter an other time shall be more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to dispute. This may suffice to declare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</p>

               <p>THe wiues in Englande be as I saide <hi>in potestate maritorum,</hi> not that the husbande hath <hi>vitae ac necis potestatem,</hi> as the Romans had in the olde time of their children, for that is onely in the power of the Prince, and his lawes, as I haue saide before, but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they haue before mariage, as soone as mariage is solemnished is their husbandes, I meane of money, plate, iuelles, cattaile, and generally all moueables. For as for lande and heritage followeth the succession, and is ordered by the lawe as I shall say héereafter: and what soever they gette after mariage, they get to their husbands. They neither can giue nor sell anie thing either of their husbandes, or their owne. Theirs no moueable thing is by the law of England <hi>constanti matrimonio,</hi> but as <hi>peculium serui aut filijfamilias:</hi> and yet in moueables at the death of her husbande she can claime nothing, but according as hee shall will by his Testament, no more than his sonne can: all the rest is in the disposition of the executors if he die testate. Yet in London and other great cities they haue that lawe and custome, that when a man dieth, his goods be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into thrée partes. One thirde is imployed vppon the buriall and the bequestes which the testator ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his testament. An other thirde part the wife
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18192:54"/>
hath as her right, and the thirde third part is the dewe and right of his children, equally to be diuided among them. So that a man there can make testament but of one thirde of his goods: if he die interstate, the funerals deducted the goods be equally diuided betwéene the wife and the children.</p>
               <p>By the common lawe of Englande if a man die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate, the Ordinarie (which is the Bishoppe by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intendment) sometime the Archdeacon, Dean, or Prebendarie by preuiledge and prescription, doeth commit the administration of the goods to the widowe or the child, or next kinsman of the dead, appointing out portions to such as naturally it belongeth vnto, and the Ordinarie by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnderstanding hath such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and discretion as shalbe méete for so absolute an authoritie for the most part, following such diuision as is vsed in London, either by thirdes or halfes. Our forefathers newely conuerted to the Christian faith had such confidence in their pastors &amp; instructours, and tooke them to be men of such conscience that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that matter to their discretion, and belike at the first they were such as would séeke no priuate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to themselues thereby, that being once so ordeined hath still so continued. The abuse which hath followed was in part redressed by certaine actes of parliament made in the time of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, touching the probate of testamentes committing of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; mortuaries. But to turne to the matter which we nowe haue in hande, the wife is so much in the power of her husband, that not onely her goods by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are streight made her husbandes, and she looseth all her administration which she had of them: but also where all English men haue name and surname, as the Romans had, <hi>Marcus Tullius, Caius Pompeius, Caius Iulius,</hi> whereof the name is giuen to vs at the font, the surname is the name of the gentilitie and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18192:54"/>
stocke which the sonne doth take of the father alwaies, as the olde Romans did, our daughters so soone as they be maried loose the surname of their father, and of the family and stocke whereof they doe come, and take the surname of their husbands, as transplanted from their family into an other. So that if my wife was called before <hi>Philippe Wilford</hi> by her owne name and her fathers surname, as soone as she is maried to me she is no more called <hi>Philippe Wylford,</hi> but <hi>Philippe Smith,</hi> and so must she write and signe: and as she changeth husbandes, so she chaungeth surnames, called alwaies by the surname of her last husbande. Yet if a woman once marrie a Lorde or a Knight by which occasion she is called my Ladie with the surname of her husbande,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>She is no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by the law although so called of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisie.</hi>
                  </note> if he die and she take a husbande of a meaner estate by whom she shall not be called Ladie (such is the honour we doe giue to women) she shall still be called Ladie with the surname of her first husbande and not of the seconde.</p>
               <p>I thinke among the olde Romans those marriages which were made <hi>per coemptionem in manum</hi> and <hi>per aes</hi> and <hi>libram</hi> made the wife <hi>in manu &amp; potestate viri,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of also we had in our olde lawe and ceremonies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a certaine memorie as a viewe and <hi>vestigium.</hi> For the woman at the Church dore was giuen of the father or some other man next of her kinne into the handes of the husbande, and he layde downe golde and siluer for her vpon the booke, as though he did buy her, the priest belike was in stéede of <hi>Lipripeus:</hi> our mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages be estéemed perfect by the law of England, when they be solemnished in the Church or Chappell, in the presence of the priest and other witnesses. And this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh both the husbande and the wife capable of all the benefites which our lawe both giue vnto them and their lawefull children. In so much that if I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the widowe of one lately dead, which at the time
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18192:55"/>
of her husbandes death was with childe, if the childe be borne after mariage solemnished with me, this childe shalbe my heire, and is accounted my lawefull sonne, not his whose childe it is in deede, so precisely wee doe take the letter where it is saide, <hi>pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant.</hi> Those waies and meanes which <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> doth declare to make bastardes to be lawefull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>muliers</hi> or rather <hi>melieurs</hi> (for such a terme our lawe vseth for them which be lawefull children) be of no effect in England, neither the Pope nor Emperour, nor the Prince himselfe neuer could there legittimate a bastarde to enioy any benefitte of our lawe, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath onely that power.</p>
               <p>Although the wife be (as I haue written before) <hi>in manu &amp; potestate mariti,</hi> by our lawe yet they be not kept so streit as in mew and with, a garde as they be in Italy and Spaine, but haue almost as much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as in Fraunce, and they haue for the most part all the charge of the house and houshoulde (as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> the wiues of the Gréekes had in their time) which is in déede the naturall occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, exercise, office and part of a wife. The husband to meddle with the defence either by lawe or force, and with all forren matters which is the naturall part and office of the man, as I haue written before. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our lawe may séeme somewhat rigorous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wiues, yet for the most part they can handle their husbandes so well and so doulcely and specially when their husbands be sicke: that where the lawe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them nothing, their husbandes at their death of their good will giue them all. And fewe there be that be not made at the death of their husbandes either sole or chiefe executrixes of his last wil and testament, and haue for the most part the gouernement of the children and their portions: except it be in London, where a peculiar order is taken by the citie much after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

               <head>Of Bondage and Bondmen. CHAP. 8.</head>
               <p>AFter that we haue spoken of all the sortes of frée men according to the diuersitie of their estates and persons, it resteth to say somewhat of bondmen which were called <hi>serui,</hi> which kinde of people &amp; the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them and about them doth occupie the most part of <hi>Iustinians</hi> Digestes, and Code. The Romans had two kindes of bondmen, the one which were called <hi>serui,</hi> and they were either which were bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, taken in warre, left by succession, or purchased by other kinde and lawefull acquisition, or else borne of their bonde women and called <hi>vernae</hi>: all those kinde of bondmen be called in our lawe villens in grosse, as ye would say immediatly bonde to the person and his heires. An other they had as appeareth in <hi>Iustinians</hi> time, which they called <hi>adscripticij glebae</hi> or <hi>agri censiti.</hi> These were not bond to the person, but to the mannor
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18192:57"/>
or place, and did followe him who had the manors, &amp; in our lawe are called villaines regardants, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be as members, or belonging to the manor or place. Neither of the one sort nor of the other haue we any number in England. And of the first I neuer knewe any in the realme in my time: of the seconde so fewe there be, that it is not almost worth the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But our lawe doth acknowledge them in both those sortes. Manumission of all kinde of villaines or bondmen in Englande is vsed and done after diuerse sortes, and by other and more light and easie meanes than is prescribed in the ciuil lawe, and being once manumitted, he is not <hi>libertus manumittentis,</hi> but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>liber:</hi> howbeit sith our Realme hath receiued the Christian religion which maketh vs all in Christ bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and in respect of God and Christ <hi>conseruos,</hi> men began to haue conscience to hold in captiuitie and such extreme bondage him whome they must acknowledge to be his brother, and as we vse to terme him Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that is who looketh in Christ and by Christ to haue equall portion with them in the Gospel and saluation. Vpon this scruple, in continuance of time, and by long succession, the holie fathers, Munkes and Friers in their confession, and specially in their extreme &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sicknesses, burdened the consciences of them whom they had vnder their hands: so that temporall men by little and litle by reason of that terror in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were glad to manumit all their villaines: but the said holie fathers, with the Abbots and Priors, did not in like sort by theirs, for they had also conscience to impouerish and dispoyle the Churches so much as to manumit such as were bond to their Churches, or to the mannors which the Church had gotten, and so kept theirs still. The same did the Bishoppes also till at the last and now of late some Bishoppes to make a péece of money manumitted theirs partly for argent, partly for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18192:57"/>
slaunders, that they séemed more cruell than the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie: after the monasteries comming into temporall mens handes haue béene occasion that now they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all manumitted. The most part of bondmen when they were, yet were not vsed with vs so cruelly nor in that sort as the bondmen at the Romane ciuill law, as appeareth by their Comedies, nor as in Gréece as appeareth by theirs: but they were suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy coppieholde lande to gaine and get as other serues that nowe and then their Lordes might fléese them and take a péece of money of them, as in France the Lords doe taile them whom they call their subiectes at their pleasure, and cause them to pay such summes of money as they liſt to put vpon them. I thinke both in France and England the chaunge of religion to a more gentle, humane and more equall sort (as the christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as in respectes of the Gentiles) caused this olde kinde of seruile seruitude and slauerie to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that moderation, for necessitie first to villaines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardants, and after to seruitude of landes and tenures, and by litle and litle finding out more ciuill and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meanes and more equall to haue that doone which in time of heathenesse seruitude or bondage did, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished the whole. For although all persons christians be brethren by baptisme in Iesu Christ, and therefore may appeare equally frée: yet some were and still might be christianed being bond and serue, and whom as the baptisme did find so it did leaue them, for it chaungeth not ciuill lawes nor compactes amongest men which be not contrarie to Gods lawes, but rather maintaineth them by obedience.

               <p>This perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I say of Christians not to make nor kéepe his brother in Christ, seruile, bond and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for euer vnto him, as a beast rather than as a man, and the humanitie which the Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth teache, hath engendered through Realmes not néere to Turkes and Barbarians, a doubt, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and scruple to haue seruants and bondmen: yet necessitie on both sides, of the one to haue helpe, on the other to haue seruice, hath kept a figure or fashion thereof. So that some would not haue bondmen, but <hi>ascripticij glebae,</hi> and villaines regardant to the ground, to the intent their seruice might be furnished, and that the countrie being euill, vnwholsome, and other wise barren, should not be desolate. Others afterwardes found out the wayes and meanes, that not the men but the land should be bound and bring with it such bondage and seruice to him that occupieth it, as to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

the Lordes dung vnto the fieldes, to plough his ground at certaine daies, sowe, reape, come to his Court, sweare faith vnto him, and in the ende to holde the lande but by copie of the Lords court rolle, and at the will of the Lord. This tenure is called also in our lawe, villaine, bonde, or seruile tenure: yet to consider more déepely all lande, euen that which is called most frée lande, hath a bondage annexed vnto it, not as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the lower ground, must suffer and receiue the water and filth which falleth from the higher ground, nor such as <hi>Iustinian</hi> speaketh of <hi>de seruitudinibus praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum rusticorum &amp; vrbanorum,</hi> but the lande doeth bring a certaine kind of seruitude to the prossessor. For no man holdeth land simply frée in Englande, but he or she that holdeth the Crowne of Englande: all others holde their land in fée, that is vpon a faith or trust, and some seruice to be done to an other Lorde of a mannor as his superior, and he againe of an higher Lorde, till it come to the Prince &amp; him that holdeth the Crowne. So that if a man die, and it be found that he hath land which he holdeth, but of whom no man can tell, this is vnderstoode to be holden of the Crowne, and in capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is much like to knights seruice, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto it thrée seruices, homage, ward and mariage: That is, he shall sweare to be his man, and to be true vnto him of whom he holdeth the lande. His sonne who holdeth the land after the death of his father, shall be maried where it pleaseth the Lorde. He that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the lande most freely of a temporall man (for franke almose and franke mariage hath an other cause and nature) holdeth by fealtie onely, which is, he shal sweare to be true to the Lorde, and doe such seruice as appertaineth for the land which he holdeth of the Lord. So that all frée lande in Englande is holden in fée or <hi>feodo,</hi> which is asmuch to say as in <hi>fide</hi> or <hi>fiducia:</hi> That is, in trust and confidence, that he shall be true to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18192:59"/>
Lorde of whom he holdeth it, pay such rents, doe such seruice, and obserue such conditions as was annexed to the first donation. Thus all sauing the Prince be not <hi>viri domini,</hi> but rather <hi>fiduciary domini,</hi> &amp; <hi>possessores:</hi> This is a more likely interpretation than that which Litleton doeth put in his booke,<note place="margin">

               <p>An other kinde of seruitude or bondage is vsed in Englande for the necessitie thereof, which is called apprenticehoode.

And the pactions agréed vpon, be put in writing, signed and sealed by the parties, and registred for more assurance: without being such an apprentice in London, and seruing out such a serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the same Citie for the number of yéeres agréed vpon, by order of the Citie amongest them, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer so much borne in London, and of parentes londoners is admitted to be a Citizen or frée man of London: the like is vsed in other great Cities of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande. Besides apprentises, others be hired for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and be called seruaunts or seruing men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men throughout the whole Realme, which be not in such bondage as apprentises, but serue for the time for daily ministrie, as <hi>serui</hi> and <hi>ancillae</hi> did in the time of gentilitie, and be for other matters in libertie as full frée men and women.</p>
               <p>But all seruaunts, labourers and others not mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must serue by the yere: and if he be in couenaunt, he may not depart out of his seruice without his masters licence, and he must give his master warning that he will depart one quarter of a yere before the terme of the yere expireth, or else he shalbe compelled to serue out an other yere. And if any young man vnmaried be without seruice, he shalbe compelled to get him a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18192:60"/>
whom he must serue for that yere, or else he shalbe punished with stockes and whipping as an idlè vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond. And if any man maried or vnmaried, not hauing rent or liuing sufficient to maintaine himselfe, doe liue so idely, he is enquired of, and sometime sent to the gaole, sometime otherwise punished as a sturdie vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond: so much our policie doth abborre idlenesse. This is one of the chiefe charges of the Iustices of peace in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Shire. It is taken for vngentlenesse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and a shewe of enmitie, if any gentleman doe take an other gentlemans seruaunt (although his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath put him away) without some certificate from his master eyther by word or writing, that he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him of his seruice. That which is spoken of men seruaunts, the same is also spoken of women ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. So that all youth that hath not sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues to maintaine it selfe, must néeds with vs serue, and that after an order as I haue written.

               <p>THe Archebishops and Bishops haue a certaine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar iurisdiction vnto them especially in foure maner of causes: Testamentes and legations, Tythes and mortuaries, mariage and adulterie or fornication, and also of such things as appertaine to orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest themselues and matters concerning religion. For as it doeth appeare, our auncestors hauing the common wealth before ordeined &amp; set in frame, when they did agree to receiue the true and Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which was established before, and concerned externe policie (which their Apostles, Doctors and Preachers did allowe) they helde and kept still with that which they brought in of newe. And those things in kéeping whereof they made conscience, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them to be ordered and gouerned as such things, as of which they had no skill, as to men in whom for the holinesse of their life and good conscience, they had a great and sure confidence. So those matters be ordered in their Courts, and after the fashion and maner of the lawe ciuil or rather common by citation, libel, <hi>contestationem litis,</hi> examination of witnesses pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilie, by exceptions, replications apart and in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, allegations, matters by sentences giuen in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by appellations from one to an other as well a <hi>grauamine</hi> as <hi>a sententia definitiua,</hi> and so they haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names, as Proctor, Aduocates, Assessors, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Commissaries, &amp;c. farre from the manner of our order in the common lawe of Englande, and from that fashion which I haue shewed you before.
