            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Translator's Preface.</head>
            <p>THere are Two Popular Objections common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made against Abridgments, which I shall endeavour to answer one after the other: The first is, That they have occasion'd the Loss of the greater Volumes from whence they were extracted. Thus, for instance, the Loss of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> is imputed to <hi>Justin;</hi> that of <hi>Livy</hi> to <hi>Florus</hi> or his Epitomator; and <hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who flourish'd about the middle of the Eleventh Century, is charged with depriving the world of <hi>Dion Cassius.</hi> Nay, the Loss of all the Texts and Decisions of the Learned Lawyers before him, is attributed to <hi>Trebonian,</hi> who compiled his Pandects out of them. This Notion was started by some Learned Men of the last Age, as <hi>Bodin, Casaubon,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Bacon;</hi> and since their time, merely, I suppose, upon their Credit and Authority, it has been almost universally received, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Examination. However, with a due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission be it spoken to Persons of their deserved E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and Reputation in the world, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade my self, that this Accusation is well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; for besides that we have the Misfortune
<pb facs="tcp:95582:3"/>
to regret the want of several useful Books, which as far as we know were never abbreviated, such as <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius Halicarnas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus;</hi> and on the other hand enjoy several others that were Epitomized, as we find the History of <hi>Herodotus</hi> is still extant, altho one <hi>Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> whom <hi>Suidas</hi> mentions, had made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of it; both which Instances are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to overthrow this precarious Hypothesis; yet in my opinion there are so many better Reasons to be assigned for the Loss of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se precious Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity, that I am apt to flatter my self it will be no disagreeable Entertainment to the Reader to give him a short View of them. Before the <hi>Art of Printing</hi> was discover'd, it may easily be imagined, That as Volumes of any considerable Bulk were infinitely more Expensive than now they are, so they could only be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by men of Plentiful Fortunes; that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they were nothing near so well diffused; and when they happen'd to be lost or impaired by ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, the Loss was neither so soon, nor so easily rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uited. If to this we add, That in that part of the world which had formerly been the Seat of all Arts and Sciences, Learning began to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, if not despised; and that from another part of it vast Inundations of Barbarous People were continually pouring down, who swept away every thing before them; no considering man I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will find it strange, That amidst the vast Treasures of the Ancient Ages, so few should escape so general a Shipwrack, and arrive safe to our hands. That this was the case of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95582:3"/>
Empire in its declining Period, no body that is not utterly unacquainted with their History, will presume to question. As soon as that Vigorous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which animated thrir Republic, had wholly abandon'd them, Learning and Learned Men made but a very inconsiderable Figure among them. Hence we see, that from the time of the <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines</hi> till <hi>Diocletian,</hi> they did not produce one single <hi>Historian</hi> above the rank of our Modern <hi>Grubstreet</hi> Annalists. I could not prevail with my self to allow the <hi>Scriptores Augustae Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> who lived in this Interval, a better station; for tho 'tis certain that sorry Guides are better than none at all, yet the Stile of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Writers is so extremely vicious, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct so injudicious and their Relations of all Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions so jejune and insipid, that any one that will submit to the Penance of turning over their W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rks, will s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on be convinced to his cost, that what I have told him, is true. While Learning was thus daily decaying in its Vitals, all this while <hi>Epitomes</hi> were given it to keep it alive: not that they contributed to the loss of the Greater Volumes, which would have been destroy'd without them; but they were the only Books that then pleased, and were in vogue; whether it was that the sickly Genius of those Ages could not endure Volumes of a larger size, which it required a more healthful Constitution to digest; or whether the continual Alarms of their Enemies just allowed them time enough to peruse short Manuals; as we see men seldom sit down to a Regular Dinner, when they are every moment in danger of having their Quarters beaten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p. For
<pb facs="tcp:95582:4"/>
now the <hi>Goths,</hi> under which name I comprehend all the <hi>Northern</hi> Mob made up of the Scum of several Nations, invaded the Empire in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and pierced into the very Bowels of it, which before they were contented to attack only in its Out-skirts and remotest Provinces. This insolent Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Tramontani</hi> passing the <hi>Alpes,</hi> out of a natural aversion to all Literature and Politeness, burnt and plunder'd all the Libraries that stood in their way; and as no care was taken to repair the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which these outragious Levellers every where committed, we ought not to wonder, that when the Building was consumed, so much of the rich Furniture happen'd to share the same Calamity, and be destroy'd along with it. The <hi>Saracens</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who some Ages after subdued the better part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> were a fairer Enemy; As if their design had been to make an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Sciences and Arts, rather than of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and People, they encouraged the Muses; which perhaps may be one reason why more of the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians are preserved, than of the <hi>Latin,</hi> and translated <hi>Ptolomy, Euclid,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with most of the valuable <hi>Greek</hi> Books they could get, into the <hi>Arabic</hi> Langua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; by the same token that the last of these about the end of the Twelfth Century, was out of <hi>Arabic</hi> turned into <hi>Latin,</hi> upon which barbarous Version the Schoolmen afterwards built all their petifogging, litigious, Cobweb-Divinity. But the <hi>Goths</hi> were not so merciful in their anger; they destroy'd Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing root and branch, and by their good will would not have left us the least remainders or footsteps of it.
<pb facs="tcp:95582:4"/>
To this may be added as no small cause of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss of so many <hi>Latin</hi> Originals, the indiscreet Zeal of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me over-pious Christians, who never thought their Religion secure, or out of danger, so long as any of the Monuments of Paganism were suffered to stare it in the face; for this reason they sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all those Books which gave the least account of the Heathen Theology to the flames; and as 'tis impossible for an Historian to give us a full Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry of any Country without acquainting us with several of their Religious Rites and Ceremonies, because <hi>Livy</hi> makes frequent mention of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices, Lustrations, Processions, <hi>&amp;c. Gregory</hi> the Great destroyed as many of his Books as had the misfortune to fall into his hands, and by doing so, imagined he did his Maker good service. I could sooner forgive him, had he taken upon him the Title of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop which his Ambitious Brother Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Constantinople</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n usurped; nay, had he done all the sinful unrighteous things which the worst of his Succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssors ever committed, than pardon him this Immoral Action of destroying the Works of <hi>Livy.</hi> In short, for I am afraid I have dwelt too long upon this Chapter; 'tis evident, that first a neglect or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Learning, then the everlasting Invasions of Barbarous Nations, really contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the loss of those Ancient Authors, whom now we want, especially considering that the Transcribers of those Ages could not soon enough repair the Damages which these cruel Ravagers committed in the Empire of Learning, it being
<pb facs="tcp:95582:5"/>
truly observed of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, that their Greatness in part occasion'd the destruction of both.</p>
            <p>So much for the first Objection, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess does not affect our Attempt, as being compiled not out of one single Historian, but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of many. The other, as it appears to be better grounded, so it is more general, and strikes at all Abbreviations whatever. It is therefore pretended, that these sorts of Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances don't so much diffuse Learning, as they prostitute it; that as they were the Inventions of an unpolish'd Age, when people grew lazy, so they continue those habits still in the minds of men; that the generality of Mankind contenting themselves with a superficial knowledge of things, sit down satisfied with these amusements, which furnish them with matter enough for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conversation, and by this means are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from making a thorough progress in Learning. To this terrible Charge it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That the ill use these empty Pretenders make of Abridgments, as of every thing else, does not destroy the real advantage of them, and ought by no means to stand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the visible benefit that the far greater number of Readers daily reap from them. As there is no disputing against matter of Fact, 'tis certain there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many Abstracts or Epitomes of all sorts printed as at present; witness the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Iournals in all parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and yet the Commonwealth of Learning has been so
<pb facs="tcp:95582:5"/>
far from receiving any prejudice or detriment from them, that it may without the least impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of vanity be affirm'd, that all Sciences have been more universally cultivated in our Age, than in any of the preceding ones; and that these Abbreviations have not a little contributed to the farther increase and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. History is a Province of a vast extent, where an unacquainted Traveller may easily lose his way, or else be bewildred in the great variety of matter; and therefore 'tis but a charitable Office to give him a general Scheme of the Countrey before he actually visits it. 'Tis likewise plain that Abridgments have been suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully attempted in Mathematics. How intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible are <hi>Tacquet, Barrow,</hi> and <hi>De Witt,</hi> in respect of <hi>Clavius</hi>'s tedious Comments upon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid</hi>'s Demonstrations? nay they have not only saved abundance of unnecessary labour, but they have made this knowledge pleasant to those who in the last Age were frighted with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se Studies. Before I dismiss this Paragraph, I will only add, That Abridgments have been so far from mutilating any of the branches of Learning, that were it not for the assistances we derive from them, there would be so many Interruptions and Chasma's, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Historical part of it, that it would prove but an uncomfortable study. How many Ecclesiastical Monuments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for instance, had been lost, if <hi>Photius</hi> the Learned Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> had not preserved them for Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by throwing them into a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95582:6"/>I will not so far abuse my Reader's patience as to enlarge upon the several Advantages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from History, and particularly the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> which of all others is the most instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and entertaining. As it comprizes a prodigious variety of surprizing Events, the Affairs of other Nations are all along so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with theirs, that what one of their own Writers said of them, is literally true, <hi>viz.</hi> That whoever reads the Actions they performed, does not so much learn the History of one single People, as that of all Mankind. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis a prodigious thing to consider, that a small pitiful Town, composed at first of Outlaws and Vagabonds, of different Interests, Tempers, and perhaps Principles; of so little Credit and Reputation, that their Neighbours refused to marry their Daughters to them, should surmount so many Difficulties which threatned their Constitution in its very infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and afterwards upon a new moulding of their Government, which private Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents at home, and powerful Enemies abroad laboured to destroy, should by the regularity of their Military Discipline, the bravery of their Forces, and the vertue of their Inhabitants, be in a capacity make such astonishing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests. And though the perpetual Struggles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the People and the Senate threw the State into so many terrible Convulsions, that by all appearing Symptoms, their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth often seem'd to be in an expiring Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet we find they made the haughtiest Powers
<pb facs="tcp:95582:6"/>
in the Vniverse truckle to them, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all the then inhabited World to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. After this, to reflect, how by the creeping in of Avarice and Luxury, and the several Inferior Vices dependant on these, the Republic was dissolved, and forced to give way to the Emperors, under whose hands it flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some time, till by the frequent Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by an Insolent Army, but especially by the perpetual Irruptions of the <hi>Northern</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it was by degrees broken to pieces, all these remarkable shiftings of the Scene, and the fresh appearance of so many new persons still upon the Theatre, must needs give a considering man not only a very agreeable, but useful entertainment.</p>
            <p>I am now arrived to the last stage of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, so that I have no more work left upon my hands, but only to give the Reader a short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the following Performance. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by a Iudicious Hand in <hi>France</hi> for the use of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and recommended to me by a Learned Gentlemen here in Town, who was so taken with the newness of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and the exactness of the Chronology, that he was impatient till he saw it put into an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> dress. The whole is managed by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion and Answer, in an easie, familiar, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legible Method, suited to persons of the meanest Capacity, but with that good order and accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the greatest Proficients in this sort of Learning may not be ashamed to refresh their Memories by perusing it. I was the more easily persuaded to undertake it, because I could never
<pb facs="tcp:95582:7"/>
as yet meet any Abbreviation of the <hi>Roman</hi> History, which was not in one respect or other lame and deficient. Either the Stile was uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, the Narration too tedious, or obscure, or the true order of time miserably neglected.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Lucius Florus,</hi> tho I confess there are abundance of things very prettily said in him, yet he so frequently interrupts the Series of the History, and is so everlasting an Affecter of pointed Sentences, to which he sacrifices the Truth without any remorse, that he is not to be depended upon. <hi>Eutropius</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> lived in an unpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ite Age, and not only pass over several Important Occurrences, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly give a faulty account of matters of fact.</p>
            <p>I cannot answer for this, that it wholly comes up to the dignity of the Subject; and indeed as it is the first undertaking of this nature that ever appear'd in public, it cannot reasonably be expected that it should be carried to its highest perfection at once; however, I may without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity affirm, That it has been considerably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in the Version, as any one that will be at the pains to compare the Translation with the Original will soon discover.</p>
            <p>If it meets the favourable Reception which so useful and serviceable a Performance seems to deserve, the Translator may, perhaps, find leisure time enough hereafter for the advantage of our <hi>English</hi> Youth to put it into the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Language.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> In the 3961 Year of the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Period. 753 before the Christian <hi>Aera.</hi> 431 after the burning of <hi>Troy,</hi> and of the World 3301.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which was the Capital City of the <hi>Latins</hi> then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Alha,</hi> because <hi>Iulius</hi> that built it, made it the Seat of his Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What King possess'd the Throne at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Amulius</hi> after he had ejected his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Numitor.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From <hi>Romulus,</hi> who gave it his own Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Why?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because his Brother <hi>Rhemus</hi> and he having agreed, That he who saw the best Augury should Name it; <hi>Romulus</hi> had the most favourable Augury, as having seen twelve Vultures, and the other only six.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> In the first place he open'd a Publick Sanctuary in a little Wood, which was not far from the City, where all Fugitive Slaves, Criminals, Bankrupts, and others of the same Quality found Protection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Since the <hi>Romans</hi> had no Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and their Neighbours would not marry with them, they were obliged to have recourse to a Stratagem.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The First was that of the Senators, whom he created to the Number of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and call'd them <hi>Patres</hi> or Fathers, and their Children <hi>Patricians.</hi> The Second was that of the Knights. And the Third, that of the People.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The first thing he did was to disband the Guards which <hi>Romulus</hi> had instituted for the security of his Person.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he said 'twas better for a Prince to make himself be <hi>lov'd</hi> than <hi>fear'd</hi> by his Subjects.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Three <hi>Curiatii</hi> were at first wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Two of the <hi>Horatii</hi> slain.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he not soon tarnish the Glory of this Illustrious Action?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Returning Victorious, and meeting his Sister in Tears for one of the <hi>Curiatii,</hi> who was promis'd her in Marriage, he run her through with his Sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he punish'd for this Crime?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; his late Victory excus'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> being thus Conquerors, what did <hi>Tullus</hi> after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He ordered the City of <hi>Alba</hi> to be raz'd to the ground, and commanded the <hi>Albans</hi> to come and live at <hi>Rome</hi> with their King <hi>Metius Suffetius.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He was sometime after ty'd to the Tails of four Horses and torn in pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what Misdemeanor was so severe a Punishment inflicted on him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For forming a Conspiracy to make himself Master of <hi>Rome</hi>; and betraying the

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Answer did <hi>Actius</hi> return him?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Eldest was of a sweet agreeable Temper: The Youngest, Fiery and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whom did they marry?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The two <hi>Tarquins,</hi> Brothers-in-Law or Nephews to <hi>Servius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came they to marry them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Tullius</hi> apprehending that these <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> the Sons or Grandsons of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> would shock him in his Throne, thought the best way to secure them in his Interests, would be to bestow his Eldest Daughter upon the Elder <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who was naturally Ambitious and Violent; and his Youngest upon the other, whose name was <hi>Aruns,</hi> who had as much Moderation as his Brother had Heat and Passion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Consequence of these Marriages?</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95582:20"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As these things were wholly managed by a Principle of Policy, and <hi>Servius</hi> had no regard to the different Characters and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the married Couple, he was the occasion that <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who liked not the too gentle humour of his Wife, entred into a strict Correspondence with his Sister-in-Law, and debauch'd her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I desire to know the Result of this Correspondence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Tarquin</hi> murder'd his own Wife, and the Youngest Sister poison'd her Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did she do so?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To put her in a capacity to marry her Brother-in-Law, and take away the Crown from her Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came <hi>Tarquin</hi> to be declared King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Suffering himself to be over-persuaded by <hi>Tullia,</hi> who told him he must turn the old Gentleman out of his Kingdom without waiting for his Death, he summons the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators to tell them he was minded to reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd upon this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He placed himself on the Seat where the Kings were accustom'd to sit, and began to call his Father-in-Law <hi>Servius</hi> an Usurper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what became of <hi>Servius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This making a great noise in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the King came to know the reason of it: <hi>Tarquin</hi> immediately raising himself from his Seat, he laid hold of him, and throwing him down stairs, order'd the Soldiers to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas after the Death of <hi>Servius,</hi> whom he caused to be assassinated, that he seized upon the Kingdom, and behaved himself with all imaginable Arrogance and Cruelty.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From the Insolence of his Temper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he do when he was made King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He despis'd the Authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and frequently put to death, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, or imprison'd the Senators and chief men of the City, upon false Reports and Accusations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable things did he do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He defeated the <hi>Volscians</hi> by Force of Arms, but made himself Master of <hi>Gabii</hi> by Treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was that managed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He pretended to fall out with his Son <hi>Sextus,</hi> in the presence of most of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; nay, his Passion was carried on so far, that he was going to strike him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What does <hi>Sextus</hi> upon this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Away he flies, and sends to the <hi>Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to beg the Protection of their City against the barbarous Treatment of an Unnatural Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did the Inhabitants receive him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: And he knew so well how to establish himself in their good Opinion by fighting for them, that they made him their General, and Governor of the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When <hi>Sextus</hi> found himself in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to do what he pleased, what did he then?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He carries him into his Garden, and in his presence knocks off the Heads of all the highest Poppies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Without doubt <hi>Sextus</hi> understood well enough his Father's meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right: He struck off the Heads of the principal men among the <hi>Gabians</hi>; some he imprison'd, others he accus'd of Treason, to find a pretext to condemn, and so make them uncapable of doing him any Injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Disgrace happen'd afterwards to <hi>Tarquin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Reign daily becoming more and more odious to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they took his Crown from him, and turn'd him with his whole Family out of the City, for a certain Crime committed by his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Sextus,</hi> who imagin'd that his High Birth would carry him out in every thing, having beheld <hi>Lucretia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> he was struck with her Beauty; but as he could not hope to satisfy his Passion easily, (for besides that she was a Lady of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Virtue imaginable, she was married to a Prince of the Royal Family), he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to ravish her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was that effected?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the night time he enters her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95582:22"/>
claps his Dagger to her Breast, and threaten'd to kill her, if she did not comply with his Desires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> These Menaces, did they affright her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Sextus</hi> then to accomplish his Intentions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Seeing nothing was able to move this Illustrious Lady, he tells her, That after he had killed her, he would kill her Slave like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and leave him in her Bed, and then publish abroad, that he kill'd them both in the Act of Adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then this Consideration prevail'd with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: For she rather chose to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Body to the Passion of <hi>Sextus,</hi> than suffer her Memory to be dishonoured by so black a Calumny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did she after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After she had shown this weakness, she hides a Dagger under her Gown, and sends to find out her Husband <hi>Collatinus,</hi> her Brother <hi>Lucretius,</hi> and her Cousin <hi>Brutus,</hi> who were encamp'd before <hi>Ardea</hi>: She complained to them of the Brutal Action of this libidinous Prince, begg'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Injury done to her; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately drawing out the Dagger from under her Gown, she struck it into her Belly, being resolved not to survive the Loss of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who declared it against them?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Family of the <hi>Fabians</hi> begg'd of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> to leave the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the War to their care, and they would undertake it at their own Expence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many were there of this Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how came they off?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After having frequently defeated their Enemies, they unluckily fell at last into an Ambuscade, which the <hi>Vejentes</hi> had prepar'd for them, and by this means the <hi>Fabians</hi> were wholly cut off in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 277.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not he put an end to other Wars besides this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He had frequent Rencounters with the <hi>Volscians,</hi> who were often beaten, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>Quintus Capitolinus.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Year 286, he took <hi>Antium,</hi> the Capital City of the <hi>Volscians.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he do nothing else?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ten years after the Taking of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being call'd from his Country-seat, where he employ'd himself in cultivating his own Grounds, he was created Dictator, and in that Quality overcame the <hi>Aequi,</hi> and made them first pass <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>Camillus,</hi> the Dictator, after a Siege of Ten years continuance, in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 358.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what means did he take it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By undermining it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What particular Passages happen'd at this Siege?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Soldiers were resolved not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home till they made themselves Masters

of the Place, and bound themselves by a solemn Oath to observe it. And this was the first time that they begun to pass the <hi>Winter</hi> under Tents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This same <hi>Camillus,</hi> did not he Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his Valour upon other occasions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He brought the <hi>Fidenates</hi> into Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the City of <hi>Falisci,</hi> but by a very gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was that, I pray?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A School-Master put the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Children for their Birth in the Town, into his Hands, expecting to get a mighty Reward for his pains; but <hi>Camillus</hi> order'd him to be stript stark naked, and so to be soundly whipt from his Camp to the City, whither he sent him with all his Boys.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where did it first break out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Having entred <hi>Italy,</hi> to the number of above a Hundred thousand Men, out of an Expectation of finding a mighty booty there, they first besieged <hi>Clusium.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> take the part of the <hi>Clusians</hi> their Allies?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, they sent Ambassadors to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who instead of hearkning to them, rais'd the Siege of <hi>Clusium,</hi> and marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did the <hi>Romans</hi> do when they heard of their March?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They sent <hi>Fabius</hi> the Consul to oppose their coming with a powerful Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did a Fight hereupon ensue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A most bloody Battel was fought near the River <hi>Allia,</hi> where the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was intirely defeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what did the <hi>Gauls</hi> after this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Conquest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They immediately entred the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> finding the Gates open, and the Place abandon'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how did the <hi>Gauls</hi> behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, being now Masters of the Town?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They effectually plunder'd it, and coming into the Senate-house, massacred all the Senators, and afterwards burnt the whole City down to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did they besides?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After all this Ravaging and Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Brennus</hi> who commanded the <hi>Gauls,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the <hi>Capitol,</hi> whither the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth retired with <hi>Manlius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It had certainly succeeded, if <hi>Manlius</hi> and the rest of the besieged had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd by the noise of some Geese in the Garison, and beaten back the <hi>Gauls</hi> that were already got upon the Ramperts, and thrown down headlong those that were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ladders</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were they not weary of so long a Siege?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right, and sent to tell the Besieged, they would draw off and leave their City, provided they would give them a thousand pounds of Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did any remarkable Accident happen during this Capitulation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Camillus,</hi> who had been banished some time ago, and recall'd with all speed to come to the Relief of the City, arrived thither at the Head of Forty thousand men, whom he had pick'd up in his March, beats the <hi>Gauls</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards pursuing them for two or three Leagues, gives them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire defeat.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He returns to <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, and stops the People who would have fain gone to live at <hi>Veii,</hi> because <hi>Rome</hi> was all burnt down, with such powerful Arguments, that he perswades them to remove the Rubbish, clear the Ruins, and build a new City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long was it Re-building?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not above an Year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how was this War ended at last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After, the <hi>Gauls</hi> were wholly defeated by <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Dolabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How happen'd the Death of <hi>Manlius,</hi> whom they Sir-nam'd <hi>Capitolinus</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas after his having defended the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,</hi> and intrieguing to make himself King, that he was thrown headlong from the top of that very <hi>Capitol,</hi> which he had defended with so much Gallantry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What memorable Passage fell out in the Year 393 of the Building of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Gulf a peared in the midst of the publick Place, which they could fill up by no manner of means.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what an Answer did they return?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> That it would never close again till the most precious thing in <hi>Rome</hi> was thrown into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what Method did they take?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> At the very time, when they were most perplexed to find out this precious

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Tell me how it was manag'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They chose Ten of the Craftiest Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the Army, and apparell'd them like
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95582:31"/>
Shepherds, then they gave each of them a small Flock of Sheep, and having instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in all they were to do, posted them on the Road where the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, and what did these Shepherds do so merrily burlesqu'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being in their respective places, they were met by the Van-Couriers of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what Questions did they ask them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether they knew where the Army of the <hi>Samnites</hi> was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What answers did these counterfeit Shepherds return?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That they had actually besieged <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Upon this Advice what did the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas resolv'd to march to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this City, because it was a place of great Importance to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what followed upon that Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Army of the <hi>Romans</hi> being shut up in the Defiles through which they must of necessity pass before they could reach this place, the <hi>Samnites</hi> fell vigorously upon them, plunder'd them of all their Arms, and made them pass under the Yoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> soon after revenge this Affront?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95582:31"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for some time after, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Papyrius</hi> defeated the <hi>Samnites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which is the second thing that is to be remark'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That young <hi>Decius</hi> in a Battel against the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and the <hi>Gauls</hi> who had join'd them, perform'd the same that his Father had done upon a like occasion, that is to say, he devoted himself to Death, and flung himself into the midst of his Enemies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When was the War declared against them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Year 472, and with that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that <hi>L Aemilius Barbula</hi> defeated them, together with the <hi>Samnites</hi> and <hi>Salentines</hi> that came to their Assistance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It obliged them to beg Relief of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> in the Year 474, who Transported a vast Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two that were considerable ones. The first was fought in <hi>Campania</hi> near <hi>Heraclea</hi>: And the second in <hi>Lucania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Success of this first Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> had the worst on't; but they were vanquish'd rather by the disorder the strange sight of those huge <hi>Elephants</hi> put them into, than by the Forces of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were store of Prisoners taken here?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; but upon <hi>Fabricius</hi> his redemand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> sent them all back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking Ransom for them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> after this?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He dispatch'd Ambassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> with considerable Presents to endeavour to accommodate the matter between the <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> The Ambassadors being sent back, what did <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ask them at their return?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He demanded of them what they thought of <hi>Rome</hi>? and they immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd him, That their City seem'd to be a Temple, and their Senate an Assembly of Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> bring a Second Army into the Field?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Nay, they were so incredibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in mighty admiration said of them, Without question, I am born under the Constellation of <hi>Hercules.</hi> I have a fine time on't here to cut off the Heads of my Enemies, since new ones perpetually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from their Blood, like those of <hi>Hidra,</hi> to persecute me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, and what was the Success of this Second Battel that was fought in <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Those very <hi>Elephants</hi> that gain'd <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> his first Battel, lost him the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How happen'd that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It so fell out, That one <hi>Caius Minutius</hi> cut off the Trunk of one of the <hi>Elephants,</hi> which made the Creature cry out so furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he afrighted his fellows; so away they ran back upon their own Forces, broke their Ranks, and put the Army into so

strange a Confusion, that it was no difficult matter for the <hi>Romans</hi> to defeat them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What follow'd after this Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pyrrhus</hi>'s Physician came to <hi>Fabricius,</hi> offering to Poyson his own Master; but the Generous Consul sent him back to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who commanded him to be immediately hanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After this overthrow, where did <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> turn himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He goes into <hi>Sicily</hi> to assist the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusans</hi> against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>; but this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition not succeeding to his Expectation, he goes back into <hi>Italy</hi> in the Year 479, where he was beaten, and his Camp forc'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After this last Defeat, whither did he go?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After he had quitted <hi>Italy,</hi> he return'd into <hi>Epirus,</hi> having been employ'd Six Years in the <hi>Tarentine</hi> and <hi>Sicilian</hi> War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what happen'd after the Retreat of <hi>Pyrrhus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> having defeated the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> and <hi>Samnites,</hi> the Conquer'd were obliged to submit to the Conquerors, so they entr'd into an Alliance with those of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year 482.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They attack'd the <hi>Salentines,</hi> and at last the <hi>Punic</hi> War started up, which prov'd to be the longest and most dangerous War that the <hi>Romans</hi> had hitherto experienced.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came this about?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This King, in Conjunction with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> declar'd War against the City of <hi>Messina</hi>; and the <hi>Romans</hi> resolving to Succour the <hi>Messineses,</hi> because they had been always their good Friends, sent over an Army into <hi>Sicily,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Claudius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Gallies of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> which were light and nimble, were over-power'd by those of the <hi>Romans</hi> that were short and heavy; and by this means, their dexterity in managing their Oars was of no service to them, and their whole Fleet was either Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or Sunk.</p>

                  <hi>A. Attilius Regulus,</hi> who took <hi>Tunis,</hi> and several other Cities belonging to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> and at last went to lay close Siege to <hi>Carthage</hi> it self.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Without doubt this obliged the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> to sue for a Peace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And was <hi>Regulus</hi> willing to grant it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not unless it were upon very hard Conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw that, what Course did they take?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were necessitated to give the Command of their Army to <hi>Xantippus,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable Actions did this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral perform?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He gave the <hi>Romans</hi> a great overthrow, kill'd Thirty thousand upon the place, and took Fifteen thousand Prisoners, among whom was <hi>Attilius Regulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what place was this Battel fought?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Near <hi>Clupea.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did they do with <hi>Regulus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They sent him to <hi>Rome</hi> to Treat with the Senate about the Exchange of Prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did he perswade the <hi>Romans</hi> to treat of a Peace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: far from that, he endeavour'd as much as in him lay to hinder them from making one; telling them the Affairs of <hi>Carthage</hi> were in a very Bad condition, and that they ought never to leave off till they had utterly ruin'd them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became of him then at his return to <hi>Carthage</hi>?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Having told them the <hi>Romans</hi> would by no means hearken to a Peace, unless they would submit to their Authority, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> put him to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Torments did they make him endure?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They shut him up in a Barrel, stuck full of Nails, with the Points towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And thus the first <hi>Punic</hi> War was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right, after Twenty three years losses on both sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> shut soon after?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for the <hi>Romans</hi> were soon after obliged to fight against the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> the <hi>Liburnians,</hi> and the <hi>Insubrian Gauls,</hi> who were often beaten.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Ligurians</hi> and <hi>Liburnians</hi> by <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>; and the <hi>Insubrian Gauls,</hi> who had <hi>Britomarus</hi> to head them, by <hi>Aemilius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the occasion of the Second War?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Ambition of <hi>Annibal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Amilcar.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> grew now impatient of their Twenty four years of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and of having paid a Tribute to the <hi>Romans</hi> for so long a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how came <hi>Annibal</hi> to forward it so mightily?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because his Father, who carried him, when he was but Nine years old, into <hi>Spain,</hi> made him solemnly Swear at the foot of an Altar, never to be reconciled to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd during this War?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At the end of Nine years War, <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> was slain, and his Son-in-Law, <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> set up in his room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What befel <hi>Asdrubal</hi> after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was slain Eight years after in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and <hi>Annibal</hi> succeeded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Annibal</hi> do when he saw himself General of the <hi>Carthaginians?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what did he next attempt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He made his Army march into the Territories of the <hi>Oscades,</hi> whom he reduced under his obedience, and soon after possess'd himself of all the Cities thereabout, but especially those belonging to the <hi>Capertans</hi> and the <hi>Vacceans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whither did he shape his course after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He march'd to attack <hi>Saguntus,</hi> a City of <hi>Spain,</hi> and an Ally of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They sent Ambassadors to <hi>Carthage</hi> to complain of the Injury that was done to the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> and of the Infraction of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace by this means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of an Answer was return'd them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were forc'd to return home, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill satisfied with the Answer of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did the <hi>Saguntines</hi> do upon this refusal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Harass'd with the continual Fatigues of a Nine Months Siege, and prest by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and want of Provisions, they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to capitulate; but <hi>Annibal</hi> persisting to treat them with too much indignity, they

chose rather to perish than to trust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the hands of so cruel a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what did these people do, being thus reduced to despair?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After they had buried their Gold and Silver in the ground, they made a great Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire in the midst of the Town, into which the greatest part of the Garison leap'd, and the rest were inhumanely kill'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After the taking of this City, what did they do with it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They laid it level with the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the <hi>Romans</hi> heard of these Outrages, how were they affected?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They dispatch'd Ambassadors to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> to know of them whether they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the procedure of <hi>Annibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how were they receiv'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Fabius,</hi> one of the Ambassadors, seeing them demur upon the Point, told them they had nothing to do but to chuse either Peace or War; and all of them immediately cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out War, War, the Ambassadors imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whither did the Ambassadors go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they return'd to <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They visited <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> to desire the people of those Nations not to give Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did they accomplish their designs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for those of <hi>Spain</hi> being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the sad example of <hi>Saguntus,</hi> and the <hi>Gauls</hi> by the great Success of <hi>Annibal</hi>'s
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95582:37"/>
Arms, they refused this Embassy as a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Proposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where resided <hi>Annibal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He past the Winter at New <hi>Carthage,</hi> then return'd to <hi>Cales,</hi> where after he had perform'd his Vows to <hi>Hercules,</hi> he renew'd his Ancient Oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was it that instigated him to do it again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> An extraordinary Dream, which fill'd him with joy, and put him upon the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to march into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how did <hi>Annibal</hi> employ himself before his arrival into <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At first he made himself Master of the <hi>Ilergetes,</hi> the <hi>Bargusians,</hi> the <hi>Ausetans,</hi> and all <hi>Aquitain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whither went he afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He pass'd the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains, then he march'd through <hi>Gaul,</hi> notwithstanding the opposition of the people, who were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give way. At last he came to the foot of the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not <hi>Annibal</hi>'s Army find it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to climb these Mountains?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas troublesome enough, as well for the height of the Rocks, which seem'd to touch the Skies, as for the Snows which made the ways almost impracticable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the Inhabitants of the Hills were no small impediment to them in their March.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95582:38"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did <hi>Annibal</hi> then accomplish this vast Design?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: For having with an undaunted Courage undertaken to climb the Hills, on the ninth day he found himself on the top of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When he was there, what did he make his Soldiers remark?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He shows 'em all <hi>Italy,</hi> lying at a great distance, bidding them look upon that vast Country as the certain Recompence of their Toil and Labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Annibal</hi> more perplex'd to get down the Hills, than he was in climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right: For the Frost rendred the ways every where so slippery, that there was no steddy walking; besides the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was so steep in some places, that there was scarce any other way of getting down, but by catching hold of the Twigs and Branches of Trees that grew between the Rocks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then did he make a shift to reach the Valleys?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He made use of Fire, Iron, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, to open a way through the Rocks; and thus having passed the <hi>Alpes</hi> in the space of Fifteen days, he came into <hi>Italy</hi> with a Hundred thousand Foot, and Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where was it that <hi>Annibal</hi> first gave Battel to the <hi>Romans?</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95582:38"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Success of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Army was overcome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who had the Command of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Scipio</hi> the Consul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he not wounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and had certainly been taken by the Enemy, if the Valour of his Son, who was afterwards sirnam'd <hi>Africanus,</hi> had not forc'd him out of their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did <hi>Annibal</hi> give the second Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A short time after the first.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No happier for the <hi>Romans</hi> than the last: <hi>Sempronius</hi> and his whole Army was there defeated, and <hi>Annibal</hi> triumphantly pass'd the <hi>Appennines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Annibal</hi> do the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He came into <hi>Etruria</hi> after a March of four days and three nights in the midst of Bogs and Morasses, without reposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which so fatigu'd him, that he lost an eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd to him after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas in this place that <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Consul, a man of great rashness and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, fell into the Snares which <hi>Annibal</hi> had laid for him, he was slain, and his Army put to the Rout near the Lake of <hi>Trasimene.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many <hi>Romans</hi> lost their lives in this Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Near Fifteen thousand slain, and some Ten thousand put to flight, and dispers'd all over <hi>Etruria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not some remarkable Accident happen after this Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis reported that two women la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their Children at one of the Gates of the City, whom they suppos'd to be dead, seeing them unexpectedly return, were so fill'd with joy, that the excess of it kill'd them.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> After this great Overthrow, what was done at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The people being assembled, consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Books of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> where they found, That all these Misfortunes were only owing to the Indignation of the God <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Resolutions did they form up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Discovery?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They vow'd to celebrate a Holy Spring; and after that, in the absence of the Consuls, the people created <hi>Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> Dictator, and <hi>M. Minucius Rufus</hi> Master of the Horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where was <hi>Annibal</hi> at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was advanced as far as <hi>Spoletum,</hi> which obliged the two Consuls <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> to hasten with their Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where did the two Armies meet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Near <hi>Cannae,</hi> a small Town scituated
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95582:39"/>
in <hi>Apulia</hi>: Here did <hi>Varro</hi> put his men in a posture to receive the Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was this a bloody Fight?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for there was near Forty five thousand <hi>Romans</hi> slain, with Fourscore Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and <hi>Paulus</hi> the Consul himself was killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable Passages happen'd in this Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Consul <hi>Paulus</hi> having been wounded, was in the midst of the hurry and confusion found covered with blood and dust, by a Collonel of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What said this Officer to <hi>Paulus,</hi> seeing he was still alive?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Take my Horse, and fly for your self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what answer did <hi>Paulus</hi> make him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, no; use him your self, cries he, with a dying voice, and go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and bid the Senators from me fortify the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Annibal</hi> comes to attack it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he say any thing else to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Above all, tell <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> that I have liv'd, and that I now dye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Orders and Counsels; so leave me here to expire amidst this horrible Slaughter of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Slaughter continue a long time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So long, that <hi>Annibal</hi> commanded his Soldiers to desist; and so great, that he sent to <hi>Carthage</hi> Three Bushels of Golden Rings,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95582:40"/>
taken from the Fingers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights that were kill'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> What happen'd after the Battel of <hi>Cannae?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some young <hi>Romans</hi> were debating amongst themselves to abandon <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And had their design like to have pass'd in this Assembly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> a Collonel in the Army, who was after sirnamed <hi>Africanus,</hi> drew out his Sword, and swore he would kill the man who would not take an Oath never to go out of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the <hi>Romans</hi> desire a Peace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; they were so far from demanding a Peace of the <hi>Carthaginia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> that receiving advice that the Consul <hi>Varro,</hi> whose rashness was in part the cause of that cruel Loss, was on his way home, all the City went out to meet him, to thank him because he had not despair'd of the Safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do they say of <hi>Annibal</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That if he had known how to make use of a Victory, as well as he did how to get one, <hi>Rome</hi> had been utterly ruin'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where was <hi>Annibal</hi> then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Near <hi>Capua,</hi> which he reduced under his Obedience, as well as a great part of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had he always the better on't?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for <hi>Capua</hi> proved as fatal to him, as <hi>Cannae</hi> had been to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came that about?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95582:40"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he and his Army abandon'd themselves to the Effeminacies and Pleasures of that place, and staid a long time there, so that he never thought of pursuing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, which gave the <hi>Romans</hi> time to take breath again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did the <hi>Romans</hi> do in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth, the Magistrates, nay, even the Slaves, took up Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> do in the mean time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He endeavoured by delays and amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to weaken <hi>Annibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did the <hi>Romans</hi> attempt with their Army?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They laid Siege to <hi>Capua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And was <hi>Annibal</hi> idle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; thinking to make them raise the Siege, he marched directly towards <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what happen'd to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A sudden Tempest arising just as he was going to fight <hi>Fulvius,</hi> he was oblig'd to return back without fighting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it long before <hi>Capua</hi> surrendred?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did the <hi>Romans</hi> use them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They took away all their Privileges.</p>

                  <hi>A. Asdrubal</hi> going to join his Brother <hi>Annibal,</hi> who lay then in <hi>Apulia</hi> with a powerful Army, was defeated by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls

                  <hi>A.</hi> He caused <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s Head to be thrown into the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Camp; which <hi>Annibal</hi> seeing, he immediately cried out, I perceive my self now to be unfortunate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He cut in pieces <hi>Hanno</hi>'s Army, the General of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and took Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner <hi>Siphax</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Romans,</hi> and taken the side of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Being elevated to this Dignity, how did he behave himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He in his turn banishes all those of the contrary Party, sends back the greatest part of the Senators, but especially <hi>Sertorius</hi>; and proscribes so great a number of them, that 'tis said, they amounted to Two thousand.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHat was the principal Cause of this War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas Ambition occasion'd all those Calamities which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire suffer'd during the Course of this War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How happen'd it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> seeing themselves to be the most powerful Men of the Republick, made a League together, and so concerted Matters, that the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Affairs wholly rested on them. This Government was commonly call'd the <hi>Triumvirat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Caesar</hi> to confirm his Treaty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He gave his Daughter in Marriage to <hi>Pompey.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Caesar</hi> took the Government of <hi>Gaul. Pompey</hi> that of <hi>Spain. Crassus</hi> that of <hi>Syria,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95582:51"/>
which he therefore demanded, because he expected to make great Advantages of that rich Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After they had thus divided it, what did they do next?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Caesar</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> went each of them to their Government. <hi>Pompey</hi> staid at <hi>Rome,</hi> and contented himself to send his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which was <hi>Crassus</hi>'s first Action in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for in an Expedition against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he was entirely defeated by <hi>Surena,</hi> General of their Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd to him in this Battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He lost the greatest part of his men there, his own Son was slain, and having the misfortune himself to fall into the Hands of the Enemy, they cut off his Head, which being carried to <hi>Orodes,</hi> King of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he caus'd his Mouth to be open'd, and pouring some melted Gold into it, said, <hi>Now satisfy thy self with Gold, of which thou hast always been so desirous?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He only laugh'd at his Avarice, which influenced him to undertake that War.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He prevail'd with the Senate to recal <hi>Caesar</hi> from his Government, as soon as his time was expir'd, and to Disband his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did <hi>Caesar</hi> comply with these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As he rightly apprehended, that his Conquest of <hi>Gaul</hi> had created him several Enemies, and very well saw whither this tended, he sent them word, That he was resolv'd to put himself in a Condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himself against his Enemies, and that he would not dismiss his Army, unless they would oblige <hi>Pompey</hi> to do the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did they receive his Proposal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They would not hearken to it, which obliged him to assemble all his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and march immediately towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not <hi>Pompey</hi> endeavour to hinder his March?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Caesar</hi>'s sudden Expedition so afrighted him and his whole Party, that they soon abandon'd <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and pass'd into <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Caesar</hi> do in the mean time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He enter'd <hi>Rome,</hi> plunder'd the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treasury; and after he had staid a short time there to compose the Tumults of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> As he return'd, what did he do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He made himself Master of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and entring <hi>Rome</hi> the second time, he took Possession of the Dictatorship, which the <hi>Praetor Lepidius</hi> had procur'd to be conferr'd upon him in his Absence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He passed over into <hi>Greece</hi> to find out <hi>Pompey,</hi> and having besieged him near <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> in <hi>Albania,</hi> he was so rudely receiv'd, and his Army beaten after such a manner, that if <hi>Pompey</hi> had known to make the best Use of his Victory, <hi>Caesar,</hi> even in his own Confession, had been intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where did <hi>Caesar</hi> March after this small overthrow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He got his Troops together, and march'd towards <hi>Thessaly.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for <hi>Pompey</hi> having pursued him thither, they fought in the Plains of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pompey</hi>'s Army was totally routed. As for himself, he fled towards <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> who was then very Young.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> As soon as 'twas known at Court, that he was ready to Land, <hi>Theodotius</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the King to murder him, in order to engage <hi>Caesar</hi> to leave him in the quiet Possession of his Kingdom.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> When these <hi>Decemviri,</hi> or Ten Men, who were chosen by the People to reduce the Laws they brought from <hi>Greece</hi> into one Body, had fully compriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is remark'd of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of these <hi>Decemviri?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That his Insolence proceeded so far, as to carry off <hi>Virginia,</hi> with a design to Ravish her.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became then of <hi>Virginia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Virginius,</hi> the Father of this Young Woman, kill'd her with his own Hand in the <hi>Forum,</hi> as <hi>Claudius</hi> would have had her dragg'd off, after he had declared her his Slave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Effects did this produce?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It stirr'd up all the People against the <hi>Decemviri.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They put them all in Prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What occasion'd the Third Sedition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It happen'd upon the Subject of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, the People being resolved it should be lawful for them to Marry with the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where did this Tumult break out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> by the management of <hi>Canuseius,</hi> Tribune of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did the Fourth Sedition begin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 377.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Cause of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ambition of Honours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the People would be admitted to Publick Employments, as well as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did that happen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Lucius Stolo,</hi> and <hi>Lucuis Sextius,</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the People, having preferr'd a Law, which ordain'd that one of the Consuls should be always chosen out of the <hi>Plebeians</hi>; the Senators oppos'd it with all their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95582:54"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And the Tribunes on their side, what did they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They hindred the making of any Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule Magistrate, so that there was a sort of Anarchy in <hi>Rome</hi> for the space of Five years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which of them carried the Point at last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The People, and <hi>Lucius Sextius,</hi> was the first that was chosen out of their Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Cause of the Fifth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Gracchi</hi> occasion'd it by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to re-establish the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did that happen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Tiberius Gracchus</hi> being desirous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the good will of the People, demanded to have the abovementioned Law put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the intent of that Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> were by it forbidden to possess in Land, above Five hundred Acres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what was their design in getting it restor'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To enjoyn all those that possess'd any more to give their Lands up, and distribute them among the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not all the Nobility vigorously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; but't was to no purpose, for this Law was authoriz'd by the Senate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95582:55"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what did he do afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He made his Colleague <hi>Octavius</hi> quit his Office, because he would have stopt the Execution of this Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd to him at last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This good Success having rendred him insupportably Proud, <hi>Scipio Nasico</hi> caus'd him to be Assassinated as he came out of the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not his Death revenged?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Caius Gracchus,</hi> his Brother, in order to effect it, promises the People to get them all that Wealth which <hi>Attalus</hi> at his Death bequeath'd to the <hi>Romans:</hi> The Senate was so highly provoked at his Arrogance, that they offer'd the weight of it in Gold, to any one that should bring his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then became of <hi>Caius Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He got one of his Slaves to kill him, finding himself pursued by the Consul <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>; and he that found his Body, cut off his Head, took out his Brains, and fill'd it with melted Lead, to make it weigh the more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Besides these Five Seditions, do you observe no more?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Inform me concerning them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Posthumius</hi> refusing his Soldiers the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Volae,</hi> which he had promis'd them, a Sedition arose in the Camp, where he was stoned to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95582:55"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Seditions can you recount to me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Under <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would not vanquish that of the Enemies, altho it lay in their Power. There happen'd several little Mutinies, that don't deserve to be particularly mention'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Give me some instance of the Distrust or Jealousy of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were so jealous of having the least Invasion made upon their Liberty, that they often sent the most Illustrious of the Nobility into Banishment, whenever they suspected that they design'd to arrogate too much Power to themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray give me an Example of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was in the first place, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> banish'd for having served them too well; and <hi>Camillus</hi> was sent abroad for the same reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore do they say <hi>Camillus</hi> was exiled?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the People were possest with an imagination, that this Great Man had not equitably divided the Booty taken from the <hi>Vejentes,</hi> between them and the Army; so they believed he had a design to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Hearts of the Soldiers, in order to enslave the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Give me one other Demonstration, I beseech you, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:95582:56"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They put <hi>Spurius Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Sparius Melius</hi> to Death, because they suspected them; the first for endeavouring to revive the <hi>Lex Agraria</hi>; the second for his Largesses or Donatives to the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who kill'd <hi>Spurius Cassius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas his own Father that executed Justice upon him; and as for the other, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius Ahala,</hi> General of the Horse, kill'd him in the midst of the <hi>Forum,</hi> by the order of <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And <hi>Manlius,</hi> how died he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was thrown headlong from the top of that very Capitol, which he had so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously defended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what reason?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he had deliver'd several poor Debtors from the Clutches of their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; 'twas observ'd he carried himself too high, and did not contain himself within the Bounds of a private Citizen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many <hi>Roman</hi> Generals do you observe there were, that kill'd the Generals of the Enemies Army with their own hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three; <hi>viz, Romulus,</hi> who kill'd <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> King of the <hi>Cecinians; Cornelius Cossus,</hi> who kill'd <hi>Tolumnius,</hi> King of the <hi>Vejentes</hi>; and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who slew <hi>Viridomarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Insubrian Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Recount to me the Action of <hi>Curtius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Year 395. a Gulf appear'd in the middle of the <hi>Forum</hi>; and as 'twas impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

to fill it up, altho they threw in never so much Wood, and Stones, and Earth, they had recourse to the Augars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what Answer did they give them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it would never close again, till the most precious thing in <hi>Rome</hi> was thrown into it. Now as they were strangely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd to find it out; <hi>Marcus Curtius</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Horseback, and all in Armour rode into it, saying, That nothing was more precious than Arms, and Military Virtue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To kill <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was Consul, to set the City on Fire at the four Corners, to Plunder, and make themselves Masters of it; but this Plot was happily discovered.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long was he Governor there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nine years; during which time, he subdued all the Provinces that lye between the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> the <hi>Alps,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and made them Tributary to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other remarkable Things did he perform?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He made a Descent likewise upon <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> which before him was unknown to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How often was Fortune contrary to him, during these Nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thrice: The first happen'd to him in <hi>Britain,</hi> where his Naval Forces had like to have been lost by a Tempest. The second in <hi>Gaul,</hi> where one of his Legions was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Defeated. And the third upon the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> where his Lieutenants sell into an Ambuscade, and were cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Having plac'd good Governors in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> what did he next?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He repassed into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how was he received there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being at <hi>Luca,</hi> the Two Consuls, with above Two hundred Senators, and Four hundred Knights went to Congratulate him upon his great Conquests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He demanded a Triumph, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it granted him?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for <hi>Pompey</hi> being jealous of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Glory, so manag'd his Cabals, that they refused him both one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did <hi>Caesar</hi> bear this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Person whom he sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to make this demand, sets his Hand to his Sword, and tells them, that what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused him, <hi>That,</hi> meaning his Sword, would give him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What follow'd upon this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Caesar</hi> marches towards <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Head of his Army, which had Conquer'd the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and passes the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> a small River, which parted that Government from <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was done at <hi>Rome</hi> in the mean time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pompey</hi> gets <hi>Caesar</hi> declar'd an Enemy to the Republick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did this stop <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Cariere?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He continues his March to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was abandon'd by <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whither went <hi>Pompey?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To <hi>Brundusium,</hi> from whence he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes by Night into <hi>Epirus,</hi> where he was pursued by <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not <hi>Caesar</hi> repass the <hi>Adriatic</hi> alone in a Fisherman's Boat?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and when the Master began to despond of safety, cheer'd him with <hi>Quid times, Caesarem vehis.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was there a Battel between them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At first <hi>Pompey</hi> had great Advantages over him, and had certainly ruin'd him, if he had known how to have used his good fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then did he miscarry?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Instead of protracting the War, and starving his Enemy, which he might easily have done, he fights <hi>Caesar</hi> at <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> where he was totally defeated in the Year 706. After this, he flies towards <hi>Egypt</hi> to King <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; but before he reach'd the Shore, his Throat was cut in the Long-boat by <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Septimius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it not in this Voyage that <hi>Caesar</hi> became passionately in love with <hi>Cleopatra?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; but her Brother <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who thought to have obliged <hi>Caesar</hi> everlastingly by dispatching of <hi>Pompey,</hi> finding himself not so well receiv'd as he expected;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Resolved to destroy him, did he not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right, and besieged him in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where with a handful of Men, <hi>Caesar</hi> for a while kept off a Numerous Army; at last, by setting the Neighbouring Buildings on fire, where the finest Library in the World (which is supposed among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other Curiosities now lost, to have had <hi>Solomon</hi>'s History of Plants) was unluckily burnt to the ground, he makes his Escape to the <hi>Pharos,</hi> and from thence with his

Sword in one hand, and his Commentaries in the other, Swims to his Fleet; and after he had entirely defeated <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Forces, who was drown'd in endeavouring to save himself by flight, he puts the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the hands of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Actions did <hi>Caesar</hi> perform af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He beats <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> Son to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who had assisted <hi>Pompey</hi> with his Troops in Thessaly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was remarable in this Victory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas so easy and sudden, that <hi>Caesar</hi> writ no more than these three Words to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Friends of it, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi> When this was done, he vanquishes <hi>Iuba,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who encouraged by <hi>L. Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> renewed the Civil War in <hi>Afric.</hi> Here he causes <hi>Afranius,</hi> and Three hundred Senators to be slain, who still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to support that Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> what did <hi>Caesar</hi> apply himself to?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To reform the Calender, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly added Ten days to the Year, which <hi>Numa</hi> had made to consist of only Twelve Lunar Months, that is to say, of 355 Days; whereas by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s new Alteration, it was made to consist of 365 Days, and 6 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Hours; reserving the six Hours to the end of every fourth year to make a compleat Day, which he placed before the 6th of the Calends of <hi>March.</hi>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95582:61"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was the Year named which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 366 Days?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Bissextile</hi>; because the Sixth of the Calends was twice reckon'd that Year. This manner of Computation was called the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> from <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> the Inventor of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When was <hi>Caesar</hi> declar'd Perpetual Dictator by the Senate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After he had vanquish'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Honours did they pay him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Temple was dedicated to him as to a God, which so far possessed him with Pride, that he slighted them, and began to set up for a Sovereign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not this the Cause of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy that was form'd against him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who were the chief Contrivers of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Marcus Brutus,</hi> and <hi>L. Cassius, D. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Trebonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not his Death manifestly foretold by some strange Presages?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; but he contemn'd and neglected them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of Presages were they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some months before his Death, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Astrologer, whose name was <hi>Spurina,</hi> told him, That the Ides of <hi>March</hi> would prove fatal to him. <hi>Calpurnia</hi> his Wife, the night before he was kill'd, dreamt that the Cieling of the House fell down, and that her Husband was murder'd between her

Arms. Nay, the very day he was assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, having order'd some Beasts to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, he found them all defective.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> These Prognosties, and his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, did they not make him consider with himself for some time, whether he should go out or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They made that impression on him, that he was once minded to put off what he had to propose to the Senate till another day; but at last, at the repeated instances of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who represented to him that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Being on his way thither, did not some Passages happen to him, which might very well incline him to return home?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Spurina</hi> the <hi>Augur</hi> met him to whom says <hi>Caesar</hi> with a laughing Countenance, <hi>Well,</hi> Spurina, <hi>behold the</hi> Ides of March <hi>are come. Right,</hi> said he, <hi>but they are not yet past.</hi> After that an unknown person presented him with a Petition in the streets, wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him of the Conspiracy; but <hi>Caesar</hi> mingled them among some other Papers, telling him he would see immediately what it contain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What befel him after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being arrived to the Senate-House, he was accosted by one <hi>Cimber,</hi> under pretence of supplicating him to recal home a Brother

of his, who had been banished some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a Decree of the Senate: But <hi>Caesar</hi> refusing then to do it, and referring it to another time, <hi>Cimber</hi> seized upon the two sleeves of his Robe; and <hi>Caesar</hi> crying out against this Violence, all the Conspirators, who had given one another the Signal, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, and stabb'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who gave him the First Blow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One whose name was <hi>Casea,</hi> who wounded him a little below the Throat.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd aftewards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Caesar,</hi> who neither wanted Courage nor Vigor, seized upon his Ponyard, and made some effort to escape, but being at the same time run through in several places, and perceiving among the other Assassines <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Brutus,</hi> for whom he always exprest a mighty tenderness, he says to him in <hi>Greek, What, you too, my Son!</hi> and then covering his Head with his Robe, he fell down at the feet of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue, having received Twenty three Thrusts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became of his Body?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he buried in any State?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was any thing done in Honour to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s Memory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The People erected a Pillar to him in the <hi>Forum,</hi> Twenty Foot high, with this Inscription, <hi>Patriae Patri.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They order'd the Gates of the Palace where he was murder'd to be walled up; that the <hi>Ides of March</hi> should for the future be call'd the <hi>Parricidal Ides</hi>; and that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate should never meet on that day.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> So strangely abandon'd to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that his open Familiarities with <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> expos'd him to the Laughter and Invectives of the whole world. He was call'd Queen of <hi>Bithynia</hi> by <hi>Bibulus,</hi> who was his unactive, untalk'd-of Brother Consul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not he extremely given to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He debauch'd several, and those of the highest Quality, among the rest, <hi>Posthumia</hi> Wife to <hi>Servius Sulpitius; Tertulla</hi> Wife to <hi>M. Crassus</hi>; and <hi>Mutia</hi> Wife to <hi>Pompey</hi>: But the Lady with whom he was principally in Love, was <hi>Servilia,</hi> Mother of that <hi>Brutus</hi> who assassinated him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Princess was it that he most passionately adored?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Cleopatra,</hi> with whom he frequently spent whole nights a feasting; nay, he had bore her company as far as <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95582:64"/>
that his Soldiers positively refus'd to follow him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not he carry her to <hi>Rome</hi> with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; where he receiv'd her with all imaginable respect, and loaded her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Presents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had he any Children by her?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. That he was the Man of all the Women, and the Woman of all the Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not he a man of Learning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was the most Eloquent man of his time. He has left behind him some Orations, with a Commentary of his Actions: He could <hi>Write</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> at the same time, and <hi>Hear</hi> what was said to him: He made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to dictate at once to Four Secretaries, nay sometimes to Seven, upon different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. His History, tho naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adorn'd, is writ in a most Pure and Elegant Stile, and has been valued by all Nations. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> who resembled him in his Unfortunate End, as well as his Heroic Actions, translated that part of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>French,</hi> which related to the War of the <hi>Gauls. Quintilian</hi> says of him, <hi>That he Spoke, Writ, and Fought, with the same Spirit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many Wives had he?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> She came of an <hi>Equestrian</hi> Family, and was extremely rich; but he repudiated her, to marry <hi>Cornelia. Cornelia</hi> was Daughter to <hi>Cinna</hi>; by her he had <hi>Iulia,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Wife. <hi>Pompeia</hi> was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Claudius Pompey,</hi> and Niece of <hi>Sylla</hi>; he married her after the Death of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> but got himself soon divorced from her, upon a suspicion of her having committed Adultery with <hi>Claudius,</hi> in the Temple of the Goddess <hi>Bona.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it was not enough for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be chaste, but she must likewise take care to avoid all Suspicion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who was <hi>Calpurnia?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Turn of his Face was Oval; his Forehead smooth, a <hi>Roman</hi> Nose, Black Lively Eyes, his Lips large, his Complexion White and Lovely, of High Stature, the

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His chief Talent lay in dissimulation, and he was universally hated for his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Covetousness, his Debaucheries, and his Pride.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He conceal'd all his Faults from the world with admirable address and dexterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What obliged him to stand so much upon his guard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he was afraid of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> Son to his Brother <hi>Drusus,</hi> whom he had adopted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He dispatch'd him out of the way, because he was jealous of his growing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He committed a thousand Crimes; and his Insolence carried him so far as to say, That he was Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> was only Prince of <hi>Capreae,</hi> a small Isle near <hi>Naples,</hi> where he used to retire.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.

               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He made his Horse be declared Consul in full Senate; he banish'd <hi>Livy</hi>'s Statue and Writings from all Libraries; he gave <hi>Virgil</hi> the same Treatment, and would have suppress'd the Verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> pretending his Power ought to be no less than <hi>Plato</hi>'s, who had prohibited the Reading of them in his Imaginary Republick. Lastly, as he hated <hi>Seneca,</hi> and all men of Eminent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it came into his head to abolish not only the Laws, but all the Living Oracles of them, the most celebrated Lawyers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had not he a mighty Ambition to ride a Horseback over the Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To accomplish this unaccountable Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he built a Bridge of Gallies from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pales</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He magnificently feasted all such whom their Curiosity had brought thither, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards caus'd them to be thrown into the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Having quitted <hi>Rome</hi> to go and fight the <hi>Britains,</hi> what fine Employment did he set his Army upon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He only made them gather Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did they Rifle it accordingly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for happening to find <hi>Tiberius Claudius Nero</hi> there, who hid himself for fear of being kill'd, they carried him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Camp, and proclaim'd him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and the reason was, because he refused to gratify her Lust.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being one day oblig'd to Sign a Dead Warrant for a Criminal, he seem'd to be touch'd with so much Compassion, that he wish'd he could not write. <hi>O quam vellem me nescire literas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which was his principal Vice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> With whom did he begin to exercise that barbarous Quality?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He first poysons <hi>Britannicus.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What farther barbarous Acts did he commit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He put his Mother <hi>Agrippina</hi> to Death, after he had for a long time before stript her of all Authority, nay, and turn'd her out of Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After he had caus'd her to dye, what did he more?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95582:78"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He had a mind to behold her all naked as she lay, and brutally said, That he did not think his Mother had been so fine a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he make any farther Progresses in his Barbarity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He took away <hi>Otho</hi>'s Wife, named <hi>Poppea Sabina</hi>; he repudiated <hi>Octavia,</hi> and afterwards put her to Death; and shortly after, he kick'd the abovemention'd <hi>Poppea</hi> so that she died of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was no Conspiracy form'd against him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Piso</hi> contrived one against him, and had engaged several Gentlemen in it, but <hi>Nero</hi> happening to discover the Author and his Accomplices, among whom were the Poet <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> he put them all to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein did his Vanity chiefly lye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He mightily valued himself for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well upon the Harp in the Theatre, and Singing his part with the Comedians: Nay, he made a Voyage as far as <hi>Greece,</hi> to let the <hi>Grecians</hi> see he was a good Musitian, and a good Actor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who was it he married instead of a Woman?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pythagoras</hi> his <hi>Libertus,</hi> or Freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had he not a Natural Inclination to mischief?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95582:79"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was so strangely inclin'd that way, that he frequently said King <hi>Pream</hi> was the happiest Prince in the world, for having the satisfaction to see his Country all in Flames, before he lost his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had he not a great fancy to represent the burning of <hi>Troy</hi> by that of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One night he distributed his Guards through all parts of the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to set the Houses on fire; which they so diligently executed, that in a short time the whole Town was in a flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where was <hi>Nero</hi> all this while?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Upon <hi>Maecenas</hi>'s Tower, from whence he beheld the Fire, and sung some of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Verses upon the Destruction of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whom did he charge with this Action?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As he had a mortal hatred to the Christians, he accused them with having set the City on fire, and put several of 'em to death for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it not he who began to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them first at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Right; and made them suffer Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which till that time were unknown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Armenia</hi> taken by one of his Generals?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Domitius Corbulo,</hi> sufficiently famous for conquering the <hi>Frisians,</hi> took and burnt <hi>Artaxata</hi> the Metropolis of the Country, beat out the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and sent <hi>Tiridates</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he received a Diadem from <hi>Nero</hi>: Yet after all these considerable Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95582:79"/>
being sent for into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Nero,</hi> he was forced to lay hands on himself, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a more ignominious death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was this Tyrant beloved by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for so many Crimes having drawn upon him the Contempt and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the whole Empire, <hi>Vindex</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, and Governor of <hi>Gaul</hi> revolted first against him, and declared <hi>Galba</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Spain,</hi> Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In the mean while was <hi>Rufus</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>High-Germany</hi> unactive?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He enter'd <hi>Gaul</hi> with a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to join <hi>Vindex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what happen'd upon this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Army, which knew nothing of his intention, fell upon that of <hi>Vindex,</hi> and cut it to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Vindex</hi> do when he saw this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Imagining that <hi>Rufus</hi> had betray'd him, and inrag'd at the intire loss of his Troops, he out of despair kill'd himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the upshot of all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>German</hi> Army join'd the small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the <hi>Gaulish,</hi> and then <hi>Rufus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd <hi>Galba</hi> Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Nero</hi> terribly alarm'd at this Revolt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Instead of preparing himself for a Battel, he resolved to make his Escape into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> saying, he could get his Livelihood any where by his Acting and Singing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:95582:80"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did his Guards behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, seeing him so strangely pusillanimous?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They all forsook him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whither then did <hi>Nero</hi> retire to save himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He stole privately out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hid himself in a Cave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the Senate perceiv'd that, what Resolutions did they take?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They declar'd him at the same time an Enemy to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> condemn'd him to dye, and sent out Soldiers every where to go and apprehend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, what befel him at last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Finding there was no hopes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his wretched life any longer, and yet not having Courage enough to hasten Death with his own hands, he desir'd <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> one of his Free'd-men to kill him, who broke his Ponyard as he endeavour'd to do him that kindness, but at last made a shift to dispatch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Nero</hi> the last Emperor of the <hi>Augustean</hi> Family?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> After what manner did he end his days?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being at the point of death, he rais'd himself on the sudden, and cried out, <hi>Oportet Imperatorem stantem mori,</hi> An Emperor ought to dye standing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How old was he when he died?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He was Sixty nine years old, he reign'd Ten years within Ten days, and hasten'd his Death by drinking too much cold water.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was of an indifferent Stature, but thick, his Visage red, his Shoulders large, his Constitution vigorous, his Looks cheerful, his behaviour courteous, a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Mien, his Temper civil, but cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it not he that gave occasion to the Proverb, <hi>To shooe a Mule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did it happen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being once in the Countrey, a man who desir'd to speak with him, gave some Money to the Muleteer who conducted his Litter, to stop it, and make as if he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shooe his Mule.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the Emperor smell out the trick?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He immediately gave Audience to the man that had a desire to talk with him, but ask'd his Muleteer how much Money he got by shooing his Mule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he not constrain'd to lay several Taxes upon the people?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; because his Predecessors had by their Luxury quite exhausted the Publick Treasury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it not he that laid an Excise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Urine?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He told him, No. <hi>And yet for all that,</hi> says the Emperor, <hi>this very Piece came from the Excise upon Vrine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He immediately quitted the Natural
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95582:86"/>
Propensity he had to Lewdness, and treated every one with that sweetness, that he was called <hi>The Love and Delight of all Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> What were the first Instances he gave of his Clemency?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He pardon'd two Persons of Quality who had conspir'd against him; he likewise pardon'd his Brother <hi>Domitian,</hi> who had form'd a second Conspiracy against him, and instead of punishing him, declared him his Successor in the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How died he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Brother <hi>Domitian,</hi> notwithstanding he had pardon'd him before, dispatch'd him by Poison, when he was aged Forty one years, and after he had reign'd Two Years, Two Months, and Twenty Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other demonstrations did <hi>Titus</hi> give of his Mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis said he never refus'd any thing which was asked of him; and would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently say, That a Prince ought not to send back any of his Subjects sad or discontented from his presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is besides reported of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One Night as he was at Supper, he remembred himself that he had done good to no body that day, <hi>My Friends,</hi> says he to those that were about him, <hi>I have lost a Day, Diem perdidi.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable Passages happen'd during his Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A prodigious quantity of Fire and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95582:87"/>
Ashes broke forth from <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> which were thrown as far as <hi>Afric, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not this Irruption do a great deal of damage?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Pliny</hi> the Elder being desirous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this terrible Spectacle, was suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Flames, and several Cities were ruin'd by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was it that <hi>Titus</hi> said as he was going to dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he only repented himself of one thing, but did not express what it was: 'Tis imagin'd that it was because he had not put his Brother <hi>Domitian</hi> to death, and clear'd the Empire of so wicked and cruel a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had he not a great value for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and People of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for tho he was passionately in Love with Queen <hi>Berenice,</hi> yet he refused to marry her, because he thought the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> would disapprove of the Match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of a man was he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was of the common Stature, the Features of his Face very good, his Belly somewhat of the largest; of a courteous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, a sweet insinuating Mien, a Noble Air, which inspir'd all those that beheld him both with Love and Respect.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and younger Brother to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he like his Father?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; and much less did he resemble his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> since he was one of the most profligate Monsters that ever lived, and was not inferior to <hi>Nero</hi> in Cruelty, Avarice, and Incontinence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what did he chiefly excel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was so great a Master at his Bow, that he would frequently order a man to be set with his hand stretch'd out, and his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers open, and then he would shoot between his fingers, and never touch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was his constant Occupation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He pass'd whole days in his Closet alone, where he diverted himself with the Royal Sport of Fly-catching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not some-body rally him upon this occasion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A certain Person of Quality having one day asked, Who was with the Emperor in his Closet? answer was made him, That not so much as a Fly was with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he perform any Warlike Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95582:88"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He triumph'd twice over the <hi>Daci</hi> and the <hi>Catti.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who was his chief Confident?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One <hi>Martial,</hi> whom he particularly affected; I don't mean the Poet of that name, but another to whom that Poet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses several of his Epigrams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> To what extravagant Actions did his Folly lead him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He must needs pass for a god, and so commands several Statues of Silver and Gold to be erected to his own Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other strange Frolicks did he play?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being minded one day to put the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors into a dismal Fright, he invited a great number of them to come and sup with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, and when they came there, how were they receiv'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He orders them to be lock'd up in a Hall hung with Black, and only lighted by a few Lamps, by the light of which they could discern several Coffins, upon each of which were written the names of those that were invited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not this terrible Scene possess them with strange apprehensions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for after they had continued some time in these cruel imaginations, some naked persons whose Bodies were blacken'd all over, entred the Hall with Swords in one hand, and flaming Torches in the other.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did they not give themselves all for lost?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; but after these black men had danced a pretty while about them, they open'd the doors, saying, The Emperor gave all the Company leave to withdraw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was <hi>Domitian</hi>'s usual way to make himself remember the Names of those whom he design'd to put to death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He writ their Names down in a Table-Book, but it cost him very dear; for having among several others set down the Names of his Wife <hi>Domitia, Norbanus, Petronius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi>;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What happen'd upon it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Domitia,</hi> who very well knew the Table Book, having accidentally lighted upon it one day, she show'd it to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose Names were written down there, as well as her own, in order to oblige them to concert matters with her, and dispatch <hi>Domitian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was <hi>Domitian</hi>'s end?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Stephanus</hi> stabb'd him with a Ponyard in his Closet; but the Guards running in immediately to his assistance, they soon kill'd <hi>Stephanus</hi> among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> a-doing at the moment when this happen'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He harangu'd the people of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but stopt himself in the midst of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and after he had continued silent for some time, he cry'd aloud, <hi>Courage,</hi> Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,

                  <hi>Strike the Tyrant</hi>; and a moment after, says he, <hi>The Tyrant is dead, he is just now slain.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What else do Historians remark of <hi>Domitian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He persecuted the Christians through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. 'Twas he that banished St. <hi>Iohn</hi> into the Isle of <hi>Patmos</hi>; tho others lay it upon <hi>Nero,</hi> which is the more probable of the two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Learned Writers flourished in his time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That Sonorous Enthusiastic Poet <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; Martial</hi> the Witty Epigrammatist; <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> the declaiming Satyrist; that celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Institutor of Youth <hi>Quintilian; Muso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Philosopher; <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> a notorious Impostor and Pretender to Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that most excellent Historian <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who has writ the Antiquities of his own Countreymen: And for the Art Military, there was <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> who sailed round <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by him conquer'd, and was the first <hi>Roman</hi> that discover'd it to be an Island. He found and subdued the <hi>Orkney</hi> Islands: But notwithstanding these great services, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> dispatch'd him by Poison.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At <hi>Colen</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and was the first Foreigner that got possession of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who was his Master?</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of a man was he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was one of the greatest Generals that ever sate upon a Throne: He was Sweet-temper'd, Merciful, and Prudent: Nay, he was so charitable to his Soldiers who were wounded in his Wars with the <hi>Dacians,</hi> that he tore off his own Shirt from his Back to bind up their Wounds, when they had no Linnen of their own.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Conquests did he make?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He attack'd the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and took from them <hi>Armenia, Persia, Seleucia, Babylon,</hi> and reduced a very considerable part of <hi>Asia,</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for the glorious Exploits he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ambassadors visited him from all parts of the world; nay, some came from as far as the <hi>Indies</hi> to compliment him upon those occasions.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable Presents were made him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was presented with a Horse from <hi>Armenia,</hi> which fell down upon his knees as often as he went to mount him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what other Actions did he increase his Reputation with the People?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> There was so prodigious an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at <hi>Antioch,</hi> while he and the whole Court lay there, that the City was almost totally destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how did <hi>Trajan</hi> make a shift to save himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He escaped through the Windows of the Room where he lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where died he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At <hi>Selinus,</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> whither he ordered himself to be carried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> What respect was paid him after his Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Ashes were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and placed in a Golden Urn on the top of a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of a prodigious Heighth and curious Workmanship, which he had caus'd to be erected in the publick Place, and which is to this day call'd <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long did he Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ten years Six months and Fifteen days; he lived Sixty three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What remarkable things do you find in his Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two: The first of them was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd Confidence he repos'd in one of his Friends, whose Name was <hi>Sura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did he make it appear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some Persons, who envied him for the great share he possess'd in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Friendship, strove by all imaginable means to blast his Reputation, and render him suspected to his Master. They accus'd
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95582:92"/>
him with forming a Design against his Life; but <hi>Trajan</hi> to let them see how far he relied upon the Honesty of his Friend, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Invitation to Sup with him, went thither freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, and what did he do there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After he had sent back his Guards, he orders <hi>Sura</hi>'s Physitian and Barber, to be call'd to him; the former he commands to take off the Hair about his Eye-brows, and the latter to shave his Beard. After this, he goes to a Bath, and then sits down very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned with the rest of the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What said he to his Friends next Morning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He recounted to them every thing in order as it passed, and told them, That if <hi>Sura</hi> had any Intentions to kill him, he gave him the fairest opportunity the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do it, that a man could wish; and since he had neglected it, it was an infallible indication that he had no such design in his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the second remarkable thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Trajan</hi> in giving his Sword to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the Guards, according to the usual Custom, utter'd these glorious Words, <hi>Take this Sword, and if I govern like a Iust Prince, employ it in my Service; but if I abuse my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, draw it against me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What added he afterwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he who gave Laws to the rest of the World, lay under greater Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95582:92"/>
to observe them, than any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Title did the <hi>Romans</hi> bestow upon him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> They gave him the Sir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not his Memory exceeding dear to Posterity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was held in so great esteem, that in succeeding Times, when an Emperor was promoted to this high Dignity, amidst the other Acclamations that were made in the Senate-house, they used to wish that he would prove as happy as <hi>Augustus,</hi> and as good as <hi>Trajan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What answer did he make his Friends, who were Reproaching him one day with his too great Condescention and Good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he lived with his Subjects, just as he would have wished them to live with him, if they had been the Masters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Faults or Vices do you observe in him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two very great ones. The first, that he was given to excessive Drinking. The second, that he loved young Boys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was his Wife's Name?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Plotina,</hi> who in some Ancient Medals is represented with a very tall Head-dress, much resembling the Modern Commodes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Learned Men flourish'd in his time?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how did she carry on this Affair?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As soon as the Emperor was dead, she sent a forged Declaration immediately to the Senate under his hand, whereby he adopts <hi>Adrian,</hi> and declares him his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. In the mean time she dexterously conceals his Death, till <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Adoption was confirm'd by the Authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did <hi>Adrian</hi> make any Conquests?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So far from that, that he devoted himself wholly to Peace, and abandon'd <hi>Assyria, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he loved to be always Travelling abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Reasons did he alledge for so doing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He used to say, That a Prince ought to imitate the <hi>Sun,</hi> who carries his Light
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95582:94"/>
through all the Corners of the World, and illuminates all the Regions of the Earth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He separated the <hi>Britains</hi> from the <hi>Picts,</hi> by a Wall Forty Leagues long, which took up the whole breadth of the Island, and reached from the <hi>German</hi>-Ocean to the <hi>Irish</hi>-Sea; it was likewise fortified by a Ditch of the same length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore built he this prodigious Wall.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> There was ne're a man in his Empire, who knew so many several things in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several Professions.

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Son of <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and the Lustful <hi>Faustina.</hi> But some say that he was begotten by a Gladiator.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was the Handsomest, but the Lewdest and most Vicious man of his Age. As for the Administration of State-Affairs, he wholly intrusted them with <hi>Perennis,</hi> a Person of great Ambition and Cruelty, whom he had constituted his <hi>Praefectus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torij,</hi> or Captain of his Guards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do Historians particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late concerning him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he was so admirable an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, that one day having order'd a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Lyons to be let loose one after another, he kill'd them all. At another time he did the same by a Hundred Ostriches, and cut off their Heads with his Arrows, which were headed in the fashion of an Half-moon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did he behave himself towards his Sister <hi>Lucilla?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He caused her to be put to death for having conspired to advance her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the Imperial Dignity, who was only a bare Senator of <hi>Rome.</hi> She was first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Emperor <hi>Verus.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> In commanding himself to be call'd <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Iupiter</hi>: Nor was his Cruelty less predominant than his Ambition; for he sacrificed all those to his barbarous Resentments, of whom he had the least suspicion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How happen'd she to receive that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the means of a Child who found the Emperor's Table-Book, wherein she found her own Death design'd.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What prompted him to serve her so?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Commodus</hi> (who spent his time at Court among Strumpets and Catamites, and abroad with Fencing-Masters and Bullies) had it seems resolv'd to lye in the Gladiators Amphitheatre, in order to go out with them the next morning, and harangue the people in that blessed Company: Now she had taken the freedom to remonstrate to him how mightily this would sink his Reputation, and how contemptible it would render him to the whole world.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but they compell'd him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it. He endeavour'd to avoid it by recommending <hi>Glabrio</hi> a Senator to their Choice, who, as he said, was a man of far greater Merit than himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray acquaint me with his Character?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was an exceeding Valiant, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, Modest, and Sweet-temper'd Prince: He would not suffer his Wife to be call'd <hi>Augusta</hi> or Empress, nor his Son to be salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Title of <hi>Caesar.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what reason?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he show'd himself too severe towards them, and design'd to keep them under Military Discipline; so they cut off his Head, and carried it to the Camp, where they fortified themselves. Seeing no body stir, they order'd one of the Soldiers to make Proclamation, That the Empire was to be sold, and that he who bid the most should be put into the Possession of it by the Army.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> To his Two Sons, whom he carried along with him in that Expedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what reason did he carry them with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To remove them from <hi>Rome,</hi> where they lived in all manner of Excess.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was <hi>Geta</hi>'s Character?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was of a sweet easy Disposition, as his Brother <hi>Caracalla</hi> was naturally brutish and outragious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What barbarous Action did that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster commit in the Second Year of his Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He kill'd his Brother <hi>Geta</hi> with his own hand, in the presence of his Mother <hi>Iulia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Instances can you give me of his Cruelty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He not only put above Two thousand persons to Death for adhering to his Brother's Party, but he banished several more, and cut off <hi>Papinian</hi>'s Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what reason?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he refused to flatter his Crime; for having desired him to write an Apology to excuse his Brother's Death, this eminent Lawyer told him, That it was much easier to Commit a Parricide, than to justify it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it that Historians report of his Mother <hi>Iulia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That she had the Impudence to marry him, after <hi>Geta</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Person did <hi>Caracalla</hi> imagine himself to be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He fancied he was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, because his Head lean'd a little upon one Shoulder, as that Prince's did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is particularly observable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:95582:103"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Empire was never so harass'd with Imposts and Taxes, as it was under this Monster of Prodigality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the reason why he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd his Subjects so severely?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He would frequently maintain, That Money ought not to be lodged in private hands, but that all should go to his Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer to be distributed among the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became of him at last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> While he was making War against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he writ to <hi>Materninus,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Rome,</hi> to consult the Astrologers, to know what fortune <hi>Macrinus</hi> the <hi>Praefectus Praetorij</hi> would come to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> To whom was the Governor's Answer carried?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was deliver'd to <hi>Caracalla</hi> himself, while he was busied in managing a very fine Horse in the presence of <hi>Macrinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did he read it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; he gave it to <hi>Macrinus</hi> to read, who spoke not one word of it to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but wholly employ'd himself to find out a person that would kill him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he find one ready to execute his design?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He met one <hi>Martial</hi> after a little search, whose Brother <hi>Caracalla</hi> had put to death, who receiv'd this Commission with great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness, and run him through the body while he was easing Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long did he reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:95582:104"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Six Years, Two Months, and Five Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was he beloved by the People?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; he was hated by all the world, except the Soldiers only, who regretted his Loss by reason of the excessive Largesses he frequently bestow'd upon them.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He fastens him to a Post, where he was choak'd by the smoke of a heap of wood which was set on fire about him. Over the Post this Inscription was to be seen, <hi>Fumo periit qui fumum vendidit.</hi> He that sold Smoke is stifled by Smoke.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Having reviv'd the old Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, he defeated the <hi>Persians</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Africans</hi> in <hi>Mauritania.</hi> At last, wholly turning his thoughts upon the <hi>German</hi> War, he with his Mother <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea</hi> was slain by his Soldiers at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the 39th. year of his Age, having reign'd Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years, and Nineteen days. 'Twas his Mother's Penuriousness that ruin'd him with the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Eminent men flourish'd in his Reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Dion Cassius,</hi> twice honour'd with the Consular Dignity, who writ the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story very acurately in <hi>Greek</hi>: The greatest part of this Excellent Work is now lost; which is chiefly attributed to his Abbreviator <hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> a <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Monk. Thus the loss of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> is imputed to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> as that of <hi>Livy</hi> to <hi>Lucius Florus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Shepherd's, in a small Village of <hi>Thrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Stature was he of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> An extraordinary one, being Eight Foot high; and besides he was so strong, that he could draw a Chariot as heavy laden as two Horses could draw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How got he himself advanced to the Empire?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By a Faction of the Soldiers. He was the first Emperor that without any Decree of the Senate obtain'd the Purple by the sole Authority of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What method did he take to preserve himself in this Dignity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After he had successfully ended the Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> he exercised great Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Rome</hi>; Some he fastned to Crosses, where they miserably perish'd; others he baited in the Skins of Beasts, and expos'd them to Tigers and Lions; others were kill'd with Bastinadoes; in short, there was no sort of Barbarity to be named, which he did not use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not these Brutalities draw the aversion of all the world upon him?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Senate declar'd him an Enemy to the Republic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who first made Head against him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Gordianus</hi> the Governor of <hi>Afric,</hi> a man Eighty years old, was, together with his Son, against his will elevated to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but Fortune crossing his Attempts, and his Son being slain by the <hi>Moors,</hi> the old Gentleman out of despair hang'd himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the Senate heard of the death of these two great men, whom did they elect for their Emperor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Pupienus,</hi> two of their own Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Maximin</hi> highly incens'd at the Proceedings of the Senate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He immediately quitted the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> War, and marching into <hi>Italy</hi> at the Head of his Army he besieged <hi>Aquileia,</hi> which was the first City he met in his way, and was at that time the finest and most flourishing Town in all <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who signaliz'd themselves in this Siege?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Women; for the Soldiers want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cordage to string their Bows, and serve the Machines that were employ'd in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of stones, they cut off their own Hair, and made Cords of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became of <hi>Maximin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Soldiers slew him and his Son in his Tent, because he had occasion'd the death of so many of them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was of a very mean Birth, and came from <hi>Pannonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of a man was he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was extremely Generous, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95582:115"/>
Cruel and Bloody, which occasion'd the famous Saying, <hi>That he was a good Physician, but took away too much blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he do as soon as he was elected Emperor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He wore a Diadem, which none of his Predecessors had ever done before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he make any Warlike Expeditions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He vanquish'd the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni</hi> in <hi>Vindelicia,</hi> which comprehended the same Tract of Ground as <hi>Bavaria</hi> does now. Then marching towards the <hi>East,</hi> he takes <hi>Zenobia</hi> Prisoner, recovers <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all <hi>Asia,</hi> and in short, enlarges the Empire to its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the Wars were over, how did he employ himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He triumph'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Captive <hi>Zenobia</hi> made no small part of the Spectacle; but he was enrag'd at some Seditions which had arose there in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Authors of which he severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd; nay, even some Senators, for faults which a milder Prince would have pass'd by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did the <hi>Romans</hi> relish this Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They began to fear him, and say that he deserv'd to be assassinated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where, and after what manner died he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Thrace,</hi> where he lay with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army to attack the <hi>Persians</hi>; and as he was upon the March between <hi>Byzantium</hi> and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95582:115"/>
                  <hi>Heraclea,</hi> he was slain by <hi>Mucaporus</hi> at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of <hi>Mnestheus,</hi> his Freed-man and Secretary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long did he reign?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Five Years compleatly.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was his Death unreveng'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for the Villany of <hi>Mnestheus</hi> being immediately discover'd, he was condemn'd to be thrown to Wild Beasts, and the whole Army celebrated the Funeral of <hi>Aurelianus</hi> after a most Magnificent manner.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They were so fortunate in all their Attempts against the Enemies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that they obtain'd as many Victories as they fought Battels; and after they had spent ten years thus in their Wars, crown'd with Glory and Success, they entred all four Triumphantly into <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Diocletian</hi> caused himself to be call'd <hi>Iovianus,</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> took the Title of <hi>Herculianus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To the great amazement of all the world, both of them voluntarily quitted the Empire, <hi>Diocletian</hi> at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> at <hi>Milan.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Diocletian</hi> reign'd almost Twenty Years, and <hi>Maximian</hi> Eighteen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was not <hi>Diocletian</hi> a cruel Persecutor of the Christians?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Out of an implacable Malice to the Professors of that Religion, he design'd to extirpate them utterly out of the world; and what by the Cruelty of his Edicts, the Bigotry of his Ministers, and the barbarous Variety of his Torments, made a greater havock of them than any of his Predecessors. In <hi>Egypt</hi> only, a Hundred and fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand are said to be put to death, and Seven hundred thousand sent into Banishment. The <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion, together with their Commander <hi>Mauritius,</hi> were cut off by <hi>Maximian</hi>; but this relation by some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Critics is look'd upon to be Fabulous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Was not <hi>Maximian</hi> soon weary of this retired life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and being desirous to leave it, in order to reassume the Imperial Dignity, he earnestly importunes <hi>Diocletian</hi> to remedy

those Evils which <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Galerius</hi> had occasion'd by their ill conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What answer did <hi>Diocletian</hi> return him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Showing him the Coleworts growing in his Garden, he told him he took a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleasure to plant them, than to govern the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What courses did <hi>Maximian</hi> take, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself despised and neglected by all the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He withdrew to his Daughter, who was the Wife of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage her to poison her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, she discover'd his Perfidiousness to <hi>Constantius,</hi> who caus'd him to be slain.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Character?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was of an agreeable, sweet, and merciful Disposition; but as for <hi>Galerius</hi> he was of a quite contrary temper, he declared himself a mortal Enemy of the Christians, and massacred a whole Town of them in <hi>Phrygia</hi>; nay, he would have fain engaged <hi>Constantius</hi> to persecute them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Judgments did these Cruelties draw down upon his head?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God permitted him to be seized by an infamous and nasty Disease, during which he saw himself devour'd alive by Worms, and so died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did <hi>Constantius</hi> behave himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Making as if he really design'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Christians, he commanded all the Officers of his Houshold, who were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to change their Religion, otherwise they should lose their Places.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Several of them were so; but the Emperor sent them away with disgrace, saying, That those who were not true to their God, would never be faithful to their Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did he treat those that continued firm in their Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He kept them still in his Service, and highly commended their Fidelity.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> His Son <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized himself exceedingly by his Courage, and a thousand noble Actions.</p>
               <p>

How great a Warrier he was, the <hi>Alemans, Franks</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> whom he overcame, do testify, and his remaining Works are undeniable proofs of his Wit and Ingenuity.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Don't Historians observe some defects in him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He had some, but such as would not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95582:131"/>
have appear'd so conspicuous in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fortune; he had an incurable aversion to State-affairs, which ought to have taken up his most serious moments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not this sink his Reputation mightily with his Subjects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and what they could not suffer but with the utmost indignation, was to see him freequently prefer a Barbarian Soldier to a <hi>Roman,</hi> although the <hi>Roman</hi> was the elder of the two, and had more merits to plead.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he found himself not strong enough to support so furious a War as he was then engaged in; and besides the <hi>Goths</hi> ravaged <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the other Provinces of the Empire at pleasure.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Character do Historians bestow upon him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he was inferior to none of his Predecessors either in Virtue or Merit; that he never made War but out of meer neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and was successful in all his Military Undertakings: In fine, that his Goodness charm'd all the world; and his engaging Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour gain'd him the hearts of all that approach'd him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was naturally Choleric, but he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom suffer'd his Passion to get the better of him, and then after some short intervals it was no difficult matter to appease him.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which was the last Victory that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> obtain'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas that which he gain'd over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> whose Troops had join'd those of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogastes,</hi> who had caus'd <hi>Valentinian</hi> to be strangled in his own Palace at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Theodosius</hi> then vanquish'd these two Tyrants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and 'twas rather by a particular Protection of Heaven, than any human strength.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What became of them?</p>

                  <hi>A. Eugenius</hi> was taken Prisoner, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogastes</hi> kill'd himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great live long after these Victories?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for shortly after this Generous Prince died at <hi>Milan,</hi> A. D. 395. being Fifty Years old, according to the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Hunns,</hi> the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who in their turn ravaged the several Provinces of it, erecting new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and establishing their Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms where ever they came.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> By whom was <hi>Rome</hi> taken?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was taken and retaken by <hi>Alarie</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> A. D. 410. and about 1163 years after the building of it. For the space of three days, this Imperial City, which for Nine hundred years had defied the Attacks of all its Enemies, even of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> himself, was ravag'd and plunder'd at the discretion of the barbarous Conquerors. Not long after it was taken by <hi>Totila,</hi> and after him by <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> who made so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent an Entry into it, that St. <hi>Austin,</hi> wholly astonish'd at so prodigious a show, wished that he had seen three things upon earth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Iesus Christ</hi> in the flesh, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and Ancient <hi>Rome</hi> in its splendor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for some time make a happy Progress?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It advanc'd rather than decreas'd from <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> down to <hi>Nero</hi>; but afterwards <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> so weaken'd it by their Civil Wars, that it was scarce in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to preserve it self from the Insults of its Enemies.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who restored this Empire to its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Splendor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, as it possess'd the greatest Extent of Ground, so it visibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd its former Reputation. From that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod it by degrees declin'd till the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, who by putting an end to

all intestine Broils, retriev'd in some manner its ancient Credit; but through a fatal ill management did it a greater Injury at last, than all his Predecessors before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did that happen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First he transplanted the Seat of the Empire from <hi>Rome,</hi> where it had so long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, to <hi>Constantinople</hi>; by which means he abandon'd <hi>Italy</hi> and the Provinces which lay nearest it, to the Invasion of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and what was equally dangerous, to the Ambitious Attempts of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had always a mighty hankering after Temporals. Next, he considerably enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it by dividing it between his Three Sons.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> From the Sons of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, for the space of Twelve hundred years, or thereabout, to <hi>Constantine Palaeologus</hi> the last Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who was prest to death in the Crowd, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Emperor of the <hi>Turks</hi> took the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the Year of the Creation of the World 5505, and of the Birth of J.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Fifty six years; <hi>viz.</hi> from the year 1204, to 1260.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> By the Valour of <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who made himself Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and it was retaken by another <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the fourth of that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In whose hands did the Western Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire continue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Emperors of <hi>Constantinople</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd all they could to keep it under their obedience; and for that end sent their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there, who had continual Brigues and Quarrels with the Popes, so that at last they had no manner of Authority or Credit in <hi>Italy</hi> about the time that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was King of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did that happen?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the III<hi>d.</hi> finding himself now in a capacity to exercise that power of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Empires, which his Predecessors had so long thirsted after; and besides having great obligations to the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who had protected the Holy See from the Insults of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> promoted <hi>Charles</hi> the Great to the Empire of the <hi>West.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the consent of all the Estates; <hi>viz.</hi> the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Pope himself placing the Imperial Crown upon his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did this happen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On <hi>Christmas</hi>-Day, in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 801.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> And did this famous Conqueror acquit himself worthily in his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He lived Fourteen Years after his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to this Dignity, and reign'd with that universal Esteem of the world, that they were used to say of him, <hi>He was a Conqueror like</hi> Caesar, <hi>Peaceable like</hi> Augustus, <hi>and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer of the Church like</hi> Constantine. He sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd a Council at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> where the use of Images in Churches, confirm'd by the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was condemn'd; and he died at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the 72<hi>d.</hi> Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> From whom did <hi>Conradus</hi> I. usurp the Imperial Crown?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From <hi>Charles</hi> the Simple King of <hi>France,</hi> who was Grandson to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the only person left alive of the Race of that great Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what reason do they say <hi>Leo</hi> III. excited the People to proclaim <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and bestow the Empire upon him, and his Descendents and Successors, the Kings of <hi>France?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For their Piety and Zeal to Holy Church. Nay, <hi>Leo</hi> the Third solemnly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted he would excommunicate all those that should presume to disturb them in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Imperial Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did it always continue in that Line?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for about fourscore and five years after this, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> V. a <hi>German</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Cousin-German to the Emperor
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95582:138"/>
                  <hi>Otho</hi> III. of the House of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the Empire in those of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, made the Decree which is commonly called the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> because the Seal is made of that rich Metal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did the Pope ordain in this Bull?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That only the <hi>Germans</hi> should have a right to elect the Emperor; for which end he established Six Electors, Three Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, and Three Lay Princes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are the Ecclesiastick Electors?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Archbishops of <hi>Ments, Colen</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> who are all Chancellors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the first for <hi>Germany,</hi> the second for <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the third for <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who are the Secular Electors?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> Comptroller of the Houshold. 2. The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> Master of the Horse. 3. The Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Great Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Was not one more added to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Electors?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was taken into the number at first, to be Arbitrator in the Case, whenever the Votes fell equal on both sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And has not a new Elector been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them since?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for the Prince Palatine having forfeited his Electorate which was given to

the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> they constituted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him at the Peace of <hi>Munster.</hi> Since the late Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> the Emperor has been induced to create a new Electorate in favour of the Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the great Services he has done the Empire, particularly in this present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy against <hi>France</hi>; but as 'tis opposed by several Princes of the Empire, who have enter'd their respective Protestations against it, we cannot positively tell what will become of this Affair.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Rodolphus</hi> Earl of <hi>Habspurgh,</hi> whom after a tedious <hi>Interregnum,</hi> which had like to have proved fatal to the Empire, the Electors unanimously chose. He overcame <hi>Ottocarus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in consequence of that Victory bestowed <hi>Austria</hi> upon his Son <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and laid the foundation of that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful House, which has brought forth so many Emperors and Princes to <hi>Europe,</hi> and which ever since the days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who first projected the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> has enjoy'd the Empire.</p>

Several Reasons may be given for the latter; as first, their affectation to incorporate so many <hi>Greek</hi> Words and Phrases into their Tongue; a Vanity complain'd of by <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> In the Age before they seldom used them but in case of necessity, and even then, as is evident from <hi>Tully</hi>'s Example, they writ them in <hi>Greek,</hi> and not in <hi>Latin</hi> Characters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Causes are assign'd for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The continual Irruptions of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations, who like a mighty Torrent, swept every thing before them. Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious swarms of people still breaking in upon them, could not but occasion a vast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in their Language. To this may be added the introducing of a new Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Christian, in the Empire; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of which brought in with 'em a new set of Phrases and Words, that were none of the politest, and wholly unknown before, as seeming always to have a greater regard to the truth of what they delivered, than to the purity of their Diction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did it fare after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From the Tenth to the middle of the 15th Century little or no Learning was stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in these Western parts of the World: The Monks, who were the only people that possest any share of it, amusing themselves in the study of School-divinity, as 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95582:140"/>
call'd. Those that were the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in those Ages leaving nothing but mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable jejune Relations of things behind them, larded with frequent Miracles of their Saints, which seem to have been written in defiance of Eloquence as well as of good sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came it to revive again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas occasion'd by two remarkable Accidents that happen'd within a short space of one another. The first was the invention of Printing at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Year 1440. by the help of which, to the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit of the Learned World, we can print more Volumes in a day, and that more correctly, than the Ancients could have written in an year. The second was the taking of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turks</hi> about twelve years after, which forced several of the Learned <hi>Greeks</hi> to quit their Native Countrey, and come into <hi>Italy,</hi> where they were forced to teach <hi>Greek</hi> for their own su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance. Of this number were <hi>Theodorus Gaza, Constantinus Lascharis, Chalcondilas, Chrysoloras, Trapezuntius,</hi> who began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the study of that Language, which for the space of Five hundred years had been perfectly buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Persons of Note encouraged Learning at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, that great Friend to the Muses, and Restorer of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, employ'd the most Learned Men of that Age to compare and revise the Old MSS.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95582:141"/>
and print them; and we are particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him for putting out <hi>Polybius.</hi> After him <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> alias Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who was himself a man of great Learning, promoted it by his Example and Encouragement. About this time the Art of Painting, which had been totally lost for so many Ages, began to flourish in <hi>Italy</hi>; and in the compass of an hundred years arrived to its highest perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What were their principal Studies at this time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To retrieve the purity of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, and learn their Antiquities; for which end they convers'd with their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litest Authors, compar'd various Readings, turn'd over Glossaries and Old <hi>Scholia</hi> upon Ancient Historians, Orators and Poets; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted old Inscriptions, examin'd old Statues and <hi>Basso Relievos,</hi> in which as <hi>Italy</hi> abounded above all other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> so it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them with a better opportunity to be skill'd in the Ancient Habits, Utensils, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the rest of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The most eminent men for this sort of Learning, were <hi>Laurentius Valla, Pomponius Laetus, Alexander ab Alexandro, Rodolphus Agricola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> How long was this Learning confin'd to <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not long; for although the <hi>Italians</hi> had the honour to revive it, and made a very considerable progress in it, yet about
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95582:141"/>
the latter end of the 15th Century, when Copies of Books were pretty well multiplied by Printing, Learning crost the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and soon after <hi>Erasmus, Budaeus, Beatus Rhena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp;c.</hi> dispersed that sort of Knowledge through <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Learned men had we then in <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth's time, which was the soonest that we came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Belles lettres</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> we had an admirable Set of Philologers in this Nation who were excellent Critics, and had a great command of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pool, Linacer, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Cheek, Ascham,</hi> and several more, often to be met with in <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s Epistles. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed about the beginning of the 16th Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury a remarkable turn of Affairs happen'd in this part of the World, which did not a little contribute to advance all sorts of Learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Year 1519. <hi>Luther</hi> made a publick defection from the Papal Authority, which, till then, was generally receiv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of examination. This change of the Scene obliged both Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> those of the Reformation, and the Champions for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to prosecute their Studies in the Learned Languages vigorously. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to justify their Separation, and to prove
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95582:142"/>
that Antiquity was of their side; and the latter, to keep their ground still, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the remainder of their Credit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with the People. When this Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical War was over, men applied themselves to all the other parts of Learning; and in this last Age Mathematical and Physical Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences seem to have been the predominant Studies of the Learned men of <hi>Europe:</hi> not but that a Critical Skill in Antiquity was at the same time pursued by several Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men, as Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Marsham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and after them by Dr. <hi>Spencer, Isaac Vossius, Nic. Heinsius, Frederic Gronovius, Ezekiel Spanheym,</hi> and <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> Men even in this part of Learning equal, if not superior to any that cultivated it before them. In short, all manner of Learning seems at present to be better diffused in all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> than ever it was; but whether the Genius's of this and the last Age are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to those Immortal Heroes of Antiquity, truly so called, is a Controversy that cannot be conveniently discuss'd in so narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass as this Paper will allow.</p>

those that were of the first, call'd themselves Soldiers of the first, and those that were of the second, call'd themselves Soldiers of the second Legion.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not the number of them rise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably higher in following Ages?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for in the second <hi>Punic</hi> War the <hi>Romans</hi> had in <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Legions; but in the Civil War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> they amounted to

                  <hi>A.</hi> They were disposed after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they cover'd the two sides of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, which made these Troops be call'd <hi>Alae,</hi> or Wings; their Commanders not calling themselves Tribunes, but Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They wore over their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic a woollen Robe. The <hi>Graecians</hi> had their Mantle called <hi>Pallium,</hi> which was as peculiar to them as the <hi>Toga</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of a Robe was it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The figure of it was generally in a demi-circle, and sometimes foursquare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were there any plaits or folds in this Gown?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There were two, so placed that one was above the other; the uppermost came slopeing cross from the right to the left, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of a Belt, and the lower came from the wast of the Gown to the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who wore their Gowns edged?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Magistrates and Priests, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Children, who till they were seventeen years old wore it with another mark of their Nobility in the form of a golden Heart, which was fasten'd to the Collar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And when they were seventeen years old, what Robe did they wear then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They took the <hi>Toga virilis</hi> which was wholly plain. Nay, young Gentlewomen wore the same Habit till they were married, the Edges of which were covered with Purple.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What sort of a fashion'd Coat was it that the People wore?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was without Studds. The Knights wore one with small Studds, and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors theirs with large ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How were these Studds made?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were nothing but knots of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the form of broad Nail-heads, sow'd or embroider'd upon the Stuff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who wore the Robe which they call'd the <hi>Palmata?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Those that triumph'd. This Robe derived its name from Palms which were painted upon it. All the different Habits which we have no English Names to express them by, were different Military Vestments which they wore over their Tunic.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Some in the <hi>Circus,</hi> or on the Theatre, and took their names from thence; others were sacred, and celebrated in Honour of the Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How were these sacred Sports call'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were generally named from the Deity in whose Honour they were kept. Others were made upon the account of some Vow. Funeral Sports were only kept at the death of some person, and others for mere exercise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many sorts of Sports were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the <hi>Circus?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Seven sorts.

               <p>The second was Running.</p>
               <p>The third was Leaping, and that either on a level place, or else from a low place to a high one, or from a high one to a low one.</p>
               <p>The fourth was shooting.</p>
               <p>The fifth was Fighting on Horseback.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:95582:155"/>The sixth was driving Chariots drawn by three or four Horses.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> After what manner were the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatres built?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were built in a Circular or Oval Form, the middle part was call'd the <hi>Cavea,</hi> or <hi>Arena.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because it was covered with Sand.</p>
               <p>The Games called the <hi>Megalenses,</hi> were celebrated in honour of <hi>Cibele</hi> the Mother of the gods.</p>
               <p>Those kept in honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> as also those kept in honour of <hi>Mars, Flora,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> took their name from these Divinities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Capitoline</hi> Games were celebrated in memory of the preservation of the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Games, which were likewise for distinction call'd the Great Games<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were kept in honour of the three Deities <hi>Iupiter, Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Iuno.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Compitalitij</hi> were kept in the cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and open Streets.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Secular</hi> Games were so named, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were celebrated but once in an Age, but because they were very seldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, the Priest laid his hand on the Altar, and rehearsed certain Prayers to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why so?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the <hi>Romans</hi> were persuaded, that without their intercession they could not have access to the other gods. His Prayers being ended, he laid upon the Beasts head a little Corn, together with a Cake made of Meal and Salt, call'd in Latin <hi>Mola.</hi> From this Ceremony the Act of Sacrificing has been termed <hi>Immolatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he do after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He drank some Wine out of a wooden or earthen Chalice, which was afterwards carried about to all the people that they might also <hi>libare</hi> or gently taste of it. This Rite was call'd <hi>Libatio.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> After what manner was this done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, the Priest pluckt off some of the Hairs between the Horns, and threw them into the fire; then turning his Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, he drew a long crooked Knife upon the Beast's Back, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his under Officers or <hi>Popae</hi> to kill the Beast.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, for some saved the Blood in Vessels, others Flead the Beast, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers washed it. Then the Priest observ'd the Entrails, and if he discovered no ill Omens in them, the above-mention'd <hi>Popae</hi> rowl'd them in Barley-meal, and sent them in Baskets to the Priests, who taking them up in a broad Platter, laid them upon the Altar and burnt them.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For the greater security they writ down the form of the Contract upon Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Record, and had them seal'd by some Witnesses there present, who from this Action were termed <hi>Signatores.</hi> But first they consulted the Augurs, as they were used to do in all Actions of any impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did the Woman wear the Ring, which the Man in token of his Affection gave her, on the fourth Finger of her left Hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because they supposed that an Artery from the Heart proceeded to that Finger alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whence is the word <hi>Nuptiae</hi> derived?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From <hi>Nubo,</hi> which signifies to cover, for the custom was that the Woman should be brought to her Husband with a <hi>Flammeum,</hi> or yellow Veil thrown over her Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why was the Bride by a seeming vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence taken away from her Mother, or next Relation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because of the good Success which <hi>Romulus</hi> and his Followers had in the violent taking away of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other Ceremonies did they use?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:95582:164"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Towards night the Woman was led to her Husband's House (whence the common Phrase <hi>Vxorem ducere</hi> to marry a Wife) with five Torches, to intimate the need which married Persons had of five Deities, <hi>viz. Iupiter, Iuno, Venus, Suadela,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> who is oftentimes call'd <hi>Lucina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What were these Torches made of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Of a pitchy Liquour that issued from a Tree call'd <hi>Teda.</hi> Hence the Poets figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively called both the Torches, and the Wedding it self <hi>Tedas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When the Woman was brought to the door, what did she then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> She anointed the Posts of the Door with Oil, from which Ceremony a Wife was call'd <hi>Vxor quasi Unxor.</hi> Then the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lifted her over the Threshold, and so carried her in by a seeming force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why so?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because she cou'd not in modesty seem to go without violence into that place where she was to resign her Virginity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> As she was carried in, what was it the Company cried aloud?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They cried <hi>Talassio, Talassio,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did <hi>Hymen Hymenaee</hi>; for which this reason is alledged; That at the Rape of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Women some of the meaner sort car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away one of the fairest Women, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Citizens would have taken her from them, which to prevent they pretended that they carried her to one <hi>Talassius,</hi> a man of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95582:164"/>
great esteem, and so brought their Prey off, the others accompanying her, and often cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Talassio, Talassio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What follow'd after this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being thus brought home, she received the Keys of her Husband's House, to denote that the custody of every thing in it was committed to her care.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How was the Marriage-Bed stiled?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Genialis lectus,</hi> and sometimes <hi>lectus adversus, quòd eum in atrio collocari januae ex ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verso mos fuit,</hi> that is, because they placed it in the Court, directly opposite to the Gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Ceremonies did they use the next day after the Marriage?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They gave a solemn Entertainment where the Relations and Friends of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Couple met to make merry. This Feast they called <hi>Repotia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many sorts of Divorces had they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two: One between Parties only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the second between married People. The first was properly call'd <hi>Repudium,</hi> in which the party sueing for a Divorce, used this form <hi>Conditione tuâ non utar</hi>; the other was call'd <hi>Divortium,</hi> and the party that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it used these words, <hi>Res tuas tibi habeto,</hi> or <hi>res tuas tibi agite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the reason of this Phrase, <hi>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> or <hi>remittere nuncium?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because in these Divorces they usually sent their Wives a paper containing the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95582:165"/>
Causes of their Separation <hi>per nuncium</hi> by a Messenger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Formalities were used in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Ceremonies were quite contrary to those observ'd in Marriage. For after the Censors were made acquainted with the just Causes of the Divorce, the Marriage-Tables were broken, the Dowry restor'd, the Keys of the House taken from the Woman, and she turned out of doors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the building of Cities the Founders generally made their Augural Observations; which being ended, they marked out the place where the Wall was to be built, by ploughing up the Ground.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:95582:166"/>
time the <hi>Romans</hi> used to write in Tables of Wood, covered over with Wax, so that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellae</hi> is employ'd to signify Missive Letters, and <hi>Tabellarius</hi> a Letter-Carrier. These Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Books were made of the <hi>Caudex,</hi> the Trunk or Stock of a Tree, whence we still call our Books <hi>Codices, à Caudicibus.</hi>

With the sharp point they writ what they pleased; with the broad end they scrap'd out what they had written; whence the Phrase, <hi>Stylum invertere,</hi> which signifies, To say and unsay a thing.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They writ a whole Book in one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Page, which was not cut into many leaves, and bound up, as the fashion now is, but that one entire Page was used to be roll'd upon a Staff fasten'd at the end of it. Hence

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Staff on which the Book was roll'd, they call'd metaphorically <hi>Vmbilicus,</hi> because as a Navel is the middle of a man's body, so when the Book was roll'd up, this Staff was the middle of it. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was always fasten'd at one end of the Page, hence <hi>Vmbilicus,</hi> but especially when applied to a Book, signifies <hi>The End,</hi> as in Horace, <hi>ad Vmbilicum ducere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How were the two knobs or ends of the Staff, which appear'd on each side of the Volume, call'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Cornua,</hi> and they used to adorn them with Silver and Gold. The Title, which was the beginning of every Book, was named <hi>Frons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Customs and Ceremonies were used by the <hi>Romans</hi> in handling their Suits of Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, there was, <hi>in jus vocatio,</hi> that is, the citing of one into the Court. Secondly, <hi>Postulatio,</hi> a Request put up to the Praetor, That it might be lawful for the Plaintiff to enter his Action against the Defendant; whence <hi>postulare aliquem de hoc vel illo crimine,</hi> is to accuse one of this or that Crime. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>nominis delatio,</hi> the taking of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's Name into the Court-Book, and this was call'd, <hi>intendere actionem vel litem,</hi> and <hi>diem alicui dicere</hi>; that is, to enter an Action against one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:95582:167"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When Request was made by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff to the Praetor, That he might enter his Action against the Defendant, did he not <hi>vadari reum, i. e.</hi> demand Sureties or Bail of him to appear on the day appointed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and <hi>promisit vadimonium,</hi> that is, he entred likewise into Bond for his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on the same day, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the third day following, called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>dies perendinus,</hi> and sometimes <hi>dies ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> simply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who were the <hi>Viri Consulares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not every one that was capable of a Consul's Office, but those that had actually born it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did the <hi>Romans</hi> date their Deeds and Charters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At first they did it by naming the Year wherein their City was founded; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>ab urbe conditâ</hi> the twentieth, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, or fortieth year; but afterwards by subscribing the Name of their present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls. Nay, to know the Age of their Wines they sign'd their Vessels after the same manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was their manner of selling <hi>sub coronâ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> An Enemy was said to be sold <hi>sub co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronâ,</hi> when in the Market-Place a Crown was put upon his head in token of such a Sale; or else because at that time he was surrounded with a Circle of Soldiers called <hi>Corona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:95582:168"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was their way of dismissing an Enemy <hi>sub jugum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They erected two Spears, with a third lying a-cross, in manner of a Gallows; then they caused them, being disarm'd and their Belts taken away, to pass under, in token of Bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did <hi>Lapis</hi> in old time signify a Mile?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because at every Mile's end a great stone in manner of a mark-stone, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did the <hi>Romans</hi> call the space of Five Years a <hi>Lustrum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because they did once in Five Years Revolution <hi>lustrare exercitum Romanum,</hi> purge the <hi>Roman</hi> Army by Sacrifice. Hence we say, <hi>duo lustra,</hi> ten years, <hi>tria lustra,</hi> fifteen years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does not <hi>Nomen</hi> sometimes signify the same as <hi>Debitum,</hi> a Debt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and the reason is, because the Creditors did use to write down their Debtors Names: Hence they were said, <hi>Nomina sua liberare,</hi> when they paid the Debt; as on the contrary, they were said <hi>Nomina faeere,</hi> when they contracted a Debt.</p>
