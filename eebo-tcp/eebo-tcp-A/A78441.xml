            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF ROBERT CECILL, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> UPON The BILL for the Limiting the Power of his Brother <hi>JAMES</hi> EARL of <hi>SALISB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY</hi> to Cut of the Jntaile of his ESTATE.</head>
            <p>THAT upon his Father's Marriage with the Lady <hi>Margaret Mannors,</hi> his Grandfather, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> by Leaſe, and Releaſe, did ſettle ſeveral Caſtles, Lordſhips, Mannors, Tenements, and Hereditaments, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of about 8000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> (after ſome particular Eſtates ſince ſpent,) to the uſe of the firſt, and all, and every other Son and Sons of the ſaid Father, on the Body of the ſaid Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> begotten, and their Heirs Males ſucceſſively, in Tail Male, with ſeveral Remainders over.</p>
            <p>That his Father had Iſſue by the ſaid Lady <hi>Margaret, James</hi> now Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> himſelf, and three other Sons, inheritable to the ſaid Eſtate ſucceſſively.</p>
            <p>That the Preſent Earl in the time of the late King <hi>James</hi> II. (notwithſtanding his being deſcended of a Proteſtant Family) became a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and Zealouſly engaged in the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt;</hi> and having no Iſſue did then Suffer a Common Recovery of Lands to the Value of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> of the ſaid Eſtate, and thereby barred the Remainder thereof; and the ſaid Earl, perſiſting in his Zeal to that party, doth intend to ſuffer a <hi>Common Recovery</hi> of the Reſidue of the ſaid Eſtate; whereby the ſaid <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> who is a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and Zealous for the preſent Government will be barred of the Remainder, and my Lord impowred to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it upon ſome Perſon of his own Religion.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of the ſaid Bill is therefore to prevent the deſtroying of the Remainder of the ſaid Eſtate, and reſtrain the preſent Earl from Voluntary Waſte, allowing him Liberty to provide for younger Children if he ſhould have any; and to make a Jointure to any Wife that he ſhould marry, andall other neceſſary Priveledges and Proviſions for the Support and Improvement of the Eſtate, and to preſerve the Right of the younger Children of the late Earl, or any Creditors of the ſaid Earl, or Legatees of his Will,</p>
