            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in
the eighteenth Chapter
of <hi>Luke,</hi> from the firſt to
the eighth verſe, from
the example of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
widdow, ſtirring up his
Diſciples to importunate praier, he
there aſſures them, That God will
ſurely hear the praiers of his own elect
that cry to him day and night, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them of their adverſaries; and
this he will doe for them, though he
make them tarry long. And hereby
Saints may be aſſured, That God will
<pb facs="tcp:98732:7"/>
hear their frequent importunate prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which night and day they have
put up againſt the man of ſinne, the
Beaſt, and their Babylonian enemies,
who have troden the Saints under
feet, and made warre againſt them,
and overcome them, and dealt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them above this twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years: and that he will at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them on theſe their enemies.
But ſaies our Saviour at the eighth
verſe, <hi>Nevertheleſſe, when the Sonne
of man cometh, ſhall he finde faith on
earth?</hi> Whereby he implies, That
when hee cometh, his people ſhall
ſcarce have faith to beleeve that hee
will thus avenge them on their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But when he ſhall come to doe
it, it will be beyond their faith. And
even thus is it with Saints now, they
have ſcarce faith to believe, that the
Lord Jeſus hath now begun, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to avenge his own elect on their
<pb facs="tcp:98732:8"/>
adverſaries, the myſticall <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
Now for the ſtrengthening of
the faith of Saints concerning this
thing, I doe preſent them with this
enſuing Diſcourſe, wherein as the
Lord hath diſcovered it to me (to
the ſtrengthening of my faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the proſperity of <hi>Sion</hi> hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward,
and giving me great joy
and pleaſure therein.) I have made
it to appeare from the Scriptures,
That the Lord hath already lifted
up his Saints from under the vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of their enemies, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
to put the cup of trembling,
into the hands of them that afflicted
them. Which I deſire that all that
love, and honour the Lord Jeſus may
diligently obſerve.</p>
            <p>For the moſt high God, of whom,
and through whom, and to whom
are all things, and for whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb facs="tcp:98732:8"/>
they are, and were created,
both whoſe wiſdome and knowledge
are unfathomable; tels his people
of old by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as wee
have it in the fourty eighth Chapter
of his Propheſie, at the third and
the fifth verſes, That he declared
from the beginning the things hee
would bring to paſſe, and that he
ſhewed it them before it came to
paſſe: and he gives the reaſon why
he did ſo, in the fourth and fifth
verſes, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>I knew
that thou art obstinate, and thy necke
is an iron ſinew, and thy brow braſſe:</hi>
And, <hi>least thou ſhouldest ſay, Mine
idol hath done them, and my graven
image, and my molten image hath
commanded them.</hi> And therefore the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the fourty eighth
Chapter, and fourteenth verſe, hee
makes a challenge to the Nations,
and to the People, to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:98732:9"/>
and to ſhew which among
them hath declared thoſe things.
But there is none to be found among
the ſonnes of men that can declare
any thing: for he maketh the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
mad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the
fourty third, and the thirteenth, he
ſaith, <hi>Before the day was, I am hee,
and there is none that can deliver out
of mine hands: I will work, and who
ſhall let it.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the fourtie
ſix Chapter, and the ninth and tenth
verſes, <hi>I am God, and there is none
like mee, Declaring the end from the
beginning, and from ancient times,
the things that are not yet done, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I
will doe all my pleaſure.</hi> And yet
notwithſtanding all this, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had ſeene and
knowne, (or might have) all the
glorious workes of the moſt high,
and obſerved how he declared things
<pb facs="tcp:98732:9"/>
before they came to paſſe, and had
thereby a greater advantage then
the Heathen, of being convinced of
his eternall Power and God-head:
Yet were they ſo vile, as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
it, having in them an emnitie
to the true God, and choſe rather
to worſhip Idols, and denie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God: As appeares in the
fourty ſixth Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and
therefore at the eighth and ninth
verſes, he ſaies, <hi>Remember this, and
ſhew your ſelves men, and bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to minde, O yee tranſgreſſours.
Remember the former things of old, for
I am GOD, and there is none elſe,
I am GOD, and there is none like
me, Declaring the end from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and from ancient times the
things that are not yet done; ſaying,
My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe
all my pleaſure.</hi> Remember; as if
hee had ſaid, and ſhew your ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:98732:10"/>
men, ſhew your ſelves to be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
creatures, and be not as the
horſe and mule that hath no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
but ſeeing I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from ancient times, the things
I would doe long before they came
to paſſe: ſaying, My counſell ſhall
ſtand, and I will doe all my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
And be ye thereby convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that I am GOD, and there is
none like me. But as then, ſo now,
are there many that are become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,
denying the true GOD, and
JESUS CHRIST, whom he hath
ſent, whoſe necke are an iron ſinew,
and their brow braſſe, who had they
not loſt the principles of reaſon,
might by the things of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be convinced of his Eternall
Power and God-head, <hi>Romans</hi> the
firſt Chapter, and the twentieth verſe.
As alſo by obſerving how hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what it was his will to bring
<pb facs="tcp:98732:10"/>
to paſſe long agoe, and how hee
hath brought to paſſe what hee ſo
declared. But they have loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the principles of reaſon which
they once had, by which they
might have then been convinced
hereof; whereby they are left
without excuſe, as the Apoſtle ſaies,
<hi>Romans</hi> the firſt and the twentieth.
But they having loſt reaſon, are
now become vaine in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and their fooliſh heart is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened;
and though they profeſſe
themſelves to be wiſe, and are puft
up with ſelfe-conceits of wiſdome,
in their frothy and blaſphemous
Diſcourſes: yet they are become
fooles, changing the truth of GOD
into a lie. And the Apoſtle gives
the reaſon why GOD hath thus
given them over, in the firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
to the <hi>Romans</hi> the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth,
and the eight and twentieth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb facs="tcp:98732:11"/>
               <hi>Becauſe they did not like to retaine
GOD in their knowledge, and becauſe
that when they knew GOD, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
him not as GOD.</hi> The like
reaſon hee giveth, why them that
periſh are deceived by the man of
ſinne, as in the ſecond Epiſtle to the
<hi>Theſſalonians</hi> the ſecond Chapter, and
the tenth verſe, <hi>Becauſe they received not
the love of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, Though Atheiſts, and
Papiſts, denie the Eternall GOD,
and obſerve not his wonderfull
workes, how he declares things long
before they come to paſſe: ſaying,
My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will
doe all my pleaſure; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brings it to paſſe, becauſe their
fooliſh heart is darkned: yet all his
Saints doe, and will obſerve this:
For ſaith the Pſalmiſt, in the hundred
and eleventh <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and the ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:98732:11"/>
and third verſes, <hi>The workes of the
LORD are great, ſought out of all
them that have pleaſure therein. His
worke is honourable, and glorious, and
his righteouſneſſe endureth for ever:
He hath made his wonderfull workes to
be remembred,</hi> &amp;c. The LORD
hath made his wonderfull workes
to be remembred among his Saints,
though others remember them not,
yet his Saints have pleaſure in them,
and therefore ſearch them out, and
they have a promiſe made to them,
That in the obſerving the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things of the LORD, they
ſhall underſtand his loving kindeneſſe,
it runnes thus, <hi>Who ſo is wiſe, and
will obſerve theſe things, even they
ſhall underſtand
the loving kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the LORD</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The Pſalmiſt in the former part of that Pſalme, had been ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſeverall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the providence of GOD, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Saints to obſerve, amongſt the reſt theſe are ſome, <hi>He poureth contempt upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cauſeth them to wander in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe where there is no way; yet hee ſetteth the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies like a flocke. The righteous ſhall ſee it and rejoyce, and all iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth.</hi> Now this is that which is by Saints to be obſerved at this time alſo, even how GOD beginneth to pour contempt upon Babylon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops and other Babylonian Factours, and to ſet the Saints that were lookt upon as poor deſpiſed creatures on high from afflictions and to make of them families like a flock, who not long ſince were ſmall in number, but now is this number greatly increaſed.</note>,

being ſo, let
Saints diligently
obſerve the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſcourſe,
wherin it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
That GOD
hath brought to
paſſe the things he
did fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares agoe
predeclare; which
they obſerving it
may tend much to
the ſtrengthening
of their faith in
this, That JESUS
CHRIST hath
begun, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to avenge
them on their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For in the
<pb facs="tcp:98732:12"/>
enſuing Diſcourſe
it will appear,
That as JESUS
CHRIST did
long ſince reveale
to <hi>John,</hi> how that
after the myſticall
<hi>Babylonians</hi> had perſecuted his Saints
a long time, he would raiſe up his
Saints out of their perſecuted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and bring down thoſe their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi>
enemies: So hee hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
begunne to doe this thing, even
to raiſe up his Saints, and to bring
downe their enemies, and that pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
according to what hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
to <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I know there hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by many Saints, many things
that GOD revealed to <hi>John,</hi> which
he hath brought to paſſe. Many of
which Obſervations are already in
<pb facs="tcp:98732:13"/>
print: but that which I chiefly aim at
in this Diſcourſe, is that which is not
yet printed by any other, and whether
any other have yet obſerved it, I know
not; but they are paſſages ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worthy to be obſerved, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time, becauſe they give the Saints
ſuch ground of encouragement and
conſolation, in reſpect of the happy
ſucceſſe that ſhall be of the very preſent
affairs of this Kingdome (how knotty
and difficult ſo ever for the preſent, or
for ſometime, yet they may appear to
be) as that in love to all Saints I could
not but communicate them to them in
this way.</p>
            <p>But there are two things, which it
may be may cauſe ſome to retain ſome
unbeleeving and doubtfull thoughts
concerning the happy ſucceſſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
things, although it be made clear
in the following Diſcourſe, That the
time of Saints being cloathed in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
is expired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98732:13"/>
Firſt, It may be ſome cannot receive
it, becauſe they look for farther judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to come upon this Kingdome,
(wherein outwardly the Saints may
ſuffer alſo) becauſe of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
ſins of this Kingdom, as drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe,
and adulteries, and oaths, and
their entering into ſo many Covenants
concerning religious things, for which
they have no ſufficient warrant, now
in the times of the Goſpel, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the poor, and meaner ſort
of people, and the great neglect of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtice generally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to theſe
I ſay, That it is true, that if God ſhould
deal with this Nation, according to its
demerits; then indeed no other could
be expected, but an utter deſolation of
it, that it might either ſwim in bloud,
or burn with fire untill it were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But</p>
            <p>Firſt, I deſire you to conſider, That
God hath a very great number of his
<pb facs="tcp:98732:14"/>
dear Saints in this Kingdom, in whom
he delights, and for whoſe ſake he may,
and I had almoſt ſaid, will ſpare this
Kingdome, and ſpare the Cities and
Towns, and Counties where they are
for if God would have ſpared <hi>Sodome</hi>
for ten righteous perſons, we have a
great ground of hope, that he will ſpare
<hi>London,</hi> yea all <hi>England</hi> from a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
devaſtation and deſolation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thouſands of righteous perſons in
<hi>London,</hi> and in all <hi>England</hi> a very great
number. And how many plots of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, wherein they endeavoured
the ruine of this Kingdome, hath God
blaſted? Having ſuch a great number
of his precious jewels in it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, What though h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere
be in this Kingdome, many that are
great enemies to Jeſus Chriſt, yet God
can by his Covenant of Grace, bring
many of them in to the obedience of
Chriſt, and make them of perſecutors
<pb facs="tcp:98732:14"/>
to become eminent Saints, and call
thoſe his people that were not his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
And why ſhould we doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would do ſo, ſince theſe are the
times wherein he hath promiſed to do
ſo, and hath already begun to doe it?
But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it be ſo, that ſome are
hardned to deſtruction, and they are
never quiet, but ſtill are plotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the juſt, to ruine them: yet know
they ſhall not prevail over the Saints,
but in oppoſing them ſhall ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 3. as appears in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Doubtfull thoughts may
be in others, that yet the Saints may be
overcome, becauſe they ſee they have ſo
many enemies abroad, and at home,
and they are ſpeaking great words, and
are ſtill plotting againſt them. To ſuch,
I ſay, Let them ſuppoſe that there were
none that did dare to make any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb facs="tcp:98732:15"/>
at all in this Kingdome, but that
all things went ſmoothly on, in the
hands of thoſe that are carrying it on:
and if they could then beleeve, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
God would not have his Saints in
this Kingdome to be troden under foot
by the Beaſt any more. Then let them
have the ſame faith to beleeve it now,
as knowing it is as eaſie with God, to
carry on this work over the mountains
as over the plains, and he will make
the great mountain to become a plain
before <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> before his people,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. He can command thoſe that
are preparing warre againſt them to ſit
ſtill, and proceed no farther, and put a
fear upon them; or if they doe goe on,
yet he can make it to come to nothing,
and to be the moſt effectual way to lay
them lower, and to raiſe his people
higher.</p>
            <p>Now if any particular man would be
as ſure of ſafety, as all the Witneſſes
<pb facs="tcp:98732:15"/>
in generall are; then if he be a man in
any publike imploiment, let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his place oppoſe the Beaſt,
and act for the welfare of all that wiſh
well to <hi>Sion,</hi> and doe juſtice unto all,
from the higheſt unto the loweſt, and
be more forward to act for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
then for the higheſt. Let him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the meaneſt
man<note n="*" place="margin">I ſay, that ſeek for juſt things, not thoſe that ſeek for unjuſt things, as for protection in evil waies, or for places of profit or honour, when they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerve them, nor are fit for them, or elſe have too many already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that ſeeks to
him for juſt things
to be his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and act for
him, as hee would
be dealt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
were he in that
condition: for thus
relieving of the poor and diſtreſſed
ones, is moſt acceptable to the Lord of
Sabbath, and in ſo doing, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it will go well with him, however
it go with others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98732:16"/>
Again, If he be a private man; let
him alſo in his place, wiſh well to <hi>Sion,</hi>
and oppoſe the Beaſt; ſo ſhall he alſo
proſper in the proſperity of <hi>Sion.</hi>

Chapter of this book of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> I
cannot but here inſert it, as a Preamble to
the following diſcourſe alſo; though it may
be it may not ſeem in the eyes of ſome ſo
pertinent.</p>
            <p>The three verſes are as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98732:18"/>
1. The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God
gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things
which muſt ſhortly come to paſse; and he ſent and
ſignified it by his Angel unto his ſervant John.</p>
            <p>2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of
the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all things that
he ſaw.</p>
            <p>3. Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear
the words of this prophecy, and keep thoſe things
which are written therein, for the time is at hand.</p>
            <p>In theſe verſes is contained theſe five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſubject matter of this book.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The reaſon of the divulgation
of this book.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The inſtruments of the divulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Fourthly, The fruitfulneſſe of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
in the divulging this book.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The pronunciation of a bleſſing
upon the perſons that reade or hear the
words of this book.</p>
            <p>The firſt particular contained in theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
is the ſubject matter of this book; and
that it expreſt in theſe words, <hi>The Revelation
of things that muſt ſhortly come to paſſe, The word
of God, and the testimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From
whence this is the Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98732:19"/>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That the whole book of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> is a <hi>Revelation,</hi> declaration or
manifeſtation of the minde of God, about
the things which were to come to paſſe,
ſhortly after the revealing of it: which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
is the word of God, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This point being ſo evident, and clear in
the Text, I ſhall not produce any further
proofs of it, becauſe I intend brevity, but
immediately proceed to the Deductions
which flow from it, which are theſe.</p>
            <p>If this book be a <hi>Revelation</hi> or Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the minde of God about the things,
which were ſhortly to come to paſſe: then
it is our duty to obſerve how God hath
brought to paſſe, the things which he did
pre-declare he would bring to paſſe; that ſo
we may glorifie God in his omniſciency in
fore-ſeeing, and fore-knowledge of all
things, and in his omnipotency, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things to paſſe which he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
to bring to paſſe: that he can doe
all things, and nothing can hinder him from
bringing all things to paſſe, according to the
counſel of his own will. When Saints doe
moſt diligently obſerve the works which
God brings to paſſe, according to what he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98732:19"/>
hath pre-declared in his word; then do they
moſt anſwer the end, for which God did
before reveal theſe things, which was that
he might be admired and magnified by his
people, in bringing all things to paſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his word, ſhewing that he is God
alone: for none elſe can declare things to
come, as the eternal God doth. But how
can Saints have experience of this, but by
comparing his Word and works together?
Therefore it is the duty of Saints frequently
ſo to do. So much of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is this book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
the word of God, and the teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt? then we are hereby informed,
That it is warrantable for us to call that
which is a <hi>Revelation</hi> of the minde of God,
the word of God. We ſee <hi>John</hi> cals it ſo, and
why may not we? I the rather ſpeak of this:
becauſe ſome have affirmed, That nothing
may be called the Word of God, but Jeſus
Chriſt; becauſe it is a title the Scripture
gives to him, as <hi>John 1. 1. In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 14. The Word was
made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his
glory, the glory as of the only begotten Son of God,
full of grace and truth.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 7. For
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98732:20"/>
there are three that bare record in heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three
are one.</hi> And <hi>Revel. 19. 13. And he was cloathed
with a veſture dipt in bloud, and his name is called,
The word of God; and the armies that were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
followed him upon white horſes,</hi> &amp;c. But let
theſe know, that though in theſe places that
title, <hi>The word of God,</hi> is given to Jeſus
Chriſt, he being the eſſential word of God:
which is the reaſon why this title is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him. Yet that the Spirit of God,
gives this title alſo to the Scripture, to the
written word, the word which is the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of the minde of God, as appears here,
and in other places, as <hi>Jer. 2. 1. Moreover, the
word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, Go and cry
in the ears,</hi> &amp;c. And verſ. 4. <hi>Hear ye the word of
the Lord, O houſe of Jacob, and all the families of
the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Jer. 7. 2. Stand in the
gates of the Lords houſe, and proclaim there this
word, ſaying, Hear the word of the Lord all ye of
Judah, that enter in at theſe gates to worſhip the
Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſt, the God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:
amend your waies,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Jer. 14. 1. The
word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning
the dearth,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Jer. 30. 1, 2. The word that
came to Jeremiah from the Lord, ſaying, Thus
ſpeaketh the Lord God of Iſrael, ſaying, Write all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98732:20"/>
the words that I have ſpoken unto thee in a book.</hi>
And ſeverall like paſſages to theſe we have,
as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 6. 1. and 7. 1. and 12. 1. and
16. 1. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 1. and 4. 1. And the like
we have alſo in <hi>Joel, Jonah, Micah, Zechary,</hi>
and the reſt of the Prophets: where it is
clear, That that which was the Revelation,
or manifeſtation of the minde of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the waies in which he would have
his people to walk, or the things which he
was about to doe, whether of bringing a
dearth upon a people, or any other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or the doing of them good: This ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
is given to it; <hi>The word of God.</hi> So that it
is clear that this title may be given to the
written Word, the Scripture, both by all
the fore-cited places (beſides many others
that might have been cited to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
and alſo in the text, where this book
of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is called the word of God.
But I ſtill acknowledge, That Jeſus Chriſt
is more eminently the word of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the originall of it: for as God doth all
things elſe by Jeſus Chriſt, ſo he gives out
his Word by him, and Jeſus Chriſt gives te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to it: which is the next inſtruction
ariſing from the point, and comes now to
be ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98732:21"/>
Thirdly, Is it ſo, That this Book of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> is the Word of God, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jeſus Chriſt? Then this may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
us, that as this: ſo all the Scriptures,
doe as truly come from Jeſus Chriſt, as
from God the Father: for he gives teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to what the Father ſaies. What the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declares, he witneſſes, and teſtifieth the
ſame; and therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witneſſe. Rev.</hi> 1. 5. And it is ſaid of him,
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. For all the promiſes of God in him
are yea, and in him amen.</hi> So much of the firſt
particular, the ſubject matter of this Book.
I come now to the ſecond, which is.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the divulgation of this
Book; and that is contained in theſe words:
<hi>Which God gave unto Jeſus Chriſt to ſhew unto his
ſervants.</hi> From whence ariſes this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That it is the pleaſure of God,
to have his ſervants acquainted with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and to know what is his minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things to come.</p>
            <p>This we ſee was the reaſon of the divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of this Book: becauſe it was the
minde of God to have his ſervants acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it, a ſutable place to this, is that,
<hi>John 15. 15. Henceforth</hi> (ſaith Jeſus Chriſt)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98732:21"/>
               <hi>I call you not ſervants; for the ſervant knoweth no
what his Lord doth; but I call you friends: for all
things that I have heard of my Father, I have made
known unto you:</hi> and <hi>Pſalm. 25. 14. The ſecret of
the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will
ſhew them of his covenant.</hi> So that it is a clear
truth, That it is the pleaſure of God to
have his ſervants acquainted with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and to know his minde, concerning
things to come.</p>
            <p>It being ſo, in the firſt place it teaches
Saints to admire, and magnifie the love of
the Father, that doth expreſſe himſelf ſo
graciouſly to them, as to afford them that
honour to be as his friends, in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vealing his
ſecrets to them. It is a remarkable paſſage,
<hi>Amos 3. 7. Surely the Lord God will doe nothing,
but he revealeth his ſecrets unto his Servants the
Prophets.</hi> Oh what a high ſavour is this, that
the Lord ſhould engage himſelf that he will
doe nothing, but he will reveal it unto his
ſervants! As a tender Husband unboſomes
himſelf, and diſcovers his ſecrets to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Wife, and cannot with-hold them
from her. So the Lord God doth expreſſe
his tender love unto his ſervants, in reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſecrets to them, and he will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but he will diſcover it unto them.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98732:22"/>
What cauſe have Saints now to admire, and
extoll that rich Grace of God, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to them herein?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Doth the Lord reveal his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
unto his ſervants? Then ought they
to be dilligent obſervers of what he reveals
unto them. Revealed things are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto us, and if they belong unto us,
then it behoves Saints to obſerve them, and
to improve them to thoſe ends for which
they are diſcovered to us; and if we ſhould
come ſhort of it, we ſhould demean our
ſelves very unworthily. When a man reveals
his ſecret unto his dear friend, if his friend
ſhould ſlight him in it, and take no notice of
what he diſcovers to him, he were a very
unkinde, and a very unworthy friend: But
how much more may we be ſaid, to carry
our ſelves unkindly, and unworthily; if we
ſhould ſlight the love of our God, in reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſecrets to us, by not being diligent
in obſerving of them? Since it pleaſes the
Lord, to reveal to his ſervents things to
come; it well becomes them to obſerve them
exactly. And ſo much of the ſecond parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
The reaſon of the divulgation of this
Book.</p>
            <p>I come now to the third, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98732:22"/>
of the divulgation of this Book,
which is contained in theſe words: <hi>Who
ſent, and ſignified it by his Angel unto his ſervant
John.</hi> So that the Angel, and <hi>John,</hi> were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as inſtruments in that work. From
whence the Obſervation is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. That though Jeſus Chriſt
could reveal immediately to al his ſervants,
all theſe things revealed in this Book; yet
it pleaſed him to chuſe rather to doe it by
inſtruments.</p>
            <p>If it had pleaſed him, he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
theſe things to all his people, in all
ages ſince <hi>John,</hi> immediately by his own
Spirit; but he chuſes rather to doe it by the
writings of <hi>John:</hi> which he preſerves and
keeps up in a high eſteem in the hearts of all
his Saints; as his own infallible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
truth, and teſtimony: or elſe
he might have ſent a <hi>John,</hi> or ſome Prophet
of his, to have revealed theſe things by
mouth unto his people, in every age, age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
age: but he chuſes rather to doe it by
revealing it to <hi>John,</hi> ſo many hundreds of
years agoe; and his writings muſt be the
inſtruments of revealing theſe things unto
his people; and he might have revealed
thoſe things unto <hi>John</hi> immediately him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98732:23"/>
without any other inſtrument: but he
chuſes to ſignifie it by his Angel to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>John.</hi> So he might teach, and edifie, and
build up his people immediately; but he
chuſes rather to doe it by inſtruments, by
Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and
Paſtors, and Teachers: which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for
the edifying of the body of Chriſt; till we all come
in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of
the Son of God unto a perfectman, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 4.
11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>So he might likewiſe, have revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
immediately to all his people of old;
but generally it pleaſed him to make uſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Angels, or of his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
to be the inſtruments of revealing his
minde unto his people then. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why it pleaſeth God, uſually to make
uſe of inſtruments to effect his deſigns by,
may be theſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that which is the reaſon of all
his doings; his own will. He makes uſe of
inſtruments, becauſe it is his will to make
uſe of inſtruments: for his will is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the rule of all his actions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But a ſubordinate reaſon to
this, may be to ſhew his ſoveraignty over al
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98732:23"/>
his people; therefore he ſends them about
his work, they being all at his royall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>As a Prince hath power over all that are
in his dominion, ſaying to this man go, and
he goeth, and to another, come, and he
commeth, and to another doe this, and he
doth it: So the great King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, maketh it to appear that he
hath all his ſervants at his beck, by ſending
of them about ſeverall employments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another reaſon why he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
uſe of inſtruments, in revealing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his minde to his people, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of his Saints, may be to maintain a
communion among Saints: for if God
ſhould reveal himſelf to all alike, then
would not his people have ſuch communion
one with another, as they have, to the end
they may partake one of anothers gifts; and
therefore doth it pleaſe the Lord to make
uſe of inſtruments, whereas if it pleaſed him,
he could have effected all things immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
without means or inſtruments: and
ſince it is ſo then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It reprehends thoſe that have a
low eſteem of inſtruments, and ſleight and
undervalue means, upon this ground: that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98732:24"/>
God can worke without inſtruments, and
without means. But let ſuch know, that
it is the will of God to make uſe of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in ſleighting inſtruments, they
contradict his will: and as they that ſleight
the Kings Officers, doe ſleight the King:
So they, in ſleighting the inſtruments and
means that God hath appointed to work by,
do ſleight God himſelf, and they do as much
as in them lies, endeavor to break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints. And ſurely what ever the
pretences of ſuch perſons are, that doe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
means, and ſleight inſtruments, this
cometh not from the Spirit of God in them;
for the Spirit teacheth not to undervalue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
means, which God hath appointed to be
uſed. Though it is true, The Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
us not to idolize means, nor to tie God to
worke only by means, but to acknowledge
that God can, and ſometimes doth worke
without means and inſtruments; Though
he doth uſually work by means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and therefore it is as great an evil
on the one ſide, to reject the inſtruments, or
means that God uſes to work by, becauſe he
hath not abſolutely tied himſelf to them; as
on the other ſide, to idolize means or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe God doth uſually work by
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98732:24"/>
Therefore in the ſecond place Saints are
here exhorted, to have a high eſteem of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
as being of Gods appointment,
by whom he will reveal himſelf to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and quicken, and comfort, and build
them up upon the true foundation. Since
the Lord will make uſe of inſtruments, O
Saints doe not you ſleight them, leaſt you
ſleight God himſelf: but eſteem them very
highly in love, for their works ſake. It is
the rule of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13.
ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>We beſeech you brethren,
to know them which labour among you, and are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; and to eſteem
them very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> The
Apoſtle knew very well that God could if
he had pleaſed, have built up his people
without employing ſome to labour among
them, in the Word, and Doctrine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the admonitions of men, but theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtruments, and means of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
He therefore preſſes the Saints,
to eſteem very highly of thoſe inſtruments,
for that works ſake that God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them unto: for though <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi>
and <hi>Cephas</hi> can doe nothing of themſelves,
yet they are to be highly eſteemed, as being
inſtruments in Gods hand, by which God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98732:25"/>
will work. And ſo all the means which
God hath appointed for his people to make
uſe of, in which he will be found of them,
and in which he will have Communion
with them, let them prize, and embrace, and
make uſe of, waiting upon God in the uſe of
them, who will be found of them at laſt, and
will make it appear, that they have not
ſought him in the uſe of means in vain.
Though for a time he ſeem to be ſilent tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
them, yet at laſt he that ſhall come,
will come, an I will not tarry.</p>
            <p>It is unqueſtionably the policy of Satan,
to take off Saints from uſing means, that
they may be deprived of that comfort, and
benefit which otherwiſe they might obtain
in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all Saints beware of ſuch
deluſions, whereby they are drawn to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, in ſleighting the inſtruments
and means which he hath appointed, and
let them be exhorted to embrace means, and
make diligent uſe of them; for they are
bleſſed that ſo doe, as will appear in the
handling of the fifth particular. But ſo
much for this third particular, The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the divulgation of this Book.</p>
            <p>The fourth particular, Is the faithfulnes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98732:25"/>
of thoſe inſtruments in the divulgation of
this book, it is expreſt in theſe words: <hi>Who
bare record of the Word of God, and of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Jeſus, and of all things that he ſaw.</hi> We ſee
that as the Angel ſignified it to <hi>John,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi>
did not fail in recording any thing of it,
but he bare record of all things that he ſaw.
Whence the Obſervation is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. That when God ſetteth inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about a worke which he will have
done, they muſt, and they ſhall effect it.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt will have his ſecrets decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his ſervants, and he imploieth <hi>John</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this work; and <hi>John</hi> doth it punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
he bare record of the word of God, and
of the teſtimony of Jeſus, and what, of ſome
things? Nay, of all things which he ſaw.
And this truth is further confirmed, by two
pertinent Scriptures, which we have to this
effect. One is <hi>Amos 3. 8. The Lion hath roared,
Who will not fear? The Lord God hath ſpoken, who
can but propheſie?</hi> The other is, <hi>Acts 4. 20. For
we cannot but ſpeak the things which wee have
ſeen and heard.</hi> In both theſe places it appears,
that it is not poſſible for inſtruments to be
ſilent, nor to ſit ſtill, when God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to them, and given them commiſſion to
doe his work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98732:26"/>
Firſt, Is it ſo that when God ſetteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
about a work which he will have
done, that they muſt, and ſhall effect it?
Then this informes us of the reaſon why
Saints fear not perſecution, nor impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor death, but chooſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them all, then to conceal the truth that
is diſcovered to them, or to diſert the work
they are called to: for God having ſtirred
up their ſpirits, and ſet them about this
work, they cannot be ſilent, and ſit ſtill, but
ſhall go on in deſpite of all oppoſition, to
accompliſh the worke which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to do. Thus did <hi>Luther,</hi> and
thus have many other Saints done, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhall doe: For if the Lord have ſpoken
they cannot but propheſie, ſpeak the things
they have ſeen and heard: for their light is
not given them to hide it under a buſhell;
but their love to Chriſt conſtraines them to
hold it forth, and the ſtrength of Chriſt
carries them forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Since it is ſo, it ſerves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Saints, conſidering that the work
that God hath to doe ſhall ſurely be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
no oppoſition ſhall hinder it:
for though inſtruments ſeem to be never ſo
weak, yet they muſt, and ſhall accompliſh
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98732:26"/>
Gods deſigns. Therefore fear not, the day
ſhall break forth, and the ſhaddowes ſhall
fly away, and none of the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhall be able to hinder it. But I ſhall
ſay more to this point in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
Therefore ſo much ſhall ſuffice to
be here ſpoken of it, and of this fourth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
the faithfulneſſe of the inſtruments
of divulging this Book.</p>
            <p>The fifth particular, Is the pronouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a bleſſing upon the perſons that
read, or hear the words of this Book. And
that we have in theſe words: <hi>Bleſſed is he
that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
propheſie, and keep thoſe things which are written
therein; for the time is at hand.</hi> From whence
ariſes this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. That it is a bleſſed thing, to
reade and hear the Word of God, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that which is contained in the book
of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſo as to keep it.</p>
            <p>This clearly appears in theſe words: and
the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> likewiſe witneſſeth the
ſame, <hi>Jam. 1. 25. Be ye doers of the word</hi> (ſaith
he at the 22. verſ.) <hi>and not hearers only deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your own ſelves.</hi> Whereas it appears he
ſpeakes of the written Word, which men
may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ar with the ear, and doe not. And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98732:27"/>
now at the 15. verſ. he ſaies: <hi>Who ſo looketh
into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
he being not a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of
the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi>
What is the man that <hi>James</hi> ſaith ſhall be
bleſſed? It is the man that looketh into the
perfect law of liberty, (that is) heareth or
readeth the word of God in the Scripture,
(which is a perfect law of liberty, Spiritual
liberty) and heareth or readeth it, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfully,
but is a doer of it: This is the
bleſſed man.</p>
            <p>Thus it is a clear, That it is a bleſſed thing
to hear and reade the Word of God, and
particularly that which is contained in the
Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſo as to keep it.</p>
            <p>Then firſt, This condemns thoſe that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the reading, and the hearing of the
word: ſince it is a bleſſed thing to reade,
and hear the Word of God ſo as to do it.</p>
            <p>Now they that doe not reade it, nor hear
it, cannot doe it: for ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.
10. 14. How ſhall they believe in him, of whom
they have not heard?</hi> Implying, That without
hearing the Word of God, they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God: but if the Apoſtle had not ſo
ſaid, yet we ſee it to be true, In that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and people to whom the Goſpel is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98732:27"/>
not preached, and that doe not reade it, doe
altogether continue in unbelief. And ſo
thoſe that are under the darkneſſe of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to whom the word in the purity of it is
not preached, and have not liberty to reade
it, they continue alſo in a dark and a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition; but among thoſe people
where the Word is embraced, and read, and
heard there are many brought into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of faith. Nay, in ſome places of this
Kingdome where they ſeldom en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oy a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Preacher, yet by reading the Word they
are made partakers of the ſweet bleſſing of
it. They ought therefore to be ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for their folly, who neglect the
hearing, and reading the Word, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the doing of it, in which they
might be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, Hence all ſorts of
people are exhorted to be frequent in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, for all deſire to be bleſſed,
and thoſe that have in any meaſure been
made partakers of the bleſſing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
they cannot but deſire more of it; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would be wiſdome for all to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the means of being made bleſſed,
which is hearing, and reading the Word.</p>
            <p>If a man that deſires a great outward
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98732:28"/>
eſtate, ſhould be perſwaded that if there
were any way at all for him to attain that
eſtate, it muſt be ſuch, or ſuch a way, that
man would be ſure to take that way.</p>
            <p>Why this is the caſe in reſpect of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spiritual bleſſings; the readieſt way that
any Soul can take to attain them, is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
reading, and hearing of the Word of
God, waiting for the comming in of the
Spirit in it. O therefore let not men diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that they have a ſleight eſteem of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
bleſſings, and heavenly treaſures, by
neglecting the means by which they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
for if men have a high eſteem of
Gold, and Pearls, if they know the means
by which they may be attained, they will
make uſe of thoſe means: ſo according to
the eſteem we have of Spirituall bleſſings,
will be our diligence in improving the
means of attaining them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſome one will ſay,
I have been frequent in hearing and reading
the Word, and finde it but an empty thing,
I hear and am as carnal as before, I read and
am as dark, and low as before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how can it be ſaid that hearing,
and reading the Word, is a means of
attaining Spirituall bleſſings?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98732:28"/>
I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, If thou findeſt to thy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
but little benefit from hearing or
reading the Word; yet thou canſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it would be better with thee, if thou
didſt not reade or hear the Word, for there
is no ground of hope for thee, when thou
neglecteſt all means of enlivening, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or of heightning the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Though to thy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thou haſt no benefit from reading, or
hearing the Word, yet remember, that the
Word is compared to ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19. and
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. Now you know that ſeed uſeth
to lie hid under the clods for a time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
groweth up: ſo may the ſeed of the
Word ſeem to be hid in thee for a time, and
yet afterward it may grow up, and bring
forth fruit. The Diſciples while the Lord
Jeſus was with them, often heard his word,
and he plainly fore-told them of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but when their Lord was crucified,
though they had ſo often heard it, yet they
ſeemed to be altogether ignorant of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Reſurrection, but afterward it
was ſweet unto them when the Spirit
brought it, with other things to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.
In the 4. of <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel, at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98732:29"/>
the 36, 37, 38. verſes, our Saviour tels his
Diſciples, That <hi>both he that ſoweth, and he that
reapeth ſhall rejoice together, but</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>herein
is that ſaying true, one ſoweth, and another reapeth.
I have ſent you to reap that whereon ye beſtowed no
labour, other men laboured and ye are entred into
their labours.</hi> Others had ſowed the ſeed of
eternal life in the hearts of the people: and
therefore he ſaid in the 35, verſ. That the
fields were already white unto the harveſt,
but the Diſciples were ſent to reap the fruit
of that ſeed, that others had laboured in the
ſowing of: So that one Miniſter may ſow
the ſeed of life, and joy in the hearts of ſome
people, and another may reap it. But the
time ſhall come, that both he that ſoweth,
and he that reapeth ſhall rejoice together.
When the ſeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſowne the fruit doth not
by and by appear, and of this Saints have
had experience, that have laine long under
the hearing of the Word, frequently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon it, and been diligent in reading,
and yet have attained to their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
neither to faith, nor peace, nor
joy, nor ſtrength, but have ſeemed to be as
unbelieving, as carnal, and as fleſhly as ever,
walking heavily for a long time: And that
Word which hath been ſweet to others that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98732:29"/>
at the ſame time heard it, hath been as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them. That word which hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the heart, and ſtrengthened the faith, and
inflamed the love of others, hath ſeemed to
have no effect upon them, and thus ſome have
continued weeks, months, nay years together,
and if they have had any reviving, it hath
been but as a morning dew; and yet at laſt
when the Fathers appointed time was come,
wherein he hath raiſed them up to joy, and
peace in believing, and given them life, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and ſtrength, then hath the Spirit
brought to their remembrance, the things
which they heard many years before, and
then have they been wonderfully overcome,
and taken with it, and it hath brought forth
fruit abundantly in them. Therefore Saints,
you that ſay you finde little or no effect, the
word hath upon you for the preſent, be not
thereby diſcouraged, but goe on to reade and
to hear the word ſtill, for it is a means which
is often bleſſed to many.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, Is it ſo, that it is a bleſſed
thing to reade and hear the Word, ſo as to
keep it? Then it ſerves to exhort all, as to
hear and reade the Word, ſo to look beyond
it, in the frequent hearing and reading of it
waiting for the coming in of the Spirit; for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98732:30"/>
the bleſſing is not pronounced upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the Word only, but ſuch as hear it, and
keep it, and hear it and doe it: and then ſhalt
thou hear the Word ſo as to keep it, when
the Spirit comes along with it: Therefore
when thou comeſt to hear the Word, doe not
reſt upon the bare hearing of the Word, but
expect the coming of the Spirit; and that
thou maieſt thus doe, conſider that there are
frequent preſidents in Scripture, That in the
hearing of the Word the Spirit hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
as you have it, <hi>Act. 10. 44. While Peter
yet ſpake theſe words, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them
which heard the Word.</hi> And in the ſecond of
the <hi>Acts</hi> at the 41. verſe, we finde that there
were three thouſand ſouls converted, at the
preaching of <hi>Peter.</hi> And when <hi>Philip</hi> went
down to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and preached the Word,
there were by his preaching many convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both men, and women, as appears <hi>Acts
8.</hi> 12. There are ſeverall other paſſages in the
<hi>Acts</hi> to this purpoſe. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>Received you the Spirit by the workes of
the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> Whereby it
appears, That the Spirit was received by the
hearing of the word of faith, and therfore it
is that the Apoſtle cals the Miniſtery of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98732:30"/>
Goſpel, The miniſtration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.
3.</hi> 8. Therefore let all be encouraged in the
hearing of the Word to wait for the Spirit,
whereby they may not be forgetfull hearers,
but doers of the Word, and be bleſſed in ſo
doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. And in the laſt place it ſerves to
encourage all Saints, to be frequent in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, and meditating upon the book of the
<hi>Revelation;</hi> for there is a bleſſing particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounced upon them that read, or hear,
and keep the things that are written therein:
therefore let none be diſcouraged from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thoſe things that are written in this
book, becauſe they are ſo hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and are more darke and myſterious
than moſt places of Scripture. It is true,
they are ſo, but to encourage us to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in reading of it, notwithſtanding the
myſteriouſneſſe of it, the holy Ghoſt hear
pronounces a particular bleſſing to it, which
is a ſpeciall encouragement to incite us to
the reading of it. And there is alſo another
encouragement in theſe words, <hi>For the time is
at hand.</hi> And now if we be deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
of the things that concern the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time, then let us look diligently into
the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> for this word, <hi>The

ſhall hold true, in all ages, and times, even
until the glorious appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,
to judge the quick and the dead, when all
ſhall appear before the judgement ſeat of
Chriſt: for there hath been no age ſince the
delivery of it, in which it might not be ſaid,
<hi>The time is at hand,</hi> that is, The time is come,
in which ſome part or other of it, hath been
fulfilling: for at the time when this <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was given to <hi>John,</hi> then was fulfilling
that which is ſpoken concerning the ſeven
Churches; and ſoon after, that which was
to be done in the opening of the ſeals, began
to be fulfilled, which is not yet fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
and about four hundred year after
<hi>Johns</hi> time, began that to be fulfilled, which
is ſpoken of concerning the riſing of the
beaſt, and what is revealed concerning the
actions of the beaſt; and the pouring out of
the viols upon the beaſt, hath been ſince that
and now is a fulfilling, and what is ſpoken
concerning the totall ruine of the beaſt, and
the happy deliverance of the Saints, and the
glorious ſtate of the Church after deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
ſhall be hereafter fulfilled. So that

            <p>And now ſince the following Diſcourſe, is
on a part of the book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> let
theſe two motives, which here you have to
ſtirre you up to the reading of the whole

concerns the preſent time, incite you to the
reading, and the ſerious conſideration of
what is herein delivered, concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act

at the 15. verſe, when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
City was put into a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
enlarged, raiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
there is mention
made of a golden reed
wherewith it was to be meaſured. But here
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98732:33"/>
is not a golden reed, but a reed like unto a
rod, importing, that it is a chaſtized and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
depreſſed, low condition into which
it was at this time to be put: and that it was
indeed ſo, appears in what follows.</p>
               <q>And the Angel ſtood, ſaying]</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Angel,</hi> chap. 10. 1. <hi>is thus deſcribed:</hi>
And I ſaw a mighty Angel come down from heaven,
cloathed with a cloud, and a rain-bow was upon his
head, and his face was as it were the Sunne, and
his feet as pillars of fire. <hi>This deſcription re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
that which is given of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
Chap. 1. 15, 16. <hi>by which it appears, That this
Angel here ſpoken of is Jeſus Chriſt. It is
indeed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and diſpoſe all things in, and concerning
his Church, and all things in the world, and
therefore it is, that</hi> all power is given unto him,
in heaven, and earth, <hi>Mat. 28. He is the</hi> King
of the holy hill of Sion, <hi>Pſalm. 2. And he muſt</hi>
rule the Nations with a rod of iron, and break
them in peeces like a Potters veſſel, <hi>and</hi> he muſt
raign untill he have put all his enemies under his
feet.</p>
               <q>Riſe and meaſure]</q>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus doth not leave his people
in the hand of enemies, nor under the rod
of the wicked in a careleſſe manner, as if he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98732:33"/>
did not care how much they were given up
to the hand of the enemies: no, but they are
meaſured out to affliction, and ſo far as they
are meaſured out unto it ſo far ſhall they be
under affliction, and no farther. So God mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<hi>Job</hi> to affliction, <hi>All that he hath is in thy
power only upon himſelf put not forth thine hand,</hi>
Job 1. 12. and again, <hi>Behold, he is in thine hand, but
ſave his life.</hi> The wicked ſhall not goe a hairs-breadth
beyond the meaſure. Jeſus Chriſt
hath ſuch a tender reſpect unto all his people
in their ſufferings, that they ſhall have no

               <q>Meaſure the Temple]</q>
               <p>The word Temple in the old Teſtament,
is uſed only for that Houſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> built
in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Lord, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Temple of the Lord; it being the
place wherein God was in a ſpeciall manner
preſent, and wherein he would in a ſpeciall
manner be worſhipped. But in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
it is uſed, firſt, for the Church, the
Saints of God, of which that Temple was a
figure: for as God was in a ſpeciall manner
preſent in that Temple, ſo he is in a ſpeciall
manner preſent in his people. And ſo we
have it, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. For ye are the temple of the
living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them,</hi>

                  <hi>and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they
ſhall be my people.</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. What know ye not
that your bodies are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt,
which is in you, &amp;c.</hi> and thus the word Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the new Teſtament is uſed for the
Saints, as the Temple was a figure of them,
as they have a ſpeciall preſence of God in
them. Which is likewiſe ſpoken of <hi>Iſay. 66.
1, 2. Thus faith the Lord, the Heaven is my Thron,
and the Earth is my foot-ſtool: where is the houſe
that ye build unto me, and were is the place of my
reſt, for all theſe things hath my hand made, and all
theſe things have been ſaith the Lord, but to this
man will I look; even unto him that is poor, and of
a contrite ſpirit, and that trembleth at my word.</hi> So
that he that is of a poor, and of a contrite
ſpirit, and trembleth at the word of God,
ſhall be the houſe, the Temple of God. As
we have it alſo <hi>Iſay.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, The word Temple in the
new Teſtament, as it is uſed for thoſe in
whom there is a ſpeciall preſence of God;
ſo it is uſed to ſignify that means by which
knowledge, and inſtruſtion is given out: as
the Temple of old was the place where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were to receive inſtruction and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And in this ſenſe it is uſed, <hi>Rev. 21.
22. And I ſaw no Temple therein, for the Lord
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98732:35"/>
God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of
it.</hi> This is ſpoken of the new Jeruſalem, of
that glorious ſtate the Church ſhall be in,
when they ſhall be all taught of God, from
the greateſt to the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Now the word Temple heer in the Text,
doth ſignify theſe.</p>
               <p>Eirſt, It ſignifies the Saints of God, as they
are they in whom God in a ſpeciall manner
dwels. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſignifies the Ordinances, and
means whereby knowledge is diſpenſed, and
inſtruction is received: for it is the Saints
that are as lights in the World, and they
both inſtuct the ignorant, and edify one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
eſpecially when they are congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
aſſembled together to worſhip God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own will, and to propheſy
to edify one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Temple of God and the Alter, and them
that worſhip therein]</hi> It clearly appears in
theſe words, that the word Temple heer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Saints, both as they are an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God through the ſpirit; and ſo are
his Temple, and as they are being aſſembled
together, the means of inſtruction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
knowledge, and doe worſhip God
aright: For leaſt the word Temple ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98732:36"/>
not be full enough to expreſſe this, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>And the Altar</hi> (which in the Temple
was the place where they worſhipped God)
<hi>and them that worſhip therein.</hi> Not only the
place of worſhip, but the worſhippers. So
that this takes in all Saints, as they are a
Temple, as their aſſemblies are the place
wherein God is worſhipped, and inſtruction
is given, and received; and as they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
as Saints worſhipping God, and
poſſeſſing God.</p>

               <p>The Court is ſaid to be without the

               <p>It was the Temple and the Altar, and

that was to be given unto the Gentiles by
meaſure; ſo that this word <hi>(for it)</hi> may be
read thus (for the Temple) <hi>Is given unto
the Gentiles]</hi> The word Gentiles in the old
Teſtament, when the Temple was in its
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98732:37"/>
glory, was uſed to expreſſe ſuch as were not
of the Church of God; for the Iſraelites on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were accounted the Church: &amp; all others
were looked upon as ſtrangers to it, ſuch as
were a far off: as ſuch as were enemies to
the Temple, and would have the Temple
ruined and laid waſt. But note, though the
difference between Jewes and Gentiles ſince
the daies of the Goſpel be taken away, and
the Gentiles, as well as the Jewes may now
be of the Church of God, if they be built
upon the Lord Jeſus; yet the word Gentiles
is heer uſed to expreſſe thoſe that were not
of the Church, nor of the Temple; but
would have the Temple ruined. And as the
Babylonians of old had the Temple for a
while given unto them: So now Jeſus
Chriſt gives his ſpirituall Temple, into the
hands of theſe Gentiles the myſticall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
for a while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the holy City]</hi> This title, <hi>the holy City,</hi>
we finde in Scripture, is firſt given unto the
City of Jeruſalem, the City wherein the
materiall Temple was ſcituate, as appears
<hi>Matth.</hi> 37. 3. where it is ſaid at the death of
our Saviour, <hi>That the graves were opened, and
many bodies of the Saints which ſlept aroſe, and
came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98732:37"/>
went into the holy City, and appeared unto many.</hi>
Which City it is evident was the City of
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And indeed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a City more holy then others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was the place wherein men ought in
a more eſpeciall manner to worſhip God.
And therefore ſaies the woman of <hi>Samaria,
Ye ſay in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to
worſhip;</hi> And our Saviour doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
this, (for indeed it is out of all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction)
that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been the place
where men ought to worſhip, for God had
placed his name there, and there he would
be worſhiped; becauſe the Temple was there
wherein was his ſpeciall preſence. So that in
this reſpect, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was once a more holy
City then others.</p>
               <p>But when the cauſe was taken away the
effect ceaſed, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ceaſed to be the
place where men were enjoined to worſhip
God, and God had removed his ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
from the Temple; then <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was
no more holy then another place.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to ceaſe to
be the place of worſhip, and the holy place;
therefore it is that our Saviour, <hi>Iohn 4. 21,
23.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The hour commeth when ye ſhall neither
in the mountain of Samaria, nor yet at Jeruſalem
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98732:38"/>
worſhip the Father; but the true worſhippers ſhall
worſhip the Father in Spirit, and in truth: for the
Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> As if he had
ſaid, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall not be the place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
men ſhall not worſhip God there, for
if men doe perform <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> worſhip, that
is, worſhip with that worſhip that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to an outward place, it ſhal be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as no worſhip, no, men ſhall not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ſuch as worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt worſhip him with an inward, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
worſhip, and in truth, that is, in the
Son, <hi>in the Spirit, and in the Son,</hi> and ſuch the
Father ſeeks to worſhip him, ſuch he is now
a ſeeking out, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and
ſuch worſhip is moſt pleaſing unto him.
So that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had once the title of
<hi>the holy City.</hi> It was once the place wherein
God was worſhipped, but it is now ceaſed to
be ſo.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, This title, <hi>The holy City,</hi> is
given in Scripture unto that City, of which
that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old was a figure, and that
is, the Saints, and people of God, who are
all citizens of <hi>the holy City.</hi> And therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Saints at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 19. Ye are no more ſtrangers, and
forreigners; but fellow citizens with the Saints,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98732:38"/>
and of the houſhold of God.</hi> And that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
of old was a figure of this <hi>Holy City,</hi> appears
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 22. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. where the Saints
are called by the name of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> only
they are differenced from the material <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
in that they are called, <hi>The heavenly
Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem which is above.</hi> Now
that this <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
of Saints, and Sanctified ones, and
therefore muſt needs be a <hi>Holy City.</hi> I ſay
that this Spirituall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath this title,
<hi>The holy City,</hi> given to it doth appear, <hi>Revel.
21. 2. And I John ſaw the holy City, new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
comming down from God out of Heaven, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
as a bride adorned for her husband.</hi> Who is
the ſpouſe, the bride that is adorned for her
husband Jeſus Chriſt, but his Saints? They
then are the new and heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
they are <hi>the holy City.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And the holy City ſhall they (that is the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
fore-ſpoken of) tread under foot]</q>
               <p>To be trouden under foot by an enemy, is
the higheſt kinde of inſultation of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
over a people that poſſibly can be: for
what greater contempt, and ſcorn, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
can an enemy expreſſe, then by treading,
a perſon or a people, under feet? And yet
this is the condition, the Church was put
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98732:39"/>
into, which is ſpoken of in the propheſie of
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 51. 23. where it was ſaid that
thoſe enemies, that afflicted the Saints, <hi>Said
to their Souls bow down, that we may goe over, and
their bodies was laid as the ground, and as the
ſtreets to them that went over.</hi> And this is the
condition which the holy City, the Temple
of God, his precious Saints are here alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
unto, even to be trod under foot,
to be depreſſed, and greatly perſecuted, to
be bowed down under the feet of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to be made as the ground, and as the
ſtreet to them to goe over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Querie.</hi> But now, before I proceed any
further, the Querie will be, What thoſe
<hi>Gentiles</hi> are in particular, to whom the
Temple, and the holy City was to be given,
and by whom they were to be trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot? For as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple
of old were given to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
ſo the queſtion is now, Who the
particular enemies are to whom the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the holy City now are delivered?
For though the holy City hath many
enemies, yet ſhe is not given to them
all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Though in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there be no other deſcription of them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98732:39"/>
but only this, <hi>the Gentiles:</hi> yet we have a
large deſcription of them, in three ſeverall
Chapters of this propheſie: which deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as they lie, I ſhall here incert.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is,</hi> Rev. 12. 3. 4. And there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
another wonder in Heaven, and behold a
great red Dragon having ſeaven heads, and ten
horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his heads, and his
tail drew a third part of the Stars of Heaven, and
did caſt them to the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond place in which the enemies
of the Saints, (to whom they are given for
a while) are deſcribed is,</hi> Rev. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>verſes, which is as followes.</hi> And
I ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea, and ſaw a Beaſt
riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven heads and ten
horns, and upon his horns ten Crowns, and upon his
head the name of blaſphemy. And the Beaſt which
I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were
as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
a Lion, and the Dragon gave him his power, and
ſeat, and great authority. And I ſaw one of his
heads as it were wounded to death, and his deadly
wound was healed, and all the world wondered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the Dragon which
gave power unto the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the
Beaſt ſaying, Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is
able to make war with him? And there was given
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98732:40"/>
unto him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
and power was given unto him to continue
fourty, and two months. And he opened his mouth in
blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and
his tabernacle, and them that dwelt in heaven. And
it was given unto him to make war with the Saints,
and to overcome them: and power was given him
over all kindreds and tongues, and nations, and all
that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe
names are not written in the book of life of the
Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>The third place where the enemies of the
Temple, and the holy City, <hi>viz.</hi> The Saints
are deſcribed, is <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3, 4, 5, 6. as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>And I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet
coloured Beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having
ſeven heads, and ten horns, and the woman was
arraied in purple, and ſcarlet colour, and decked
with gold, and precious ſtone, and pearls, having a
golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and
filthineſſe of her fornication: and upon her forehead
was a name written, <hi>MYSTERY, BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYLON
THE GREAT, THE
MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND
ABOMINATIONS OF THE
EARTH.</hi> And I ſaw the woman drunken with
the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98732:40"/>
Martyrs of Jeſus: and when I ſaw her I wondred
with great admiration.</p>
               <p>Thus now the enemies of the Church,
the Temple or holy City, which in the text
in hand are only deſcribed by this word
<hi>(the Gentiles)</hi> in theſe paſſages are more
largely characterized.</p>
               <p>But theſe expreſſions uſed in theſe deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of theſe enemies, being for the moſt
part very myſterious: we have theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
opened, and unveiled in the 17. Chap.
from the 7, verſ. to the end of the Chapter,
as it followes.</p>
               <p>And the Angel ſaid unto me wherefore didſt thou
marvel? I will tell thee the myſtery of the woman,
and of the Beaſt that carrieth her which hath the
ſeven heads, and ten horns. The Beaſt that thou
ſaweſt was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the
bottomeleſſe pit, and goe into perdition; and they
that dwell on the earth ſhall wonder, whoſe names
were not written in the book of life, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World, when they behold the Beaſt that
was, and is not, and yet is. And here is the minde
which hath wiſdome: The ſeven heads are ſeven
mountains, on which the woman ſitteth, and there
are ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is, and the
other is not yet come: and when he commeth, he
muſt continue a ſhort ſpace. And the Beaſt that was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98732:41"/>
and is not even he is the eighth, and is of the ſeven,
and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which
thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings which have received no
Kindome as yet: but receive power as Kings one
hour with the Beaſt. Theſe have one minde, and
ſhall give their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt.
Theſe ſhall make warre with the Lamb, and the
Lamb ſhall overcome them: for he is Lord of Lords,
and King of Kings, and they that are with him, are
called, and choſen, and faithfull. And he ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me the waters which thou ſaweſt, where the
Whore ſitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and tongues. And the ten horns which thou
ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore,
and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat
her fleſh, and burn her with fire, for God hath put
in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and
give their Kingdom unto the Beaſt, untill the words
of God ſhall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou
ſaweſt is that great City which reigneth over the
Kings of the Earth.</p>
               <p>In theſe words, we have the myſterie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
of what is delivered in the 12, 13, and
17. Chapters, concerning the Beaſt, and the
Woman, and the Heads, and the Horns, and
the many waters: which are all myſterious
expreſſions, and hard to be underſtood, (as
thoſe were, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. from the 1, to the 9, ver.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98732:41"/>
untill the interpretation was given to <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
at the 16, verſe and ſo on) but the Angel
having in this 17, Chap. opened theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
now the meaning of them is more
apparent: So that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be queried, What is the
Beaſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have it anſwered, verſe 8. in theſe
words,</hi> The Beaſt that thou ſaweſt was, and is not;
and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
perdition. <hi>Now by comparing this with
ſome paſſages in the 12, and 13. Chapters,
we ſhall plainly ſee what the Beaſt is. In the
11. Chap. at the 9, verſe, the Dragon there
mentioned, is ſaid to be,</hi> That old ſerpent called
the Devill, and Satan which deceiveth the whole
world. <hi>And in the 13. Chap. at the 1, and 2.
verſes, it is ſaid, That</hi> a Beaſt did riſe up out of
the Sea, having ſeven heads, and ten horns, and
upon his horns ten Crowns, and upon his heads the
names of blaſphemy: and the Beaſt was like unto a
Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a Bear, and
his mouth as the mouth of a Lion; and the Dragon
gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>So then; The Beaſt that hath ſeven heads,
and ten horns, and is like unto a Leopard,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſome wicked one in whom the devil
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98732:42"/>
raigns; who hath power, and a ſeat, and
great authority in the earth: which power,
and ſeat, and great authority, was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him of the devil. And though that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
one, that hath that deviliſh power, and
authority, be diſtinct from the devil; (as
he that receives is diſtinct from him that
gives:) yet they are ſo one, as the devill is
ſaid to be in the Beaſt: for what the Beaſt is
ſaid to doe, the devill is ſaid to doe: for in
the 13. Chapter, at the 7, verſ. it is the
Beaſt that is ſaid <hi>to make war with Saints:</hi> but
in the 12. Chapter, at the 17, verſe, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is ſaid to doe it. And again, they are ſo
one, as the Beaſt is ſaid to be the devill; and
therefore when the Angel comes to declare
what the Beaſt is, in the fore-mentioned
place, ſaies he, <hi>The Beaſt ſhall aſcend out of the
bottomleſſe pit.</hi> It is not ſaid he ſhall receive
his authority from him that aſcends out of
the bottomleſſe pit, (though that be the
meaning of it, as before appears:) but <hi>He
ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit;</hi> to ſhew the
oneneſſe of the devil, and the Beaſt. Thus
the myſterie of the Beaſt is unfolded; and
it appears, that the Beaſt is a wicked one,
that hath a deviliſh power, and authority,
and is one with the devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98732:42"/>
                  <hi>This is he of whom it is ſaid,</hi> All the world
wondered after the Beaſt; and worſhipped the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
that gave power unto the Beaſt; and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the Beaſt ſaying, Who is like unto the Beaſt?
Who is able to make warre with him? <hi>And of
whom it was ſaid, That</hi> there was given unto
him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and power was given unto him to continue
fourty and two months, &amp;c. <hi>As you have it pages
46, and</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, If it be queried, What that
Woman is, that is ſaid Chapter 17. 3. to ſit
upon this Beaſt?</p>
               <p>We have an Anſwer to this, in the 18,
verſe of this 17. Chapter, in theſe words:
<hi>And the Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great
City which raigneth over the Kings of the earth.</hi>
Now what that great City was, that did
then raign over the Kings of the earth;
though it were not ſo apparent in ſeverall
other hiſtories as it is; yet the Scriptures
could ſufficiently inform us: for it informs
us, that <hi>Tribute was paid to Caeſar; Matth.</hi> 22. 17.
And that becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> was he that raigned
over the kings of the earth, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Pilate, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſars
friend.</hi> And that <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the higheſt authority that then was: as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98732:43"/>
appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 10, 11. Now the place
where <hi>Caeſars</hi> royall ſeat was then, was the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears in that <hi>Paul</hi> was
ſent thither. So that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>the City that
then raigned over the Kings of the earth.</hi> And
therefore it was that it was accounted ſuch
a priviledge to be a <hi>Roman, Acts</hi> 22. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Now ſince it is clear in Scripture; (and
all hiſtories do acknowledge it,) that <hi>Rome</hi>
was the great City that raigned over the
Kings of the earth; Then it appears, That
<hi>Rome</hi> is that Woman that is ſaid to ſit upon
the Beaſt. Now this being apparent, it doth
appear the more clearly what the Beaſt is.</p>
               <p>It was clear before, That the Beaſt was a
wicked one in whom the Devill raigned,
that had received power, and a ſeat, and
great Authority from the Devil: but it did
not ſo clearly appear who that wicked one
in particular is. But here it appears that it
is particularly he upon whom the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſitteth: he that ſupports it.</p>
               <p>Now it is apparent that it is that wicked
one the Pope, that is the ſupport of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
City. He it is that bears her up in her
pompe, and pride, and filthy abominable,
Sodomiticall practiſes. He is the Beaſt upon
which that great Whore ſitteth. And the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98732:43"/>
City of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been, and to this day is
ſuch a fountain of filthineſſe, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and all curſed abominations: as
this name appears ſo perſpicuouſly in her
forehead, as he that runs may reade it,
MYSTERIE, BABYLON THE
GREAT, THE MOTHER OF
HARLOTS, AND ABOMINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS
OF THE EARTH. And
it is apparent, that <hi>She is drunken with the
blood of Saints, and the blood of the Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly, If the Queſtion be, What the
ſeven heads of the Beaſt are?</p>
               <p>The Angel gives an anſwer to that, at the
9, verſe of the 17. Chapter. <hi>The ſeven heads
are ſeven mountains upon which the Woman ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</hi>
The Woman being the City of <hi>Rome;</hi>
the ſeven heads of the Beaſt, are ſaid to be
the ſeven mountains upon which that City
was built. And with this Hiſtorians agree,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſay, that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was founded
upon ſeven mountains. Now theſe may
as properly be ſaid to be the ſeven heads of
the Beaſt; as the ten Kings may be ſaid to
be his ten horns: as will appear by and by.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If it ſhould be enquired, What
the ten horns are, mentioned Chap. 12. 3.
and 13. 1. &amp; 17. 3?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98732:44"/>
The Angel anſwers that in the 12, verſe
of the ſeventeen Chapter, in theſe words:
<hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt are ten Kings,
which have received no Kingdome as yet, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
power as kings one hour with the Beaſt. Theſe
have one minde, and ſhall give their power, and
ſtrength unto the Beaſt; theſe ſhall make war with
the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words the Angel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veils
this alſo, and tels us, that thoſe which
are myſteriouſly expreſt by the ten horns of
the Beaſt, are the ten Kings, which did give
up their power, and ſtrength unto the Beaſt
with one conſent, &amp; one mind, and thus it
came to paſſe: for when the devil gave the
Pope that power, and authority, whereby
the Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſubjected to him,
then the ten Kingdomes that were under
<hi>Rome,</hi> did likewiſe willingly give up their
power to him alſo; and were ſubjected to
the Beaſt, and as he, ſo they alſo made warre
with the Lamb the Lord Jeſus in his Saints:
and ſo became the ten horns of the Beaſt, by
which he became the more dreadfull, and
terrible: for he had not been ſo dreadful, if
he had but only had the ſtrength of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
heads, of that great City that is ſeated
upon ſeven hils: but having theſe ten horns
alſo, theſe ten Kingdoms he was become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
terrible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:98732:44"/>
But fifthly, If it ſhould be queried, What
the many waters are upon which the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſitteth, mentioned Chap. 17. 1. &amp; 13. 1?</p>
               <p>The Angel anſwers that alſo, in the 15.
verſe of the 17. Chapter, in theſe words:
<hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt where the Whore ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
tongues.</hi> So that this is not left in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
neither; but the Angel plainly declares,
That by the waters is meant the peoples,
and nations, and multitudes, and tongues.
And the Whore is ſaid to ſit upon them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have willingly ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto her, to be as it were vaſſals to
her.</p>
               <p>Now by this time it appears from theſe
12, 13, and 17. Chapters, what thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
(mentioned in the text, to whom the
Temple, and the holy City was given,) are
in particular: for it appears that as though
the Church of old had many enemies, yet
they were particularly given to the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> So now, the Church
is particularly given to be trodden under
foot of myſticall <hi>Babylon, Rome,</hi> and of that
wicked one the Pope, that hath received
from the devil, his power, and his ſeat, and
great authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98732:45"/>
Now that theſe particular enemies did as
the text declares, <hi>Tread the holy City under foot,</hi>
appears alſo in theſe following paſſages:</p>
               <p>Rev. 12. 13, 14, 15. The Dragon perſecuted
the Woman, which brought forth a man-childe: and
to the Woman were given two wings of a great
Eagle, that ſhe might flee into the wilderneſſe, into
her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and
times, and half a time from the face of the ſerpent;
and the ſerpent caſt out of his mouth water as a flood
after the Woman, that he might cauſe her to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away of the flood. <hi>That by the Dragon
here mentioned, is meant the Pope who is
one with him, appears page</hi> 49. 50.</p>
               <p>Now he is here ſaid to perſecute the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
(the Church) that is cloathed with the
Sun, and the Moon under her feet. And this
wicked one perſecutes the Church, as ſhe is
thereby driven into the wilderneſſe: that is,
into a deſolate, bewildred, barren, and ſad
condition; and that, ſo long as the Beaſt
remains: (for that's the meaning of a time,
times, and half a time, as will appear in
what follows,) as if it were not poſſible for
the Church to be in any other then a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
condition, untill the ruine of the
Beaſt, and the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> were come. And
when he had driven the Church into that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98732:45"/>
deſolate wilderneſſe condition, he was not
therewith ſatisfied, but caſt out water as a
flood after her, that he might cauſe her to
be carried away with the flood. And hath
it not been even thus? Did not that ſcarlet
coloured Beaſt ſo perſecute the holy City,
all the Saints of God ever ſince his firſt riſe,
as that they have been in a deſolate, ſad,
wilderneſſe condition ever ſince? And yet is
he not ſo ſatisfied, but is ſending out of his
floods of malice, and fury after the Saints;
and would ſwallow them all up if it were
poſſible.</p>
               <p>Again, Chapter 12. 17. he is ſaid, <hi>To be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roth with the Woman, and to make war with the
remnant of her ſeed, which keep the Commandments
of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And
Chap. 13. 6, 7. <hi>And the Beaſt opened his mouth
in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name,
and his tabernacle, and them that dwelt in heaven;
and it was given unto him to make war with the
Saints, and to overcome them.</hi> And hath not
that Beaſt, the, Pope punctually done as is
here ſpoken of him, in opening his mouth
in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his
name and his Saints? Hath he not ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was the head of the Church, and that he
could forgive ſins, with many other blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98732:46"/>
And hath not he made war with
the Saints, which kept the Commandments
of God, and the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt?
Have not they been the only ones with
whom he hath made war? The moſt vileſt,
and moſt abominable perſons were moſt
nouriſhed by that curſed Beaſt; and the moſt
precious Saints have been moſt hated, and
hath he not alſo overcome them? For, for
this twelve hundred years he hath ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, as they never had power to riſe
up againſt him untill of late. Again, Chap.
17. 6. the great Whore is ſaid <hi>to be drunke
with the blood of Saints, and with the blood of the
Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi> And Chap. 18. 24. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſaid of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
great Whore, <hi>That in her was found the blood of
Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain
upon the earth.</hi> And moſt evident it is, That
<hi>Rome</hi> hath not only made others drunken
with the cup of her abominations, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of her fornications; but is her ſelf
drunken with the blood of the Saints, and
the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, which ſhe
hath taken in greedily, and eagerly, and in
her it will be found, when with violence ſhe
ſhall be thrown down, and become the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of devils, and the hold of every
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98732:46"/>
foul ſpirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hurtfull Bird. Thus by this time it appears
by whom, and how the holy City hath been
troden under foot.</p>
               <q>And the holy City ſhall they tread under foot, fourty
and two moneths.]</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>It being apparent, what the enemies of
the Church are, and that they have troden
the Temple, and holy City under foot. The
next thing to be cleared, is the time how
long thoſe enemies of the Church were to
tread her under foot. And that is heer ſaid
to be fourty and two moneths. Now what
the meaning of this is, will more clearly
appear, by comparing it with four other
paſſages in the prophecy of this Book. One
is</hi> Chap. 12. 6. And the woman fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
where ſhe had a place prepared of God,
that they ſhould feed her there a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and threeſcore daies. <hi>A ſecond, Chap. 12.
14.</hi> And to the woman were given two wings of a
great Eagle, that ſhe might flee into the wilderneſs:
into her place; where ſhe is nouriſhed, for a time,
and times, and halfe a time, from the face of the
Serpent. <hi>A third, is Chap.</hi> 11. 3. And I will
give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall
propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore
daies, cloathed in ſackcloth. <hi>A fourth, is Chap.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98732:47"/>
13.</hi> 5. And there was given unto the Beaſt, a mouth
ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemies; and power
was given unto him to continue fourty and two
months. &amp; it was given unto him to make war, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the text ſpeaks of the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church, under the expreſſion
of being trod under foot: and the firſt of
theſe paſſages ſpeaks of the afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, under the expreſſion of
flying into the wilderneſſe; becauſe of the
perſecution of her enemies. The ſecond of
theſe paſſages, ſpeaks likewiſe of the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition of the Chuch, under the ſame
expreſſion as the former, of fleeing into the
wilderneſſe. The third of theſe expreſſions,
ſpeakes of the afflicted condition of the
Church, under the expreſſion of being cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in ſack-cloath. and the 4. ſpeaks of the
afflicted condition of the Church, under the
expreſſion of the Beaſts making war with
the Saints and overcoming them, and they
all ſpeaking the ſame thing: the affliction of
the Church, do alſo ſpeak of the ſame time
of the continuance of that affliction, with
this in the Text. Now in the Text, that time
is expreſſed under the expreſſion of fourty
and two moneths. And

               <p>Now that theſe agree in one, appears thus.</p>
               <p>In fourty and two moneths, accounting
thirty daies to a moneth, there is juſt a
thouſand two hundred and threeſcore
daies: ſo that fourty and two moneths, and
a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore
daies, agree in one. Again in three years and
a half, we have juſt fourty and two months,
accounting twelve moneths to a year: So
that a time, times, and half a time, that is,
one year, two years, and half a year, which
is three years and a half, agrees with fourty
and two moneths. And with a thouſand
two hundred and threeſcore daies. So that
the time the Church was to continue under
affliction, to be troden under foot, was a
thouſand two hundred &amp; threeſcore daies.</p>
               <p>Now as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a day for a year <hi>(Eze. 4, 5, 6.)</hi> ſo this
one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore
daies, is to be accounted a thouſand two

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:98732:48"/>
So then whereas in the Text it is ſaid,
that the Church ſhould be troden under
foot fourty and two moneths by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
that is particularly, by that wicked
one the Pope, and his adherents, the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Babylonians: the meaning of that
fourty two moneths is, <hi>A thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and threeſcore years.</hi> And it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be acknowledged to be ſo; for the Beaſt
hath troden the holy City under foot, for

becauſe they are ſaid to continue ſo
long, as the holy City was to be troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot of the Beaſt; which is a thouſand
two hundred and threeſcore years. Now
twelve hundred years, is a terme of time
which no man ever lived when men lived
longeſt: much leſſe ſince the flood, therefore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98732:48"/>
ſince the two Witneſſes are ſaid to continue
twelve hundred and ſixty years; they cannot
be confined onely unto two men, but do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all the Saints, that have been Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the truths of Jeſus Chriſt, ever ſince
the Beaſt began to perſecute the Church: for
Jeſus Chriſt during all that time, did never
leave himſelf without witneſſes, though for
the moſt part of that time, the number of
them were very ſmall, in compariſon of the
falſe prophets of the Beaſt: which may be
the reaſon, why they are here expreſt by the
ſmalleſt of numbers, the number two. But I
ſay, Jeſus Chriſt hath never left himſelf
without Witneſſes; but hath had ſome at all
times, that have been witneſſes of his truths,
in oppoſition to the Beaſt. And thoſe are
they, that are here in the text ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
a thouſand two hundred, and ſixty
daies. Now as this text holds forth, That
Jeſus Chriſt hath had Witneſſes, during all
the raign of the Beaſt, and the perſecuted
condition of the Church: ſo other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in this propheſie confirm it, as Chap.
8. 9. <hi>I ſaw under the Altar, the ſouls of them that
were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which they held.</hi> Theſe were ſome that had
witneſſed, and teſtified the truths of Chriſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98732:49"/>
againſt the Beaſt, and ſealed their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with their bloud; for they were ſlain for
the Word of God, and for the teſtimony
which they held. And to ſhew that theſe
were not all that witneſſed the truths of
Chriſt, but that Jeſus Chriſt had continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome that were his Witneſſes, which the
beaſt ſhould continually be ſlaying; it is ſaid
in the 11. verſe of that Chap. <hi>That they ſhould
reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, untill their fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
alſo, and their brethren that ſhould be killed
as they were, ſhould be fulfilled:</hi> So that Chriſt
had a further number of Witneſſes, which
were alſo to honour him, by laying down
their lives for his truth. And Chap. 12. 11.
The Witneſſes of Chriſt, are again menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
for it is ſaid, <hi>That the Dragon did make
war, with them which kept the commandments of
God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And
verſe 12. they are ſaid, <hi>To overcome the devil, by
the bloud of the Lamb,</hi> (by which all Saints do
overcome him) <hi>and by the word of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
for they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi>
Here it appears that the Saints did ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the truths of Chriſt; as they counted
not their lives dear unto them, but laid
them down to ſeale the truth which they
held, which was a means of convincing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98732:49"/>
many of the truth, and thereby they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomers
of the Beaſt. And <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 24. when
<hi>Babylon</hi> came to be throwne downe, it is ſaid,
That in her was found the bloud of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and of all that were ſlain upon the
earth: whereby it appears, That during all
the raign of the Beaſt, he hath been ſlaying
the Prophets, Witneſſes, and Saints of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus by theſe ſeverall paſſages it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That Chriſt hath had his Witneſſes
during all the raign of the Beaſt; and it is
apparent that this word, <hi>My two Witneſſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all thoſe Witneſſes of Chriſt, that
have been during all the raign of the Beaſt:
for they have been ſaid to propheſie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
two hundred and threeſcore years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how could all the Witneſſes of
Chriſt, be ſaid to propheſie?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Every Saint in a ſence, may be
ſaid to be a Prophet. For they are Prophets
to whom God diſcovers his ſecrets: and
there is no true Saints, but the ſecrets of God
are diſcovered to them, <hi>Pſal. 15. 14. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he
will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> The truth is, it is
the diſcoveries of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt,
and of hidden truths that maketh Saints. If
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98732:50"/>
the Lord did not reveal his ſecrets unto poor
ſouls, it would not be poſſible for them to
be Saints. Now then as ſoon as the ſoul is
made a Saint, it is made a Prophet: for when
the Lord hath revealed himſelf unto the ſoul
and diſcovered his ſecrets to it, made it to
ſee the wonderfull things of his law, and
cauſed it to rejoyce in the ſweet diſcoveries
of his grace, the ſoul cannot chooſe but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them to others. Yea the word is as a
fire in its boſome, and it cannot hold it in,
according to that rule, <hi>When thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> This is ever the
ſweet temper of a real Saint, he cannot but
give vent to the bublings of Chriſt upon his
heart: and that in oppoſing gain-ſaiers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
earneſtly for the faith, and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying,
exhorting, and comforting of other
Saints.</p>
               <p>Now that this is prophecying, is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 3. He
that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men to edification,
and exhortation, and comfort.</hi> Now this all
Saints in ſome meaſure or other can do, and
ſometimes doth; though ſome Saints can
doe it farre more excellently then others, yet
he that ſpeaketh to edification, exhortation
and conſolation, though with much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98732:50"/>
doth as truly propheſie as he that hath
greateſt abilities. Another Scripture is <hi>Act.
15. 32. And Judas and Silas being prophets alſo
themſelves, exhorted the brethren with many words,
and confirmed them.</hi> Here it is evident, That
to ſpeak the word of exhortation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
to the confirming of Saints in
the truth, is to propheſie: for <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
are ſaid to exhort and confirm the Saints,
as they were Prophets. Another paſſage to
this purpoſe is <hi>Revel. 19. 10. For the teſtimony
of Jeſus is the ſpirit of propheſie.</hi> This paſſage
gives a moſt clear anſwer to the queſtion,
What is it to propheſie? The Angel had ſaid,
<hi>Chap. 18. 24. That in Babylon was found the bloud
of Prophets, and of Saints.</hi> Now here he makes
it to appear, what the Prophets were that
<hi>Rome</hi> had ſlain; namely, they were they that
had the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for (ſaith he)
<hi>The teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of propheſie.</hi> So
that all Saints that have the teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
have the ſpirit of propheſie: and ſo all
that were ſlain for the teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
were they that did propheſie in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</p>
               <q>I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they
ſhall propheſie a thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98732:51"/>
Jeſus Chriſt having in the former verſe,
declared that the holy City ſhould be troden
under foot, which is the afflicted condition
of the Church, he doth here declare, what
ſupplies they ſhould have in that condition:
in that he ſaies that he would give unto
them this gift, that they ſhould propheſie.
Though they are to be deſtitute of outward
comforts and outward liberties by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
perſecuting of them, yet they are to
have inward comforts: the Lord will reveal
his ſecrets to them, which ſhall exceed all
outward comforts; they ſhall have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jeſus, which is the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <q>I will give unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall
propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore
daies.]</q>
               <p>That this one thouſand two hundred and
threeſcore daies, is a thouſand two hundred
and threeſcore years, appears in pag. 59, 60,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where it is evident, that it is the ſame
term of time with that in the former verſe,
and with that in former paſſages of this
book; and that the meaning of them all, is a
thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years,
there appears.</p>

               <p>While the Church was in the materiall

So the Church now being in myſticall

though they inwardly enjoy the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries

               </epigraph>
               <p>Theſe, that is, theſe two Witneſſes, are
the two Olive-trees. In that they are ſaid to
be (the) two Olive-trees, it implies it hath
reference unto ſome paſſage of Scripture,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98732:52"/>
wherein there is a former mention of them.
Now the place where they are mentioned, is
<hi>Zech.</hi> 4. ſo that <hi>Zechariah</hi> doth propheſie of
theſe two Witneſſes, under the expreſſion of
two Olive-trees; and therefore the holy
Ghoſt mentioning the Witneſſes here, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that theſe are they that are elſewhere
called the two Olive-trees. Now in that
place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 4. we finde that the Prophet
doth ask the Angel, What theſe be? And then
the Angel makes this anſwer, <hi>This is the word
of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, ſaying; not by might,
nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of hoſts:
Who art thou, ô great mountain? Before Zerubbabel
thou ſhalt become a plain, and he ſhall bring forth
the head ſtone thereof with ſhoutings, crying, Grace,
Grace unto it.</hi> Now this is ſomewhat a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
anſwer; but thus much appears in it:
That though the Saints ſeem to be little in
the eyes of men, and their enemy (whether
it be the materiall <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the myſtical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon)</hi>
ſeem to be a great mountain, as if it
were impoſſible for the Saints to remove
their mountainous enemy: yet they ſhall be
removed out of their way, the great mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain
ſhall become a plain before them; and
thoſe Saints that ſeem to be little, but as an
handfull to a mountain, they ſhall when the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98732:52"/>
great mountain is become a plain; again,
become a glorious Temple, and when it ſhal
be thus, there ſhall be ſhoutings, crying, Grace,
Grace unto it. And this appears to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the two Witneſſes in the Text; for
they have ſeemed to be ſmall and little, and
their enemy a great mountain: but undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
this mountain ſhall become a plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and they ſhall again become a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Temple, a mountain of holineſſe, the
praiſe of the whole earth. But the Prophet
at the 12 verſe, is ſaid again to ask the Angel,
What the Olive-branches are? and receives
this further anſwer: <hi>Theſe be the two anointed
ones, that ſtand by the Lord of the whole earth:</hi> here
is another deſcription of them, in which it is
moſt evident, that by the two Olive-trees is
meant the Saints, Servants and Witneſſes of
Jeſus Chriſt; for this is a plain character of
Saints; for firſt, Saints are anointed ones,
and are ſaid to be anointed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. and
are ſaid to have received an <hi>unction from the holy
One, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 20. Again ſecondly, as Saints
are anointed ones, ſo it is they only that can
come into the preſence of God; it is they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that can enter into the Holy of Holies, by
the new and living way, which Jeſus Chriſt
hath made for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:98732:53"/>
Now by this time it is clear, That by the
two Olive-trees, is meant all Saints: for
they are anointed ones, and they ſtand in the
preſence of God; they then are the two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-trees,
which have propheſied, cloathed
in ſackcloth, and though they have been but
as a handfull, compared with that great

               <p>The Saints in a ſence, are the Judges and

ſpeaking of the raign of the Lord Jeſus, and
his Saints ruling with him, ſo that as he
judgeth, ſo doe they; and they paſſe ſentence
with him upon their enemies, and therefore
is it here ſaid, <hi>If any man will hurt them, fire
proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their
enemies:</hi> That is, that breath of the ſpirit
that proceedeth out of their mouth, in their
praiers doth both pronounce the ſentence
and bring down the fire of wrath upon their
enemies. And this is clear, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. 3. for
there it appears, That when the praiers of
all Saints were offered upon the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
that then <hi>the Angel took the Cenſor, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the
earth, and there were voices, and thunderings, and

is the power that Saints have to devour
their enemies, and though their enemies be
never ſo high and potent, yet they are not
ſo high, nor ſo potent, but they can reach
them, either to kill or deſtroy them, or to
binde and impriſon them. And this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>As the fire mentioned in the former verſe,
was not material fire, but it was myſtically
ſpoken: ſo the rain here mentioned, is to
be myſtically underſtood, as it is in ſeverall
places of Scripture. I will cite but only two
places, for they will be ſufficient: and in
both of them, what is to be underſtood by
water or rain, is declared. As <hi>Iſa. 44. 3.
I will pour water upon him that is thirſtly, and flouds
upon the dry ground.</hi> Now would we know,
what is here meant by water and flouds? it
follows in the next words, <hi>I will pour my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98732:55"/>
So that here the Spirit, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of heaven are expreſſed by water, and
by flouds. The other place, is <hi>Joh. 3. 38, 39.
He that beleeveth on me, as the Scripture hath ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
out of his belly ſhal flow rivers of living water.</hi> The
next verſe explains this, <hi>This he ſpake of the
Spirit, which they that beleeve on him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
So that we ſee what the Scripture
means by water, when it ſpeaks myſtically
of it: ſo that it is in this ſence, that the Saints
are ſaid here during the prevalency of the
Beaſt, to ſhut heaven that it rain not: for
it cannot be underſtood of materiall rain,
for that hath been extended to the unjuſt, as
to the juſt: and if materiall rain ſhould be
with-held, the Saints and Witneſſes might
have as well ſuffered by the with-holding
of it, as others: no, it is not the with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of materiall rain, but a greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then that: for as the Saints had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to bring a fire of wrath upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
ſo to ſhut up the rain of ſpirituall
bleſſings, that the flouds of the ſpirit do not
deſcend upon them. But whereas the Saints
are like the tree, that is planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of water, that is alwaies green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing;
their enemies are for want of theſe
waters, as a dry tree that brings forth no
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98732:55"/>
fruit, and muſt be hewen down and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fire.</p>
               <q>That it rain not in the daies of their propheſie]</q>
               <p>We ſee what the daies of their propheſie
is, at the third verſe, where they are ſaid
to propheſie, cloathed in ſackcloth, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
two hundred and threeſcore daies:
which hath been ſhewed to be ſo many
years, which is the tearm of time which the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Beaſt is to prevail, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
City, the Saints are to be troden under
foot; theſe we ſee are ſaid to be the daies
of their propheſying, cloathed in ſackcloth;
not but that they might propheſie after that
time is expired: but thoſe were the daies of
their propheſying in ſackcloth, becauſe they
are troden under foot, and they are given
to the Beaſt, the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and during
theſe daies of their propheſying in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
they have power to ſhut heaven, that
it rain not ſpirituall bleſſings upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And hath it not been even thus?
Hath not the Beaſt, and all his adherents
been as dry trees, and have they not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to be ſo, without ever obtaining a drop
of ſpirituall grace? Have they not been as
the dry ground, obdurate and hardened in
their helliſh waies? inſomuch as it is to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98732:56"/>
admired, that they ſhould ſo continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any relenting or returning for ſo many
hundred years, although they have had the
Scriptures, and many of them great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts and abilities, and the writings
of many precious Saints; which are means
by which God uſes to worke; but none of
theſe means could work any thing, becauſe
they had the Heaven ſo ſhut, that none of
the waters of the Spirit did deſcend upon
them. Therefore it was that the letter of
the Word, and all other advantages could
doe nothing, for they are all nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit.</p>
               <q>And have power over waters, to turn them to
bloud]</q>
               <p>This is another plague diſtinct from the
former (but it is alſo myſtically expreſſed)
therfore theſe waters, are not thoſe that are
ſaid to be ſhut up from them: for it is not
poſſible for them to be turned into bloud:
that is, to be made uſeleſſe, as waters are,
when they are turned into bloud: but they
are thoſe waters which their enemies the
<hi>Babylonians</hi> made uſe of, in ſtead of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Spirit: And what were they? It
were their Canons, and Decrees, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
which they gave forth, as equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98732:56"/>
unto the very dictates of the Spirit it
ſelf: and they declared them to be of as
great authority, and of theſe waters they
made all that did adhere to them to drinke:
and with theſe waters they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
never caring for the waters of the
Spirit. Now the Saints had power over
theſe waters, to turn them to bloud; which
they did by the Spirit of propheſie which
they had; whereby they did ſo hold forth
the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, in the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, as all the Romiſh Doctrines, and
Popiſh Canons were turned to bloud, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
uſeleſſe unto others, and diſcovered
to be corrupt. And this is that which was
done by thoſe Angels or Saints, that pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out the ſecond and third viols. <hi>Revel.</hi>
16. 3, 4.</p>
               <q>And to ſmite the earth with all plagues, as often
as they will.]</q>
               <p>How Saints may be ſaid to ſmite the
earth, or earthly men with all plagues, doth
in part appear page 72. where it appears,
That they doe it by their praiers: for when
the praiers of the Saints aſcended up before
God, then it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. 5. That fire
was caſt upon the earth, or earthly men, and
produced dreadfull effects; as voices and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98732:57"/>
thundering, and lightnings, and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.
Thus Saints doe ſmite the Earth
with all plagues by their praiers. But they
doe not only ſmite the Earth by their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but alſo by their propheſying, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt: for
by the earth here ſpoken of, is peculiarly
expreſſed thoſe earthly men, that in a more
eſpecial manner trod the Saints under foot.
Now they (as before appears) were the
Beaſt, the Pope, and his Complices, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
Romans,</hi> and all that were of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Now theſe the Saints do ſmite with
all plagues, by their holding forth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of Jeſus Chriſt againſt them (as
well as by praying againſt them:) for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is their Doctrine diſcovered, to be a pack
of abominable lies; and this proves a plague
unto them, and this pains them at the very
heart: for by this plague, they are like to
die, it is like to prove a mortall diſeaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and therefore is very grievous, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.
12. 11. The Saints are ſaid to overcome the
Dragon by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word
of their Teſtimony; for they loved not their lives
unto the death:</hi> Whereby it is evident, That
by holding forth the Teſtimony of Jeſus
Chriſt, and ſealing it with their bloud, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98732:57"/>
Saints doe ſmite the devil in the Beaſt, ſo as
to overcome him. And thus by their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and by the word of their Teſtimony,
Saints doe ſmite the earth, that is, their
Babylonical enemies with all plagues as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as they will.</p>

is to continue, as appears by comparing
the third verſe of this Chapter, with the fifth

great authority, in the raign of <hi>Phocus</hi> the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98732:58"/>
Emperour: which was, as ſay Hiſtorians, in

it makes up, 1664. And this year,
1664 ſhould be the year wherein the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſhould finiſh their giving Teſtimony,

be computed according to the rule of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
allowing 365 daies to a year, and
to every fourth year adding a day more. But
we finde that the holy Ghoſt in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
not obſerving that rule, doth allow but
360 daies to a year, and according to that
rule, 1260 daies to three yeares and an

               <p>And therefore in computing the time of

are to obſerve the rule which the holy

to a year, and ſo the time of the Witneſſes

               <p>That the Pope is the Beaſt that aſcended

               <p>This warre which is here mentioned, that
the Beaſt was to make againſt the Witneſſes,
the Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, is the late warre
that hath been by him made in <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> as will perſpicuouſly appear, by
comparing it with that deſcription of it,
which is given in this and the following
verſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt that this warre was made by the
Beaſt that aſcended out of the bottomleſſe
pit, that is, by the Pope, is moſt evident:
For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is done by any of the ten
Kingdomes, that are of his hornes is his
act. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatever is done by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation,
is done by him: Now in both
theſe reſpects, the warre late in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98732:59"/>
and in <hi>Ireland</hi> is the Beaſts warre. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, All that have acknowledged any
Kingdoms to be the horns of the Beaſt, have
acknowledged <hi>England</hi> to be one of them.
Therefore this warre being made by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of one of the ten horns of the Beaſt,
was made by the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected: But <hi>England</hi> was
fallen from <hi>Rome</hi> before the warre, which
was begun in 1641. for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
long ſince caſt off the Popes Supremacy, and
it was never ſince acknowledged by the
Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and together with the
Popes Supremacy, was the Popiſh Canons
and Decrees rejected, and for matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the Doctrine embraced in <hi>England,</hi>
was purely refined from the dregs of mens
inventions, And how could <hi>England</hi> then
be ſaid, (theſe things being done) to be
one of the horns of the Beaſt, and a part of
the Babylonicall City of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although <hi>England</hi> had done theſe
things, yet <hi>England</hi> was ſtill one of the horns
and a part of that City. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we conſider, what it was that made
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to become the Beaſt,
and what made the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to become
the myſticall <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now the Biſhop of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98732:59"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> did then become the Beaſt, when he
did receive from the devil (for Jeſus Chriſt
never gave it him) a power to exerciſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
over the conſciences of all that did
profeſſe Chriſtianity: and by this power he
did oppreſſe, and trouble, and afflict the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Saints of Jeſus Chriſt; by this means
alſo did <hi>Rome</hi> become the myſticall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;
for heerby did it enſlave, and vaſſalize
the Saints, as Babylon of old did the
Church that then was: and then conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the ten Kingdomes, that did exerciſe
this authority over the conſcience, did
thereby become a part of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the
horns of the beaſt; by which he did puſh,
and gore, and deſtroy the Saints of Jeſus
Chriſt. And hereby was the holy City
troden under foot.</p>
               <p>Now then, though Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> caſt
of the Popes ſupremacy, and a great part of
his deviliſh doctrine; yet <hi>England</hi> did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
remain one of the horns of
the Beaſt, and a part of Romiſh Babylon:
becauſe there was a party retained, which
did exerciſe authority over the conſciences
of Saints; which hath proved a great bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to them, and hath perſecuted the
Saints, as the Beaſt was wont to do: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98732:60"/>
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, there were
ſome Saints perſecuted, that did ſcruple in
ſome things to conforme to the Biſhops;
though the Biſhops then, were not ſo bad
as they have been ſince: but ſince the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
grew worſe, and worſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more prophane, and filthy, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as all that uſurp authority over the
conſciences do, and as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
did) I ſay ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, that
they grew worſe and worſe, they have
growne higher, and higher in the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints; ſo that a reall godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
could ſcarce be ſuffered to abide in the
Kingdome: but many were fain to flie to
<hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> and other places;
and thoſe that did abide in the Kingdome,
were exceedingly perſecuted. And thus
<hi>England</hi> did remain a horn of the Beaſt, and
a part of Babylon; becauſe there was a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
retained, that did exerciſe authority over
the conſcience.</p>
               <p>And heerby it is evident, That the late
war in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> was made by the
Beaſt. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, That war was made by one of his
horns, <hi>England</hi> being then a horn of the
Beaſt. And</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98732:60"/>
Secondly, This war was made by the
Beaſt: becauſe it was by his inſtigation; for
it was evident that this war was, <hi>Bellum Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copale,</hi>
the Biſhops war; and that they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Queen, acted for the Beaſt,
and were thereunto inſtigated by him: and
to that end the Popes <hi>Nuncioes,</hi> and Jeſuites
were ſo long reſident in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
were violent in the proſecution of it. So
that this is clear, that the late war in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> was made by the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, as the war in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> was made by the Beaſt; ſo it was
made by him againſt the Witneſſes, the
Saints, and precious ones of Jeſus Chriſt:
for that which is done againſt the moſt
conſiderable number of Saints, is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the whole; as being the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over all. Now in <hi>England</hi> there are a
more conſiderable number of the faithfull
ſervants, and Witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt; then
is in any Kingdome in the World. As one
truly ſaid, <hi>England is the richeſt Ship in the
World; for God hath more of thoſe precious jewels
in it, than he hath in any other Kingdome in the
World.</hi> It is true that in other Kingdomes,

there are a vaſt number of ſuch as are called

<hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

theſe, it was made againſt all the Witneſſes,
againſt all Saints. Now that it was made
againſt the Saints in <hi>England.</hi> is alſo evident
for it was the rooting out of ſuch as were
called Puritans, and Independents, and
Browniſts, that was chiefly aimed at in that
war; and therefore it was given out, that
they would leave no more Puritans in
<hi>England,</hi> then there were proteſtants in <hi>Rome.</hi>
And this was made evident in all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
for the Puritans were they, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom they expreſſed their greateſt
malice. And ſuch as they called Puritents,
were the moſt precious Saints of Jeſus
Chriſt. Thus it is evident, that this warre
was made by the beaſt againſt the Saints, the
Witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Iu this war that was made by the Beaſt
againſt the Saints, and Witneſſes of Jeſus

them; for at the very firſt breaking out in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> there was ſuch terrible blow given
unto the Saints, and they were ſo overcome,
as the Beaſt, and his adherents thought
themſelves ſure of overcoming all the
reſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> ſo that all the
reſt did then ſeem to be as dead men; and as
at the beginning they overcame, ſo they
continued overcoming, &amp; keeping the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

field, and exceedingly overcame them that
oppoſed them, and alſo took Cities, and
Towns, and Caſtles, and got poſſeſſion of
County after Country; ſo that the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

brought to ſuch a low ebbe, as for three

is given to it, <hi>The groat City.</hi> But leaſt this

are ſome other diſtinguiſhing characters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>Firſt, That it is Spiritually called <hi>Sodom;</hi>
for the abominable filthineſſes, and Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall
practiſes, that are in it; for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
of that City are ſo many, and
ſo apparent; as there is no City in the
world, that may ſo fitly be called by the
name of Spirituall <hi>Sodom,</hi> as it.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, It is ſpiritually called
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98732:62"/>
                  <hi>Egypt:</hi> and this name alſo is moſt fitly given
to that City; for as <hi>Egypt</hi> of old, was a houſe
of bondage to the people of God; ſo hath
<hi>Rome</hi> been a houſe of bondage, to the Saints,
for above twelve hundred years.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is diſtinguiſhed by this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<hi>Where alſo our Lord was crucified:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was by the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> that our
Lord was crucified; ſo that though it was
not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>

was accounted as a part of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe are
the characters that are given to <hi>Rome;</hi>
whereby it is made evident, that this great
City is <hi>Rome.</hi> Now that the Witneſſes being
overcome, that their dead bodies did lie in
the ſtreet of this great City is apparent; for
<hi>England</hi> being one of the ten horns of the
Beaſt, is a part of that great City. And ſo
the dead bodies of the Witneſſes being in

and tongues, though they be not of the
Witneſſes, and Saints; yet they are not for
the Beaſt, but doe help the Saints againſt
the Beaſt; for they are ſaid to keep the dead
bodies of the Saints, from being put in
graves: when the Beaſt had overcome the
<hi>Saints</hi> ſo as they ſeemed to be quite loſt, they
ſeemed to be dead: then they would not
ſuffer them to be interred; though they

them from being totally removed out of

wherein they ſhould not be in ſuch a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

Sutable to this, is that paſſage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 16.
where it is ſaid, when the Dragon poured
out waters as a floud after the Woman, that
he might cauſe her to be carried away of the
floud; that then the earth helped the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and opened her mouth, and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the floud.</p>
               <p>Here it is evident, that the Church being
followed by the Beaſt, with a floud of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
that the people of the earth doe
keep off the fury of the Beaſt, from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church utterly; ſo that the people
of the earth are made inſtruments of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Saints, againſt the perſecution of the
Beaſt. And ſo it was in the late warre in
<hi>England,</hi> the Lord made ſome ſuch as were
but carnall, and prophane, to be inſtruments
of helping the Saints, from being totally
overcome of the Beaſt; for thoſe of the
Saints that were in the Parliaments Army,
that fought againſt the Beaſt, were but a
ſmall number compared with the others in
that Army, that were not Saints. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98732:64"/>
it is very wonderfull to conſider, how
by an over-ruling providence, the hearts of
carnall men were commanded to ſtand up in
the defence of the Witneſſes, againſt the
Beaſt: for there were many thouſands, that
did engage themſelves with the Parliament,
in their defenſive warre, that were not the
Witneſſes. Thus God made them of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and kindreds, and tongues, and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to be inſtruments of keeping the bodies
of the Witneſſes, from being put in graves,
from being put totally under the earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Chap. 16. 1. where the ſeven Angels, are bid
to pour out their viols upon the earth,
which was upon the Beaſt and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as appears throughout the Chapter,
and ſo again in the 6, verſe of this 11. Chap.
it is ſaid, <hi>The Witneſſes had power to ſmite the

is peculiarly ſpoken of the members of the

more eſpeciall plague; and ſo it is they, (I

dwell upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>They that dwell upon the earth, ſhall rejoyce over

               <p>The Witneſſes being overcome, and lying

               <p>And thus they did here in <hi>England,</hi> for

that were members of the Beaſt, and how
they doe ſo, hath been ſhewed in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

endure thoſe torments, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

they hold forth the truth of Chriſt, ſo as to
overthrow their deviliſh doctrines, and turn

               <p>As the late war made by the Beaſt againſt
the Witneſſes, doth fully agree with all the
circumſtances of it, laid down in the former
verſes; ſo it agrees exactly with what is
laid down in this verſe alſo: for after the
Witneſſes had been in ſo low a condition,
as they were (as <hi>Paul</hi> was when he was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
ſuppoſed to be dead, for three years
and a half: they did not lie as dead a day
longer, but at the very day, when the three
years and a half were expired; then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98732:66"/>
of life from God entred into them, and
they began to ſtand upon their feet.</p>
               <p>For on the 23. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. did
the Beaſt begin the war in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and he
continued overcomming the Witneſſes, the
Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
untill the 5. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. and
from the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. unto the 5. of
<hi>April,</hi> 1645. there is juſt a thouſand two
hundred, and ſixty daies; which according
to the Scripture account, (though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Heathen account) is three
years and a half compleat: and when this
three years, and a half were expired; which
was, I ſay, one the 5. of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. then was
the reſurrection of the Witneſſes: for they
having lain dead for three years and a half
before; then the Spirit of life from God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into them. And the year 1645. as it is
the year wherein the Witneſſes were raiſed
from the dead; ſo it is the year, wherein
the term of time in which they were to
propheſie in ſack-cloth, and to be troden
under foot was to expire, and the year alſo
wherein the prevailing power of the Beaſt
over the Saints was to expire, as is made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in the opening of the 2, verſ. pag. 60.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that one the 5. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98732:66"/>
the Saints, Witneſſes, and Servants of Jeſus
Chriſt, were raiſed up, and that then a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life from God entred into them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
thus:</p>
               <p>On the 5. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Army, who had ſtood for the defence
of the Saints againſt the Beaſt; and had bin
before that time exceedingly overcome, and
were brought into a very low condition at
that time, being new modelled, and having
a great many precious Saints in it, both
eminent Commanders, inferiour Officers,
and common Soldiers; and being then put
under the conduct of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax;</hi>
they then began to march againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and then had a Spirit of life from God,
that entred into them, as did appear in all
their actings afterward; for they went on
with ſuch vigour, courage, life, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
as they effected every work they took
in hand; defeated all the enemies with
whom they did encounter; had the victory
in every battle they fought; never ſate
down before any City, Town, or Caſtle, but
they took it in, before they raiſed their
ſiege: Thus they acted like men raiſed from
that dead, low, condition they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
And why? Becauſe now a Spirit of life
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98732:67"/>
from God was entred into them: and unto
God did they give all the praiſe, and ſo let
them doe ſtill: for they had as ſurely fled
before their enemies, and been beat down as
the myre in the ſtreets then, as ever they had
been before, if the Spirit of life from God
had not been put upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus the 5. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. did the
Witneſſes, the Saints, (of whom the Beaſt
thought to make an utter end,) ſtand upon
their feet having a ſpirit of life from God
put upon them; when the Army that fought
their battles, and defended their righteous
cauſe, began to march againſt the Army of
the Beaſt, to the overthrowing of it.</p>
               <q>And they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear
fell upon them that ſaw them]</q>
               <p>The Saints being raiſed from the dead,
from that dejected, low condition in which
they were, for three years and a half; a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life from God being put upon them:
they then ſtood upon their feet, to the fear,
and amazement of their enemies. Before
indeed the Saints did lie dead in the ſtreet,
and were as the ſtreet to them that went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them: but ſince the Spirit of life from
God entred into them, they have ſtood upon
their feet; and as men that ſtand upon their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98732:67"/>
feet, ſo long as they doe ſtand upon their
feet, are not in a capacity of being trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot of men: So the Witneſſes, and
Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince they ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their feet, could not be troden under
foot of men. Though they have been tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under feet a thouſand two hundred, and
threeſcore years, and the Beaſt hath had
power ſo long to trample them under feet;
yet ſince the Spirit of life from God entred
into them, and they ſtood upon their feet,
it was not poſſible for the Beaſt, nor any of
his adherents, ſo to trample them under
foot any more.</p>
               <q>And they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear
fell upon them which ſaw them]</q>
               <p>The Witneſſes ſtanding upon their feet, as
men riſen from the dead, did caſt a great
fear, and terrour upon their enemies: for
now they begin to fear what will become of
themſelves, and their great Idoll, <hi>The Beaſt;</hi>
they ſeeing the Witneſſes of Jeſus to ſtand
upon their feet, fearfulneſſe doth ſurprize
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe now they conceive that their
Kingdome is going down; as indeed it is
going down wonderfully, as they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and make merry, when they ſaw the
Saints, or Puritans, as they termed them,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98732:68"/>
brought into a low condition, when they
lay dead; ſo now on the contrary, they

a great fear is fallen upon them.</p>

acted in oppoſing the Beaſt, and had a moſt

them though in a cloud, in an obſcure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>And thus it was with thoſe Saints that
were in the Army on the Parliament ſide,
as before they ſtood upon their feet, and
prevailed againſt their enemies, they had
the praiers of all other Saints: ſo afterward,
were they with great affection, received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſocieties of Saints, and embraced by
them, and this did appear to their enemies;
though not very clearly.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>The Kingdome of the Beaſt being called
the earth, it is that earth of whom this
earth-quake is ſpoken. Now this earth-quake,
is ſaid to be the ſame hour when the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98732:69"/>
Witneſſes being riſen from the dead, did
aſcend into the ſocieties of the Saints; and
were by them received, and embraced: in
that ſame hour, there was a great earth-quake.
The ſtate of the Beaſt hath been ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before. The Witneſſes have made a
former earth-quake in the Kingdom of the
Beaſt, which was mentioned, Chap. 7. 5. but
that is not ſaid to be <hi>a great</hi> earth-quake; but
this is ſaid to be <hi>a great</hi> earth-quake. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this was a greater earth-quake; a
greater ſhaking to the Kingdome of the
Beaſt, then any that hath been before it, as
doth appear by the effects of it, mentioned
in this verſe. Though it is true, this is not
the greateſt earth-quake that ſhall come on
the Kingdome of the Beaſt; for there ſhall
be a farre greater earth-quake that ſhall
come upon it: as appears, Chap. 16. 18. yet
this was a very great earth-quake; a very
great ſhaking to the Kingdome of the Beaſt:
For in this earth-quake,</p>
               <q>The tenth part of the City fell]</q>
               <p>This word, <hi>The City,</hi> hath reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a City, formerly mentioned in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
and that is verſ. 8. and it is there ſo
plainly deſcribed, as it doth evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be the myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98732:70"/>
And the tenth part]</q>
               <p>The ten Kingdomes that were the ten
horns of the Beaſt, were ten ſeverall parts
of myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> which did raign over
them. So that <hi>England</hi> being one of them,
was a tenth part of myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And a tenth part of the City fell]</q>
               <p>This was one of the effects of the earth-quake,
which was occaſioned by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Witneſſes, the Saints in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
it did ſo ſhake the great <hi>Babylon</hi> of the
Beaſt, as a tenth part of it fell. And this
moſt exactly came to paſſe, in the year of the
Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, 1645. for
then did the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> (which
was a tenth part of great <hi>Babylon)</hi> fall from
<hi>Rome;</hi> for then was that removed from it,
whereby it had continued to be a part of
<hi>Babylon</hi> (the place of Saints ſlavery) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the power of men over the conſciences
of Saints: For after the Army, which was
for the Witneſſes, ſtood upon their feet, in
1645. they ſo caſt of that power that men
had had over their conſciences, and over
their perſons and eſtates for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake; as it was not poſſible for the
Beaſt, nor any of his Adherents to recover
that power again, over the conſciences of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98732:70"/>
the Saints in this Kingdome (though they
did with all their ſtrength, and greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
endeavour it afterwards) for the
Witneſſes then ſtanding upon their feet;
there was ſuch an earth-quake, great <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
was ſo ſhaken, as <hi>England</hi> fell from it;
the yoke of bondage which was upon the
conſciences of Saints in <hi>England,</hi> was then
caſt off: And this was one effect of the great
earth-quake, which there was in myſticall
<hi>Babylon,</hi> at the reſurrection of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
that <hi>England</hi> fell from it.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>England</hi> is fallen from the great
Whore, myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi> and is become a
preſident to the other Kingdoms; who muſt
all in time, caſt off the yoke of bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they are; and hate the Whore,
and make her deſolate, and naked, <hi>&amp;c.
Revel.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
               <q>And in the earth-quake were ſlain of men ſeven
thouſand.]</q>
               <p>This was another effect of the earth-quake,
that as a tenth part of the City fell,
ſo there were ſlain of men ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>What is meant by the fall of the tenth
part of the City, is already apparent, and it
is not the material falling of a tenth part, of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98732:71"/>
any material City, but the myſtical fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the tenth part of a myſticall
City. And ſutable to this, is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this ſlaying of ſeven thouſand men,
not by the material falling of any part of
a material City. But the earth-quake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a myſticall ſhaking of myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi>
this is a myſtical ſlaying of ſeven thouſand
men; whereby they die myſtically, that is,
ceaſe to live any longer to myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi>
being by beholding the great victory, which
the Saints had over the Beaſt converted, and
fallen off from the Beaſt, which ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men were before, either ſecretly,
or openly lovers and worſhippers of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, How doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that ſeven thouſand men, or perſons
were ſo converted, by the reſurrection of the
Witneſſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it doe not viſibly appear
to the outward eyes of any; yet it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to perſwade me, and ſhould be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all Saints to believe it: in that this
Scripture, this oracle of Heaven, ſaith
it. When there was no true worſhippers of
God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were viſible to <hi>Elijah</hi> the
Prophet, and that then the Lord telling
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98732:71"/>
him, that he had left ſeven thouſand in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
who had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi>
nor had kiſſed him with the mouth; it was
ſufficient to perſwade <hi>Elijah</hi> to believe it:
although not one of thoſe ſeven thouſand
did viſibly appear to him. Therefore much
more ought Saints now, not to queſtion the
truth of this; that ſeven thouſand are in this
myſticall earth-quake, myſtically ſlaine,
though it be not altogether ſo viſible to us
(as other things are) becauſe this Scripture
ſaies it. And beſides, what the Scripture
ſaies in it, there is a probability of it, for it
is very probable, that many are convinced,
that the Witneſſes, the Saints, are Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and thoſe that ſight againſt them, are
enemies of God, and doe fight againſt God.
I ſay it is probable, that many are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of this, becauſe God hath ſo owned his
people, and given them ſuch victory over
thoſe vile wretches that did oppoſe them,
and formerly reproach them, and ſay, Where
is your God? And now God appearing to
be for them, when the enemy were come to
ſuch a height of impiety and inſolency: there
is no queſtion, but that many were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by it, and fell from the Beaſt, and that
the number of theſe ſo fallen from the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98732:72"/>
Beaſt is, no leſſe then ſeven thouſand.
And this was the effect of the great earth-quake.</p>
               <q>And in the earth-quake were ſlain of men ſeven
thouſand, and the remnant were affrighted,
and gave glory to the God of heaven.]</q>
               <p>This remnant here ſpoken of, are diſtinct
from the Witneſſes, whether they be ſuch
as were for the Beaſt, or others; they are not
of the Witneſſes, but were ſome that were
affrighted at the Witneſſes, having a ſpirit of
life from God put upon them; and their
ſtanding upon their feet: and therefore not
of them, but ſome others, and they were not
of the ſeven thouſand neither, becauſe they
are ſaid to be the remnant, or the reſidue. So
then, the meaning of this clauſe, is this; that
the raiſing up of the Witneſſes in ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
manner, to the ſhaking of great <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
did ſo work upon the reſidue of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as were not of the Witneſſes, nor of the
ſeven thouſand, as that either they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
at it, or had their mouths opened
to glorifie God in it, or both.</p>
               <p>And thus it was in the year 1645. the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of people, both in the Kingdome,
and in others, that either ſaw or heard of
the great things God did for the Saints, were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98732:72"/>
either affrighted, and amazed at it, or elſe
did glorifie God in working ſo wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he did: for when God did worke ſo
wonderfully, and beyond expectation, in
giving victory upon victory, and ſucceſſe
upon ſucceſſe unto his people; ſo as they
ſeemed to be, as them that dreamed: I ſay,
when God did thus, then the generality of
people did admire, and acknowledge God
in it, and give him the glory of it, <hi>They glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
the God of heaven,</hi> that had done ſuch
great things, in ſuch an unexpected manner,
and in ſo ſhort a time. And thus <hi>the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.</hi>

this woe is which is to come,

               <head>Deduction 1.</head>
               <p>That Deduction that firſt in order ariſes
from the firſt verſe, is a word of Comfort
for all afflicted Saints; and the word of
Comfort for ſuch is this, That all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
whatever they be, are meaſured
out unto them by their God, who hath a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98732:74"/>
tender love unto them, and care over them
in their affliction. The Saints of God who
are his Temple, and the holy and beloved
City, we ſee here are meaſured out unto an
afflicted, ſad condition: and their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
come not at randome, nor according
to the will of their enemies: no, but they
are meaſured unto affliction, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could have no power over them, but
that they were by their God given unto the
Gentiles, to be troden under foot, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it could not have been poſſible, for the
Gentiles to have troden them under foot.
Now ſince it is Gods act towards his people,
it muſt needs be for their good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the afflictions, and the
ſufferings that Saints undergoe, ſpeaks of it
as their priviledge, <hi>Phil. 1. 29. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is
given, in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe
on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> And the
holy Ghoſt in the Propheſie of <hi>Micah,</hi> ſpeaks
of the rod of affliction, as of the food of the
people of God, <hi>Micah 7. 14. Feed thy people
with thy rod; the flock of thine heritage, which
dwell ſolitarily in the wood.</hi> And as in <hi>Micah,</hi>
God is ſaid to feed his people with his rod;
ſo he is ſaid to comfort them with his rod:
for ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 23. 4. <hi>Thy rod and thy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98732:74"/>
ſtaffe they comfort me.</hi> And therefore let Saints
in an afflicted condition, be comforted in
this conſideration, That their affliction,
what ever it be, is that which comes not by
chance, as men uſe to ſay; nor according
to the wils of men; but their God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenced
it out unto them, who doth it in
great wiſdome, and great love, and gives
them out affliction, as their priviledge, as
their food, and for their comfort. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let poor ſouls in affliction be no more
caſt down, and walk no more heavily, nor
goe mourning all the day long no more,
becauſe of their afflictions, but walk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
under afflictions, becauſe they come
from a loving God, who hath appointed
them thereunto, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3.</p>

               <head>Deduction 2.</head>
               <p>In the ſecond place, it ſerves to enforme
us, That it is of God, that enemies do riſe
up againſt the Saints; for we ſee here, that
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the myſtical <hi>Babylonians,</hi> were
by God appointed to afflict the people of
God; to tread the holy City under foot,
before ever they had a being. Now as God
doth in love ſuffer his people to be afflicted:
So in wrath he uſually gives up wicked men
to be the inſtruments of afflicting his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98732:75"/>
For as the ſufferings of Saints worke
out for them a greater weight of glory,
<hi>(2 Cor. 4. 17.)</hi> So the wrongs and violence;
that wicked men doe offer unto the Saints,
doth procure for them a greater weight of
vengeance. And therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.
1.</hi> 28. bids the Saints, <hi>To be in nothing terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their adverſaries; which is to them</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>an evident token of perdition, but to you of
ſalvation, and that of God.</hi> And 2 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 6.
It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a righteous thing with God, to
recompence tribulation unto them which trouble his
Saints.</hi> So that God raiſes up wicked men
to afflict his people, that he may pour out
the fuller viols of wrath upon them. And
therefore, when God told <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> That
he would at that time ſend all his plagues
upon his heart, and upon his ſervants and
people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 14. ſaith he at the 16. verſe.
<hi>And in very deed, for this cauſe have I raiſed thee
up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name
may be declared thorowout all the earth.</hi> So that
no enemy can riſe up againſt the people of
God; but it is of God, and God uſually
doth it, that he may pour out the fuller vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols
of wrath upon them. I ſay uſually, it
is ſo, but it is not alwaies ſo: for ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Saints are ſometimes choſen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98732:75"/>
as <hi>Paul</hi> was: but ordinarily, it is ſo,
and ſo it ſhall be with the Beaſt: for both
<hi>Babylon</hi> of old, and this myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had afflicted, and oppreſſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, ſo much as was before ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were appointed to take off the dregs of
that cup of trembling, which they put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the people of God, <hi>Iſa. 51.
21, 22, 23. Hear now thou afflicted, and drunken,
but not with wine: thus ſaith thy Lord, the Lord
and thy Gad, that pleadeth the cauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is people;
behold I have taken out of thy hand, the cup of
trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury;
thou ſhalt no more drink it again, but I will put it
into the hand of them that afflict thee, which have
ſaid to thy ſoul, Bowe down, that we may goe over,
and thou haſt laid thy body as the ground, and as
the ſtreet to them that went over.</hi> And how this
was done, and ſhall be done, both to the
materiall and the myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> appears
at large in the 47. Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the
51. of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the 18. of the <hi>Revelation:</hi>
beſides in ſeverall other Scriptures. Now
then, we may ceaſe to wonder, why wicked
men doe prevail ſo much, and continue ſo
long in doing violence unto Saints; for
we ſee it is of God; for ordinarily he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it, that vengeance may fall the heavier
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98732:76"/>
upon them at laſt. <hi>Babylon</hi> hath multiplied
her abominations for a long time, and
made her ſelfe drunk with the bloud of
Saints; but at laſt ſhe ſhall be rewarded dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for all the cruelties ſhe hath done to the
Saints.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 3.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, Saints are here inſtructed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how they be too haſty to get out of an
afflicted condition; and eſpecially to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how they uſe any indirect means, that
ſo they may come the ſooner out of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for it is vain and ſinfull for them ſo to
doe: for the time how long they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in an afflicted condition, is fixed by
the Father, and ſo long they ſhall remain
under affliction, though they ſtrive and
ſtruggle never ſo much, to come ſooner out
of it. For we ſee here the holy City, was
to be troden under foot of the Gentiles, to
be in an afflicted condition fourty and two
months, and ſo long they did abide in that
condition; it may be they might expect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
the firſt moneth of years; but if
not then, yet the ſecond moneth, when ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years were expired, they might then hope
deliverance was near. For the materiall
<hi>Babylon,</hi> held the people of God but ſeventy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98732:76"/>
years, but yet deliverance came not in three,
nor four, nor five, nor twenty moneths of
years; but when they had been five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years under perſecution, there came
no deliverance from the tyranny of the
Beaſt, but the Saints were to remain ſeven
hundred years longer, and why? becauſe
the time appointed for deliverance was not
come till then. The decree was paſt, that
the holy City ſhould be trod under foot
fourty and two moneths, and the decree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſt, ſo long it muſt, and ſo long it did
remain to be troden under foot. It is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
therefore for Saints, quietly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the will of their God, in affliction,
and not to be too haſty to get out, before
the appointed time of their God be come;
but if he tarry they muſt wait.</p>

            <div n="4" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 4.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, In the next here is a further
word of Conſolation to Saints in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that is, That when the time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
in which they are to abide under
affliction, is expired, then they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
out of affliction, and nothing ſhall
longer prolong their affliction: for we ſee
that though the holy City muſt be trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, fourty and two moneths: yet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98732:77"/>
when that time is expired, they muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
<hi>The rod of the wicked muſt not alway
reſt upon the lot of the righteous:</hi> No, the Father
hath appointed a time, wherein deliverance
muſt come. The Saints muſt not alwaies
be laid low, and therefore ſaith the Church,
<hi>Micah 7. 8. Rejoyce not againſt me, ô mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
when I fall, I ſhall riſe again.</hi> So, though
the Witneſſes be cloathed in ſack-cloth, a
long time, yet it ſhall not be alwaies ſo,
<hi>They ſhall at laſt have beauty for aſhes, the oil of
joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe, for the
ſpirit of heavineſſe,</hi> Iſa. 61. 3. <hi>And though they
have for a time lien among the pots; yet ſhall they
be, as the wings of a Dove, covered with ſilver,
and her fethers with yellow gold,</hi> Pſal. 68. 13.
And of this we are to be confident under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
affliction, that we ſhall have deliverance,
and nothing ſhall be able to hinder it, when
the appointed time for our deliverance is
come, though not before.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, In the next place, Is it ſo, that
Jeſus Chriſt hath had ſome that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,
during all the twelve hundred and
odde years that the Beaſt hath tyrannized
over the Saints, during all the time, the
Saints have been under the bondage of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98732:77"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> then this may ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thoſe of their errour, who will not
hear (ſuch as they acknowledge to be real)
Saints, to hold forth the word of truth, the
Teſtimony of Jeſus, to the edification, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
and comfort of others: and the
reaſon why they will not hear them, is,
becauſe they conceive, that ſince the riſing
up of the Beaſt, and the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> darkneſſe,
there hath been no true Paſtors, nor Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor Prophets. Now for the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of thoſe of their errour herein; I ſhall
be the more large in this Uſe, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make it clearly to appear to be their
great weaknes.</p>
               <p>And now, you that lie under this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in the ſpirit of love and meekneſſe, I
deſire you to conſider, how evident it is,
that Jeſus Chriſt hath had ſome true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
during all this twelve hundred years,
that the Beaſt hath troden the Saints under
foot: For Jeſus Chriſt ſaith expreſly, <hi>I will
give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall
propheſie a thouſand two hundred and ſixty daies,
cloathed in ſackcloth.</hi> And this hath been
made good, for it appears, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in all times
ſince, Chriſt hath had ſome that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,
that is, have held forth the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98732:78"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>For the Teſtimony of
Jeſus is the ſpirit of propheſie.</hi> And indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
true Saint is a Prophet, becauſe the
Lord revealing his ſecrets to a ſoul, as it
maketh it a Saint, ſo it maketh it a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and ſo the Lord looks upon his Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as his Witneſſes and Prophets. Now this
being evident, That Chriſt hath had true
Prophets; this maketh it clear, that as it
is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 10, 11, 12, 13. That Jeſus
Chriſt, when he aſcended up farre above all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and
ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for the perfecting of Saints, for the worke of
the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,
till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of
the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect
man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe
of Christ.</hi> So this word hath been fulfilled,
Jeſus Chriſt hath alwaies continued theſe.
For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Apoſtles have been continued for
the edifying of the body of Chriſt, as it is
here ſaid: for the Apoſtles being the eie-witneſſes
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all
that he did and ſuffered, and of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as it is evident in that expreſſion of
<hi>Peter,</hi> when another Apoſtle was to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98732:78"/>
in the place of <hi>Judas, Acts 1. 21, 22.
Wherefore of theſe men which have accompanied
with us, all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in,
and out among us. Beginning from the baptiſme of
John, unto that ſame day he was taken from us, muſt
one be ordained to be a Witneſſe with us of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
I ſay, they being eie-witneſſes of
the Lord Jeſus, their witneſſe which they
gave of him is left ſtill upon record, in
which Apoſtles ſtill continue uſefull to the
Church, for perfecting of Saints for the
work of the Miniſtery, and for the edifying
of the body of Chriſt, till we all come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and in this ſenſe Apoſtles have continued:
but Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtours, and
Teachers have actually continued in the
Church; and that doth appear by this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we here ſee it is evident that Prophets
have been continued. Now a man that is a
true Prophet of Jeſus Chriſt may be, and in
ſome degree truly is an Evangeliſt, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
and a Teacher alſo. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be an Evangeliſt, is to be able
to hold forth the Goſpel, in the grace and
ſweetneſſe of it, and he that is ſo is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt.
And</p>
               <p>Secondly, To be a Paſtour, is to be able
to feed the flock of Chriſt, both the ſheep
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98732:79"/>
and tender lambs, with the wholſome, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
truths of Chriſt, to the nouriſhing, and
ſtrengthning of their Souls. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To be a Teacher, is to be able
to unfold the myſteries of the Goſpel, and
clearly to hold forth the truths of Chriſt,
to the inſtruction of the ignorant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of knowledge; and he that is ſo is a
Teacher.</p>
               <p>Now he that is a Prophet, may be all
theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, He may be a man that publiſheth
the glad tydings, of the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, A man that teacheth, and
inſtructeth people, with knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, A man that feeds the flock
of Chriſt, with wholſome ſaving truths. I
ſay a Prophet may be, an Evangeliſt, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
and Teacher, and ſo was <hi>Paul:</hi> that
he was a Prophet, appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. and
that he was a Paſtour, appears, in that he
was ſo frequent in feeding the Church of
God: and that he was a Teacher, appears,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27.
and that he was an Evangeliſt, appears in all
his Epiſtles, by his full, and ſweet holding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98732:79"/>
forth the Grace of the Goſpel in them, and
as <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo: ſo it might be alſo ſaid of
<hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi>
and others.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, If one man
may be both a Prophet, and Evangeliſt, a
Paſtour, and Teacher, Why doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeak of them particularly, as given to
particular perſons; For ſaith he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt
when he aſcended gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome
Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors,
and Teachers.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29. he
ſaith, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are
all Teachers?</hi> Implying that the Spirit had
diſpenced out the gift of propheſying to
one, of teaching to another, of Apoſtleſhip
to a third, and not all theſe gifts to one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be true, That a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
may be alſo an Apoſtle, an Evangeliſt,
a Paſtour, and Teacher, as <hi>Paul</hi> was; yet the
Scripture ſpeaks particularly of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſeverall gifts, and ſometimes
they are ſeverally diſpenſed; ſo that one
man may be more properly ſaid to be an
Evangeliſt, becauſe he may be more able to
hold forth the ſweet word of the Goſpel, and
to be a ſon of conſolation, and to be more
Evangelical then other, and ſo may be more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98732:80"/>
properly ſaid to be an Evangeliſt. And ſo
of the reſt, one man may be more eminent
in one of theſe gifts, then in the reſt; and ſo
may be more properly ſaid to be, either a
Paſtour, or a Teacher, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
he that is an Evangeliſt, may in
ſome ſort be able to act, as a Paſtour, or
a Teacher: ſo he that is a Paſtour, may in
ſome ſort, be able to act as an Evangeliſt, or
a Teacher, though in an eſpeciall manner
he may be fitted to doe the work of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
and ſo of the reſt: So that the reaſon
why they are particularly ſpoken of, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that ſome Saints may be more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
fitted for one of them, then for the
reſt; and not that they, that have one of
theſe gifts, have only one of thoſe gifts, and
is utterly void of the reſt, and this will be
the more confirmed, and cleared by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, with that paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 8, 9,
10. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of
wiſdome, to another tbe word of knowledge, by the
ſame Spirit, to another faith, by the ſame Spirit, to
another the gifts of healing, by the ſame Spirit, to
another the working of miracles, to another prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
to another diſcerning of Spirits, to another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kindes of toungues, to another the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of tongues.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98732:80"/>
ſeverall gifts, and ſaith that one is given to
one, and another to another, and a third to
a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his meaning is, That one
Saint is more eminent for one gift, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for another, and not that he that had
the word of wiſdome, had no knowledge,
nor no faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor that he that had faith,
had not wiſdome, nor knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor
that he that had knowledge, had no faith,
nor wiſdome, nor propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor that
he that had diſcerning of Spirits, had no
knowledge, nor propheſie, nor wiſdome,
nor faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That he that had the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
might not have ſo much faith, nor
wiſdome, nor diſcerning of ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
he that had leſſe knowledge, ſo he that was
full of faith, might have leſſe wiſdome, and
diſcerning of ſpirits, and knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
then thoſe that were more weak in faith.
But now as ſome might be eminent in one
of theſe gifts only; ſo ſome might be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for two, or three: and others might
be eminent for them all. And thoſe that
were eminent for one only, could not be
ſaid to have none of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now by this time the reaſon is evident,
why the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98732:81"/>
Paſtours, and Teachers diſtinctly, and
withall it is evident, that he that is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
is an Evangeliſt, a Paſtour, and a
Teacher. For as it cannot be ſaid of him
that hath faith, that he hath no knowledge,
nor wiſdome, nor diſcerning of ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So it cannot be ſaid of a Prophet, that he is
no Evangeliſt, nor Paſtour, nor Teacher.</p>
               <p>And now, it is evident, That Prophets
have been continued all the while, the Saints
have been in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Prophets, there hath been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Evangeliſts, and Paſtours, and
Teachers, whereby that Scripture hath been
made good, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13. which
ſaies, they muſt all continue, <hi>Till we all come
in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of
the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> And this being ſo evident,
it appears to be from weakneſſe, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that any have queſtioned, whether any
of theſe have been during the time, that
the Saints have been captivated to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here this query may be made; May
there be Prophets, Evangeliſts, Apoſtles, and
Teachers, that were never ordained by the
laying on of hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes they may; for the Scripture
ſpeaks not of laying on of hands upon any,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98732:81"/>
but only of Biſhops, and Deacons; and they
only had the laying on of hands becauſe
they were ordained, to doe ſome particular
things, which were to be done by them, and
was proper to them only, and none in the
Church elſe, were to act in them, but only
they. But Propheſying, and Evangelizing,
and feeding, and teaching, and building up
one another, was common to all in the
Church, as every one had received the gift,
ſo to miniſter, as good ſtewards of the
Grace they had received!<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4. 10.</note> For their
gifts are not given to be laid up
in a napkin, <hi>But the manifeſtation of
the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>is given to every one to profit
withall.</hi> So that, theſe I ſay were not
reſtrained only to be done by Biſhops, and
Deacons, who only were perſons ordained,
by the laying on of hands; but were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to be done by all.</p>
               <p>Now a Biſhop, (which the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
cals, either a Biſhop, or an Elder,
or a Presbyter,) is ordained by the laying
on of hands; becauſe he is appointed to the
work, which is proper to that Office, and
not to any other in the Church.</p>
               <p>Now the works that are proper to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
Elder, or Presbyter. Are,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:98732:82"/>
Firſt, To rule, and guide, and govern the
Church: and this is clear by that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
1 <hi>Tim. 5. 17. Let the Biſhops that rule
well be counted worthy of double honour.</hi> And
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. the Apoſtle ſaies, That a Biſhop
muſt be one that rules well his own houſe;
implying, that he is not fit to rule the
Church of God, if he doe not rule his own
houſe well. And of thoſe it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeaks, <hi>Hebrew. 13. 7. Remember them
which rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the
word of God.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>Obey them which have
the rule over you and ſubmit, for they watch for your
Souls.</hi> And of theſe he alſo ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5.
12. Know them which labour among you, and are
over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, ſecondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the work of a
Biſhop, or Presbyter, to ordain Elders, or
Biſhops in the Churches where they are
wanting, as appears, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. The Apoſtle
there ſpeaking to <hi>Titus,</hi> who was a Biſhop or
Presbyter, ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in
Crete; that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things
that are wanting;</hi> and ordain Elders in every
City. And ſo <hi>Timothy</hi> being a Biſhop, it was
his work, as appears by that rule given him,
1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22. Lay hand ſuddenly on no man.</hi> Again
it likewiſe is made evident, to be the work
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98732:82"/>
of Presbyters, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. 14. and 2 <hi>Tim.
1.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Now theſe things were proper to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Biſhop, and others that are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be Biſhops, have no warrant to
take upon them to act in theſe things.</p>
               <p>But there are other things that Biſhops
are alſo enjoined to doe, that may be and
ought to be done by other brethren, but Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
are enjoined to doe them, in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
manner, and they are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, To feed the flock over which they
are made over-ſeers, and this is that</hi> Paul <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
the Elders of the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>to
doe,</hi> Acts 20. 29. Take heed unto your ſelves, and
unto all the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath
made you over-ſeers, and feed the Church of God,
which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud. <hi>And
this is that which</hi> Timothy, <hi>who was an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or Biſhop, was enjoined to, in theſe
paſſages,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 3. Preach the word, be inſtant
in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort
with all long-ſuffering, and Doctrine. <hi>And verſ.</hi> 5.
Doe the work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of
thy Miniſtery. <hi>And</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. Study to ſhew
thy ſelf approved unto God, a work-man that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to be aſhamed, rightly deviding the word of
truth. <hi>Thus ought Biſhops in a more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98732:83"/>
manner to feed the flock of God, and to
inſtruct and admoniſh them. But this is not
their duties only, but the duty of all the
brethren, according to their ſeverall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the duty of Biſhops, or
Presbyters, to be good examples to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
this alſo <hi>Timothy</hi> was enjoined unto,
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 12. Be thou an example to believers, in
word, in converſation, in love, in ſpirit, in faith,
and purity.</hi> And this <hi>Titus,</hi> who was a Biſhop,
was alſo enjoined unto, <hi>Tit. 2. 7. In all things
ſhew thy ſelf a pattern of good works: in Doctrine
ſhewing uncorruptneſſe, gravity, ſincerity.</hi> And
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. The things which thou haſt heard of
me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to
faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi>
Thus it is the duty of Elders, or Presbyters,
to be a good example to believers: but it is
not their duty only, but the duty of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Saints alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is the duty of Biſhops, to
watch over the ſouls of the flock which are
committed to them; for they muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them to God, and this the Elders,
or Biſhops of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
unto, <hi>Acts 20. 28. Take heed</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>unto your ſelves, and unto the flock over
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98732:83"/>
which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers: for
I know</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>that after my departure, there
ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you:</hi> So that
the Elders of the Church ought to look to
the flock, to keep them from the pernicious
Doctrines of wolviſh men, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Obey them that have the rule
over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch
for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account, that
they may doe it with joy.</hi> So that it is evident,
that it is the duty of the Elders of the
Church, to watch over the ſouls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But this is not their duty only; but the
duty of all believers, to watch over one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>Thus the Scripture declaring that Biſhops
are ordained, by the laying on of hands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what things are to be done by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
as Biſhops, and not by other Saints;
and what things are to be done by them,
which is to be done by others alſo. Now
the Scripture ſpeaks but of one Office more,
to which perſons are ordained by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands, and that is of Deacons.</p>
               <p>Now the Office of a Deacon the Scripture
expreſſes diſtinctly alſo, namely, that they
are to receive the collections for the poor,
and to diſtribute it to the poor, to widows,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98732:84"/>
and to ſuch as are in want, and to all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their neceſſities. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1. 2, 3. and 4. verſes compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
this was the work which Deacons
were ordained to doe, and which is to be
done by them only, and not by others in
the Church. But we finde that <hi>Stephen</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> being Deacons, were ſuch as did feed
the flock, preach the Word, oppoſed gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiers,
were Teachers, and did the work of
Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and wonders among the people, as
appears in the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth
Chapter of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but theſe are the duty
of Deacons; but not their duties only, but
the duties of all the brethren, in which
they are to act according to the meaſure of
grace received.</p>
               <p>And now, ſince the Scripture ſpeaks but
only of Biſhops and Deacons, that were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the laying on of hands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it is the duty of the reſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the Church, to propheſie, as
1 <hi>Cor. 14. 31. Ye may all propheſie one by
one;</hi> and that it is the duty of others in the
Church to doe the work of Evangeliſts,
Paſtors and Teachers. It is hereby clear,
that they may be Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98732:84"/>
Paſtours and Teachers, that
were never ordained by the laying on of
hands. And ſo much for anſwer to that
query.</p>
               <p>And ſince it is made ſo evident, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtours and
Teachers have continued all the while the
Beaſt hath continued, I hope, hereby they
that thorow darkneſſe have been of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
minde, will be hereby convinced of
their errour herein. And now be ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to frequent the Aſſemblies of Saints;
and come to thoſe meeting places, where
ſuch as are precious Saints, doe hold forth
the word of truth; and by the Spirit of
Propheſie doe ſprak unto men, to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
exhortation and comfort. O come
you, and partake of thoſe gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby ſome are inabled to hold forth
the glad tidings of the Goſpel, to publiſh
peace, and grace, and mercy thorow Jeſus
Chriſt, and to doe the worke of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,
and partake you of thoſe gifts,
whereby others are inabled to unfold the
myſteries of the Goſpel, and to teach, and
inſtruct the ſimple, and to doe the work of
a Teacher. In a word, Come and partake
of Apoſtolicall, Propheticall and Paſtorall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98732:85"/>
gifts, of all the particular operations and
manifeſtations of the Spirit of Chriſt in his
Saints: which are given to profit withall.
Conſider that Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will give
unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi> It
is the gift of Jeſus Chriſt unto his people,
which he gives not only for the good of the
perſons in whom it is, but for the good of
others alſo. Saints have an intereſt in one
anothers gifts; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking
of ſuch as were Prophets, as himſelf and
<hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſaith he to the Saints
<hi>(1 Cor. 3. 21, 22.)</hi> all are yours, <hi>whether
Paul or Apollo, or Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the gifts
that are given to others, are given to
them for me, and the gifts that are given
to me, how weak ſoever, are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for my ſelf, but for others alſo: for
Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo diſpoſed of it, to give
ſeveral gifts to ſeveral Saints, to this end to
maintain Communion among Saints. O
therefore you that are Saints, have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
one with another, that you may
receive benefit from one another, as Chriſt
hath appointed: For he gave <hi>ſome Apoſtles,
and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and
ſome Paſtours and Teachers;</hi> What to do? <hi>For
the perfecting of Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98732:85"/>
for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Now
doe you deſire to be edified? Doe you deſire
to preſſe forward toward perfection, that
you may not be as children, carried about
with every winde of doctrine? Then fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Aſſemblies of the Saints, that you
may partake of their gifts. Jeſus Chriſt
hath given them to effect theſe things in
you, and all his people: and for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſpirit of love among Saints, that they
receiving benefit one from another, may not
ſay one to another, I have no need of you,
as thoſe ſeem to doe, that forſake the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of Saints: but that all being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and knit together, may encreaſe with the
encreaſe of God. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice
to be ſpoken to this.</p>

               <head>Deduction 6.</head>
               <p>Sixthly, The next inſtruction that I ſhall
come to (though it be not the next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet I ſhall place it here, becauſe of the
affinity it hath with this) is this. That
ſince the Witneſſes, the Saints of Jeſus
Chriſt, have had a ſpirit of praier, all the
while the Beaſt hath continued; whereby
their enemies have been devoured, as by a
ſpirituall fire: then hereby they may be
convinced of their errour, that ſay they are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98732:86"/>
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore doe not joyn with
any, in pouring out their fouls to God in
praier, nor yet doe it themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now let ſuch conſider, that in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
mid-night of Popery, Saints have had a
ſpirit of praier; and indeed it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be a Saint, and not to have a ſpirit of
praier. It is the very nature and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſpirit of a Saint, to aſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to God in praier, at all times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that though the Saints may
be without other Ordinances, as baptiſm,
and breaking of bread (though I know no
rule they have willingly to neglect them
neither:) yet they cannot be without the
uſe of praier and propheſying; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſee that Saints have alwaies enjoyed
them, during all the time they have been
troden under foot: the ſpirit of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and propheſie hath been ſtill upon
them. And herein they have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be both living Chriſtians, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Chriſtians: a dead man cannot
breathe, nor can a ſleeping man ſpeak; but
when a man breathes and ſpeaks, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be, both a living, and a waking
man. Now if Chriſtians be not dead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98732:86"/>
then ſure they will both breathe, and
ſpeak as ſoon as the breath of ſpiritual life
is in a man, he is a man that breaths toward
God in praier continually: and when he is
grown up a little, he is able to ſpeak, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
exhortation and comfort; though
ſome are more fluent in ſpeaking, and have
better utterance then
others, yet<note n="*" place="margin">Therefore to confine this ſpeaking or propheſying to ſuch only as are ordained to be Biſhops or Presbyters, is a principle derived from Babylonian darknes, and hath not the leaſt footing in the Scripture.</note> all in
whom there is true
ſpiritual life, in ſome
ſort or other, doe ſo
ſpeak as to edifie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
and comfort
one another. Let
ſuch therefore as are in this errour, beware
how they entertain principles, ſo contrary
to the very life of Chriſtianity. And O do
you not ſtop your breath; what though
you be in <hi>Babylon?</hi> yet you muſt breathe
there, otherwiſe you are ſtifled. Beware
therefore of being ſtifled, breathe freely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thy God, whereever thou art. Thou
maiſt have Communion with him in any
place. Though thou art with <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and in a Lions den; yet the breathings
and the pantings of thy ſoul after God, are
acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:98732:87"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps ſome may ſay, When
I goe about to pray, I finde much deadneſſe,
fleſhlineſſe, carnality and coldneſſe in my
ſelf, both when I am to pray publikely with
other Saints, and when I am privately reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and I look upon this as an effect of
Babyloniſh darkneſſe. I queſtion therefore
whether I may pray, until it be wholly done
away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle, when he bids us, In
all things to make known our requeſts to
God, and to pray without ceaſing, and to
continue in praier, and to pray continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Phil. 4. 6. 1 Theſſ. 5. 17. Col.</hi> 4. 2. did very
well know, That Saints did carry fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, which would be oppoſing the
Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and therefore he himſelf ſaith, <hi>When
I would doe good, evil is preſent with me;</hi> and,
<hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit
againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to
the other: ſo that ye cannot doe the things that ye
would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. I ſay the Apoſtle knew
this, That the fleſh would oppoſe, but he
would not have Saints, upon that ground
to neglect ſpirituall duties: for that were
to ſuffer the fleſh to get the victory; but
rather to be the more frequent in ſpirituall
duties, and to be the more inceſſant in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98732:87"/>
performances, eſpecially in praier, that
ſo they might overcome the fleſh that ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, When the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Saints to ſpirituall duties, he ſpeaks to
them as knowing, that though they carry
fleſh ſtill about them, yet that they have a
ſpirit in them, in which they are to act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God: and that though fleſh be acting
in them; yet at the ſame time, that ſpirit
may act in them. And therefore when Saints
come to pray, though the fleſh doe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to put out the life of the Spirit, yet
the Spirit ſtrives to mortifie the fleſh: and
though both act at the ſame time, yet God
is able to diſtinguiſh, between what cometh
from his own Spirit, which is alwaies in
his Saints, and what comes from fleſh in
them. And though the fleſh doe act its
part, yet Jeſus Chriſt having by one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
done away all the corruptions of the
fleſh in his people: God can notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fleſh in them, ſmell a ſweet ſavour
in thoſe performances, in which there is
much weakneſſe and fleſh, and but little of
the Spirit appearing; there being an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
already made, for the ſins of their
holy things. So that Saints, you having
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98732:88"/>
Spirit in you, as well as fleſh, you are not
to neglect to performe ſpirituall duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you doe not ſee fleſh wholly ſubdued
(for that was never yet done in any Saint,
while he remained in this tabernacle) but
in that ſpirit to act, eſpecially in praier, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when you finde fleſh alſo acting; for if
you have but a ſpiritual deſire, to have that
fleſh ſubdued, that deſire cometh from the
Spirit; and that ſpark being neglected, may
ſeem to die; but if according to the rule of
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> we ſtirre up that gift of the
Spirit we have received, how weak ſoever
it may ſeem to be, that ſpark may grow up
into a flame, and get ſtrength in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to burn up that corruption that ſo
troubles and burthens us. Therefore the
Apoſtle gives this rule, <hi>To continue in praier.</hi>
Saints doe you deſire to have fleſh ſubdued?
then continue ſo deſiring, and be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lifting up your ſpirits, to your God in
praier againſt it: and that you may doe ſo,
take all opportunities to retire your ſelf,
from other imploiments, that you may lift
up your ſouls unto God in praier: and doe
not content your ſelves with barely having
theſe deſires, and ſo be continually plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your ſelves in worldly imploiments, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98732:88"/>
converſing with ſublunary things: but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all opportunities, to retire your
ſelves, from converſing with theſe things,
for the enlivening and enflaming of your
ſpirits; and doe not perſwade your ſelves,
that while you are diſcourſing of your bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
and tradings, and lands, and livings,
and cloathing, and I know not what; that
you pray as well, as when you retire your
ſelf into a private place, to lift up your
ſouls in ſecret to God in praier: For our
Saviour gives you this direction; <hi>When you
pray enter into your cloſets, and ſhut your doors,
and pray to your Father which is in ſecret,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. And our Saviour himſelf obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſame rule: for it is often ſaid of
him, That he went apart into a mountain
to pray; and continued whole nights in
praier unto God: the night being the time
in which he was free from other imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 9. it is ſaid, That
<hi>Peter</hi> went upon the houſe to pray. And
truly if Saints did improve more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and take more advantages thus to
retire themſelves to converſe with God; ſo
much coldneſſe and lukewarmneſſe, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
covetouſneſſe, pride, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would not appear in them. But it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98732:89"/>
hath been the deſigne of the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to take off Saints from theſe warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
profitable and advantagious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein they might enjoy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, to the end they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in a more looſe and carnal frame, to the
ſading of their ſpirits, and to the ſcandal of
their moſt holy profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But another may ſay, I finde that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith unto his Diſciples, <hi>Whatſoever ye
ſhall ask in my Name, that will I doe,</hi> Joh. 14. 13.
And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have confidence toward God,
and whatſoever we ask, we receive of him,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 21, 22. And again, <hi>This is the confidence
that we have in him, that if we ask any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, he heareth us; and if we know
that he hear us, whatſoever we ask, we know that
we have the Petitions that we deſired of him,
1 John</hi> 5. 14, 15. And by theſe paſſages it
appears, That Saints in the Primitive times,
before the great falling away, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Beaſt; when they praied, had
aſſurance that they ſhould have the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they deſired. But when I pray, I have
no ſuch confidence in many things: and
many times it is a long time before my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
are anſwered; and in ſome Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have a plain denial; and therefore I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98732:89"/>
queſtion, whether it be not ſinfull for me ſo
to continue praying, until I am fully come
out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and then I conceive that I
ſhall have ſuch a ſpirit of praier, as the Saints
had in the Primitive times, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that whatſoever I ask of God, I ſhall
receive of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That the Saints while they
have been under the bondage of <hi>Babylon,</hi> have
had a ſpirit of praier; and have had their
petitions heard, is evident. For their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have brought judgements upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
being preſented upon the golden
Altar. And if it have been no ſin, for theſe
to continue praying, though they were in
<hi>Babylon:</hi> then doubtleſſe it would be no ſin
for thee to pray, though thou ſhouldeſt be
in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas thou ſaiſt, That in
ſome things thou haſt no confidence that
thou ſhalt be heard; and ſometimes it is
long before ſome Petitions are granted, and
other Petitions are plainly denied. Let me
tell thee, That if in thoſe things, in which
thou haſt no confidence, thou doe pray for
them with the ſubmiſſion of thy will, unto
the will of the Father, it may be no ſin for
thee ſo to pray, for the things that thy ſoul
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98732:90"/>
deſires, though thou haſt no confidence of
them; if they be ſuch things, as be not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in themſelves, as ſuch as theſe are not,
<hi>viz.</hi> to be delivered from bodily diſtempers,
to be kept from dangers in travelling, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſea or land; to be delivered from the
tyranny of unreaſonable men, that ſeek to
doe thee hurt: or to have parents, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or wife, or husband, or brethren, or
ſiſters, or any other friend delivered from
bodily diſtempers, or dangers in travelling,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to have them brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, from darkneſſe to light,
and from the power of Satan to God: or
to have them kept from errours and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſpirits. I ſay theſe, and ſuch like
things, which are not ſinfull in themſelves,
if thy ſoul deſire them, it will be no ſinne
for thee to pray for them, though thou haſt
no confidence that they ſhall be granted; ſo
thou pray for theſe, with the ſubmitting of
thy will, to the will of the Father. And
this is clear, in that the Lord Jeſus himſelf,
in whom was no ſinne, did pray ſo, with
ſubmiſſion to the Fathers will, for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from that bitter cup, which he was to
drink of, though he had no confidence that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Petition ſhould be granted. So that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98732:90"/>
Saints may pray, for thoſe things which
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y doe not infallibly know, to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the minde of God: and yet it may
be no ſinne ſo to pray, if they doe pray with
ſubmiſſion to the Fathers will. And in ſo
praying they may be acceptable to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who many times doth grant ſome of
thoſe Petitions, as ſoon as they are put up;
and at other times, after he hath made his
people to wait long, and to pray importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
for them. And if ſome of them be
denied, yet their perſons and praiers may be
accepted, and may be, and ſometimes are
granted another way, God giving them in
that, which is better then the thing deſired.
But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All Saints may have, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
many Saints have as much confidence
now in praier, as the Saints had in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times; for what was the confidence
that Saints then had? Saith <hi>John, This is the
confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any
thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> This
was the primitive Saints confidence, and
what Saint hath not this confidence now,
that if we ask any thing according to his
will, he heareth us? Saints are now confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That the things they pray for which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98732:91"/>
God wils, and intends to give unto them,
ſhall be granted, only they have not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
ſpirit, ſo as to know in all things,
what it is the will of God to beſtow upon
them. But many things they doe know,
and others they have ſtrong perſwaſions of,
when God in a more then ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
moves their ſpirits to pray for
them.</p>
               <p>Thus Saints have a holy boldnes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
in approaching to the throne of
Grace, by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt,
coming to God in the ſpirit of Adoption,
being confident of having every good thing,
that a gracious and loving Father ſees good
for them, all their Petitions are heard. They
are confident, that if they ask any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, he heareth them. And
no Saints in the Primitive times had other
confidence. So that Saints, it is no ſinne
for you to continue praying, making
known your requeſts to God, but it is your
duty ſo to do. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though fleſh doe break out,
and in ſome things Saints doe not pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
yet they are not therefore wholly to
neglect praying: knowing that God ſtill
delights in the breathings of his owne
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98732:91"/>
Spirit in them; although they have
many weakneſſes and infirmities in them.
And</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If they finde their faith is not ſo
high, nor their confidence ſo ſtrong, as ſome
Primitive Saints were, then ought they to
pray for the increaſe of faith. If they be
weak in faith, let them have recourſe to
him, who is the authour and finiſher of
faith, for the ſtrengthening of it; who will
give liberally, and will not upbraid his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
though they be weak. Though a man
that is altogether faithleſſe, hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſure to him; yet the man weak in faith,
hath as many promiſes made to him, as he
that is ſtrong in faith. So that though it
be weak, yet if it be a true faith in him that
praies for the increaſe of faith, he ſhall finde
acceſſe to the throne of grace. And ſo much
for the clearing of this.</p>

            <div n="7" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 7.</head>
               <p>Seventhly, The next Deduction is to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the excellency and preciouſnes of Saints,
from the 4 &amp; 5 verſes, they are diſcovered to
be excellent, in that they are ſaid to be Olive
trees, they are not as the dry tree, who is <hi>nigh
unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned,</hi> He. 6. 8. But
bleſſed and happy is the condition of Saints:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98732:92"/>
For they have an <hi>unction from the holy Ones,</hi>
they ſtand in the preſence of the Lord of the
whole earth. They are precious in the eies
of God, and profitable to men: for they
empty the golden oil, they have received
from the holy one into others; the Spirit
as it floweth from them, ſometimes peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
into thoſe that are ſtrangers, aliens
to Jeſus Chriſt, whereby they are brought
home to the imbraces of Jeſus Chriſt: and
then Saints are excellent in their eyes alſo.
And ſo <hi>David</hi> cals them, <hi>Pſal. 16. 2, 3. My
goodneſſe extendeth not to thee; but to the Saints
that are in the earth, and to the excellent in whom
is all my delight.</hi> And excellent they are.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are not only as
Olive-trees, but as Candle-ſticks. For as
it is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo it is ſaid of
them, <hi>They are the light of the world,</hi> Mat. 5. 14.
They are <hi>as light ſhining in a dark place.</hi> Now
how precious is light, to them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in a ſenſible darkneſſe? Light is
one of the moſt precious things in the
world: it puts a beauty upon other things,
it chears and comforts the heart; it cauſes
men to ſee the dangers that are in their
way, that ſo they may avoid them: and
many others, are the excellent properties
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98732:92"/>
of this naturall light; but many more, are
the precious effects of ſpirituall light. And
this is that that Saints have; though others
are in the darkneſſe of hell, yet they enjoy
the light of heaven: <hi>The Lord God almighty,
and the Lamb are a light unto them,</hi> Rev. 21. 23.
And in this reſpect alſo Saints are excellent
and precious ones: But I would be brief in
this particular, and therefore ſhall not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlarge it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 8.</head>
               <p>Eighthly, The next Deduction, in which
I ſhall be brief alſo, is to diſcover from the
fifth verſe, the dangerous condition of thoſe
wicked men, that are enemies to Saints.
Though Saints ſeem to be poor, weak, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable
creatures, and their enemies in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance ſeem to be ſtrong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and to be overcomers of them: yet
theſe ſeeming weak Saints, are ſtrong, and
mighty: for they can but ſend up a meſſage
to heaven, and bring ſecret and inviſible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
from thence, which ſhall deſtroy their
enemies. The breath of their mouth kindles
coals of fire, that deſtroies their enemies;
<hi>And if any man will hurt them, he muſt with this
fire be killed.</hi> Little doe wicked men think,
that when they deal cruelly with Saints,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98732:93"/>
they bring coals of fire upon their owne
heads; yet ſo they doe, if they continue ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
enemies unto them. There is
a notable place, to ſhew the danger men run
upon, when they offer to wrong the Saints
of God, it is <hi>Zech 12. 3. In that day, ſaith the
Lord, will I make Jeruſalem a burdenſome ſtone
for all people: all that burden themſelves with it
ſhall be cut in pieces; though all the people of the
earth ſhall be gathered together againſt it.</hi> Though
the ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Saints of God,
had all the people of the earth gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
againſt them; yet ſo potent and
ſtrong are they, through the Lord of hoſt
their God, as they ſhould overcome them
all; they ſhould be as a burdenſome ſtone,
and ſhould cruſh in pieces, all that burden
themſelves with them. Therefore it would
be wiſdome in men, to beware how they
offer any violence to any one of the Saints
of God, either to their lives or liberties,
how colourable ſo ever the pretences be, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they doe it; ſeeing it is ſuch a
dangerous thing to abuſe Saints: as that in
wronging them, men be devoured or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied
by them. And ſo I have done with
this particular alſo.</p>

               <p>Ninthly, In the next place from the ſixth
verſe, might be diſcovered the reaſon, why
there hath been ſuch a hardneſſe of heart
and impenitency upon the Beaſt, and the
Babyloniſh crew; namely, becauſe that as
a judgement upon them, for perſecuting the
Saints of God; the heavens have been ſo
ſhut up againſt them, as that none of the
waters of the ſpirit have deſcended upon
them. But I paſſe this by, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars that might be obſerved in
that verſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 10.</head>
               <p>The tenth Deduction is from the ſeventh
verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>The Beaſt that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of the bottomleſſe pit, ſhall make warre,</hi> &amp;c.
It doth enform us, that this title, <hi>The Beaſt,</hi>
is the moſt proper title of the Pope; as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in the comparing of the ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
in this propheſie, where the Beaſt is
mentioned together; which is done in the
explicatory part of this Diſcourſe; where
it appears evidently, that by the Beaſt is
meant the Pope: Now in all the other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
of the propheſie of this book, where
the Pope is mentioned; and in this ſeventh
verſe, he being called <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> it is evident,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98732:94"/>
that this is his moſt proper title. Though
it is true, the Pope is Antichriſtian, yet we
doe no where, in the propheſie of this book,
nor in any other Scripture where he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
ſpoken of, finde the title of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
given to him. But generally, in the
propheſie of this book, and in the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where there are ſome things
ſpoken of him, he is called <hi>the Beaſt.</hi> And
for the 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. where he is alſo expreſly
ſpoken of, and plainly deſcribed, he is not
called there Antichriſt neither, but is there
called, <hi>That man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, and
that wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is ſaid, there are many Antichriſts,
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. But it is no where ſaid, There
are many Beaſts, and therefore he is called,
<hi>The Beaſt,</hi> and that man of ſinne, the ſonne
of perdition, and that wicked. As we uſe
to ſay, The King of ſuch a Kingdome; and
The Governour of ſuch a place; and, The
Maior of ſuch a City or Town; importing
there is but one: So the Pope is called, The
Beaſt. For though there be many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts,
yet there is but one Beaſt; but one
Pope, who is, The Beaſt. I doe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſerve this: firſt to diſcover, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
greatneſſe of the wickedneſſe, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98732:94"/>
the abominableneſſe of the Pope; who for
his oppoſition to God, and his enmity to
the Saints, is expreſt by a peculiar title, that
is proper only to that wicked one: to ſhew
that he is above al others hateful and curſed.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, I doe the rather ſpeak of
this, becauſe ſome doe confuſedly ſpeak of
the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and Antichriſt, confounding the
Beaſt with Antichriſt, whereas there be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
that are, and may be called Antichriſts,
eſpecially ſome that are riſen up lately, That
deny that Jeſus is the Chriſt, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
equal with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and
who do alſo deny, That Jeſus Chriſt is come
in the fleſh; or at leaſt have a light eſteem
of Chriſts coming in the fleſh: by looking
upon that fleſh, which was ſo united unto
the God-head, as when the life of it was laid
down: it was ſaid to be the life of
God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. as
no<note n="*" place="margin">Though that fleſh as it was offered up through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit, was a propitiation for our ſins, and that bloud ſo ſhed did cleanſe us from all ſin: ye that fleſh ſo offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did at once ſanctifie and perfect all that are his. 1 Jo. 4. 10. and 1 Joh. 1. 7. and Heb. 10. 10. and 14.</note> more to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
then the fleſh
of a common man. I
ſay theſe, and ſuch as
theſe are Antichriſts,
as is clear, 1 <hi>John 2.
22.</hi> and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 3.
But though there be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98732:95"/>
many Antichriſts, yet there is but one that
may be called the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> but by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Beaſt with Antichriſt, ſome look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Beaſt onely as Antichriſt, whereas
there be many Antichriſts, which are to be
rejected and avoided, beſides the Beaſt;
though they have more ſpecious pretences
than the Beaſts pretences now are, and are
thereby the more like to prevail upon the
more knowing profeſſors of the time. So
much for this particular.</p>

               <head>Deduction 11.</head>
               <p>Eleventhly, In the eleventh place, it ſerves
to juſtifie the Parliament, and all that joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them in the late defenſive war. Now
although they have been branded with the
odious titles of Rebels and Traitours, and
what not: yet here their juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
in that act, appears as clear as the
Sunne.</p>
               <p>For firſt, we ſee here, that the enemies
which they did oppoſe was the Beaſt, that
did aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit. And
who the Beaſt is, and how the Beaſt did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be he, that did wage the late warre
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is made evident in the
explicatory part of this Diſcourſe. Now
ſince it was the Beaſt, that curſed enemy of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98732:95"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Saints, that raiſed
this warre, it was a moſt righteous act in
the Parliament, and all that did adhere to
them, to oppoſe him, and his party
in it.</p>
               <p>But here by the way I deſire to declare,
That though I doe affirme, that that warre
was raiſed by the Beaſt, that curſed enemy
of Jeſus Chriſt: yet doe I not hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
every particular man that did engage
in this warre; nor any particular man, high
or low: for I know not, but that it might
be poſſible, for ſome by colourable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be drawn to engage in this warre, that
never intended to fight for the Beaſt, but on
the contrary hated him. But this I affirm,
that the generality of thoſe (eſpecially of
the chiefeſt) that engaged in this warre,
were ſuch as were thereunto incited by
the Beaſt, and intended the advancement of
the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>And now I ſay, ſeeing the warre, that was
raiſed againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
againſt the Parliament, and ſuch as were ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Puritans and round-heads in <hi>England,</hi>
was a warre made by the Beaſt, that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the bottomleſſe pit, and contrived
in <hi>Rome</hi> and hell: it was a moſt righteous
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98732:96"/>
thing for the Parliament, and thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to them, to defend themſelves againſt
it: God having put a power into their
hands to do it: and yet were they no Rebels,
unleſſe it were rebellion to oppoſe the Pope
and the devil.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, The righteouſneſſe of the
Parliament, and thoſe that adhered to them,
is made further evident, by conſidering the
ends for which the Beaſt did raiſe this war;
and they were,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To deſtroy the Witneſſes, to make
an utter end of all the Saints and ſervants
of Jeſus Chriſt, and to leave none that
ſhould oppoſe or ſpeak againſt the Beaſt, the
Pope, that ſo he might bring all men into a
profeſſed ſubjection to himſelf. And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Puritans were the only obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
hereof (for others would eaſily enough
have been perſwaded unto a uniformity, and
would ſay, that there was little or nothing
in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> doctrines, but might have
been imbraced, rather then to make any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
if the Puritans were removed out of
the way) therefore one main end the Beaſt
had in this warre, was to overcome the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
Now this being one end of the
Beaſt in that warre, it was a righteous thing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98732:96"/>
for the Parliament, and thoſe that adhered
to them, to oppoſe the Beaſt, for the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing
of, and preſerving of the Saints of
Jeſus Chriſt, from the tyranny of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>It being a righteous act in <hi>Abraham</hi> to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
and deliver one juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> from thoſe that
would have captivated him, and his family:
It is much more a righteous act in the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary
party, to reſcue and deliver, all
the precious Saints of Jeſus Chriſt: (for al
Saints had a ſhare in this deliverance) from
the cruelty and tyranny of the Beaſt, that
ſought their ruine. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their righteouſneſſe in that
act, will appear, if we conſider the other
end of the Beaſt in the late warre, and that
was to thruſt out Jeſus Chriſt, from raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as King, and to ſet up his owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
by ſubjecting the conſciences of all
that profeſſe Jeſus Chriſt, both in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and all others, unto his laws. Now
this being his other great deſign in that war;
it was a moſt righteous thing to oppoſe him
in it. And it had been a great ſinne for the
Parliament to ſtoop themſelves, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all the reſt in the Kingdome, thus to be
ſubjected to the Beaſt; and lay aſide the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98732:97"/>
power of Jeſus Chriſt: God having put
power into their hands, to oppoſe the Beaſt
herein.</p>
               <p>Thus, the righteouſneſſe of thoſe that did
oppoſe the Beaſt, appears, if we look upon
the ends of the Beaſt in that warre.
And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their righteouſneſſe in that act
of oppoſing the Beaſt, is made the farther
evident, becauſe it is in part a fulfilling of
that righteous ſentence, which God hath
paſt upon the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6, 7. where God
ſaies to his people thus, <hi>Reward her even as
ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her works; in the cup which ſhe hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
fill to her double: how much ſhe hath glorified
her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and
ſorrow give her.</hi> Now this ſentence is in this
warre (wherein the Beaſt hath been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and his deſigns fruſtrated, and a tenth
part of <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen) in part fulfilled:
for in this warre <hi>Babylon</hi> hath in part had of
the ſame cup, which ſhe filled to the Saints,
as ſhe overcame them, ſo they have in part
overcome her; and this is the beginning of
her torments, which are coming on apace,
and ere long the cup that ſhe hath filled, ſhall
be filled to her double.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:98732:97"/>
Now the Parliament, and thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to them, having in the late defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
warre, in part fulfilled that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſentence of God upon <hi>Babylon;</hi> it doth
therein moſt clearly appear to be a righteous
act.</p>

               <head>Deduction 12.</head>
               <p>Twelfthly, In the next place here is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the reaſon why the Parliamentary
Army, did not more prevail for the firſt
three years and an half, and why after that
period of time it was ſo ſucceſſefull and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious:
The reaſon of it here plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be, becauſe it was (according to
fore-appointment) the minde of God, to
have his people brought to a low ebb, for
ſuch a period of time; ſo that they ſhould
be lookt upon as dead men, and the enemy
ſhould rejoyce over them, as if they were all
totally overcome for three years and an
half: And ſince it was ſo, it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the inſtruments that were then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied,
if they had been never ſo faithfull,
ſo active and diligent, to do any more, then
that which God had raiſed them up for;
which was only to keep the dead bodies of
his people from being buried: and ſo much
they did: they ſtill defended the cauſe of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98732:98"/>
Witneſſes againſt the enemy, ſo as it was
only kept, as it were above-ground, though
it ſeemed to be as dead. And ſo God would
have it to be, for the firſt three yeares and
an half: but when the firſt three years and
an half were compleatly (according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
account) expired; then it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
for the adverſe party to prevail over
them; for then the time was come, in
which the Witneſſes were to be raiſed, and
then the Spirit of life from God entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: and that was the reaſon why they
went on like active, living men, ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
and victoriouſly: for God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to carry on his worke, for the
fall of this Kingdom from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 13.</head>
               <p>Thirteenth, In the next place, this ſerves
to exhort all thoſe that were drawne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the late war againſt the Parliament,
and thoſe godly people that adhered to
them, to relinquiſh that act of theirs. And
that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is ſo apparent, that in ſo
doing, they were inſtruments of upholding
the Kingdome of the Beaſt, and that they
did in it endeavour to ſupport the Beaſt, as
much as in them lay, whatever the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98732:98"/>
were upon which they were drawne to
engage in it: and therefore if they deſire to
be enemies to the Beaſt, let them be enemies
to this act of theirs: for in it they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſupport the Beaſt, though it was in
vain, the time of his ruine being come: and
therefore it behoves them to repent of what
they have done in it; for it is not good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
can juſtifie an evil action. It would
be their wiſdome therefore, now at laſt to
renounce it, as they renounce the Beaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And</p>
               <p>Secondly, It concerns them to repent of
this deed of theirs, conſidering againſt
whom they fought, not againſt ordinary
men, but againſt the
choiſeſt of<note n="*" place="margin">Though I ſay that it was againſt the choiſeſt of men; yet I doe not hereby affirme, That all that were engaged on that ſide, in an outward oppoſition, were the choiſeſt of men: for ſome that were on that ſide, might be as bad as ſome on the other ſide: for ſome of the nations, and kindreds, and tongues, and people that were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Witneſſes did help the Witneſſes, as the earth was ſaid to help the woman, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 16.</note> men, the
Witneſſes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Jeſus Chriſt:
nay they fought not
againſt them onely,
but againſt Jeſus
Chriſt: for as Jeſus
Chriſt ſaith to his
Diſciples, That <hi>the
world hated them,
becauſe it hated him;
and he that hateth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98732:99"/>
him, hateth the Father
alſo, Joh.</hi> 15. 18. &amp; 23.
So it may be ſaid,
that they that fought
againſt the Saints of
Ieſus Chriſt, fought
againſt Ieſus Chriſt
himſelf, and againſt
the Father alſo. Now therefore, you that
were active in that quarrel of the Beaſt, how
doth it concern you to renounce what you
have done therein? leaſt you be found to be
fighters againſt God: and let no longer a
ſpirit of emnity and difference remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, and thoſe that you oppoſed in
that particular, but be of one minde with
them, in a mutuall oppoſing of the Beaſt
with them. And this doe, leaſt perſiſting
in that way of defending the Beaſt, you be
deſtroied with the Beaſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 14.</head>
               <p>Fourteenthly, In the next place it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
all thoſe that did engage in the late
defenſive warre, that they have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in what they have done, in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and no cauſe to repent of it. Have
you contributed to the maintenance of the
warre in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by lending
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98732:99"/>
plate, and disburſing money? And have
you ſent horſes, and arms, and proviſions
to the Army? And have your ſervants or
children, or your ſelves in perſon, been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
in that warre? You have cauſe to
rejoyce in all that you have done therein:
for you ſee it was a moſt juſt and righteous
act, and God hath by it brought a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
worke to paſſe, in the bringing this
Kingdome from that vaſſallage to <hi>Rome,</hi> in
which it hath been this twelve hundred
years, and putting the cup of trembling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the enemies of Ieſus Chriſt,
the dregs whereof they ſhall at laſt take off.
And therefore you have no cauſe to repent,
but to rejoyce in what you have done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
to rejoyce that you had the honour to
be in any meaſure inſtruments of promoting
ſuch a cauſe; and if you ſuffered any loſſes,
by being oppoſers of the adverſe party, yet
it was farre better to be loſers in oppoſing
them, then in any meaſure to comply with
them. And you that have received wounds,
or loſt limbs, for promoting that cauſe may
glory in them: for what ſoever you have
herein done, or ſuffered, it hath been in,
and for oppoſing that grand enemy of Ieſus
Chriſt, <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> and in being inſtruments
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98732:100"/>
of bringing Gods deſigne to paſſe, for the
ruining of great <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the ſetting up
the Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how ever you ſeem to be rewarded of
men for it; yet never repent of it, but rejoyce
in what you have done in it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction 15.</head>
               <p>Fifteenthly, In the next place this may
convince thoſe of their errour, that take to
themſelves a power over the conſciences of
Saints, to rule over them, and make laws for
them, and to force them to obedience to
thoſe laws.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch ſeriouſly conſider this, that this
is apparently that curſed power that the
Beaſt hath uſurpt to himſelf, or at leaſt it
had no other Donor then the Dragon, the
old Serpent, the Devil: who gave the Beaſt
his Power and Seat, and great authority.
And by this Power the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> firſt
became, and ſtill continues to be the Beaſt.
And this is a Power that is abhorred of
God; for thoſe men that exerciſe this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
doe take away the legiſlative power of
God, who is the King, the Judge, and the
LAW-GIVER of his Saints; and doe give
Ieſus Chriſt leſſe honour, then the Heathens
doe their idols, who doe allow them to be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98732:100"/>
the orderers of their own worſhip.</p>
               <p>O that theſe men therefore might be
convinced of their errour, in impoſing their
lawes upon the conſciences of Saints, and
conſtraining them to worſhip God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the rules that they have hammered
out from them; though they dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that they themſelves are infallible:
for ſurely, if they perſiſt in it, God who is
jealous of his glory, and will not give it to
another, will break out in the fire of his
jealouſie againſt them, as well as againſt the
Beaſt, that great man of ſin, who ſitteth in
the Temple of God, and takes upon him
to make lawes as God. It concerns them
therefore, to beware how they goe on in
theſe waies, leaſt they be deſtroyed with
that ſon of perdition.</p>
               <p>Again, Let ſuch conſider, that all thoſe
that ever exercifed this power, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity
of them were alwaies enemies of
the moſt precious, and moſt ſpirituall
Saints; and were followed with a curſe. Let
them but look upon the Biſhops, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they were enemies of Saints, and a
curſe reſted on them, even a blindeneſſe of
minde, and hardneſſe of heart; and at laſt
they were brought down, and ſhame and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98732:101"/>
contempt caſt upon them.</p>
               <p>And it may be ſome of you, that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to take the ſame power, have
oppoſed the Biſhops for the ſame thing: O
therefore, that in the conſideration heerof
you might at laſt lay down that impoſing
power, although thereby you may ſeem
to loſe, that honour that you ſeek from
men, and to loſe much of theſe outward
things, the things of the world, which at
beſt are but vanity: for it is far better to be
without theſe, and have a good conſcience,
than to enjoy much of theſe, either with a
troubled, or ſeared conſcience, and a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
heart. It is better to be at emnity
with the Beaſt heerin, and loſe much of
the world, then to enjoy abundance of the
world, and ſoon after to periſh with the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Again, This let me tell you with all,
that if you ſhall perſiſt, in endeavouring
to get ſuch an impoſing power (it being
that by which the Beaſt raigns in any
place where it is) it is in vain for you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it in <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>England</hi> is fallen
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and is no more a part of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and therefore it is in vain to ſeeke to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
a Romiſh power any longer in it. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98732:101"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> being thus fallen, is become a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
to the other Kingdomes ſo to doe,
and ſhall not return to <hi>Rome</hi> again, for
<hi>England</hi> and all the other Kingdomes muſt
hate the whore, and make her deſolate.</p>
               <p>And thus much I cannot but ſpeake, to
you that endeavour to take ſuch a power
upon you, whether you will hear, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will forbear.</p>

               <p>16. The next particular ariſing from
theſe verſes thus opened, is an exhortation
to all the Saints in <hi>England,</hi> to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in unity. O you precious ſonnes and
daughters of the Almighty, the Saints, and
Witneſſes of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that are
in this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> Conſider you
what your condition was about ſeven or
eight year ago; at what time you were
trampled upon by the Biſhops (which was
a treading under foot of the Beaſt) Call to
minde how ſome of you were pillored, and
had your eares cropt and many of you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
and fined, and by ſeverall other
waies were perſecuted, and troubled by the
members of the Beaſt your adverſaries: and
that onely for acting that which in your
conſcience, you were parſwaded was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98732:102"/>
to the minde of God; and which if you
had for fear of men, or for any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
left undone, your conſcience told you,
that you ſhould in ſo doing be diſobedient
to your heavenly Father. I ſay, call theſe
things to minde, and what a great preſſure
it was to your ſpirit, that you could not
with liberty, and freedome follow the
Lamb; but men did what in them lay
to enforce you to worſhip the Beaſt, and to
embrace for doctrine, the commandments
of men. O how grievious was this oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to you! And what a burden was it?
And how did you groan in your ſpirits to
be delivered? What a grief was it to you
to ſee precious Saints cruelly, and ridgedly
dealt with, by the enemies of Ieſus Chriſt?
And how many frequent prayers did your
ſouls breath out, and lift up to heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your enemies, and for deliverance,
from their yoake of bondage? I ſay, call
theſe things to minde, and remember that
this was the condition of you all, whether
you are ſuch as are commonly called Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
or Independents, or Anabaptiſts, if
you were Saints, if you loved the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in ſincerity, you were all a like
hated of, and oppoſed by the Beaſt: and it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98732:102"/>
was a grief, and burden to all your ſpirits,
to ſee the enemies of Ieſus Chriſt to prevail
ſo much, and you all, both Presbyterians,
Independents and Anabaptiſts did pour out
many effectual, fervent praiers againſt the
Beaſt, and the Biſhops his adherents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Conſider, as the Beaſt was thus
an enemy to you all alike, ſo it was a mercy
to you all alike, when in the year 1645.
God gave you all, a full victory over the
adherents of the Beaſt in this Kingdom: for
then the Biſhops, and them that fought for
them (and in them the Beaſt) was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
And this, I ſay, was a mercy to
you all alike, and it was alike anſwer to all
your praiers, and alike joy to all your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to ſee your enemies, and the enemies
of Jeſus Chriſt overcome. And now ſince
you are all children of the ſame Father, and
have all one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and have all
one Spirit, and have all drank of one cup
of affliction, and had all one common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that hated you all, and perſecuted you
all, becauſe you had all the one holy Spirit
of the Father, and of the Son in you: and
ſince your Father in love to you all, and in
anſwer to the praiers of you all, gave you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98732:103"/>
all alike deliverance from that enemy of
you all. O unite, unite, unite! ſince your
God hath made you one in his love, O be
you one in your love one to another! and
let it appear that you dwell in God, by dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in love. What a low, unworthy thing is
it, for you that dwell in God, to grow cold
in love towards your brethren, the children
of your Father, for differing from you in
judgement, in ſome circumſtantiall things
only? What if ſome be weak, and doe not
know ſo much of the minde of God, in ſome
circumſtantial things as you (whether you
be Presbyterians, Independents or Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts)
conceive you doe? Will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not love your weak brother, for whom
Chriſt died, and who is beloved of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe your Father in his wiſdome,
hath yet with-held that light from him,
which he hath given to you? What a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is this in you thus to doe? Doe you
not know, that it is not for your merits
that you have more then him, but it was
from grace, from free favour that you have
it? And doth what you have received from
grace, worke ſuch an effect in you, as to
make you grow cold in love toward your
brethren? O let it be far from you!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:98732:103"/>
And what though ſome are Presbyterians
and ſome Independents, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
diſtinguiſhed? Though I could wiſh,
that theſe diſtinctions of difference might be
all laid aſide, and that all that belong to
Jeſus Chriſt might only be called Saints,
and the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, and by ſuch
generall expreſſions as include them all,
though they ſtill differ in circumſtances: for
there were no ſuch diſtinctions uſed among
Saints in the primitive times, though there
were differences in ſome circumſtances. But
I ſay, What though ſome are Presbyterians
and ſome Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet if they are
ſuch as you judge to be in Chriſt Jeſus, and
to be beloved of the Father: reſolve you in
the ſtrength of Chriſt, to ſuffer none of
their differences from you in judgement, to
with-draw your affections from them: but
ſince you love your God and Father, love
you his beloved children, and your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
and ſince you ſincerely love the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let it appear in loving
of thoſe upon whom his image is ſtampt:
For there is no reaſon, why you ſhould not
love Presbyterians, as well as Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and Anabaptiſts, as well as Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſſe you look upon them as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98732:104"/>
no Saints, as ſuch as are no lovers of the
Lord Jeſus: but if you look upon them as
Saints, then if you love the Lord Jeſus, you
cannot but love them, what ever their
judgements be. And if you be deficient
herein, you are to condemn your ſelves in
it, and to be humbled for it. And hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
conſidering the oneneſſe that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you all, what ever your judgements
are, and that you have been as one in your
ſufferings, and as one in deliverances from
ſufferings, doe you ſtill be one in love, and
then <hi>upon you will the Lord command the bleſſing,
even life for evermore.</hi> Pſal. 133. 3.</p>

               <p>17. The next, and the main Deduction
that flows from theſe verſes, being thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
is a ſpeciall encouragement, in

Court of Parliament, and to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
the Lord <hi>FAIRFAX,</hi> and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It is of ſpeciall encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the high and honourable Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
for as much as (a great number
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98732:104"/>
of them, being the Witneſſes of Jeſus
Chriſt) they were the primary or firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
that God made uſe of to defend
the cauſe of his people, and to preſerve
them from the tyranny and fury of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Now you being the firſt inſtruments that
God made uſe of, to plead the cauſe of his
people, God having into your hand firſt
put the power of oppoſing the Beaſt: and
that wonderfull hath been the ſpirit of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and conſtancy, that hath been put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you in that high Court of Parliament,
that make it your deſign to advance the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the good of the
Saints, and of all the Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in generall: ſo that though you have
been oppoſed by great and potent enemies,
yet your courage hath not failed, but you
have perſiſted conſtant, in proſecuting the
ſame deſignes, ſince you firſt began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in 1641. unto

party; and you have not baſely complied

               <p>And in all this, the word of God being
fulfilled, theſe things being according to
what is written, even your being firſt laid
low, and alſo your raiſing again, it being
written, predeclared, that the Beaſt ſhould
make warre with the Witneſſes (of whom
you are a part, and whoſe cauſe you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend)
and ſhould overcome them, and kill
them, and that they ſhould lie dead three
years and an half, and after three years and

things being written and fulfilled, the Beaſt
having made warre againſt the Witneſſes

of defending againſt him, and his
adherents,) and having overcome them
and killed them, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and they being dead for three years
and an half, the enemy rejoycing over
them, and making merry, becauſe they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98732:105"/>
thought they had been ſo ſlain, as they
ſhould never recover life again; your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being overcome, and your Gariſons
being poſſeſſed by the enemy, and after three
years and an half, the Spirit of life being
put upon your Army, and they, <hi>as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
ſtanding upon their feet, and therein at
the ſame time, <hi>England</hi> being fallen from
the Beaſt, from being a part of great <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and this in the year 1645. and that
year being the year, wherein it is written,
The prevailing power of the Beaſt ſhould
come to a period. I ſay, theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, here is ſpecial incouragement to you
Witneſſes, in the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to goe on in defending that cauſe,
that God hath given you the honour hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to be inſtruments of defending: I ſay, to
go on to defend it. And that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, By doing juſtice upon your, and
the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt. Hath God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
any of the chief actours of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
bloudy warre into your hands?
then you being a Civil Power, ordained of
God, are to doe juſtice upon evil doers: for
the Apoſtle ſaith of a Ruler, <hi>Rom. 13. 4. He
is the miniſter of God, and he beareth not the ſword
in vain: for he is the miniſter of God, a revenger
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98732:106"/>
to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> And
they are evil-doers in a high degree, that
are theeves and murderers: and ſuch are the
chief actours of an unjuſt warre. Now if
God have delivered any ſuch into your
hands, you are to execute wrath upon them:
for it is an obſervable paſſage, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 42.
The Prophet of the Lord there tels <hi>Ahab</hi>
King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after he had let <hi>Benhadad</hi> King
of <hi>Syria,</hi> whom the Lord had delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hand, to go away with his life; that
<hi>Ahabs</hi> life ſhould goe for his life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not ſafe, to neglect doing juſtice
upon ſuch perſons, although they conſent
to ſuch Articles of agreement (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to doe it, for their own ends) as
<hi>Benhadad</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 34. Now you in
the high Court of Parliament, whom God
hath honoured to be the chief inſtruments
of defending the righteous cauſe of the
Witneſſes, have ſpeciall encouragement
to goe on to execute juſt wrath upon ſuch
groſſe evil doers, without fear.</p>
               <p>And alſo ſecondly, You have encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to goe on, to deal well with all the
Witneſſes and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, that
walk ſoberly and juſtly toward men, and
holily towards God, that are under your
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98732:106"/>
juriſdiction; whether they be ſuch as are
commonly called Presbyterians or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,
or Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even to
deal well with them, and all the Subjects of
the Kingdome, and to undoe the heavy
burdens, and to let the oppreſſed goe free,
and to break every yoke, and to eſtabliſh
juſt and righteous laws. I ſay, here is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
encouragement for you to doe thus;
for in doing thus, you ſhall proſper and
become a glory to the Kingdome; and no
enemy ſhall ever henceforth be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt you: for though formerly you
were brought into a low condition, and
the enemy prevailed over you with a very
high hand; yet henceforth the enemy ſhall
no more prevail againſt you, although they
were in number a hundred thouſand more
then they are.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, From theſe verſes thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
here is ſpeciall encouragement in
particular, for his Excellency the Lord
<hi>FAIRFAX,</hi> and the honoured Councel
of warre: ſince as the Parliament are the
primary, ſo they are the ſecondary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of defending the cauſe of the Saints
of God againſt the Beaſt. Now, ſince you,
and the Army under you in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98732:107"/>
(according to what is written, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
long agoe) were they that had a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life from God put upon you, in the
year 1645. whereby life was put into all
the Witneſſes, and whereby you were ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to act like living men, men that had a
life from God, in the overcoming the Beaſt
and his adherents in this Kingdom: and
ſeeing you have been inſtruments of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that cauſe ever ſince: I ſay, ſeeing God
hath honoured you, ſo as to make you ſuch
eminent inſtruments of this great worke,
and the hearts of all the Saints in <hi>England,</hi>
are generally knit unto you, and the eyes
of all the Saints in <hi>England</hi> are upon you,
moſt Noble General, and Worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
here is, I ſay, ſpecial encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for you to goe on ſtill to improve the
power that God hath given you, for the
ſame end for which it was given you, <hi>viz.</hi>
The ſuppreſſing of the Beaſt, and defending
all the Saints and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt
in this Kingdome, and to goe on (having
the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, and not your
own, and publike good more then private
ends in your eye, and in your heart) to
endeavour to cauſe juſtice and righteouſneſſe
to abound in this Kingdome: and this is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98732:107"/>
your encouragement, that in ſo doing, as
you have alwaies been ſince 1645. So you
ſhall ever be conquerours in all the battles
you fight, and overcomers of all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with whom you encounter, no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
that is formed againſt you ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nor no enemy ſhall be able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you; yea though all the people of the
Earth ſhould be gathered together againſt
you; yet you ſhould be but as a burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſtone unto them, and all that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
themſelves with you, ſhould be broken
in pieces.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, Here is ſpeciall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for all the Saints in <hi>England</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
to be of good courage, not to fear the
menaces or threatnings of any enemy: for
no enemy ſhall ever any more prevail over
them.</p>
               <p>Now what I ſay, for the encouragement
of the Parliament, and of the Generall,
and chief Commanders of the Army in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and of all the Saints in <hi>England</hi> in
generall, is clearly grounded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore is it unqueſtionable, and
to be received and obſerved of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Army and Saints in <hi>England.</hi> Indeed
if I ſhould declare any thing to you, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98732:108"/>
tell you that I had it by viſion or revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and it were not apparent in Scripture,
I know no warrant you had to receive it,
or to have any confidence of it: For as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the day of Chriſt, ſaith to
the <hi>Theſſalonians, Now we beſeech you by the
comming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our
gathering unto him, that you be not ſoon ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in minde, nor be troubled, neither by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as
that the day of Chriſt is at hand; Let no man
deceive you by any means; for that day ſhall
not come, except there come a falling away
firſt,</hi> &amp;c. So may I ſay, you have reaſon
to beware that you be not ſoon ſhaken in
minde, or troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor
by word, nor by letter from any, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing for which they doe not bring
a word from the Scripture: and let no man
deceive you, for you may be deluded and
deceived, if you receive any thing from any,
which is not according to what is revealed
in the Scripture, as the young Prophet was
deluded by the old Prophet, when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that Doctrine which was contrary to
the Word of the Lord, which before he had
received: So may you, if you ſhould ſo doe.
Therefore if a Prophet, or an Apoſtle, or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98732:108"/>
an Angel from heaven, ſhould bring any
meſſage which is not conſonant unto the
Word, which you have already received in
the Scripture, you are not to be ſhaken in
minde, nor to be troubled by it, nor to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. But now the Scripture grounds,
upon which I doe for their encouragement
declare and affirme, That the Parliament,
and the Army in proſecuting the righteous
cauſe of the Saints (and that all the Saints
of <hi>England</hi> in generall) ſhall all overcome
their enemies, and go on victoriouſly hence
forward are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Witneſſes are raiſed
from the dead, The Spirit of life from God
is entered into them, and they do ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their feet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>England</hi> is fallen from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and is no more a tenth part of that
great myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the one thouſand two
hundred and threeſcore years, in which the
Beaſt was to tread the holy City under foot,
did expire in 1645.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt of theſe grounds, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn from Scripture, as appears in the
explicatory part of this Diſcourſe; where
it is evident, That that great and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98732:109"/>
number of Saints in <hi>England,</hi> and all
reall Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, of whom it is
ſaid, <hi>That the Beaſt ſhould make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and overcome them, and that they
ſhould lie dead three years and an half, the
Spirit of life from God ſhould enter into them,
and they ſhould ſtand upon their feet, to the fear
of their enemies, and to the glory of their
God.</hi> And it is evident, that this which
this Scriptrre hath ſaid of them, is pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
come to paſſe; The Beaſt did
make warre againſt all Saints, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
warre againſt that great number of
the Saints in <hi>England</hi> in the late warre,
the Beaſt did overcome them, and kill
them, and they were myſtically dead for
three years and an halfe, and as ſoon as
the three yeares and an halfe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
expired, the Spirit of life from
God entered into them, a Spirit of life,
vigour and courage was put upon them,
and they did no longer lie as dead men,
but like living men, they ſtood upon
their feet, to the fear and amazement of
their enemies, and to the glory of their
God, who had put ſuch a Spirit of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and courage upon them. And
now upon this ground, may all the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98732:109"/>
Saints in <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe Worthies in
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who have been inſtruments of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the power of the Beaſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
be encouraged to continue oppoſing
the Beaſt, and acting juſtly and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
toward all, and be aſſured (God
having put a Spirit of life upon them,
and made them to ſtand upon their feet)
they ſhall overcome every enemy, that
ſhall riſe up againſt them, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
in no battle, ſhall be able to ſtand
before them, nor give them one defeat,
but ſhall fall before them, and bee cut
downe as mowne graſſe, and the men
of warre ſhall not finde their hands, but
turne their backs, and flee before them:
for they ſhall now finde them living men,
ſuch as have a Spirit of life from God put
upon them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground, upon which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
That no enemy ſhall be ever able
to prevail over them, is clear in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
For it is alſo evident in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory
part of this Diſcourſe, That
<hi>England</hi> is that tenth part of the Citie,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98732:110"/>
which the holy Ghoſt in this Scripture
ſpeaks of, where it is ſaid, That upon
the raiſing of the Witneſſes, and their
having a Spirit of life from God put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and their ſtanding upon their
feet, <hi>A tenth part of the City fell.</hi> And it
alſo appears, That <hi>England</hi> being that
tenth part of the City, is fallen from
myſticall Babylon, and is no longer a
part of it, but is overcome by the Lord
Jeſus, hee is now King of it, who is
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who
will keep it for himſelfe, and will not
ſuffer it to be ſubjected to the Beaſt any
more: The Saints in <hi>England</hi> are brought
out of the bondage of myſticall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
and ſhall return no more to it, and
therefore they may be confident, That
none of the Romiſh power, of any of
the other nine Kingdomes, neither thoſe
that are more remote, or thoſe that are
nearer neighbours to it, ſhall ever be able
to prevail over <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third ground of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that the Parliament, Armie and
Witneſſes in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall hence-forth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98732:110"/>
overcome all the enemies that ſhall riſe
up againſt them, is evident alſo in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
for it appears alſo in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
part of this Diſcourſe, That the
one thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
daies, in which it is ſaid in this
Scripture, That the holy Citie ſhould be
troden under foot, and that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſhould be in ſack-cloth, by reaſon
of the Gentiles, the ſpirituall Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
tyrannizing over them, is one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
two hundred and threeſcore yeares,
and did expire, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1645. as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by computing the time of the
Beaſt's continuance (as it ought to bee
computed) by the Scripture account:
And alſo, this one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and threeſcore yeares of the Beaſt's
continuance, appeares to be then expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
becauſe it is ſaid, That when the
Witneſſes had finiſhed their propheſie in
ſack-cloth, that then the Beaſt ſhould
make warre with them, and overcome
them. Now the Beaſt having made
warre againſt them, and overcome them,
and they being raiſed again, and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their feet, to the feare of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemies,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98732:111"/>
in the yeare, one thouſand ſix
hundred fourty and five. It is by this
evident, that that year, the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
two hundred and threeſcore yeares,
wherein the holy City, the Saints ſhould
be troden under feet by the Beaſt, did
expire. And now you Witneſſes in the
Parliament, and Parliamentary Armie,
and Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that all the combined power, both
of men and devils, which ſhall conſpire
againſt you, ſhall never be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt you; for you ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
under foot no more, the Beaſt ſhall
prevail over you no more; for the time
of his prevailing over you is expired,
and he muſt hence-forth be troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot himſelfe, and you muſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
prevail over him, and you muſt
reward great Babylon, as ſhe hath reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you; the Cup which ſhee hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
you muſt goe on to fill to her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe conſiderations, and from
theſe grounds, held forth in the Word
of Truth, the Scripture, and that part
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98732:111"/>
of it in this booke of the Revelation,
which Revelation God gave unto his
Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, to ſhew unto his
ſervants. Let all the Saints in <hi>England</hi>
be ſtrong, and of a good courage, and
feare not what man can doe unto them.
Let not the heart of any one Saint be
troubled, fearing that either Poperie,
Prelacie, or Presbytery ſhall recover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power in <hi>England,</hi> to Lord it over
Gods heritage, to tyrannize over the
Witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt, or to reſtrain
them from walking in that way, which
appears to them to be according to the
minde of God. But Saints, be you aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it ſhall never be, ſince you have a
Spirit of life from God put upon you;
and ſince <hi>England</hi> is fallen from Babylon,
and ſince the time of the Beaſt's tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
power over you, is expired, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
caſt off all unbeleeving thoughts,
and all diſtruſtfull feares of theſe things;
and be confident, That Jeſus Chriſt will
by you, goe on conquering, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
And what though a great Armie
ſhould be a preparing to overcome you,
as there was in <hi>July,</hi> one thouſand ſix
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98732:112"/>
hundred and fourty ſeven? Yet as then,
they were ſoon blaſted, ſo they ſhall be
for the future: For you have a Spirit
of life and courage from God put into
you; therefore men ſhall not prevaile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you. And you are no more a part
of Babylon, therefore you cannot be kept
in bondage, and the time of your being
troden under foot is expired: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though all the Malignants in this
Kingdome, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all thoſe
forraign Forces, that thoſe factours of
Rome, that are gone from <hi>England</hi> into
<hi>France,</hi> or elſe-where, can poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
were conjoyned together in one
body, and marching againſt you; yet
ſhould not your hearts be troubled, nor
be affraid, but be aſſured they ſhould be
overcome by you: And what though
you ſeem to be ſmall in number? You
know that God hath formerly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
others to ſtand for you, and can doe
ſo ſtill, if it be conſonant to his wiſdome
now alſo; but if it were not ſo, it were
an evil in you to diſtruſt his power, to
whom it is all one to ſave by few, or
by many; For victory commeth not from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98732:112"/>
the ſtrength of horſes, or the legs of men, but
from the Lord of hoſts.</p>
               <p>And therefore upon theſe grounds, let
all the Witneſſes of <hi>England,</hi> be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of overcomming all that ſhall riſe
up againſt them, by the ſtrength of the
Lord of hoaſts their God. And having
experience that God hath done thus for
them ever hitherto, ſince one thouſand ſix
hundred and fourty five, let them not be of
ſuch unworthy ſpirits, as to be diſtruſtfull
for the future.</p>

               <p>The laſt particular that I ſhall hence
obſerve, is, To ſtirre up the hearts of
Saints to joyfulneſſe and praiſes. O Saints
conſidering what God hath done for you,
ſeeing hee hath put a Spirit of life upon
you, and hath made you that lay dead to
ſtand upon your feet; And ſeeing that
<hi>England</hi> is fallen from myſticall Babylon;
and that now your enemy the Beaſt ſhall
have no more power over you, he that hath
troden you under feet a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98732:113"/>
and threeſcore yeares, ſhall tread you
under foot no more; and that now your
time of propheſying in ſack-cloth is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Put you now on, in ſtead of your
ſack-cloth, the garments of joy and praiſe,
and walk no longer ſadly, being delivered
out of the bondage of ſpiritual Aegypt, and
from the oppreſſion of your enemies; let
your hearts be affected herewith, and your
ſouls rejoyce in the apprehenſion of it. For
ſuppoſe that when you were under that
bondage, ſo that you were driven into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and your enemies hunted after you to
make a prey of you, and having taken
ſome of you, did impriſon ſome, and fine
others, and baniſh others, and pillory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
if one ſhould then have come into
your meetings, and told you as an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth, That within one moneth your
enemies ſhould be brought down, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
no longer over you, but you ſhould
be ſet at liberty to worſhip the Lord Jeſus,
in that way which he ſhould diſcover to
you, to be moſt agreeable to his owne
minde. How would your ſpirits at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
hereof, have been filled with
joy? Your joy would have been ſuch, as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98732:113"/>
would have been beyond expreſſion. O
let your joy be now no leſſe, ſince this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
done; and eſpecially having aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that you ſhall be brought under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
no more: but let your hearts leap and
ſing for joy! And in your joy let the high
praiſes of God be in your mouths, and let
him be exalted in your ſpirits. O be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in offering up the Sacrifices of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
in the ſecrets of your ſpirits unto your
God, that hath done ſuch things for you!
<hi>I will extoll thee, O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) for
thou haſt lifted me up, and haſt not made my
foes to rejoyce over me.</hi> This is now the
caſe of all the Saints in <hi>England.</hi> The Lord
hath lifted them up, and doth not ſuffer
their foes to rejoyce over them. O that
with that ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they might
extoll the Lord their God in it, and for it;
for <hi>Praiſe is comely,</hi> ſaith that holy man,
<hi>For the upright</hi> (Pſal. 33. 1.) <hi>And it is a
good thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to give thankes unto
the Lord, and to ſing praiſes unto the name of
the moſt High, and to ſhew forth his loving
kindeneſſe in the morning, and his faithfulneſſe
in the nights,</hi> Pſal. 92. 1, 2. Let Saints there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be much in this comely, good and
pleaſant worke of praiſe; and improve all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98732:114"/>
opportunities to exerciſe themſelves in this
worke. Let them ſing praiſes unto the
moſt High in the morning, and ſhew forth
his loving kindeneſſe and faithfulneſſe in
the nights. Though others forget God,
and he is not in all their thoughts, and
they doe not remember the great things he
doth for his people, yet let him be much in
the thoughts of his Saints, yea much in
their thoughts to praiſe him for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
And let them ſay within themſelves;
<hi>Bleſſe the LORD, ô my ſoul, and forget not
all his benefits.</hi> O let them not forget to
praiſe him for what he did for them, in
the year, 1645. but let them regiſter in
their hearts, the particular acts of the great
things he then did for them: and let them
not forget, what hee did doe for them in
<hi>July</hi> 1647. Let them not ſuffer theſe things
to ſlip out of their minde, but let them call
to minde how frequent and importunate
they were with God in praier, for to obtain
theſe mercies for themſelves, and for the
Kingdom: and having now attained them,
let them be as frequent, and as ready to
praiſe him, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>in the day
of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou ſhalt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. O now, you that called
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98732:114"/>
upon God in the day of trouble, and were
heard: be you much in that heavenly and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
work of glorifying God! Let all that
love the Lord in <hi>England,</hi> remember that it is
the duty, as well as the priviledge of thoſe
that have got the victory over the Beaſt, to
ſing a ſong of praiſes, unto him that fits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever
and ever, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 3. And ſince they are the
perſons, that have now got the victory over
the Beast: Let them with enlarged hearts,
ſing that new ſong of praiſe, and let not
doubtfull, nor diſtruſtfull thoughts of the
power and faithfulnes of God for the future
in the leaſt meaſure ſad their ſpirits, or keep
back their praiſes: but let the voice of joy
and praiſe be heard in the tabernacles of the
righteous in <hi>England:</hi> for the right hand of
the Lord is exalted, the right hand of the
Lord hath done valiantly for them, and they
ſhall not die but live, and declare
the works of the LORD,

            <head>The Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>IT being ſo, that (ſince my finiſhing of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
there are ſome further mutations in theſe
Kingdomes, which may ſeem to give to ſome ſome
ground to queſtion that which I have here aſſerted,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Witneſſes are ſlain by the Beaſt, and
that (according to this Propheſie) after they had lain
dead three years and an half, they are riſen and doe
ſtand upon their feet: If this be ſo, may ſome one ſay,
then how cometh it to paſſe, that there is ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that the enemies of the Saints ſhall again
get ground of them, and bring them again into a low
condition? For <hi>Inchiquin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
in <hi>Wales,</hi> and a great party in <hi>Scotland</hi> doe
ſeem to act afreſh for the Beaſt, and doe expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
againſt the Witneſſes under the titles of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
and Sectaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the Witneſſes were
indeed ſlain and raiſed, then undoubtedly they ſhould
indeed go on conquering and overcoming the Beaſt,
and the Beaſt ſhould no more recover power over
them, to put them into a diſtreſſed condition; for
then the daies of their propheſying in ſack-cloth, in
ſad and ſable garments is expired: But how can it
be ſaid to be ſo, ſince the Beaſt ſeems in a probable
way of recovering power over them again?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98732:115"/>
Now that this ſeeming ground of fear may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
I ſhall lay down theſe three conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That though the Beaſt ſhall no more prevail
over the Witneſſes to bring them down, yet he may
and muſt endeavour to oppoſe the Witneſſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to make war againſt them that they may bring
him downe: for now that the time of his prevalencie
over the Saints is expired, he muſt not long continue
in his preſent ſtation; but as he ſhall not goe higher,
ſo he ſhall go lower, yea he ſhall come down wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and how ſhall that be but by his oppoſing the
Saints, who ſhall be as <hi>a burden ſome ſtone, and
all that burden themſelves with it ſhall be
cut in peeces?</hi> And therefore the more we ſee that
that the accomplices of the Beaſt do endeavour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Saints, the nearer we may conclude that hee
and they are to their ruine; and therefore their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and ſtirrings ſhould be rather encouragements
then diſcouragements unto the Saints. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Witneſſes are indeed ſlain and
riſen, and do ſtand upon their feet, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable,
becauſe (as appeares by the fore-going
Diſcourſe) this propheſie of the ſlaying of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and of their riſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in every particular
<hi>iota</hi> and tittle of it moſt exactly accompliſhed, I will
not here recapitulate any of the particulars, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Reader to the fore-going Diſcourſe, but ſhall
here only deſire the Reader to conſider of this one in
<pb facs="tcp:98732:116"/>
a more eſpeciall manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That the holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
declares, that the falling of a tenth part of the
City ſhould immediately follow the Witneſſes, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their feet, and be in the <hi>ſame hour</hi> with it
as an effect of it. Now that a tenth part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(particularly the Kingdom of <hi>England)</hi> is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from the myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is to ſay, from
being a place of bondage to the Saints is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and therefore it is undeniable, That the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are ſlain and riſen.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is no wonder that the Witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raiſed, and having a ſpirit of life from God put
upon them, that the Beaſt doth endeavour to oppoſe
them; for that ſpirit of vigour and courage that is
put upon them, is to be exerciſed and actuated, and
they muſt goe on in it to give that ſcarlet Whore
bloud to drink, and to reward her, as ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
them, and of the cup which ſhe hath filled to
them to fill to her double: for the Saints are thoſe
Armies in heaven, which are ſaid to <hi>follow him
that is faithfull and true, and in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
doth judge, and make war, who is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a veſture dipt in bloud, and whoſe
name is called the Word of God, when he
cometh to make a final end of the Beaſt, and
the falſe prophet, and them that worſhip his
image, and to caſt them a live into a lake of
fire burning with brimſtone.</hi> Now that the
<pb facs="tcp:98732:116"/>
Saints may be actuall inſtruments, not only of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to ruine the Beaſt, but of the totall ruining of
the Beaſt: it is no wonder that he endeavours again
to recover ſtrength againſt them; and therefore when
<hi>the Dragon and his Angels</hi> (the Beaſt and his
imps) <hi>do fight againſt Michael and his Angels</hi>
(Jeſus Chriſt and his Saints) <hi>it is ſaid that they
prevailed not</hi> (that is after the Witneſſes were
riſen to oppoſe the Saints) <hi>but were caſt out,</hi> and
that was the ſhorteſt way they could take to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and to be caſt out, even their oppoſing Jeſus
Chriſt, and his Saints, which have a ſpirit of life
from God put upon them. Thus much for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that doubt.</p>
            <p>Now that I may not be miſtaken, I ſhall here adde
a caution, and ſo conclude: It is this,</p>
            <p>I deſire it may be obſerved, That though I have
particularly (in this Diſcourſe) mentioned the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and the Army (having good ground ſo to do
from what they have done, and have beene inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of already) encouraging them to go on in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Beaſt, and his adherents, and defending
the Witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt, aſſuring them of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in their undertakings, yet it is upon no other
grounds, then as they ſhall ſo go on; but if they ſhall
turn aſide, and aim more at corrupt and ſelf ends
then at the promoting of juſtice and righteouſneſſe,
then at the publike good of the Kingdom, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements
<pb facs="tcp:98732:117"/>
ſhall come for the Saints, and they being
delivered from the rage of the Beaſt, ſhall be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
wholly from his fury ſome other way, and by ſome
other means, when corrupt perſons may periſh in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of corrupt deſigns, but I hope (and have
perſwaſions of) better things of thoſe Worthies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that as God hath begun, ſo he will go on to grant
them the honour, and the happineſſe ſtill to remaine
glorious inſtruments in his hand, of ſetting up his
King upon his holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſubjecting theſe
Nations unto his royall Scepter, that judgement may
run down among us as water, and righteouſneſſe as
a mighty ſtream.</p>
