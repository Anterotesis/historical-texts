            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lambe Christ openeth the vij. seales of the booke of the most hidden myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, for the vij. ages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian church. In the meane season are the true seruantes of God sealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, solaced in their troubles, and rel√©eued in their sorowes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the great violence of the truthes aduersaries.</p>
                  <p>In the viij. and ix. Chapters, the vij. Angels blowe their trumpettes. Signifying the preachers to shewe foorth their messages appoynted of God for the vij. ages of the churche, many wonderfull plages folowing in the people for their vnbel√©eues sake, they obstinately resisting it, or els vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefully receiuing it.</p>
                  <p>In the tenth Chapter commeth the mightie Angell from heauen with a booke in his hand all open, and Iohn deuoureth the same. Which betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the earnest preachers of this latter age of the church, wherein the true seruauntes of God shall gr√©edily receiue and also digest the scriptures. Take thys for a br√©efe sum of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:689:156"/>
spoken in the other volum, the residue shall follow hereafter in course.</p>
                  <p>In the mergent of that first parte or volume, put I many allegacions both of the scriptures and doctors<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And there vnto was I first prouoked by this saying of Sainct Hierome in a certayne Epistle of his, ad Paulinum monachum. The Apocalips of Sainct Iohn (sayeth he) hath so many myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as it hath wordes, or for euerie word a mysterie whither ye will.</p>
                  <p>I mynded also thereby, my labours to ease the readers for search of the places, and to signify vnto them that I dyd nothing therin without auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And vndoubtedly the gatheryng of those places was so laborious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as the making of the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, which neuerthelesse I thought well bestowed for the comfort of my bretheren.</p>
                  <p>But two cruell enimyes haue my iust labours had in that behalfe, of whome the one hath them falsifyed, the other blasph√©emed. Which hath caused me to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> out in all that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:689:156"/>
h√©ere foloweth. The Printers are the fyrst, whose headie hast, negligence, and couetousnesse commonly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all bookes. These haue both dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plased them and also chaunged theyr numbers to the truthes derogacion, what though they had at their hands ij. learned correctours which tooke all paynes possible to preserue them.</p>
                  <p>The other is Momus or Zoylus, yea rather one whiche playeth both partes vnder the cloake of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. This cruell carper and malicious quarreller leaueth no mans worke vnrebuked, minister it neuer so much godlinesse. But lyke as rust, mothes, maggottes, cankers, catterpyllers, with other vyle vermyne corrupteth all that is to the vse of man, so doeth this enimy, to distroy both name and worke, only for the auauncement of his owne precious person.</p>
                  <p>His working tooles are suche vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sophismes, problemes, ele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ches, corolaries, quydities, subtylties, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde intentions, intrincycall moods, wyth other prodygious sorceryes,
<pb facs="tcp:689:157"/>
whom he sometime sucked out of hys mothers brestes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuersitie. These hath he not yet all, as vnsauerie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles euometed for Christ, diffyning rather with Aristotle than with Paul in his dayly disputations.</p>
                  <p>Of this ryall Rabi is Peter iudged a foole, and Iohn an vnlearned Idiote. Yet shall his reader finde small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at his hande, vnlesse he take an heape of barbarous tearmes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowed togither sentences for matters of excelent learning. But surely Iohn will one day come from Ephesus to visite this proude Diotrephes, &amp; shew him of his arrogant brags to his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, vnlesse he leaue of in tyme. All Aristotles prouision shal not help hym.</p>
                  <p>Sathan vpon the pynnacle of the Temple neuer bestowed his alleged scripture more peruersely, than thys Momus interpreted certayne of my allegacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, nor yet farther from their right vnderstanding: But I forgiue it him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this forewarning for this time, thoughe it b√©e not the fyrst lewde

                     </gap>e so leaue his quareling. My second allegation vpon the Preface .1. Cor. 6 is not set there to authorise the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips, as he most falsly and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my meaning hath interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, but affirmeth that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bel√©euers are Christs members which ought of necessitie by the holy ghostes appointment to heare and to read the wordes of the sayde Booke. For I know that the epistle vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians was written of Paule ten yeares at the least before Saint Iohns Apocalips. No lesse is he than a false Prophet that resisteth Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rebuking Babilon for hir wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,</p>
                  <p>To much it were to answere his other quarellings, and to tedious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> christian readers, and therfore I passe them ouer least I shoulde be to plenteous in aunsweringe a foole according to hys foolishnesse. Thus by these cruell handelynges of these two vngratious enemies, haue I iust occasion to leaue out the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

in the margent, obseruing this wholsome counsell of Christ concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such as they be. Geue not that is holy vnto Dogs, nor yet that is precious vnto swine. For the one of his churlish nature teareth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth, the other like a swine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it vnder his filthy f√©ete.

                           <p n="1">1 And there happened at that time (sayeth sainct Iohn) a great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle in Heauen. In the Churche is euermore variaunce and strife w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ceasinge betwixt the spirite and the flesh, the good and the bad, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and the vnfaithfull. None o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this battayle but a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, a diuersity in fayth, study, opinion, wyll, and worke, aboute the lawes or commaundements of God, and also about the lawes and trady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of men. This battaile is waigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie in cause, multitude and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The cause thereof is Christe, the Gospell, faith, rightuousnesse, mans health, Gods high honour, and such other lyke on the one partie. Upon the other party the cause is, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, hipocrisie, lyes, Idolatrye, aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, pryde, cruelty, fylthynesse, with al such other. So great is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that none is founde out of it. None is there but are in this army.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:689:193"/>
Eyther they are good or bad, faithfull or vnfaithfull, rightuous or vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. The rightuous are of the host of Michaell, the vnrightuous are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the dragons side. Continued hath this battayle from the firste begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, and so shall styll to the latter ende. Yea, though the dragon be bound or tyed vp vnder the seauenth seale opening, that he rage not then as he hath done afore. Yet shall the spirit of wickednes, and a mind to do mischief, raigne inwardly styl in his members, for Sathan can be but a Sathan, and a Diuill a Diuill.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Michaell and his Angels fought valyauntly with the dragon. Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are they whiche hath done on Christ after the minde of Paule, and spirituall is their armoure. Theyr gyrding is verytie, their brest plate rightuousnesse, their shielde a sure faith, their wepon the word of God, their helmet the hope of health, and for stedfastnesse of their f√©ete, their shooinge the gospel. By interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is Michaell to say, who is as
<pb facs="tcp:689:194"/>
God? or who is like vnto god? And he betokneth the constant minister &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere teachers of the Gospell. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Michael are al they that in a sure faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fesseth the eternall mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of God, and that none is lyke vnto hym. Contrarywise the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Angels are the hipocrits, lying prophets, and erronius teachers.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 These fight with the Dragon, and the Dragon and his Angelles with them. For he that is not with Christe, is against hym. With the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous is Michael.

The wicked sort haue the Diuil and his chaplaines to fight for them, the rightuous haue Michael and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The wicked fighteth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> errours &amp; lyes, the rightuous with the only verity of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 As vengeable &amp; as fierce as they are, yet preuaile they not, neither is their place found any more in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>.

I suppose nothing more manifest, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we haue eies &amp; will not s√©e. Are not now in may parts of Germany, &amp; in England also the Popes pardons layed aside?

To s√©e this also with such like put in execucion, the Bishoppes haue authoritie euery moneth in the yeare if they list, to call a cession, to hange and burne at theyr pleasure. And this is ratyfied and confirmed by acte of Parliament to stande the more in effect. If this be no healing of Antichristes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded head, neuer is lyke to be any.

Alas how is the people abused? None other doo they but mock Christen Princes with flattery, that giue them olde po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish titles and blasphemous names of antichrist.

                  <p>FOr so muche as this Image of both churchs, or exposition vpon S. Iohns Apocalipsis, seemed vnto me (as it came vnto the printing) to be farre to much for one volume. I thought to deuide it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall porcions into three smal bookes, as I haue now done in deede. Of whom the firste contayneth x. Chapter, the second vii. &amp; the third v. onely, which maketh out the whole number of the xxii. Some peraduenture wil maruel, that the smaller nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapters should comprehend so much of that comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie as the greater number. But if they marke in the text, the aboundinge of miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries euermore as the matter thereof aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, they will soone leaue their marueiling. The nature of this reuelation is, the further it goeth, the more wonders it sheweth &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth vnto hym that after praier shal in faith reade it and deserne it. Neuer therin are the principles well perceiued, till the conclusion thervpon folowinge doth playnely with the other scriptures conferred, declare them.</p>
                  <p>In these v. last chapters are the two chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (wherevpon resteth the whole argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of this booke) fully by all dew circumstaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces described, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> turned ouer into a moste fearefull and terrible destruction, vnder title of the olde whorish Babilon, the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning a moste glorious rayse, vnder the name of the holy new Hierusalem.</p>

In the .xix. Chapter is that reyoice of elect number ouer the tirryble iudgments of that whore much more highly discribed, the deth of Christes holy witnesses most plentyously reuenged, and how the Angel in no case will of Iohn be worshiped.</p>
                  <p>In the .xx. Chapter is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dragon tied vp for a thousand years, the chosen sort reigning w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ.

The dead after that ariseth and receiueth iudgement.</p>
                  <p>In the xxi. Chapter is the church of the chosen or the new Hierusalem prepared to to hir spouse. That citie commeth downe from heauen, and is of the holy ghoste here, after most wonderfull circumstaunces in hir right proportion described.</p>
                  <p>In the xxii. Chapter, the riuer of lyuinge waters proceedeth from the throne of God.</p>

But now they are counted among the children of god, and haue their porcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saincts. Here might much be spoken of fayth, which diuersly wrought in Abel, Seth, and Enoch for the fyrst age. In Noe, Abraham, Moyses, Dauid, Helias, and other in their ages. In Peter, Iohn, &amp; Iames, with all the other Apostles &amp; syncere preachers since Christes time. But let that suffise in this behalf, that S. Paul hath written in the .xi.

                           <p n="6">6 In that the first foundacion is said here to be of a Iaspar or Dyamond, (Whose colour is grene) is signified that the faythe of the fyrste fathers is not yet withered awaye.

                           <p n="1">1 Consequently (saith the Angel vnto Iohn) the xii. gates or openinges into this citie, were twelue fayre pearls, For dilectable and precious is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the gospell, whereby men doe enter into the kingdome of God on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery side, or in euery quarter &amp; age of the world.</p>

                           <p n="2">2 That if any of them shall presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously take vpon him to adde any thing thervnto, in purpose to peruert the truth, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghostes meaning, as Carpocras, Hebion, Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, and other antichristes hath done with the other scriptures.</p>

For than should Saynt Augustyne, saint Hierome, Isydorus, Beda, Rabanus, &amp; dyuers other great pillars of the church be vnder these plages, for doeing that charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. So should also the doctrine of this booke be against it self in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xiii. chapter where as libertie is giuen to hym that hath writ, to count the number of the beast, &amp; in other places els. But this is here spoken from them that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the text to mayntaine their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous lyes for aduauntage, or that s√©eketh to blemish the right sence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, least men should behold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in their right colours, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked papists hath don euer since their begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ning, so drown<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the authoritie &amp; maiestie thereof.</p>

            <head>A conclusion of the vvhole vvorke.</head>
            <p>HEre hast thou good christian reader, to thy soules consolation, from the eternall Trinitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, the Sonne &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, three distincte persons in one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting godhead, the vniuersall estate of the church from Christes ascencion to the ende of the world, in wonderfull mysteries discry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; directed vnto thee of him, by the most holy Apostle and Euangelist Saint Iohn. Wherein it is fully by all due circumstances manifested of the sayde holy Ghost, what the innocent Christian church is, with all hir iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications &amp; blessings, to the singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of the Lords true electes, and what the proude Synagoge of Antichrist is, with hyr filthy superstitions and plagues, to their fore warning also. This is specially done here of the sayde holy ghost, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no true beleuer should professe him selfe a citizen of this wretched world with Cain, Nemroth, &amp; other repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate vessels, at the execrable doctrine of men, but at the pure voyce of God with Abell and Abraham, to seeke for that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly heritage which is purchased for them in Christes bloud. Marke heere the condition of Iohn being in most paynefull exile, for he in miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie through all this booke representeth euery godly beleuer. By this shall ye well knowe in this reuelation the one church from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the one is mayntayned by the onely preaching of Gods pure worde, the other by all kyndes of Iewishe ceremonyes and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
<pb facs="tcp:689:454" rendition="simple:additions"/>
superstitions. And by this they also differ, that Christ wold haue all of loue, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist of tyrannous constraint, as euidently appeareth in Mahomete and the Pope. For that only cause are many necessary thynges here written in mysterie, that they should bee hid from the worldly wyse Hypocrites, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iust or Gods meeke spirited seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts, should aske them of their Lorde in fayth and prayer. In the which dayly prayer, is that most worthy minister of God, Kyng Henry the eight afore all other to th√©e remembred, which hath so sore wounded the beast, that he may before his departure, or Prynce Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde after him, throw all his supersticions into the bottomlesse lake agayne (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whence they haue commen) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comforte of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The grace and peace dyrected from God the Father &amp; his Son Iesus Christ, with the holy Ghost, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latyon be vnto all them which vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly loue hys veritie. Amen.</p>
