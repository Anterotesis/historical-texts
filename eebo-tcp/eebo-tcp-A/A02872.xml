            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But two cruell enimyes haue my iust labours had in that behalfe, of whome the one hath them falsifyed, the other blasphéemed. Which hath caused me to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out in all that

héere foloweth. The Printers are the fyrst, whose headie hast, negligence, and couetousnesse commonly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all bookes. These haue both dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plased them and also chaunged theyr numbers to the truthes derogacion, what though they had at their hands ij. learned correctours which tooke all paynes possible to preserue them.</p>
                  <p>The other is Momus or Zoylus, yea rather one whiche playeth both partes vnder the cloake of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. This cruell carper and malicious quarreller leaueth no mans worke vnrebuked, minister it neuer so much godlinesse. But lyke as rust, mothes, maggottes, cankers, catterpyllers, with other vyle vermyne corrupteth all that is to the vse of man, so doeth this enimy, to distroy both name and worke, only for the auauncement of his owne precious person.</p>
                  <p>His working tooles are suche vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sophismes, problemes, ele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, corolaries, quydities, subtylties, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde intentions, intrincycall moods, wyth other prodygious sorceryes,

whom he sometime sucked out of hys mothers brestes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuersitie. These hath he not yet all, as vnsauerie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles euometed for Christ, diffyning rather with Aristotle than with Paul in his dayly disputations.</p>
                  <p>Of this ryall Rabi is Peter iudged a foole, and Iohn an vnlearned Idiote. Yet shall his reader finde small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at his hande, vnlesse he take an heape of barbarous tearmes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowed togither sentences for matters of excelent learning. But surely Iohn will one day come from Ephesus to visite this proude Diotrephes, &amp; shew him of his arrogant brags to his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, vnlesse he leaue of in tyme. All Aristotles prouision shal not help hym.</p>
                  <p>Sathan vpon the pynnacle of the Temple neuer bestowed his alleged scripture more peruersely, than thys Momus interpreted certayne of my allegacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor yet farther from their right vnderstanding: But I forgiue it him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this forewarning for this time, thoughe it bée not the fyrst lewde

Cor. 6 is not set there to authorise the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips, as he most falsly and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my meaning hath interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, but affirmeth that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian beléeuers are Christs members which ought of necessitie by the holy ghostes appointment to heare and to read the wordes of the sayde Booke. For I know that the epistle vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians was written of Paule ten yeares at the least before Saint Iohns Apocalips. No lesse is he than a false Prophet that resisteth Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rebuking Babilon for hir wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,</p>
                  <p>To much it were to answere his other quarellings, and to tedious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> christian readers, and therfore I passe them ouer least I shoulde be to plenteous in aunsweringe a foole according to hys foolishnesse.

So great is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that none is founde out of it. None is there but are in this army.

Eyther they are good or bad, faithfull or vnfaithfull, rightuous or vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.

Yea, though the dragon be bound or tyed vp vnder the seauenth seale opening, that he rage not then as he hath done afore. Yet shall the spirit of wickednes, and a mind to do mischief, raigne inwardly styl in his members, for Sathan can be but a Sathan, and a Diuill a Diuill.</p>

                           <p n="3">3 These fight with the Dragon, and the Dragon and his Angelles with them. For he that is not with Christe, is against hym.

Whom some wryters suppose méete to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .vii. heads of this beaste. But I finde an other thing in it, the body of these .vii heads being but one, &amp; stil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing so. For though all were at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time vnder hir, yet is it not so now, &amp; yet stil remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this beast. Therefore I doo take it for one vniuersall Antichrist (as I did afore) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in him so well Mahomet as the Pope, so wel the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tyrant as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stil hipocrite, &amp; all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wickedly worketh ar of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same body. The .vii. heads of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beast, may so wel be his presumptuous doings for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .vij ages of the church, as any thing els, &amp; yet no preiudice done to that hath ben said afore What should ayle this wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded head here, not to signifie his supremite suppressed, his vsurped authoritie &amp; power diminished, &amp; his whole prodigious occupying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this latter age of the church?

I suppose nothing more manifest, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we haue eies &amp; will not sée. Are not now in may parts of Germany, &amp; in England also the Popes pardons layed aside? His power put downe, his name abolished, his Purgatorye, pilgrimages, &amp; other peltries vtterly exiled? and so lyke to be within short space in other regions also. If this be not a deadly wounding of one of the beastes heads, I think there is none. If this be not an apparent likelihood of his fall, there is none to be looked for.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 But the healing againe of this mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall wound is lyke to mar all, &amp; make the last errour worse than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first. In many places where as the Gospell hath béene preached, the bishoppe of Rome deposed, sectes, shrynes, &amp; sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries destroyed, monasteries, prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and fryers turned ouer, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still theyr poyson w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those same instrumentes wherewith they haue wrought all mischiefe.

Nothing is brought as yet to Christes institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; sincere or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but all remaineth still as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antichristes left it. Nothing is tryed by gods word but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of fathers. Now passeth all vnder theyr title. Though the olde bishops of Rome were of late yeares proued Antichristes, and their names raced out of our bookes, yet must they thus properly for old acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be called still our Fathers. If it were naught afore I thinck it is now much worse, for nowe are they become laudable cerimonies wheras before time they were but cerimonies alone. Now are they become necessary rites, godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And he that disobeieth them shall not onely be iudged a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and worthy to be hanged by their newe forged lawes, but also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a traytour against his king, though he neuer in his lyfe hindred, but rather to his power hath furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the common wealth. To sée this also with such like put in execucion, the Bishoppes haue authoritie euery moneth in the yeare if they list, to call a cession, to hange and burne at theyr pleasure. And this is ratyfied and confirmed by acte of Parliament to stande the more in effect. If this be no healing of Antichristes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded head, neuer is lyke to be any. Whan men shall defende frée wyll, &amp; allow theyr popish masse to be a sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice satisffactory for the quick and the dead, labour they any other (thincks you) than the healing of this wound?

No lesse also dooth he that setteth men to open pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at Pauls crosse, for holy water making, for processio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sensing, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other Popetish gauds, constrayning them to promise the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauncement of the old fayth of holy church by such fantastical fopperyes, as Bonner bishoppe of London dyd now of late, to the lawhinge game &amp; wonderment of all the world. Alas how is the people abused? None other doo they but mock Christen Princes with flattery, that giue them olde po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish titles and blasphemous names of antichrist. As to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten kinges and defenders of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like faith, meaning the Popes old tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicions, to heale the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaste. This is surely none other, but with the sayde beast to receiue authoritie, seate and power of sathan. Lette them therefore take héede least they be founde the same antichristes that they haue condemned, and so throwe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues double vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same plage.

Neither were they any masse saiers, soule singers, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession goers, but as was S.

But after the donation of Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine and other plentuous almses commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto their handes for the soccoure of the poore, they became al confessers, and toke them to their ease at home. Then was labour verye tedious vnto them preaching veri troublous &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                  <p>FOr so muche as this Image of both churchs, or exposition vpon S. Iohns Apocalipsis, seemed vnto me (as it came vnto the printing) to be farre to much for one volume. I thought to deuide it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall porcions into three smal bookes, as I haue now done in deede. Of whom the firste contayneth x. Chapter, the second vii. &amp; the third v. onely, which maketh out the whole number of the xxii. Some peraduenture wil maruel, that the smaller nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapters should comprehend so much of that comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie as the greater number. But if they marke in the text, the aboundinge of miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries euermore as the matter thereof aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, they will soone leaue their marueiling. The nature of this reuelation is, the further it goeth, the more wonders it sheweth &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth vnto hym that after praier shal in faith reade it and deserne it. Neuer therin are the principles well perceiued, till the conclusion thervpon folowinge doth playnely with the other scriptures conferred, declare them.</p>
                  <p>In these v. last chapters are the two chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (wherevpon resteth the whole argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this booke) fully by all dew circumstaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces described, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turned ouer into a moste fearefull and terrible destruction, vnder title of the olde whorish Babilon, the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning a moste glorious rayse, vnder the name of the holy new Hierusalem.</p>

                  <p>In the xxi. Chapter is the church of the chosen or the new Hierusalem prepared to to hir spouse. That citie commeth downe from heauen, and is of the holy ghoste here, after most wonderfull circumstaunces in hir right proportion described.</p>

For neuer shal they come to the seconde resurrection which is vnto the lyfe euerlasting, that will not ryse by repentaunce vnto a new lyfe in hym, which is both resurrection and lyfe.</p>

            <head>A conclusion of the vvhole vvorke.</head>
            <p>HEre hast thou good christian reader, to thy soules consolation, from the eternall Trinitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, the Sonne &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, three distincte persons in one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting godhead, the vniuersall estate of the church from Christes ascencion to the ende of the world, in wonderfull mysteries discry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; directed vnto thee of him, by the most holy Apostle and Euangelist Saint Iohn. Wherein it is fully by all due circumstances manifested of the sayde holy Ghost, what the innocent Christian church is, with all hir iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications &amp; blessings, to the singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of the Lords true electes, and what the proude Synagoge of Antichrist is, with hyr filthy superstitions and plagues, to their fore warning also. This is specially done here of the sayde holy ghost, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no true beleuer should professe him selfe a citizen of this wretched world with Cain, Nemroth, &amp; other repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate vessels, at the execrable doctrine of men, but at the pure voyce of God with Abell and Abraham, to seeke for that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly heritage which is purchased for them in Christes bloud. Marke heere the condition of Iohn being in most paynefull exile, for he in miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie through all this booke representeth euery godly beleuer. By this shall ye well knowe in this reuelation the one church from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the one is mayntayned by the onely preaching of Gods pure worde, the other by all kyndes of Iewishe ceremonyes and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
<pb facs="tcp:689:454" rendition="simple:additions"/>
superstitions. And by this they also differ, that Christ wold haue all of loue, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist of tyrannous constraint, as euidently appeareth in Mahomete and the Pope. For that only cause are many necessary thynges here written in mysterie, that they should bee hid from the worldly wyse Hypocrites, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iust or Gods meeke spirited seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, should aske them of their Lorde in fayth and prayer. In the which dayly prayer, is that most worthy minister of God, Kyng Henry the eight afore all other to thée remembred, which hath so sore wounded the beast, that he may before his departure, or Prynce Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde after him, throw all his supersticions into the bottomlesse lake agayne (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they haue commen) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comforte of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The grace and peace dyrected from God the Father &amp; his Son Iesus Christ, with the holy Ghost, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latyon be vnto all them which vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly loue hys veritie. Amen.</p>
