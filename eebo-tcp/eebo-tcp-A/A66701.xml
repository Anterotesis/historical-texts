         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In like manner, both Body and Soul lending their furtherance to ſin, being alike guilty, are inſeparably puniſhed together for ever.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although they are many in number, yet they are reduced principally to theſe ſeven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Navigable River, by which there may be continual concourſe of Merchants, as may be ſeen by <hi>Venice, Amſterdam, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and our Metropolitan City of <hi>London,</hi> which as it is thought had it not been for the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> would not have gone on ſo forward in the rebuilding, ſince that terrible conflagration thereof by fire, which may be evidenced in that the buildings towards the River ſide were the firſt begun, and are the forwardeſt in finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Palace of the Prince; for where the Court is, there will be continually ſtore of Nobility and Gentry, which enriches Tradesmen by ſelling commodities to them; one inſtance whereof we have by <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which is grown from a mean Village
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37944:10"/>
to a very populous City, only by the Kings Court.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reſidence of the Nobility, by whom beautiful Buildings and ſtately Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are raiſed to the great adornment thereof, as may be ſeen in the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> where their Nobles and Gentry conſtantly reſide, as ours do in Towns and Villages.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Seat or Tribunal of Juſtice, which invites Lawyers and their Clients thither in abundance, to the great enriching thereof, as may be evidenced by the Parliamentary Cities of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spiers</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Univerſities, or publick Schools of Learning, which draw thither the Sons of ſeveral Noble perſons and Gentlemen from the adjoyning Counties, to the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and profit thereof, as <hi>Paris</hi> well knoweth, <hi>Oxford, Collen,</hi> and ſeveral other places.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Immunities from Taxes and Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which cauſe many perſons to come and inhabit in ſuch places, their Income being thereby greateſt, and their Priviledges moſt, as in <hi>Naples, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt deſolate by a Plague, were again very ſuddenly peopl'd, by granting Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to all Comers.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The laſt, but not the leaſt, is opinion of Sanctity, as was evidenced in former times bp the City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to which Pilgrims from all places come to viſit the Tomb of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was there enſhrined, as witneſſeth <hi>Chaucer.</hi>

            <p>This Chamber (they ſay) was the ſame wherein the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was ſaluted by the Angel, with thoſe joyful tidings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our Saviour, being then at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and was after the Virgins death had in great Reverence by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, where it remained untouched till all <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was ſubdued by the Turks and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens, <hi>Anno</hi> 1291. then was it moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly tranſported into <hi>Sclavonia;</hi> but that place being unworthy of the Virgins divine preſence, it was by the Angels car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over into the Sea-coſt of <hi>Italy. An.</hi> 1294. but that place proving as bad as the other, being infected with Thieves and Pirats, the Angels removed it to the little Village of <hi>Loretto,</hi> where her miracles being quickly divulged, drew thither a great concourſe of People, inſomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> built over this chamber a moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, whither Pilgrims from all places reſort to this day, to the great enriching thereof, which by this means it is now from a poor Village grown to be a wealthy City.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Several men are of ſeveral minds Some aſcribe it to the Moon, who by her approaching to the South, doth by her beams and influences make warm the Sea, whence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37944:15"/>
the riſing &amp; exhalations do proceed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo ſwelling to empty it ſelf, it floweth to the Shores and Havens; but deſcending to the Horizon and Wane, as her beams by little and little diminiſh, the waters do fall and abate, which cauſeth her Eddy, or Ebb. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers impute it to God, and his Spirit moving upon the waters moveth the waters, which <hi>Iob</hi> expreſſes by the ſimilitude of fire under a pot, ſaying, <hi>It is God that maketh the Sea boil like a pot:</hi> which fire is taken to be partly in the ſaltneſs of the waters, which in the night ſhows like fire, and cauſes a moving in the ſame: Another reaſon is, for that the Earth hath more fire in it than water, which fire lieth hid in the ſubterraneous ſtones, and this fire doth partly cauſe the motion of the Sea, an Element of it ſelf liquid and active, and ſubject to motion; which thereto when once by this fire occaſioned, the precedent part is thruſt forward by the ſubſequent. Others again give this reaſon; that the Earth being round, and the Waters of themſelves liquid and moveable, when they have run their courſe as much as they can one way, then meeting with the other waters drawn by the ſame attraction from other places, they then return back again, but encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with that huge Mountain of the Sea, are beaten back again, and ſo by this means forced to continual motion.</p>

               <hi>An.</hi> This is affirmed to be ſo; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given therefore are theſe: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a body not ſo heavy: Secondly, it is obſerved by Saylors, that their Ships fly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37944:16"/>
faſter to the ſhoar than from it, whereof no reaſon can be given but the height of the Water above the Land. Thirdly, to ſuch as ſtand on the ſhore, the Sea ſeemeth to ſwell into the form of a mountain, till it putteth a bound to their ſight. But ſome then will lay how comes it to paſs that the Sea hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus over the Earth, doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm it? To which I anſwer, that muſt be attributed to him only <hi>who hath made the waters to ſtand on a heap, who hath ſet them a bound which they ſhall not paſs, nor turn again to cover the Earth.</hi>

               <hi>An.</hi> It is a cuſtom there, that when in the Churches the Goſpel is reading, the Nobility and Centry of that Country draw out their Swords, to ſignifie that they are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame if any dare oppugn it. The ſame reaſon queſtionleſs gave beginning to our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37944:18"/>
cuſtom of ſtanding up at the <hi>Creed,</hi> whereby we expreſs how prepared and reſolute we are to maintain it, although in the late times of Rebellion, ſome tender Conſciences hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to be a Relique of Popery, being more nice than wiſe, did undiſcreetly refuſe the ſame.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> That they love thoſe Husbands beſt, which beat them moſt, and think themſelves neither lov'd nor regarded, unleſs they be twice or thrice a day well-favourdly bang'd. To this purpoſe there is a ſtory reported of a German Shoemaker, who travelling into this Countrey, and here marrying a widow uſed her with all kindneſs that a woman could (as he thought) deſire, yet ſtill ſhe was diſcontented, and the more he ſought to pleaſe her, the further off was from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; at laſt learning where the fault was, and that his not beating her was the cauſe of her diſcontent, he took ſuch a vein in cudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling her ſides, that in the end he killed her.

The night growing on, he took a Tinder-box to light him a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; where ſtriking fire, a ſpark by chance flew into the Mortar, and catching hold of the Brimſtone and Salt-petre, with great violence blew up the ſtone. The Fryer gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which of his Ingredients it was that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this effect, made him an Iron pipe, crammed it with Sulpher and ſtones, and putting fire to it, ſaw with what great fury and noiſe it diſcharged its ſelf; then longing to put his invention in execution, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the ſame unto the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who having been often vanquiſhed by the <hi>Gensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe,</hi> and driven almoſt to a neceſſity of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, by the help of theſe Guns gave their enemies a notable overthrow.

               <hi>An. Cornelius Tacitus</hi> an approved Latin Hiſtorian, aſcribeth it to the Egyptians, his words are theſe: <hi>Primi per formas animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Egypti,</hi> &amp;c. The Egyptians firſt of all expreſſed the conceptions of the mind by the ſhapes of beaſts; and the moſt ancient monuments of mans memory, are ſeen graven in ſtones, and they ſay, that they are the firſt inventers of Letters; then the Phoenicians becauſe they were ſtrong at Sea, brought them into <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo they had the glory of that which they received from others; for there goeth a report, that <hi>Cadmus</hi> ſailing thither in a Phoenician ſhip, was the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Art amongſt the Greeks, when they were yet unexpert and rude. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that <hi>Cecrops</hi> the Athenian, or <hi>Livius</hi> the Theban, and <hi>Palamedes</hi> the Grecian, did find out ſixteen Characters at the time of the Trojan war, and that afterward <hi>Simonides</hi> added the reſt.

            <p>Qu. <hi>Who were the Inventers of Ships, and Shipping?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> No doubt but it came firſt from the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> which he had provided for the ſafety of him and his, in the univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; which Ark ſetling on the Mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> and there a long time remaining, gave the Phoenicians, a Sea-people, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern whereby they might make the waters paſſable. The Heathen writers which knew not <hi>Noah,</hi> attribute the Inventing of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to ſeveral perſons: <hi>Strabo</hi> to <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete: Diodorus Siculus,</hi> to <hi>Neptuno</hi> who was therefore called <hi>The God of the Sea: Tibullus</hi> the Poet referred it to the Tyrians, a famous flouriſhing Commonwealth among the Phoenicians, ſaying,</p>

            </q>
            <p>The Egyptians received this Invention from the Tyrians, and added much unto it; for whereas firſt the veſſels were either made of an hollow tree, or of ſundry boards joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, and covered with beaſts skins, (which kind of Veſſels are ſtill in uſe in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica)</hi> the Phoenicians brought them to ſtrength and form; but the Egyptians ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Decks unto them; they alſo invented the Galley of two banks on a ſide, which veſſels by length of time grew ſo large, that <hi>Ptolomy Philopater</hi> made one of no fewer than fifty banks of oars on one ſide, Large Ships

As for the Tacklings, the Boetians invented the Oar: <hi>Daedalus</hi> and his ſon <hi>Icarus,</hi> the Maſts and Sails, which gave the Poet occaſion to feign, that thoſe two made wings to their bodies, and fled out of <hi>Crete;</hi> and that <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſoaring too high, melted his wings, and was drowned: the truth indeed being, that preſuming too far on his new invention, he ran againſt a Rock, and ſo periſhed. For <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagines</hi> Ferry-boats or veſſels for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting of Horſe, we are indebted to the Salaminians; for Grapling-hooks to <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> for Anchors to to the Tuſcans; and for the Rudder, Helm, Stern, or Art of ſteering, to <hi>Typhis,</hi> who ſeeing that a Kite when ſhe flew, guided her whole body by her tayl, effected that in the devices of Art, which he had obſerved in the works of Nature. About the year 1300. one <hi>Flavio</hi> of <hi>Melphi</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> found out the Compaſs or <hi>Pyxis Nautica,</hi> conſiſting of eight Winds onely, the four principal, and four collateral; and not long after the people of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> perfected that excellent Invention; adding twenty four other ſubordinate Winds, or Points, ſo that now they are in all to the number of thirty two. By means of this excellent Inſtrument, and withal by the good ſucceſs of <hi>Columbus</hi> the Portugals Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Spaniards Weſt-ward, and the Engliſh North-wards, have made many a glorious and fortunate Expedition.</p>

of <hi>Babylon,</hi> An. Mundi 3350.

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Tradition tells us, that in former times there lived in that Town a certain Pedlar, who dreamed that if he came up to <hi>London,</hi> and ſtood on the Bridge there, he ſhould hear very joyful News, which he at firſt ſlighted; but afterwards his Dream being doubled and trebled unto him, he reſolved to try the Iſſue of it, and accordingly to <hi>London</hi> he came, and ſtood on the Bridge there for two or three days, but heard nothing which might give him any comfort in the leaſt, that the profit of his journy would be equal to his pains. At laſt it ſo happened, that a Shop-keeper there hard by, having noted his fruitleſs ſtanding, ſeeing that he neither ſold any Wares nor ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Alms, went to him, and demanded his buſineſs; to which the Pedlar made anſwer, that being a Country-man he dreamed adream that if he came up to <hi>London</hi> he ſhould hear News. And art thou (ſaid the Shop-keeper) ſuch a fool to take a Journey on ſuch a fooliſh Errand? why I tell thee this laſt night I drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that I was at <hi>Sopham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a place utterly unknown to me; where me-thought behind a Pedlars houſe, in a certain Orchard, and under a great Oak-tree, if I digged there I ſhould find a mighty Maſs of Treaſure: now

No, no, far be ſuch fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from me, therefore honeſt Country-man, I ſhall adviſe thee to make haſte home again, and not to ſpend thy precious time in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the event of an idle Dream. The Pedlar, who noted well his words, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the things he had ſaid to concenter in himſelf, glad of ſuch joyful News, went ſpeedily home, and digged under the Oak, where he found an infinite Maſs of Money, with part of which, the Church happening to fall down, he very ſumptuouſly re-edified the ſame; having his Statue therein to this day cut out in ſtone, with his pack at his back, and his dog at his heels; his memory being alſo preſerved by the ſame form of picture in moſt of the glaſs-windows in Taverns and Alehouſes of that Town to this day.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> A Magnificent Houſe, a ſumptuous Church, and a large pair of Stocks.

The Stocks are made of one entire Tree, and will by the legs, wriſts, and Thumbs, hold above forty ſeveral perſons, and are by the Inhabitants of that town ſhown to ſtrangers as a great rarity.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>In what place did the Ancients, commonly uſe to bury their dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Former Ages would not permit any dead Corps to be buried within the walls of their Cities. Thus we read that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a field wherein to bury his dead; and we finde in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke,</hi> that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Naims</hi> ſon was <hi>carried out to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:37944:35"/>
This inſtance alſo we find to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Athenians, Corinthians and other of the Graecians. Amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans it was the faſhion to burn the bodies of the dead within their City, which cuſtom continued till the bringing in of the Laws of <hi>Athens,</hi> commonly called <hi>The Laws of the Twelve Tables;</hi> one of which Laws runneth in theſe words, <hi>In urbe ne ſepelito, nemo urito.</hi> After this Prohibition, their dead Corps were firſt burned in <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and there was covered in ſundry places in the fields. The frequent Urns, or Sepulchral Stones digged up amongſt us here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (as of late days were many in <hi>Spittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> near <hi>London)</hi> are ſufficient teſtimonies of this aſſertion. Beſides, we may find in <hi>Appium,</hi> that the chief reaſon why the rich men in <hi>Rome</hi> would not yield to that Law, called <hi>Lex Agraria</hi> or the Law of dividing the Roman poſſeſſions equally among the people was, becauſe they thought it an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious thing that the monuments of their Fore fathers ſhould be ſold unto others. The firſt that is Regiſtred to have been buried in the City, was <hi>Trojanus</hi> the Emperor; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was granted as an honorary to ſuch as had deſerved well of the Republick: but afterwards when Chriſtian Religion prevail'd o're heatheniſm, Churchyards (thoſe Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Saints) were conſecrated, and the liberty of burying within the walls was alike granted to all.</p>

            <p>Many other Injunctions he laid upon them, as forbidding them Wine, and the eating of Swines-fleſh. Fryday he ordained to be the Sabbath day, to diſtinguiſh his Followers from Jews and Chriſtians, who ſolemnize the days following. To thoſe who obſerved his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and faithfully kept his Laws, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Paradiſe, ſpread here and there with Silk Carpets, adorned with verdant flowery Fields, watered with Chriſtaline Rivers, and beautified with trees of Gold, and Arbors of pleaſure, in whoſe cool ſhade they ſhall ſpend their time with amorous Virgins, whoſe manſion ſhall not be far diſtant.

            <p>Qu. <hi>Which Heretick in his time had the moſt followers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An. Arius,</hi> a prieſt of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who hatched that deviliſh Doctrine againſt the perpetual Divinity of Chriſt; to beat down which Hereſie, the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was called, wherein was made the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:37944:43"/>
and the Clauſe, <hi>of one ſubſtance with the Father,</hi> proved to be agreeable to the Word. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> being then Emperor, ſent for <hi>Arius</hi> to ſubſcribe to the Decrees of this Council, who went to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his own he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Tenets written in a paper, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom; where reading before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror the Decrees of the Council, he writ a Recantation of his Hereſie, laying his hand on his breaſt, and ſwearing, he meant as he had written: but though thereby he blinded the Emperor, God manifeſted his hypocriſie; for paſſing in great triumph through the ſtreets of the City, a neceſſity of Nature enforcing him, he withdrew aſide into a Houſe of Eaſe, where he voided out his Guts, and ſent his ſoul as a Harbinger to the Devil, to provide room for his body. However his Hereſie died not with him, but overſpread ſo far, that one of the Fathers complained, <hi>The whole world is turned Arian.</hi> And long time it was ere this Serpent of Error was knocked on the head by the Hammer of Gods Word, though very powerful then in the mouths of many faithful Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Many other Hereſies might be reckon'd up, which were frequent in the primitive times, as the <hi>Nicholaitans, Donatiſts,</hi> &amp;c. but we deſcend to ſpeak of ſome more modern.</p>

before his fall: and having gotten a great many diſciples, they betook themſelves to an Iſland called <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and went ſtark naked, having no reſpect unto marriage, yet would they not accompany any woman until the man coming to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Father</hi> Adam, <hi>I am enflamed towards this woman:</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> made anſwer, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply.</hi> But long they had not lived in this laſcivious courſe of Irreligion, but <hi>Ziſca</hi> that renowned Bohemian Captain hearing of them, with a ſelected Band of Soldiers, entered their Fools Paradiſe, and put them all to the Sword, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1416:</p>
            <p>The ſame pretence to bring men to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,</hi> though in a different way, was once practiſed by <hi>Aladine</hi> a ſeditious <hi>Perſian,</hi> who inhabited a Valley in that Countrey, which he fortified with a ſtrong Caſtle. Hither he brought all the luſty Youths, and beautiful Maidens of the adjoyning Provinces; The women were confined to their Chambers, the men to priſon, where having endured much ſorrow, they were ſeverely caſt into dead ſleeps, and conveyed to the women, where they were entertained with all the pleaſures youth and luſt could deſire, or a ſenſual mind affect. To the eyes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented curious Pictures, and other coſtly Sights, the Ears were charmed with melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Muſick, the Noſe delighted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous Smells, the Taſte ſatiated with coſtly Viands, and the Touch ſatisfied with whatſoever might be pleaſing unto it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting which a ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite could deſire to enjoy. Having lived in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37944:44"/>
this happineſs a whole day, they were in a like ſleep conveyed to their Irons. Then would <hi>Aladine</hi> come unto them and inform them how they had been in Paradiſe, in which place it was in his power to ſeat them eternally, and which he would do if they would hazard their lives in his Quarrels. They (poor ſouls) thinking all to be real, ſwore to perform whatſoever he requeſted: whereupon he deſtinated them to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of ſuch Princes as he had a mind to be rid out of the way; which for the hopes of this Paradiſe, they willingly put in execution, refuſing no dangers to be there the ſooner. One of theſe was he who ſo deſperately wounded our King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, when he was in his Wars in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That the Law and the Goſpel were unprofitable for the attaining of Heaven, but his doctrine able to ſave ſuch as received it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was the true Chriſt and Meſſias.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he had been till that preſent kept in a place unknown to the Saints.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, that he was not to reſtore the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by death or tribulation, but by the love and grace of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>He died in the year 1556. and three years after his doctrine was by them of <hi>Baſil</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, his Goods confiſcated, and his bones
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37944:44"/>
taken up and burned. He bound his diſciples to three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To conceal his name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not to reveal of what condition he had been.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37944:47"/>
a Temple to <hi>Venus.</hi> This Temple being plucked down, and the Earth digged away, ſhe found the three Croſſes whereon our bleſſed Saviour and the two Thieves had ſuffered; to know which of theſe was the right Croſs, they were all carried to a woman, who had long been viſited with ſickneſs, and now lay at the point of death. The Croſſes of the two thieves did the weak woman no good; but as ſoon as they laid on her the Croſs on which our Lord dyed, ſhe leaped up, and was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her former health; or this Croſs there are in ſeveral places ſhown ſo many pieces, that (as one ſaith) were they all put together, they would break the back of <hi>Simon of Cyrene</hi> to carry them: but theſe are <hi>pious frauds,</hi> and ſo much the more tolerable, in that they bring great gain into the Popes Treaſury.</p>
            <p>Of the Temple thus built, was afterwards inſtituted an Order of Knights Templers, by <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>Payennes,</hi> Anno 1113. and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Pope <hi>Eugenius;</hi> their Enſign was a red Croſs, in token that they ſhould ſhed their blood to defend Chriſts Temple. They were Croſs-legged, and wore on their backs the figure of the Croſs, for which they were by the common people called croſs-back or crouk-back, and by corruption crook-back. <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſecond Son to our <hi>Henry</hi> the third, being of this Order, was vulgarly called <hi>Edmund Crook-back,</hi> which made <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth conceited, that this <hi>Edmund</hi> (from whom he was deſcended) was indeed the eldeſt Son of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but that for his crookedneſs and deformity, his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother was preferred to the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37944:50"/>
two pipes thereof as he went to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

We may as well conclude that Bottle-Ale breaketh wind, for that effect we find to follow the drinking of it, though indeed it is only the ſame wind which it ſelf conveyed into the ſtomack. I confeſs in ſome reſpects being moderately taken, it may be ſerviceable for Phyſick; but Tobacco is by few taken now as medicinal, it is grown a good fellow, and fallen from a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to a Complement.</p>

            <p>It is uncertain where this famous River hath its head or Fountain, whether in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Moon, or the Lake <hi>Zembre</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia interior:</hi> but certain it is that it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in one continual Channel, till it waſheth the midland of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> having in the mean ſpace ſeveral Cataracts, which is a great fall of the waters that maketh ſuch a hideous noiſe, as not only deafeth the by-dwellers, but the Hills alſo are torn with the ſound, as <hi>Lucan</hi> hath it.</p>

               <p>Their runneth a ſtory concerning this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous accident, how that a certain poor Beggar woman with three twin-Children came to this Counteſſes door, and begged an Alms of her, which ſhe not only denyed, but alſo called her Harlot and Strumpet; telling her withal, it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould have ſo many by one man: which this Beggar hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, beſought God, who knew her innocency, to manifeſt it unto her, by giving her ſo many at one birth by her Husband, as there are days in the year; which fell out accordingly.</p>
               <p>Much to this purpoſe is the ſtory of one <hi>Jermentrudis,</hi> wife to <hi>Iſenbardus</hi> Earl of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſe</hi> in <hi>Suevia;</hi> which Counteſs grievouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed one of her neighbour women of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,

and had her puniſhed, becauſe ſhe had not long before been delivered of ſix Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at a birth. It fortuned that ſhe her ſelf, her Husband being abroad in the Fields, was delivered at one birth of twelve Children all Males, ſhe fearing the like infamous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by her inſtigation had been infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the former woman, commanded the Nurſe to kill eleven of them; The Nurſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to execute the will of her Miſtriſs, was met by her Lord, then returning homeward; He demanded what ſhe carried in her Lap? She anſwered, Puppies; He deſired to ſee them, ſhe denied him. The Lord on this growing angry, opened her Apron, and there found eleven of his own Sons, pretty ſweet babes, and of moſt promiſing countenances. The Earl examined the matter, found out the truth, enjoyned the Nurſe to be ſecret, and put the children to a Miller to nurſe. Six years being paſſed over in ſilence, the Earl making a ſolemn Feaſt, invited moſt of his wives and his own Friends. The young boys he attired all in the ſame faſhion, and preſenteth them to their mother, ſhe misdoubting the truth, confeſſeth her fault, is by the Earl pardoned, and acknowledgeth her Children.</p>
               <p>A like ſtrange thing we have of one <hi>Agil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> a King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in the Land of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who going forth one morning a Hunting, as he was riding by a Fiſh pond, he ſpyed ſeven children ſprawling for life, which ſome Harlots had been dilivered of, and moſt barbarouſly thrown into the water. The King amazed at this ſpectacle, put his Bore ſpear, or hunting-pole among them, on which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37944:71"/>
one of the childrens hands faſtened, and the King ſoftly drawing back his hand, wafted the Child to the ſhore. This child he named <hi>Lamiſſus,</hi> from <hi>Lama,</hi> which in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſignified a Fiſhpond.

               <p>Nor is that leſs ſtrange which is reported of <hi>Claudia,</hi> a Romane Veſtal Virgin, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof is this: The Romans were once told by an Oracle, that they ſhould be Lords of the world, if they could but get the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Cybele</hi> from the Phrygians, which was there worſhipped in a City called <hi>Peſinus.</hi> Hereupon they ſent unto the Phrygians to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, who being willing to pleaſe a potent Neighbor, eſpecially the Romans being their Countrey-men, as deſcended from <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his Trojans, granted their requeſt, and the Goddeſs is ſhipt for <hi>Rome.</hi> But when it came into the River of <hi>Tyber,</hi> it there made a ſtand, neither could it be again moved forward by force or ſleight. It happened that this <hi>Claudia</hi> having been accuſed of incontinency, to clear herſelf, tyed her Girdle to the Ship, praying the Goddeſs, that if ſhe were cauſeleſly ſuſpected, ſhe would ſuffer the Ship to go forward; which was no ſooner ſaid, than granted, <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> by her Girdle drawing the Ship to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the ſame clearing her ſelf from all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Uncleanneſs or Incontinency.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of a Year, what it is, with the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Engliſh and Gregorian Account.</head>
               <p>A Year is that ſpace of time wherein the Sun runs his perambulation through the twelve Signs of the Zodiack, containing 12 Solar moneths, 13 Lunar, 52 weeks, 365 days, 6 hours, and 6 minutes, which 6 hours in four years ſpace being added together, make one day, which we commonly call <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſextile,</hi> or <hi>Leap-year,</hi> and is added to the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar on the 25 of <hi>February,</hi> making that moneth every fourth year 29 days long, which at other times is but 28. This account was thus named by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the firſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor, who reduced the year to a better method than before, and from him it was called the <hi>Julian Account,</hi> yet ſtill the ſix minutes remained un-numbred, which in tract of time aroſe to ſome dayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gregory</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to make the year exactly anſwerable to the Suns diurnal courſe, caſting up the days which thoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes amounted unto, placed his Feſtivals exactly anſwerable to the Suns progreſs, which in ſixteen hundred years hath amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ten days, and is from him called the

                  <hi>Gregorian Account,</hi> being uſed in all thoſe parts beyond Sea which acknowledge the Popes Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>From whence do the twelve Moneths derive their Names?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>An. January</hi> is ſo called from <hi>Janus,</hi> who was pictured with two faces, ſignifying the beginning or entrance of the year. <hi>February</hi> took its name from <hi>Febura, March</hi> from <hi>Mars</hi> the God of War. <hi>April</hi> ſignifieth the growth or ſpringing of the year. <hi>May</hi> is the Majors, and <hi>June</hi> the Juniors ſeaſon. <hi>July</hi> was ſo called from <hi>Julius Caeſar. Auguſt,</hi> from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> the ſecond Roman Emperor. <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> ſignifieth the ſeventh moneth, for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans before the time of <hi>Julius Coeſar</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their moneths from <hi>March;</hi> ſo <hi>October</hi> ſignifieth the eighth, <hi>November</hi> the ninth, and <hi>December</hi> the tenth; which if you reckon from <hi>January,</hi> the account will be otherwiſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>An Artificial day conſiſts of 12 hours, a Natural Day 24 hours. The Athenians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Day from Sun-ſet; but the Jews, Chaldeans, and Babylonians, from Sun-riſe: The Egyptians and Romans from midnight, of whom we took pattern to count the hours from thence; the Umbrians from noon. The parts of a politick or civil day, (according
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37944:108"/>
to <hi>Macrobius)</hi> are theſe; The firſt time of the day is after midnight; the ſecond in Latine <hi>Gallicinium,</hi> Cocks crow; the third <hi>Canticini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the ſpace between the firſt Cock and Break of day; the fourth <hi>Diluculum,</hi> the break or dawn of the day; the fifth <hi>Mane,</hi> the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the ſixth <hi>Meridies,</hi> noon, or Mid-day; the ſeventh <hi>Pomeridies,</hi> the afternoon; the eighth <hi>Serum diei,</hi> Sun-ſet: the ninth <hi>Suprema tempeſtas,</hi> twi-light; tenth <hi>Veſper,</hi> the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the eleventh <hi>Prima Lux,</hi> Candle time; the twelfth <hi>Nox concubia,</hi> bed-time; the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Nox intempeſta,</hi> the dead time of the night.</p>
               <p>The Jews did divide their Artificial day into four Quarters, allowing to every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three hours, accounting the firſt hour of the firſt Quarter at the Riſing of the Sun, and the third hour of the ſecond Quarter, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the third hour; and the third hour of the ſecond Quarter, they called the ſixth hour, which was mid-day; The third hour of the third Quarter, the ninth hour; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hour of the fourth Quarter, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour; and the twelfth and laſt hour of the day, they call Even-tide.</p>
               <p>The day is accounted with us for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of money between Sun and Sun; but for Indictments of murther, the day is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from midnight to midnight; and ſo likewiſe are faſting days.</p>

               <p>The Epact is the number of 11 dayes, which the Solar year doth exceed the Lunar; the one conſiſting of 365 dayes, the other of 354, ſo that in every 4 years there is added a number more than 30, which being greater than the Epact can be, (for from change to change there can be but 30 days) therefore 30 being taken from that exceſs, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the Epact for the next year.</p>

                  <hi>A brief diſcourſe of the natural cauſe of Airy Meteors; as Snow, Hail, Rain,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>YOu muſt firſt underſtand that there be four Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Water, and Earth; the Fire is hot and dry, the Air hot and moiſt, the Water cold and moiſt, and the Earth cold and dry; Theſe four Elements are the ſimples whereof all things (under the Moon) are made, compounded and mixt.</p>
               <p>Of Rain.</p>
               <p>Rain is a cold vapour, and earthly humour, drawn from the Earth by the vertue of the Sun and the reſt of the Planets, into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region of the Air, where by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of cold it is thickned into the body of a Cloud, which the wind driving before it, it doth diſſolve, and fall upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>Of Snow.</p>
               <p>Snow is ingendred of Rain, the Cloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing through extremity of cold, but not altogether ſo hard as Hail; <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that the Hail ſooner melts than Snow, and that Hail falls oftner in the day than the night.</p>
               <p>Of Hail.</p>
               <p>Hail is likewiſe ingendred of Rain, which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37944:115"/>
the exceſſive cold when the Cloud diſſolves, freezes the drops, and congeals into Ice, whereby great and irregular ſtones do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall on the Earth. <hi>Stow</hi> in his <hi>Annals</hi> reports, that in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Anno 1545, there fell in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones as big as mens fiſts; and that which is moſt ſtrange, ſome were of the ſhape of mens faces, others were faſhioned like Gun-holes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the 23 year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Auguſt</hi> 12. Anno 1581. there fell a great ſhower of Hailſtones which were faſhioned like the Rowels of ſpurs, and were two or three inches about.</p>
               <p>Of Froſt and Dew.</p>
               <p>Dew is a thin vapour, which through the faint heat of the Suns elevating it ſelf but a little from the Earth, preſently at night de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth again, which in the Spring-time is called <hi>Dew;</hi> but in the Winter by means of cold being congealed, it is called <hi>Froſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Wind.</p>
               <p>Wind is hot and dry fumes, drawn from the Earth by the Stars, which ſeeking to fly to the Sun, is by the freezing cold driven back, but from the fields fumes another fire which carries them back again; ſo that thereby, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the confluence of other exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions riſing out of the Earth, his motion is forced to be rather round than right: and the reaſon why he bloweth more ſharply one time than another, and in ſome places more than others; and ſometimes not at all, is, fumes ariſing out of new exhalations, and out of Floods, Fenns, and Marſhes, joyning with it to encreaſe his force: the defect or dulneſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37944:116"/>
whereof may either allay or increaſe it: as alſo the Globe or rotundity of the Earth may be the cauſe of the blowing of it more in one place than in another: or Mountains, Hills, or Woods, may hinder his force from blowing in all places eqnal: whereas upon the Plain, and broad Sea, it bloweth with an equal force: and as for the ſtilneſs or ceaſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it cometh to paſs divers ways, either by froſt, cloſing, or congealing up the pores of the earth, whence it ſhould iſſue, or by the heat of the Sun, drying up fumes and vapors that ſhould encreaſe it, and whereof it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred,</p>
               <p>Of Earth-quakes.</p>
               <p>Earth-quakes are cauſed by plenty of wind, which getting into the holes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the earth, and wanting a vent, the earth cloſing again, cauſeth the ſhaking or Earth-quake, which is more violent accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of wind ſo incloſed. <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. in the 22 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, happened a terrible Earth-quake at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and generally throughout all <hi>England,</hi> by violence whereof, the great Clock-bell a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> ſtruck againſt the hammer, as divers Clock-bells did both in City and Countrey: In <hi>London</hi> a piece of the <hi>Temple</hi> Church fell down.</p>
               <p>In the late diſſolved Church called the <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> now called Chriſt-Church, in the Sermon time, one ſtone falling from the Church, killed a young man outright, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtone, ſo bruiſed a Maid, that ſhe lived but four days after, the Man and the Maid being fellow Servants in one Houſe: divers
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37944:116"/>
were bruiſed and run out of the Church. Some ſtones fell off from the Church of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome from the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> divers Chimneys loſt their tops, and Ships on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and on the Seas, were ſeen to totter: this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake did not continue above a quarter of an hour in <hi>London,</hi> but in divers parts in <hi>Kent</hi> it held them ſo terrible, that the people went out of their Houſes, for fear they ſhould fall on their heads.</p>
               <p>Of the Rain-Bow.</p>
               <p>The Rain-bow is only the Suns reflection on a hollow Cloud, which the edge being repelled, and beaten back againſt the Sun, from thence ariſeth much variety of colours, by reaſon of the mixture of clouds, air, and fire-light together.</p>
               <p>If two Rain bows appear at one time, they preſage Rain to enſue: but if one Rain-bow, preſently after Rain, it betokeneth fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Of Thunder and Lightning.</p>
               <p>When hot and dry vapours mixt with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, is exhaled up into the middle Region, and there incloſed in the body of a Cloud, theſe two contraries not agreeing together, break forth with great violence; ſo that fire and water break out of the cloud, making a roaring noiſe which we call <hi>Thunder,</hi> and the fire <hi>Lightning;</hi> the Thunder is firſt made, but the Lightning firſt ſeen, in regard the ſight is quicker than the hearing; which to prove, obſerve but at ſome diſtance when a man is cleaving of blocks, or a Carpenter hewing a log, and you ſhall ſee the fall of the beetle,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37944:117"/>
or Ax, ſome little diſtance of time before you hear the noiſe of the blow.</p>
               <p>Now of Lightnings there be many ſorts: that which is dry burneth not all, but diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and diſperſeth its ſelf; moiſt burneth not likewiſe, but blaſts and changeth the colour; but the clear is of a ſtrange property, for it melteth the ſword and not ſingeth the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd; it draweth veſſels dry without hurt to the veſſels; ſome rich miſers have had their ſilver melted in their bags and purſes, and yet neither bag nor purſe hurt, nay not ſo much as the wax that ſealeth the bag ſtirred. It breaketh the bones and hurteth not the fleſh, and killeth the Child in the Mothers Womb, not hurting the mother, what great cauſe have we to pray as it is in the Letany, <hi>from thunder and lightning, good Lord deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>What things are not burt with Lightning.</q>
               <p>It entreth not paſt five foot into the earth; it hurteth not the Laurel-Tree, ſuch are freed that are ſhadowed with the skins of Seals, or Sea-Calves, the Eagle is likewiſe free: <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>Scythia</hi> by reaſon of cold, and <hi>Egypt</hi> by reaſon of the heat, have ſeldom Lightning.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37944:119"/>
was agreed that the World was made in the Spring: Nor is that but a great queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two furious Rabbins; for though the Rabbins (for the moſt part) be for Autumn; yet R. <hi>Joſua</hi> maintains the contrary, againſt <hi>Eleazer</hi> another great Rabbi, who contends for Autumn. True it is that the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee began alwayes at Autumn: howbeit the firſt month of the year was to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Spring, which is as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Ezod. 12. 2. <hi>This ſhall be to you the beginning of Months:</hi> as if he had ſaid, though whilſt you were in <hi>Aegypt</hi> you follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another reckoning, yet it was divers from that which ye had at the firſt: for <hi>this is to you the beginning of months,</hi> or the natural head of the year.
