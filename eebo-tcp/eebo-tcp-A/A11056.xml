            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and profits of the countrey, together with the fitnesse of plantation, being by some honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of good woorth and qualitie, and Merchants of good sufficiency and iudgement duly considered, haue at their owne charge (intending both their priuate and the common benefit of their countrey) vndertaken the transporting of a Colony for the plantation thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much encouraged thereunto by the gracious fauour

of the KINGS MAIESTY himselfe, and diuers Lords of his Highnesse most Honourable Priuie Councell. After these purposed designes were concluded, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated to publish this briefe Relation, and not before; because some forrein Nation (being fully assured of the fruitfulnesse of the countrie) haue hoped hereby to gaine some knowledge of the place, seeing they could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure our Captaine or any speciall man of our Company to combine with them for their direction, nor obtaine their purpose, in conueying away our Saluages, which was busily in practise. And this is the cause that I haue neither written of the latitude or variation most exactly obserued by our Captaine with sundrie instruments, which together with his perfect Geographicall Map of the countrey, he entendeth hereafter to set forth. I haue likewise purposedly omitted here to adde a collection of many words in their language to the number of foure or fiue hundred, as also the names of diuers of their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, aswell their friends as their enemies; being reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be made knowen for the benefit of those that shal goe in the next Voyage. But our particular proceedings in the whole Discouerie, the commodious situation of the Riuer, the fertilitie of the land, with the profits there to be had, and here reported, I refer to be verified by the whole Company, as being eye-witnesses of my words, and most of them neere inhabitants vpon the <hi>Thames.</hi> So with my prayers to God for the conuersion of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and well disposed people, and for the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successiue euents of the noble intenders the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, I rest.</p>

            <p>Munday the next day, being the first of Aprill, by sixe a clocke in the morning we were sixe leagues South-South-East from the <hi>Lizarde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At two a clocke in the afternoone this day, the weather being very faire, our Captaine for his owne experience and others with him sounded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sounding.</hi>
               </note> and had sixe and fiftie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms and a halfe. The sounding was some small blacke perrie sand, some reddish sand, a match or two, with small shels called <hi>Saint Iames his Shels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foureteenth of Aprill being Sunday, betw√©ene nine and ten of the clocke in the morning our Captaine descried the Iland <hi>Cueruo:</hi> which bare South-West and by West, about seuen leagues from vs: by eleuen of the clocke we descried <hi>Flores</hi> to the Southward of <hi>Cueruo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>We fell with the Ilands of Azores.</hi>
               </note> as it lieth: by foure a clocke in the afternoone we brought <hi>Cueruo</hi> due South from vs within two leagues of the shore, but we touched not, because the winde was faire, and we thought our selues sufficiently watered and wooded.</p>
            <p>H√©ere our Captaine obserued the Sunne, and found himselfe in the latitude of 40 degrees and 7 minutes: so he iudged the North part of <hi>Cueruo</hi> to be in 40 degrees.</p>
            <p>After we had kept our course about a hundred leagues from the Ilands, by continuall Southerly windes we were forced and driuen from the Southward, whither we first intended. And when our Captaine by long bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting saw it was but in vaine to striue with windes, not knowing Gods purposes h√©erein to our further blessing, (which after by his especiall direction w√©e found) he thought best to stand as nigh as he could by the winde to recouer what land we might first discouer.</p>
            <p>Munday, the 6 of May, being in the latitude of 39 and a halfe about ten a clocke afore noone, we came to a riplin, which we discerned a head our ship, which is a breach of water caused either by a fall, or by some meeting of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,


<pb facs="tcp:1337:4"/>
which we iudged this to be; for the weather being very faire, and a small gale of winde, we sounded and found no ground in a hundred fathoms.</p>
            <p>Munday, the 13 of May, about eleuen a clocke afore noone, our Captaine, iudging we were not farre from land, sounded, and had a soft oaze in a hundred and sixty fathomes. At fowre a clocke after noone we sounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and had the same oaze in a hundred fathoms.</p>
            <p>From 10 a clocke that night till thr√©e a clocke in the morning, our Captaine tooke in all sailes and lay at hull, being desirous to fall with the land in the day time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was an vnknowen coast, which it pleased God in his mercy to grant vs, otherwise we had run our ship vpon the hidden rockes and perished all. For when we set saile we sounded in 100 fathoms: and by eight a clock, hauing not made aboue fiue or six leagues, our Captaine vpon a sudden change of water (supposing verily he saw the sand) presently sounded, and had but fiue fathoms. Much maruelling because we saw no land, he sent one to the top, who thence descried a whitish sandy cliffe, which bare West-North-West about six leagues off from vs: but comming n√©erer within thr√©e or fowre leagues, we saw many breaches still n√©erer the land: at last we espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great breach a head vs al along the shore, into which before we should enter, our Captaine thought best to hoise out his ship boate and sound it. Which if he had not done, we had b√©ene in great danger: for he bare vp the ship, as n√©ere as he durst after the boate: vntill <hi>Thomas Cam,</hi> his mate, being in the boat, called to him to tacke about &amp; stand off, for in this breach he had very showld water, two fathoms and lesse vpon rockes, and sometime they supposed they saw the rocke within thr√©e or fowre foote, whereon the sea made a very strong breach: which we might discerne (from the top) to run along as we sailed by it 6 or 7 leagues to the Southward. This was in the latitude of 41 degr√©es, 20 minuts: wherefore we were constrained to put backe againe from the land: and soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,


<pb facs="tcp:1337:5"/>
(the weather being very faire and a small winde) we found our selues embaied with continuall showldes and rockes in a most vncertaine ground, from fiue or sixe fathoms, at the next cast of the lead we should haue 15 &amp; 18 fathoms. Ouer many which we passed, and God so blessed vs, that we had wind and weather as faire as poore men in this distresse could wish: whereby we both perfectly discerned euery breach, and with the winde were able to turne, where we saw most hope of safest pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Thus we parted from the land, which we had not so much before desired, and at the first sight reioiced, as now we all ioifully praised God, that it had pleased him to deliuer vs from so imminent danger.</p>
            <p>H√©ere we found great store of excellent Cod fish, and saw many Whales, as we had done two or three daies before.</p>
            <p>We stood off all that night, and the next day being Wednesday; but the wind still continuing betw√©en the points of South South-West, and West-South-West: so as we could not make any way to the Southward, in regard of our great want of water and wood (which was now spent) we much desired land, and therefore sought for it, where the wind would best suffer vs to refresh our selues.</p>
            <p>Thursday, the 16 of May, we stood in directly with the land, and much maruelled we descried it not, wherein we found our sea charts very false, putting land where none is.</p>
            <p>Friday, the 17 of May, about sixe a clocke at night we descried the land, which bare from vs North-North-East; but because it blew a great gale of winde, the sea very high, and n√©ere night, not fit to come vpon an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen coast, we stood off till two a clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being Saturday: then standing in with it againe, we descried it by eight a clocke in the morning, bearing North-East from vs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iland.</hi>
               </note> It appeared a meane high land, as we after found it, being but an Iland of some six miles


<pb facs="tcp:1337:5"/>
in compasse, but I hope the most fortunate euer yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. About twelue a clocke that day, we came to an anker on the North side of this Iland, about a league from the shore. About two a clocke our Captaine with twelue men rowed in his ship-boat to the shore, where we made no long stay, but laded our boat with dry wood of olde tr√©es vpon the shore side, and returned to our ship, where we rode that night.</p>
            <p>This Iland is woody, growen with Firre, Birch, Oke and B√©ech, as farre as we saw along the shore; and so likely to be within. On the verge grow Gooseberries, Strawberries, Wild pease, and Wild-rose bushes. The water issued foorth downe the Rocky cliffes in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and much fowle of diuers kinds br√©ed vpon the shore and rocks.</p>
            <p>While we were at shore, our men aboord with a few hooks got aboue thirty great Cods and Hadocks, which gaue vs a taste of the great plenty of fish which we found afterward wheresoeuer we went vpon the coast.</p>
            <p>From hence we might discerne the maine land from the West-South-West to the East-North-East, and a great way (as it then s√©emed, and as we after found it) vp into the maine we might discerne very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, though the maine s√©emed but low land; which gaue vs a hope it would please God to direct vs to the discouerie of some good; although w√©e were driuen by winds farre from that place, whither (both by our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and desire) we euer intended to shape the course of our voyage.</p>
            <p>The next day, being <hi>Whit-Sunday</hi>; because we rode too much open to the sea and windes, we weyed anker a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelue a clocke, and came along to the other Ilands more adioyning to the maine, and in the rode directly with the mountaines, about thr√©e leagues from the first Iland where we had ankered.</p>
            <p>When we came n√©ere vnto them (sounding all along


<pb facs="tcp:1337:6"/>
in a good depth) our Captaine manned his ship-boat and sent her before with <hi>Thomas Cam</hi> one of his Mates, whom he knew to be of good experience, to sound &amp; search betweene the Ilands for a place safe for our shippe to ride in; in the meane while we kept aloofe at sea, hauing giuen them in the boat a token to weffe in the ship, if he found a conuenient Harbour; which it pleased God to send vs, farre beyond our expectation, in a most safe birth defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all windes, in an excellent depth of water for ships of any burthen, in six, seuen, eight, nine, and ten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms vpon a clay oaze very tough.</p>
            <p>We all with great ioy praised God for his vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodnesse, who had from so apparent danger deliuered vs, &amp; directed vs vpon this day into so secure an Harbour: in remembrance wherof we named it <hi>Pentecost-harbor,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>About foure a clocke, after we were ankered and well mored, our Captaine with halfe a dozen of our Company went on shore to s√©eke fresh watering, and a conuenient place to set together a pinnesse, which we brought in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of <hi>England</hi>: both which we found very fitting.</p>
            <p>Upon this Iland, as also vpon the former, we found (at our first comming to shore) where fire had b√©ene made: and about the place were very great egge shelles bigger than goose egges, fish bones, and as we iudged, the bones of some beast.</p>
            <p>H√©ere we espied Cranes stalking on the shore of a little Iland adioyning;<note place="margin">

               </note> where we after saw they vsed to br√©ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whitsun-munday,</hi> the 20 day of May, very early in the morning, our Captaine caused the pieces of the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be carried a shore, where while some were busied about her, others digged welles to receiue the fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we found issuing downe out of the land in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places. H√©ere I can not omit (for foolish feare of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of flattery) the painfull industry of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,


<pb facs="tcp:1337:6"/>
who as at sea he is alwayes most carefull and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, so at land he refuseth no paines; but his labour was euer as much or rather more than any mans: which not only encourageth others with better content, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so effecteth much with great expedition.</p>
            <p>In digging we found excellent clay for bricke or tile.</p>
            <p>The next day we finished a well of good and holesome cl√©ere water in a great empty caske, which we left there. We cut yards, waste tr√©es, and many necessaries for our ship, while our Carpenter and Cooper laboured to fit and furnish forth the shallop.</p>
            <p>This day our boat went out about a mile from our ship,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>We fished.</hi>
               </note> and in small time with two or thr√©e hooks was fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sufficiently for our whole Company thr√©e dayes, with great Cod, Haddocke, and Thornebacke.</p>
            <p>And towards night we drew with a small net of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fathoms very nigh the shore:<note place="margin">

            <p>Wednesday, the 22 of May, we felled and cut wood for our ships vse, cleansed and scoured our wels, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a plot of ground, wherein, amongst some garden s√©eds, we sowed peaze and barley,<note place="margin">

               </note> which in sixt√©en dayes grew eight inches aboue ground; and so continued growing euery day halfe an inch, although this was but the crust of the ground, and much inferior to the mould we after found in the maine.</p>
            <p>Friday, the 24 of May, after we had made an end of cutting wood, and carying water aboord our shippe, with fouret√©ene Shot and Pikes we marched about and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row part of two of the Ilands; the bigger of which we iudged to be foure or fiue miles in compasse, and a mile broad.</p>

            <p>Thursday, the 30 of May, about ten a clock afore noon, our Captaine with 13 men more, <hi>in the name of God,</hi> and with all our praiers for their prosperous discouerie, and safe returne, departed in the shallop: leauing the ship in a good harbour, which before I mentioned, well mored, and manned with 14 men.</p>
            <p>This day, about fiue a clocke in the afternoone,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Saluages came first to vs.</hi>
               </note> we in the shippe espied thr√©e Canoas comming towards vs, which went to the iland adioining, where they went a shore, and very quickly had made a fire, about which they stood beholding our ship: to whom we made signes with our hands and hats, weffing vnto them to come vnto vs, because we had not s√©ene any of the people yet. They sent one Canoa with thr√©e men, one of which, when they came n√©ere vnto vs, spake in his language very lowd and very boldly: s√©eming as though he would know why we were there, and by pointing with his oare towards the sea, we coniectured he ment we should be gone. But when we shewed them kniues and their vse, by cutting of stickes and other trifles, as combs and glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they came close aboard our ship, as desirous to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our friendship. To these we gaue such things as we perceiued they liked, when w√©e shewed them the vse: bracelets, rings, peacocke feathers, which they stucke in their haire, and Tabacco pipes. After their departure to their company on the shore, presently came foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another Canoa: to whom we gaue as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, vsing them with as much kindnes as we could.</p>
            <p>The shape of their body is very proportionable, they are wel countenanced, not very tal nor big, but in stature


<pb facs="tcp:1337:8"/>
like to vs:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Three sorts of colours of painting.</hi>
               </note> they paint their bodies with blacke, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some with red, some with blacke, and some with blew.</p>
            <p>Their clothing is Beauers skins, or Deares skins, cast ouer them like a mantle, and hanging downe to their kn√©es, made fast together vpon the shoulder with leather: some of them had sleeues,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and buskins.</hi>
               </note> most had none: some had bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins of such leather tewed: they haue besides a p√©ece of Beauers skin betw√©ene their legs, made fast about their waste, to couer their priuities.</p>
            <p>They suffer no haire to grow on their faces, but on their head very long and very blacke, which those that haue wiues, binde vp behinde with a leather string, in a long round knot.</p>
            <p>They seemed all very ciuill and merrie: shewing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of much thankefulnesse, for those things we gaue them. We found them then (as after) a people of exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good inuention, quicke vnderstanding and readie capacitie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Their boats.</hi>
               </note>Their Canoas are made without any iron, of the bark of a birch tr√©e, strengthened within with ribs and hoops of wood, in so good fashion, with such excellent ingenious art, as they are able to beare seuen or eight persons, far exc√©eding any in the Indies.</p>
            <p>One of their Canoas came not to vs, wherein we imagined their women were: of whom they are (as all Saluages) very iealous.</p>
            <p>When I signed vnto them they should goe sl√©epe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was night, they vnderstood presently, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that at the shore, right against our ship, they would stay all night: as they did.</p>
            <p>The next morning very early, came one Canoa abord vs againe with thr√©e Saluages, whom we easily then enticed into our ship, and vnder the decke: where we gaue them porke, fish, bread and pease, all which they did eat: and this I noted, they would eat nothing raw, either fish or flesh. They maruelled much and much loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked


<pb facs="tcp:1337:8"/>
vpon the making of our canne and kettle, so they did at a head-p√©ece and at our guns, of which they are most fearefull, and would fall flat downe at the report of them. At their departure I signed vnto them, that if they would bring me such skins as they ware I would giue them kniues, and such things as I saw they most liked, which the chiefe of them promised to do by that time the Sunne should be beyond the middest of the firmament; this I did to bring them to an vnderstanding of exchange, and that they might conceiue the intent of our comming to them to be for no other end.</p>
            <p>About 10 a clocke this day we descried our Shallop returning toward vs, which so soone as we espied, we certainly coniectured our Captaine had found some vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected harbour, further vp towards the maine to bring the ship into, or some riuer; knowing his determination and resolution, not so suddenly else to make return: which when they came n√©erer they expressed by shooting vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies of shot; and when they were come within Musket shot, they gaue vs a volley and haled vs, then we in the shippe gaue them a great p√©ece and haled them.</p>
            <p>Thus we welcomed them, who gladded vs exc√©eding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their ioifull relation of their happie discouerie, which shall appeare in the sequele. And we likewise gaue them cause of mutuall ioy with vs, in discoursing of the kinde ciuility we found in a people, where we little expected any sparke of humanity.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine had in this small time discouered vp a great riuer, trending alongst into the maine about forty miles. The pleasantnesse whereof, with the safety of harbour for shipping, together with the fertility of ground and other fruits, which were generally by his whole company related, I omit, till I report of the whole disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery therein after performed. For by the breadth, depth and strong flood, imagining it to run far vp into the land, he with sp√©ed returned, intending to flanke his light hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for arrowes, least it might happen that the further


<pb facs="tcp:1337:9"/>
part of the riuer should be narrow, and by that meanes subiect to the volley of Saluages on either side out of the woods.</p>
            <p>Untill his returne, our Captaine left on shoare where he landed in a path (which s√©emed to be frequented) a pipe, a brooch and a knife, thereby to know if the Saluages had recourse that way, because they could at that time see none of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Trifles left on shore.</hi>
               </note> but they were taken away before our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither.</p>
            <p>I returne now to our Saluages, who according to their appointment about one a clocke, came with 4 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noas to the shoare of the iland right ouer against vs, where they had lodged the last night, and sent one Canoa to vs with two of those Saluages, who had beene a bord, and another, who then seemed to haue command of them: for though we perceiued their willingnesse, yet he would not permit them to come abord: but he hauing viewed vs and our ship, signed that he would go to the rest of the company and returne againe. Presently after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture it began to raine, and continued all that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, so as they could not come to vs with their skins and furs, nor we go to them. But after an howre or there about, the thr√©e which had beene with vs before came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whom we had to our fire and couered them with our gownes. Our Captaine bestowed a shirt vpon him, whom we thought to be their chiefe, who s√©emed neuer to haue s√©ene any before; we gaue him a brooch to hang about his necke, a great knife, and lesser kniues to the two other, and to euery one of them a combe and glasse, the vse whereof we shewed them: whereat they laughed and tooke gladly; we victualled them, and gaue them <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> which they tasted, but would by no meanes drinke; our beueridge they liked well, we gaue them Sugar Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which after they had tasted they liked and desired more, and raisons which were giuen them; and some of euery thing they would reserue to carry to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Wherefore we pittying their being in the raine, and


<pb facs="tcp:1337:9"/>
therefore not able to get themselues victuall (as we thought) we gaue them bread and fish.</p>
            <p>Thus because we found the land a place answereable to the intent of our discouery,<note place="margin">

               </note> viz. fit for any nation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, we vsed the people with as great kindnes as we could deuise, or found them capable of.</p>
            <p>The next day, being Saturday and the first of Iune,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>We traded with the Saluages.</hi>
               </note> I traded with the Saluages all the fore-noone vpon the shore, where were eight and twenty of them: and because our ship rode nigh, we were but fiue or sixe: where for kniues, glasses, combes and other trifles to the valew of foure or fiue shillings, we had 40 good Beauers skins, Otters skins, Sables, and other small skins, which we knewe not how to call. Our trade being ended, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them came abord vs, and did eat by our fire, and would be verie merrie and bold, in regard of our kinde vsage of them. Towards night our Captaine went on shore, to haue a draught with the Sein or Net. And we carried two of them with vs, who maruelled to s√©e vs catch fish with a net. Most of that we caught we gaue them and their company. Then on the shore I learned the names of diuers things of them: and when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued me to note them downe, they would of themselues, fetch fishes, and fruit bushes, and stand by me to s√©e me write their names.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine shewed them a strange thing which they woondred at. His sword and mine hauing b√©ene touched with the Loadstone, tooke vp a knife, and held it fast when they plucked it away, made the knife turne, being laid on a blocke, and touching it with his sword, made that take vp a n√©edle, whereat they much maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This we did to cause them to imagine some great power in vs: and for that to loue and feare vs.</p>
            <p>When we went on shore to trade with them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Their Bowes and Arrowes.</hi>
               </note> in one of their Canoas I saw their bowes and arrowes, which I tooke vp and drew an arrow in one of them, which I found to be of strength able to carry an arrow fiue or sixe

               </note> Their arrowes are made of the same wood, some of Ash, big and long, with thr√©e feathers tied on, and nocked very artificiallie: headed with the long shanke bone of a D√©ere, made very sharpe with two fangs in manner of a harping iron. They haue likewise Darts,<note place="margin">

               </note> headed with like bone, one of which I darted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rockes, and it brake not. These they vse very cunningly, to kill fish, fowle and beasts.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine had two of them at supper with vs in his cabbin to s√©e their demeanure, and had them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at seruice: who behaued themselues very ciuilly, neither laughing nor talking all the time, and at supper fed not like men of rude education, neither would they eat or drinke more than s√©emed to content nature; they desired pease to carry a shore to their women, which we gaue them, with fish and bread, and lent them pewter dishes, which they carefully brought againe.</p>
            <p>In the euening another boat came to them on the shore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tabacco excellent.</hi>
               </note> and because they had some Tabacco, which they brought for their owne vse, the other came for vs, making signe what they had, and offered to carry some of vs in their boat, but foure or fiue of vs went with them in our owne boat: when we came on shore they gaue vs the best welcome they could, spreading fallow D√©eres skins for vs to sit on the ground by their fire, and gaue vs of their Tabacco in our pipes, which was excellent, and so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commended of vs all to be as good as any we euer tooke, being the simple leafe without any composition, strong, and of sweet taste: they gaue vs some to carry to our Captaine, whom they called our <hi>Bashabes:</hi> neither did they require any thing for it, but we would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any thing from them without remuneration.</p>

They were very well fauoured in proportion of countenance, though coloured blacke, low of stature, and fat, bare headed as the men, wearing their haire long: they had two little male children of a y√©ere and half old, as we iudged, very fat and of good countenances, which they loue tenderly, all naked, except their legs, which were couered with thin leather buskins tewed, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened with strops to a girdle about their waste, which they girde very streight, and is decked round about with little round p√©eces of red Copper; to these I gaue chaines and bracelets, glasses, and other trifles, which the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages seemed to accept in great kindnesse.</p>
            <p>At our comming away, we would haue had those two that supped with vs, to go abord and sl√©epe, as they had promised: but it appeared their company would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them. Whereat we might easily perceiue they were much gr√©eued: but not long after our departure, they came with thr√©e more to our ship, signing to vs, that if one of our company would go lie on shore with them, they would stay with vs. Then <hi>Owen Griffin</hi> (one of the two we were to leaue in the Country, if we had thought it n√©edfull or conuenient) went with them in their Canoa, and 3 of them staied aborde vs, whom our whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very kindly vsed. Our Captaine saw their lodging prouided, and them lodged in an old saile vpon the Orlop; and because they much feared our dogs, they were tied vp whensoeuer any of them came abord vs.</p>

            <p>The next morning, assoone as they saw the Sunne rise, they pointed to him to come with them to our shippe: and hauing receiued their men from vs, they came with fiue or sixe of their Canoas and Company houering about our ship: to whom (because it was the Sabbath day) I signed they should depart, and at the next Sun rising we would goe along with them to their houses: which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood (as we thought) and departed, some of their Canoas coursing about the Iland, and the other directly towards the maine.</p>

We


<pb facs="tcp:1337:11"/>
requited them with bread and peaze, which they caried to their Company on shore, s√©eming very thankefull. After supper they returned with their Canoa to fetch vs a shore to take Tabacco with them there; with whom six or seuen of vs went, and caried some trifles, if peraduenture they had any trucke, among which I caried some few biskets, to try if they would exchange for them, s√©eing they so well liked to eat them. When we came at shore, they most kindly entertained vs, taking vs by the hands, as they had obserued we did to them aboord, in token of welcome, and brought vs to sit downe by their fire, where sat together thirt√©ene of them. They filled their Tabacco pipe, which was then the short claw of a Lobster, which will hold ten of our pipes full, and we dranke of their excellent Tabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co as much as we would with them; but we saw not any great quantity to trucke for; and it s√©emed they had not much left of old, for they spend a great quantity y√©erely by their continuall drinking: and they would signe vnto vs, that it was growen yet but a foot aboue ground, and would be aboue a yard high, with a leafe as broad as both their hands. They often would (by pointing to one part of the maine Eastward) signe vnto vs, that their Bashabes (that is, their King) had great plenty of Furres, and much Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.<note place="margin">

               </note> When we had sufficiently taken Tabacco with them, I shewed some of our trifles for trade; but they made signe that they had there nothing to exchange; for (as I after conceiued) they had b√©ene fishing and fowling, and so came thither to lodge that night by vs: for when we were ready to come away, they shewed vs great cups made very wittily of barke, in forme almost square, full of a red berry about the bignesse of a bullis,<note place="margin">

               </note> for which they required foure bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, but I offered them two; which they tooke and were well content.</p>
            <p>At our departure they made signe, that if any of vs would stay there on shore, some of them would go lie aboord vs: at which motion two of our Company stayed with them, and thr√©e of the Saluages lodged with vs in maner as the night before.</p>

Two of their Canoas they sent away before, and they which lay aboord vs all night, kept company with vs to direct vs.</p>

            <p>When we came n√©ere the point where we saw their fires, where they intended to land, and where they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined some few of vs would come on shore with our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, as we had accustomed before; when they had often numbred our men very diligently, they scoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to their Campany, not doubting we would haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. But when we perceiued this, and knew not either their intents, or number of Saluages on the shore,


<pb facs="tcp:1337:12"/>
our Captaine, after consultation, stood off, and wef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed them to vs, determining that I should go on shore first to take a view of them, and what they had to traffique: if he, whom at our first sight of them s√©emed to be of most respect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and being then in the Canoa, would stay as a pawne for me. When they came to vs (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all our former courtesies) he vtterly refused; but would leaue a yoong Saluage: and for him our Captaine sent <hi>Griffin</hi> in their Canoa, while we lay hulling a little off. <hi>Griffin</hi> at his returne reported, they had there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, as he numbred them,<note place="margin">283 <hi>Saluages.</hi>

            <p>These things considered, we began to ioyne them in the ranke of other Saluages, who haue b√©ene by trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in most discoueries found very trecherous: neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting mischiefe, vntill by some remisnesse, fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity affoordeth them certaine ability to execute the same. Wherefore after good aduice taken, we determined so soone as we could to take some of them, least (being suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous we had discouered their plots) they should absent themselues from vs.</p>

            <p>About eight a clocke this day we went on shore with our boats, to fetch aboord water and wood, our Captaine leauing word with the Gunner in the shippe, by dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a musket, to giue notice if they espied any Canoa comming: which they did about ten a clocke. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being carefull they should be kindly entreated, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me to go aboord, intending with dispatch to make what haste after he possibly could. When I came to the ship, there were two Canoas, and in either of them thr√©e


<pb facs="tcp:1337:13"/>
Saluages; of whom two were below at the fire, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther staied in their Canoas about the ship; and because we could not entice them abord, we gaue them a Canne of pease and bread, which they carried to the shore to eat. But one of them brought backe our Canne presently and staid abord with the other two; for he being yoong, of a ready capacity, and one we most desired to bring with vs into <hi>England,</hi> had receiued exc√©eding kinde vsage at our hands, and was therefore much delighted in our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. When our Captaine was come, we consulted how to catch the other thr√©e at shore, which we performed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Our manner of taking the Saluages.</hi>
               </note>We manned the light horseman with 7 or 8 men, one standing before carried our box of Marchandise, as we were woont when I went to traffique with them, and a platter of pease, which meat they loued: but before we were landed, one of them (being too suspitiously fearefull of his owne good) withdrew himselfe into the wood. The other two met vs on the shore side, to receiue the pease, with whom we went vp the Cliffe to their fire and sate downe with them, and whiles we were discussing how to catch the third man who was gone, I opened the box, and shewed them trifles to exchange, thinking thereby to haue banisht feare from the other, and drawen him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: but when we could not, we vsed little delay, but suddenly laid hands vpon them. And it was as much as fiue or sixe of vs could doe to get them into the light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For they were strong and so naked as our best hold was by their long haire on their heads: and we would haue b√©ene very loath to haue done them any hurt, which of necessity we had b√©ene constrained to haue done if we had attempted them in a multitude, which we must and would,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>We caught fiue Saluages, two Canoas, and their bowes and arrowes.</hi>
               </note> rather than haue wanted them, being a matter of great importance for the full accomplement of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>Thus we shipped fiue Saluages, two Canoas, with all their bowes and arrowes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1337:13"/>The next day we made an end of getting our wood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, and filled our empty caske with water.</p>
            <p>Thursday, the 6 of Iune, we spent in bestowing the Canoas vpon the orlop safe from hurt, because they were subiect to breaking, which our Captaine was carefull to preuent.</p>
            <p>Saturday, the eight of Iune (our Captaine being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to finish all businesse about this harbour) very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, with the light horseman, coasted fiue or sixe leagues about the Ilands adioining, and sounded all along wheresoeuer we went. He likewise diligently searched the mouth of the Harbour, and about the rocks which shew themselues at all times, and are an excellent breach of the water,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rocks and mouth of the Harbour.</hi>
               </note> so as no Sea can come in to offend the Harbour. This he did to instruct himselfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by able to direct others that shall happen to come to this place. For euery where both n√©ere the rocks, &amp; in all soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings about the Ilands, we neuer found lesse water than foure and fiue fathoms, which was seldome; but seuen, eight, nine and ten fathoms is the continuall sounding by the shore. In some places much d√©eper vpon clay oaze or soft sand: so that if any bound for this place, should be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther driuen or scanted with winds, he shall be able (with his directions) to recouer safely his harbour most securely in water enough by foure seuerall passages, more their which I thinke no man of iudgement will desire as necessarie.</p>
            <p>Upon one of the Ilands (because it had a pleasant san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Coue for small barks to ride in) we landed, and found hard by the shore a pond of fresh water,<note place="margin">

               </note> which flowed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the banks, somewhat ouergrowen with little shrub tr√©es, and searching vp in the Iland, we saw it fed with a strong run, which with small labour, and little time, might be made to driue a mill. In this Iland, as in the other, were spruce trees of excellent timber and height, able to mast ships of great burthen.</p>
            <p>While we thus sounded from one place to another in


<pb facs="tcp:1337:14"/>
so good d√©epes, our Captaine to make some triall of the fishing himselfe, caused a hooke or two to be cast out at the mouth of the harbour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Great plenty of Cod fish.</hi>
               </note> not aboue halfe a league from our ship, where in small time only, with the baits which they cut from the fish and thr√©e hooks, we got fish enough for our whole Company (though now augmented) for three daies. Which I omit not to report, because it sheweth how great a profit the fishing would be, they being so plentifull, so great, and so good, with such conuenient dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as can be wished, n√©ere at hand vpon the Rocks.</p>
            <p>This day, about one a clocke after noone, came from the Eastward two Canoas abord vs, wherein was he that refused to stay with vs for a pawne, and with him six other Saluages which we had not s√©ene before, who had beautified themselues after their manner very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, though their clothing was not differing from the former, yet they had newly painted their faces very d√©ep, some all blacke, some red, with stripes of excellent blew ouer their vpper lips,<note place="margin">

One of them ware a kinde of Coronet about his head, made very cunningly, of a substance like stiffe haire coloured red, broad, and more then a handfull in depth, which we imagined to be some ensigne of his superioritie: for he so much est√©emed it as he would not for any thing exchange the same. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ware the white feathered skins of some fowle, round about their head, iewels in their eares, and bracelets of little white round bone, fastned together vpon a leather string. These made not any shew that they had notice of the other before taken, but we vnderstood them by their sp√©ech and signes, that they came sent from the <hi>Bashabes,</hi> and that his desire was that we would bring vp our ship (which they call as their owne boats, a <hi>Quiden</hi>) to his house, being, as they pointed, vpon the main towards the East, from whence they came, and that he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with vs for Furres and Tabacco. But because our Company was but small, and now our desire was with sp√©ed to discouer vp the riuer, we let them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,


<pb facs="tcp:1337:14"/>
that if their <hi>Bashabes</hi> would come to vs, he should be welcome, but we would not remoue to him. Which when they vnderstood (receiuing of vs bread and fish, and euery of them a knife) they departed; for we had then no will to stay them long abord, least they should discouer the other Saluages which we had stowed below.</p>

            <p>I will not prefer it before our riuer of <hi>Thames,</hi> because it is <hi>Englands</hi> richest treasure; but we all did wish those excellent Harbours, good d√©eps in a continuall conuenient breadth, and small tide gates, to be aswell therein for our countries good, as we found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> here (beyond our hopes) in certaine, for those to whom it shall please God to grant this land for habitation; which if it had, with the other inseparable adherent commodities here to be found; then I would boldly affirme it to be the most rich, beautifull, large &amp; secure harbouring riuer that the world affoordeth.</p>
            <p>Wednesday, the twelfth of Iune, our Captaine manned his light-horseman with 17 men, and ranne vp from the ship riding in the riuer vp to the codd<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> thereof, where we landed, leauing six to k√©epe the light-horseman till our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Ten of vs with our shot, and some armed, with a boy to carry powder and match, marched vp into the countrey towards the mountaines, which we descried at our first falling with the land. Unto some of them the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought vs so n√©ere, as we iudged our selues when we landed to haue beene within a league of them: but we marched vp about foure miles in the maine,<note place="margin">

And surely it did all resemble a stately Parke, wherein appeare some old tr√©es with high withered tops, and other flourishing with liuing gr√©ene boughs. Upon the hilles grow notable high timber tr√©es, masts for ships of 400 tun: and at the bottome of euery hill, a little run of fresh water: but the furthest and last we passed, ranne with a great streame able to driue a mill.</p>

            <p>We were no sooner come aboord our light-horseman, returning towards our ship, but we espied a Canoa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the further part of the Cod of the riuer East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which hasted to vs; wherin, with two others, was he who refused to stay for a pawne: and his comming was very earnestly importing to haue one of our men to go lie on shore with their Bashabes (who was there on shore, as they signed) and then the next morning he would come to our ship with many Furres and Tabacco. This we perceiued to be only a m√©ere deuice to get possession of any of our men, to ransome all those which we had taken, which their naturall policy could not so shadow, but we did easily discouer and preuent. These meanes were by this Saluage practised, because we had one of his kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prisoner, as we iudged by his most kinde vsage of

            <p>Thursday, the 13 of Iune, by two a clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (because our Captaine would take the helpe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the tide) in the light-horseman with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany well prouided and furnished with armour and shot both to defend and offend; we went from our ship vp to that part of the riuer which trended Westward into the maine, to search that: and we carried with vs a Crosse, to erect at that point, which (because it was not daylight) we left on the shore vntill our returne backe; when we set it vp in maner as the former.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>We set vp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other crosse.</hi>
               </note> For this (by the way) we diligently obserued, that in no place, either about the Ilands, or vp in the maine, or alongst the riuer, we could discerne any token or signe, that euer any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an had b√©ene before; of which either by cutting wood, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for water, or setting vp Crosses (a thing neuer omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Christian trauellers) we should haue percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued some mention left.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our riuer, further vp into which we then rowed by estimation twenty miles, the beauty and goodnesse wherof I can not by relation sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate. That which I can say in generall is this: What profit or pleasure soeuer is described and truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the former part of the riuer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conueniency of transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> is wholly doubled in this; for the bredth and depth is such, that any ship draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 17 or 18 foot water, might haue passed as farre as we went with our light-horsman, and by all our mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much further, because we left it in so good depth and bredth; which is so much the more to be est√©emed of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woorth, by how much it trendeth further vp into the maine: for from the place of our ships riding in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the entrance into the Sound, to the furthest part we were in this riuer, by our estimation was not much lesse than threescore miles.</p>
            <p>From ech banke of this riuer are diuers branching streames into the maine, wherby is affoorded an vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able profit by the conueniency of transportation from


<pb facs="tcp:1337:17"/>
place to place, which in some countries is both chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not so fit, by cariages on waine, or horsebacke.</p>
            <p>H√©ere we saw great store of fish, some great, leaping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue water, which we iudged to be Salmons. All along is an excellent mould of ground. The wood in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, especially on the East side, very thinne, chiefly oke and some small yoong birch, bordering low vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; all fit for medow and pasture ground: and in that space we went, we had on both sides the riuer many plaine plots of medow, some of thr√©e or foure acres, some of eight or nine:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meddow and Grasse.</hi>
               </note> so as we iudged in the whole to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thirty and forty acres of good grasse, and where the armes run out into the Maine, there likewise went a space on both sides of cl√©ere grasse, how far we know not, in many places we might see paths made to come downe to the watering.</p>
            <p>The excellencie of this part of the Riuer, for his good breadth, depth, and fertile bordering ground, did so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish vs all with variety of pleasantnesse, as we could not tell what to commend, but only admired; some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to the Riuer <hi>Seuerne,</hi> (but in a higher degr√©e) and we all concluded (as I verily thinke we might right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that we should neuer see the like Riuer in euery degr√©e equall, vntill it pleased God we beheld the same againe. For the farther we went, the more pleasing it was to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, alluring vs still with expectation of better, so as our men, although they had with great labour rowed long and eat nothing (for we carried with vs no victuall, but a little ch√©ese and bread) yet they were so refreshed with the pleasant beholding thereof,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>We were loath to leaue this Riuer.</hi>
               </note> and so loath to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, as some of them affirmed, they would haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued willingly with that onely fare and labour 2 daies; but the tide not suffering vs to make any longer stay (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were to come backe with the tide) and our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine better knowing what was fit then we, and better what they in labour were able to endure, being verie loath to make any desperate hazard, where so little neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie


<pb facs="tcp:1337:17"/>
required, thought it best to make returne, because whither we had discouered was sufficient to conceiue that the Riuer ran very far into the land. For we passed six or seuen miles, altogether fresh water (whereof we all dranke) forced vp by the flowing of the Salt: which after a great while eb, where we left it, by breadth of channell and depth of water was likely to run by estimation of our whole company an vnknowen way farther: the search whereof our Captaine hath left till his returne, if it shall so please God to dispose of him and vs.</p>
            <p>For we hauing now by the direction of the omnipotent disposer of all good intents (far beyond the period of our hopes) fallen with so bold a coast, found so excellent and secure harbour, for as many ships as any nation profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ is able to set forth to Sea, discouered a Riuer, which the All-creating God, with his most liberall hand, hath made aboue report notable with his foresaid bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, bordered with a land, whose pleasant fertility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth it selfe to be the garden of nature, wherin she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to delight hir selfe, hauing hitherto obscured it to any, except to a purblind generation, whose vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it hath pleased God so to darken, as they can neither discerne, vse, or rightly est√©eme the vnualuable riches in middest whereof they liue sensually content with the barke and outward rinde, as neither knowing the sw√©etnes of the inward marrow, nor acknowledging the Deity of the Almighty giuer: hauing I say thus far proceeded, and hauing some of the inhabitant nation (of best vnderstanding we saw among them) who (learning our language) may be able to giue vs further instruction, concerning all the premised particulars, as also of their gouernours, and gouernment, situation of townes, and what else shall be conuenient, which by no meanes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we could by any obseruation of our selues learne in a long time: our Captaine now wholy intended his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for sp√©edy returne.

            <p>Sunday, the 16 of Iune, the winde being faire, and because we had set out of <hi>England</hi> vpon a Sunday, made the ilands vpon a Sunday, and as we doubt not (by Gods appointment) happily fell into our harbour vpon a Sunday; so now (bes√©eching him still with like prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to blesse our returne into <hi>England</hi> our country, and from thence with his good will and pleasure to hasten our next arriuall there) we waied Anker and quit the Land vpon a Sunday.</p>
            <p>Tuesday, the 18 day, being not run aboue 30 leagues from land, and our Captaine for his certaine knowledge how to fall with the coast, hauing sounded euery watch, and from 40 fathoms had come into good d√©eping, to 70, and so to an hundred: this day the weather being faire, after the foure a clocke watch, when we supposed not to haue found ground so farre from land, and before sounded in aboue 100 fathoms, we had ground in 24 fathomes. Wherefore our sailes being downe, <hi>Thomas King</hi> boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaine, presently cast out a hooke, and before he iudged it at ground, was fished and haled vp an exc√©eding great and well fed Cod: then there were cast out 3 or 4 more, and the fish was so plentifull and so great, as when our Captaine would haue set saile, we all desired him to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to take fish a while, because we were so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to s√©e them catch so great fish, so fast as the hooke came downe: some with playing with the hooke they tooke by the backe, and one of the Mates with two hookes at a lead at fiue draughts together haled vp tenne fishes; all

were generally very great, some they measured to be fiue foot long, and thr√©e foot about.</p>
            <p>This caused our Captaine not to maruell at the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">

               </note> for he perceiued it was a fish banke; which (for our farewell from the land) it pleased God in continuance of his blessings, to giue vs knowledge of: the abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit whereof should be alone sufficient cause to draw men againe, if there were no other good both in present cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and in hope probable to be discouered. To ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this with words, were to adde light to the Sunne: for euery one in the shippe could easily account this present commodity; much more those of iudgement, which knew what belonged to fishing, would warrant (by the helpe of God) in a short voyage with few good fishers to make a more profitable returne from hence than from <hi>New-found-land</hi>: the fish being so much greater, better fed, and abundant with traine; of which some they desired, and did bring into <hi>England</hi> to bestow among their friends, and to testifie the true report.</p>
            <p>After, we kept our course directly for <hi>England</hi> &amp; with ordinary winds, and sometime calmes, vpon Sunday the 14 of Iuly about six a clocke at night, we were come into sounding in our channell,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Further, I haue thought fit here to adde some things worthy to be regarded, which we haue obserued from the Saluages since we tooke them.</p>
            <p>First, although at the time when we surprised them, they made their best resistance, not knowing our purpose, nor what we were, nor how we meant to vse them; yet

after perceiuing by their kinde vsage we intended them no harme, they haue neuer since s√©emed discontented with vs, but very tractable, louing, &amp; willing by their best meanes to satisfie vs in any thing we demand of them, by words or signes for their vnderstanding: neither haue they at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time b√©ene at the least discord among themselues; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as we haue not s√©ene them angry, but merry; and so kinde, as if you giue any thing to one of them, he will distribute part to euery one of the rest.</p>
            <p>We haue brought them to vnderstand some English, and we vnderstand much of their language; so as we are able to aske them many things. And this we haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if we shew them any thing, and aske them if they haue it in their countrey, they will tell you if they haue it, and the vse of it, the difference from ours in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, colour, or forme: but if they haue it not, be it a thing neuer so precious, they wil denie the knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>They haue names for many starres, which they will shew in the firmament.</p>
            <p>They shew great reuerence to their King, and are in great subiection to their Gouernours: and they will shew a great respect to any we tell them are our Commanders.</p>
            <p>They shew the maner how they make bread of their Indian wheat, and how they make butter and ch√©ese of the milke they haue of the Rain-D√©ere and Fallo-D√©ere, which they haue tame as we haue Cowes.</p>

               </note> And hauing s√©ene our Indico, they make shew of it, or of some other like thing which maketh as good a blew.</p>
            <p>One especiall thing is their maner of killing the Whale, which they call Powdawe; and will describe his forme; how he bloweth vp the water; and that he is 12 fathoms long; and that they go in company of their King with a multitude of their boats,<note place="margin">
