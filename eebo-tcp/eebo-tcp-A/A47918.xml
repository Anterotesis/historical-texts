            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The Shammer Shamm'd.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is no new thing for <hi>L'Estrange</hi> to be Baited by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Agents of a Seditious, and Schismaticall Faction; and 'tis hard to say, whether the Scurrilous <hi>Libells,</hi> or the <hi>Obscure Authors</hi> of them be the more Contemptible: But yet this is a Case, wherein I cannot; either with <hi>Honour, Safety,</hi> or with <hi>Good Discretion</hi> be Silent. In short; There is a Knot of Little Fellows (but under the Government of <hi>better Heads</hi>) that are now at work to Revive the Old Story of my Tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with <hi>Young Tonge,</hi> to <hi>Invalidate Oates's Evidence</hi>; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Lies and Scandalls are Printed in favour of that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. My Purpose in these Papers is, in the first place, to lay open, the <hi>Notorious Falshood, and Malice of this Practice.</hi> And 2<hi>ly,</hi> to prove <hi>that very Design,</hi> which is <hi>charg'd VPON</hi> me, to be <hi>managed AGAINST</hi> me.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiss to Enform the Reader by the way, that in <hi>October,</hi> 1680. Upon two full hearings before his Majesty and Councell (in despight of all that <hi>Oates</hi> could <hi>say,</hi> and <hi>Tong Swear</hi> against me) I had the Honour to be twice acquitted by the Unanimous Judgment of the whole Board: The Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of which Proceedings may be seen in a <hi>Dialogue</hi> under the Title of <hi>L'Estranges Case,</hi> &amp;c. which I caused to be Publish'd upon that occasion. I shall now, as briefly as I can, set forth how the same Calumny comes to be started again.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>January last past, The Loyall Protestant-News-Paper</hi> had this following Passage in it concerning <hi>Tong,</hi> but mistaking <hi>Samuel,</hi> for <hi>Simson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas Mr.</hi> Samuel Tonge, <hi>Son to Dr.</hi> Tonge <hi>deceased, has formerly Sworn, That his own Father was the Chief Contriver of the</hi> Popish Plot; <hi>Discovered by a Man who then went under the name of Dr.</hi> O—; <hi>Now the Religious good party, seemed at that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49721:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time to be much dissatisfied, that an Intrigue so well layed, and so effectually managed, (tho never so ill Contrived,) should be thus miscarried, and then fell upon young</hi> Tonge, <hi>and declared that he was an ill Man for offering to charge his Father with such horrid Crimes, after so many Men suffered upon the account of the said</hi> Plot, <hi>and though that it were but a Contrivance of his Father and Dr.</hi> O— <hi>(so call'd then) that it was an advancement to all</hi> Protestant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters <hi>in</hi> England, Ireland, <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>and used many mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reasons with the said</hi> Tonge, <hi>that at last Mr.</hi> Tonge <hi>Complyed with the Request and Prayer of the good party; and when he was sent for again to come before the King and Council, utterly Denying all that he had sworn before; but since being touched with Remorse of conscience, offers to justifie what he had Sworn unto by his own Testimony alone; but by such</hi> Papers, <hi>circumstances and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, as he is now able to produce, without hopes of favour or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but as a penitent Sinner, that expects mercy from God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Young <hi>Tong</hi> was so hot upon this Publication, that the very next day, he directed a Paper to Mr <hi>Thompson</hi> by way of an <hi>Advertisement</hi> under his own hand, in Confirmation of what was there publish'd: though it was not Notified by <hi>Thompson</hi> till <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. and in the words following.</p>

            <p>He speaks Truth as to his <hi>Miserable Condition</hi>; for there was not a Poorer Creature in the <hi>Prison</hi>; and <hi>Cutting of Pegs for shooes</hi>; (and working hard too) for <hi>Three-half-pence a day, was the best part of his Entertainment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>Thompson's</hi> Paper of <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. that gave the <hi>Alarum,</hi> and stir'd up the Charity of some of the <hi>Well-affected Brethren</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49721:3"/>
to hearken a little after him. He was taken one day out of the Prison (as he said) by a <hi>Printer</hi>; and at his Return talk'd of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be Publish'd toward the Middle of the next Week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>L'Estrange.</hi> This Visit put him presently into <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> in his Pocket, by a Providence, which must be left to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Further Scrutiny</hi> to <hi>Un-riddle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thomson's</hi> First Publication of <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. Out comes the <hi>Buffoon-Courant,</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. with these words in't. [<hi>Has not this very</hi> Young Tonge <hi>set forth at large how he was at first tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd so suggest that Story against his Father, in a Book Printed by Mr C—in the</hi> New Exchange; <hi>but for I know not what Reasons stifled, and never suffer'd to be Publish'd? Has not this</hi> Young Tonge <hi>a hundred and a hundred times with tears in his Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayl'd, and repented of that</hi> Unnaturall <hi>Villany? Nay but a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ago, he Voluntarily declar'd that the</hi> Sense thereof <hi>lay so heavy upon him, that if ever he got out of Prison (where he was like to starve, and had scarce Cloaths to cover his Nakedness) he would forthwith Transport himself to the</hi> West-Indies; <hi>for his shame for that False and Wicked Accusation was so great, that he should not be able to walk in the streets. And is this Pittifull Fool Furbish'd up to make a</hi> New Attacque? <hi>But on the Contrary; What if this be only a Contrivance of the</hi> Popish Traytors, <hi>and their</hi> Implement Nat? <hi>What if herein he most in pudently abuses, both</hi> Old Tonge, <hi>and</hi> Young Tonge <hi>and the</hi> Publique? <hi>Then no doubt his Majesties most Honourable Privy Councell, the Judges, and all Inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and every</hi> Protestant English-man <hi>will think it Necessary to Punish Exemplarily the Villain that in Print has Broach'd such a Horrid Scandall on the</hi> Honour, Justice, Prudence <hi>and</hi> Safety <hi>of the Nation.</hi>] [Truly I do hope, and wish, with all my heart, that the Government <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> proceed against all Cheats of this Kind, with the most Severity Imaginable: But how comes <hi>Care</hi> to know more of <hi>Tongs</hi> Doings then <hi>Tong</hi> does of his own? for Every syllable which <hi>Thompson</hi> says of <hi>Tonge, Tonge</hi> says of <hi>himself</hi>: And the Question is not here, whether it be <hi>True,</hi> or <hi>False</hi>; but whether or no <hi>Tonge sayd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The matter rested here till <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. Upon which day, came forth <hi>Tong's Advertisement</hi> in <hi>Justification</hi> of <hi>Thomson,</hi> and <hi>Tong's Pretended Vindication,</hi> in <hi>Contradiction</hi> to that <hi>Advertisement.</hi> 't

            <p>Observe first, that the Printing of it [<hi>without his Knowledge or Consent</hi>] is no denial of the <hi>thing said.</hi>

And it is a Fair Hint in <hi>Janeways History</hi> of <hi>Popish Sham-Plots</hi> from the same hand again, P. 139. where he says, that [Simson <hi>made a Considerable Confession of this Conspiracy, upon Oath, before</hi> Mr Justice Bridgeman, <hi>though HAPPILY he hath reserv'd many more particulars to another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</hi>] At which rate, 'tis but rubbing up his Memory at any time, to call to mind things that never had a Being, and to lay the Plot at whose Door he pleases.

            <p>I am coming now to his <hi>Narrative</hi>; where in the <hi>First Page</hi> he has these words. [<hi>Hearing that it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that I should Swear against my Father,</hi> to take away his Life, <hi>it is as False as God is True.</hi>] This is no Denial of his <hi>Swearing against his Father</hi>; but of his Swearing against him <hi>to take away his Life.</hi> And he declares a little lower, That he was all along very tender of his Fathers Safety; with which <hi>shuffle</hi> he thinks to come off.</p>
            <p>He tells a Story, <hi>Page</hi> 11. <hi>Of my refusing to Licence a Book of his Fathers, called</hi> The Royal Martyr, <hi>unless I might Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del it to my own Capricious Humour; and that his Father was much troubled at my sawciness, and sent for his Book again.</hi> The Word <hi>Sawciness</hi> is an Expression that fits no bodies Mouth but <hi>Care</hi>'s. But to his <hi>Story</hi> now.</p>
            <p>A Book under that <hi>Title</hi> was brought to me to <hi>Licence</hi>; which upon the Perusal, I refused to do: and the Bookseller that brought it, gave me to understand who was the <hi>Author</hi> of it; and a Fair <hi>Hint</hi> in his very Countenance, what might come on't in case I would not Pass it. Upon This, for fear of <hi>After-Claps,</hi> I went to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and discours'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Dr. <hi>Tonge himself,</hi> in words to this Effect. <hi>Doctor</hi> (said I) <hi>You must Excuse me if I dare not Licence your Book; for there are Reflections in it upon the</hi> Com't: <hi>Where you say,</hi> That the Bed-Chamber men Pick the King's Pockets; <hi>and not without a Mixture of Reproaches upon the</hi> King Himself. <hi>Beside, that you are mistaken in your</hi> Annals; There's mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fact misplac'd, mis-tim'd,</hi> and <hi>misapply'd</hi>; and from thence we proceeded to a Reasoning upon some Passages in his <hi>Preface. Doctor</hi> (said I) <hi>'Tis well that both you your self, and Dr.</hi> Oates (in those days a Dr.) <hi>have so absolutely purg'd your selves to the World, that there can be no longer any doubt of your Integrity; for otherwise, there are two or three Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49721:6"/>
in your</hi> Preface, <hi>that people would go near to stumble at.</hi> As to the Business of the <hi>Bed-Chamber-men,</hi> I'le Justifie it (<hi>says the Doctor</hi>) and if there be any <hi>slips</hi> in the <hi>Story,</hi> we can set them <hi>Right.</hi> But what's your Exception to the <hi>Preface?</hi> So I told him, that in Substance the Matter was thus: [<hi>You tell the World, that you have, with Great Care, drawn up the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the</hi> Old Popish Plot (<hi>the business of</hi> Habernsfelt, &amp;c.) <hi>And that shewing it to Dr.</hi> Oates, (<hi>who very much approv'd of the Draught) you told him,</hi> Titus, <hi>It were worth the while to know if this</hi> Plot <hi>does not go on still. Go you, and put your self among the</hi> Jesuits, <hi>and enform your self whether it does, or no.</hi> You say further, That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did go among them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be One of them; and that when he came back, he told you that the Business went on, and that it was no <hi>New Plot,</hi> but the <hi>Old One continued.</hi>] Well! (<hi>says the Dr.</hi>) All this is True, and where's the Offence? So I told him, that it might be look'd upon as a strange Councel, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Give</hi> or to <hi>Take.</hi> The <hi>Advice Given</hi> is <hi>This,</hi> Go you over, <hi>Titus,</hi> and pretend to be a <hi>Papist:</hi> Take all their <hi>Oathes</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi>; joyn with them in an <hi>Idolatrous Worship,</hi> and swear your self to the <hi>Devil</hi> through Thick and Thin, only to see whether it be Cross or Pile. This seems to be the <hi>Advice Given:</hi> And the <hi>following</hi> of this <hi>Advice,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Fore-thought,</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> may be taken for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution very Extraordinary. The Doctor's Answer was to this Purpose, <hi>God Almighty will do his own Work, by his own Ways and Methods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the more Punctual in this Relation, to shew as well the Reasons why I would not Licence that Book, in respect of my <hi>self,</hi> as the Tenderness I had for the Credit of the Doctor, and for the <hi>Common Cause</hi>; by not consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Expose any thing to the Publick, that might be liable either to a <hi>Censure,</hi> or a <hi>Mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He says further in his <hi>Narrative,</hi> P. 1. [<hi>That</hi> L'Estrange <hi>in his abusive Lying</hi> Dialogue, <hi>makes</hi> Choqueux <hi>to speak of</hi> L'Estrange'<hi>s refusing to Licence</hi> The Royal Martyr; <hi>which</hi> Tonge <hi>took very ill at</hi> L'Estrange'<hi>s hands,—but</hi> Choqueux <hi>knew nothing of it.</hi>] The Truth of these Things shall be made appear in their Proper Place.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49721:6"/>
               <hi>And again in the same Page. [Mr.</hi> Choqueux (saies he) recommended me to <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> as a Person very worthy of my acquaintance, and told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had drawn up several Papers, as Objections against the Plot; and he did presume, I should be very glad of his Assistance therein. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> told me he would to his power assist me what he could, and asked me where my Papers were; for he would gladly peruse them: for he was enformed, those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had very material things in them against the Plot. That he was a great admirer of all such things, as he did not question he had demonstrated to the World by his Collections he had made concerning the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was pleased to be silent, and said that for his part, he found the whole Plot was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd with nothing else, but Improbabilities, and Ridiculous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>Choqueux,</hi> and <hi>L'Estrange</hi> discours'd concerning the late Wars, <hi>&amp;c. Ibid.</hi>]</q>
            <p>Take notice, that <hi>Tonge</hi> had drawn up some Objections against the Plot; and <hi>L'Estrange</hi> desired a <hi>sight</hi> of 'em, and yet no Papers shew'd him, nor any Answer return'd him to that Question; but thereupon he went his way. Now see forward [<hi>Going out with L'Estrange</hi> (sayes the Narrative, Pag. 12.) <hi>I ask'd him when I should wait upon him, and if he had any writing, I would transcribe any thing for him which</hi> he had to Print, <hi>but he said he had no such business, but that any Evening he should be glad to see me, and Mr.</hi> Choqueux <hi>at his House in</hi> Holborn, <hi>and went away from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's <hi>Tonge</hi> pinning himself upon <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> and <hi>L'Estrange</hi> shuffling him off, as far as decently could be done in such a Case. But see now how <hi>Tonge</hi> plies him yet with <hi>Importunities.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>[The next day <hi>after (sayes he</hi> Ibid.) <hi>Mr.</hi> Choqueux went to <hi>L'Estrange's</hi> House, and told me he was newly gone out, but he said to morrow in the Evening I should go along with him to <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange.</hi>]</q>
            <p>You will see by and by that I went out of the way on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to avoid him; and that <hi>Tonge</hi> wrote me a Letter next Morning, desiring me in regard that he miss'd me last night, to appoint him some other time, for <hi>he had something to say to me,</hi> whereupon I appointed him at seven that Evening. And see how he proceeds. [<hi>Crawley</hi> (sayes he Ibid.) <hi>coming
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49721:7"/>
to the</hi> Savoy <hi>before we</hi> (Choqueux <hi>and</hi> Tonge) <hi>were gone, went along with us, whom I suppose</hi> L'Estrange <hi>had no acquaintance with. But</hi> Crawley <hi>went, thinking he might have something to say to him in relation to his Papers. So soon as we came into the Room where</hi> L'Estrange <hi>was, he desired Mr.</hi> Choqueux <hi>and</hi> Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>to withdraw; (for he said it look'd too much like a Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) who went out and expected my coming out into the street.</hi>]</p>
            <p>It is false, that <hi>Choqueux</hi> and <hi>Crawley</hi> were desir'd to with draw; but Mr. <hi>Crawley,</hi> and a <hi>fourth person</hi> that came with them in Company, were fairly hinted to withdraw, because (as I said) <hi>it would look like a consult.</hi> And they did withdraw; but <hi>Choqueux</hi> stay'd a while after them.</p>
            <q>[Then being together (<hi>sayes the Narrative, Ibid.</hi>) meaning <hi>Tonge</hi> and <hi>L'Estrange</hi>) he asked me whether I had a Copy of that Enformation which was delivered to the King, I told him I had not, only some loose Papers relating to it; but I could recite se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Material Passages of it. Then <hi>L'Estrange</hi> writ them down, and asked me whether I had no more to say, I told him I had not, and said when he had more leisure, and had all my Enforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he would swear me to them. I told him, I did not care to be sworn to any of my Papers, <hi>&amp;c.] This point shall be clear'd hereafter, where it will fall more naturally in my way.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I shall not need to amplify upon the Particulars above-mentioned any further in this place, then to recommend it to the Reader's Observation. First, that the <hi>Persons Visibly concern'd in these Scandalous Libells, are only Tonge,</hi> (as a Fool for the Faction to make use of) <hi>Curtis,</hi> (the Publisher of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> the <hi>Pacquet,</hi> and the <hi>Vindication) Janeway,</hi> (the Publisher of the <hi>Popish Sham-plots</hi>) and <hi>Care,</hi> the <hi>Presumptive Author</hi> of these four Pamphlets: of whose <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> the World is sufficiently sensible already, without need of any further Enformation.</p>
            <p>Now though as it is the Common business of these Fellows to Bespatter the Government, and all degrees of Men, as well as Particular Persons, that Interpose toward the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the King and the Laws. Their spleen and Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are yet so Peculiarly bent at me, that I dare be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to produce at least <hi>three hundred</hi> Scandalous, Rank and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49721:7"/>
Notorious <hi>Lyes,</hi> that these servile wretches, (taking in <hi>Baldwin</hi> for another) have published barefac'd against my single self; and I do verily believe, I may safely say, as many several Libels: But having already made an Express Application to the Magistracy of the City, for <hi>Justice, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and <hi>Private</hi> upon the Infamous Authors of these Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Papers: I make no question, but the Generous, and Loyall Governours of this City, having both the <hi>Crimes</hi> and the <hi>Criminals</hi> openly lay'd <hi>before them,</hi> and the matter, in both respects falling expresly under their Cognizance and Jurisdiction; I make no doubt, I say, but my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen will exert their Authority to the uttermost, in calling these Flagitious Incendiaries to a strict account. So that I shall now pass forward to my main business.</p>
            <p>That is to say, <hi>First,</hi> To shew that there is a <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> by Hook or by Crook, to make <hi>me</hi> a <hi>Suborner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>Discharge</hi> my self of that <hi>Impudent,</hi> and <hi>Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Calummy,</hi> by <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Undeniable Proofs, Inferences,</hi> and <hi>Presumptions</hi> to the <hi>contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make it out, beyond all dispute, that the Project has been, from First to Last, to <hi>Trepan me,</hi> by trying how far I might be prevail'd upon to entertain any Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>discrediting, shamming,</hi> or <hi>Ridiculing</hi> the <hi>damnable Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Popish Plot</hi>; which has been <hi>Attested,</hi> and <hi>Confirm'd,</hi> by the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> of so many Parliaments.</p>
            <p>There needs no more for the making out of the <hi>First Point,</hi> than what is said already; which for Order sake, I shall briefly sum up yet once again: <hi>Care</hi> in his <hi>Courant</hi> of the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1681, Charges me with <hi>Renewing my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Mr.</hi> Tonge, <hi>and endeavouring a</hi> Fresh Intrigue <hi>of the</hi> Old Stamp. <hi>Care</hi> again in <hi>Tonge's Pretended Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> has hook'd me into the [<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] in the <hi>Title Page, and his other material Passages Omitted in the</hi> Affidavit, [&amp;c.]—by drawing my Name into the Book, within the compass of that, [<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and the <hi>Supplemental Reserve.</hi> The same <hi>Care</hi> again, in <hi>Janeway's Sham Plots,</hi> gives an account Pag. 139. <hi>That over and above</hi> Tonge's <hi>Oath to Mr. Justice</hi> Bridgeman, <hi>he hath reserv'd many more Particulars to another Opportunity</hi>;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49721:8"/>
which gives him Liberty till the Day of Judgment, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Evidence. It is a farther Presumption of a <hi>Design; First,</hi> the Calculating of their <hi>Narrative,</hi> for the <hi>Oxford Parliament,</hi> to take me Unprovided, and by Surprize. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> By the keeping it so Close ever since, for fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Villany of it Detected, and Expos'd; And then the <hi>Publishing</hi> of it now at last, under a <hi>False Name,</hi> is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confirmation of the Foulness of that <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might suffice to the <hi>Second Point,</hi> that I was Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Discharg'd by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council; Oates</hi> and <hi>Tonge</hi> being present, and not having One word to say in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to my Defence: But it is not a likely matter, over and above, that I should have a Design upon <hi>Tonge,</hi> and at the same time shake him off from fastening himself upon me. That I should enter into that Liberty of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: of <hi>Censuring</hi> the <hi>Plot, Drawing him</hi> in to raise Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against it, and to represent it as the <hi>Invention</hi> of his <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it not a likely matter again, that I should <hi>ask</hi> him for his <hi>Papers,</hi> and he should give me no Answer; and that I should so Greedily Interest my self in a <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Curiosity</hi> to be dabbling with him, and yet at the same time, <hi>refuse any Information from him, but under his own hand:</hi> And with this Condition An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd, <hi>That he should declare it to be his own Voluntary Act, and ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It will be Objected perhaps, that though this Plea may serve well enough for what's <hi>past,</hi> or at least for what has been produc'd against me upon Legal Testimony: But what if he should come upon second Thoughts, (as other People have done) to refresh his <hi>Memory,</hi> and Re-inforce his <hi>Evidence,</hi> or Charge me (as <hi>Care</hi> calls it) with <hi>[a Fresh Intrigue of the Old Stamp] till I found</hi> (as the <hi>Pacquetier</hi> has it) <hi>that</hi> Tonge <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I shall say nothing now to the <hi>Many, Gross, Virulent,</hi> and Scandalous Falshoods that are scatter'd Up and Down these Venemous Papers; but refer the Reader to what I have to say upon the <hi>Third Head,</hi> wherein I shall set forth the Naked Truth of the Matter; and make it Evident, that the <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> and <hi>Tampering</hi> has been on the <hi>other side</hi>; and that instead of <hi>my Wheedling</hi> of <hi>Tonge</hi> into a <hi>Complication</hi> against his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; it has been the Business of <hi>Young Tonge, his Fellows,</hi> and <hi>Directors,</hi> from One End to the other of this affair, to draw <hi>L'Estrange</hi> into the <hi>Toil.</hi> This is the Third and the Last Point, and I shall Handle it at large.</p>
            <p>The Design of <hi>Tonge</hi>'s putting a <hi>Sham</hi> upon me (by the Order and Instruction, I suppose, of his Superiors) must bear Date a good while before I ever so much as saw the Face of him; As appears by his Propounding <hi>me</hi> (though an Absolute <hi>Stranger</hi> to him) as a fit Person for him to Advise withal, about the Menage, and Government of his Design: and making twenty sleeveless Pretences for getting into my Acquaintance; besides the Visible Importunities of Pressing upon me, after I knew him; and the Use he made of the most Frivolous Accidents, to Improve all Circumstances to my Disadvantage. And then the whole Story is Far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first time that ever he saw me, (as himself confesses) or that I ever saw him, was at <hi>Monsieur Choqueux</hi>'s, by the occasion of my going thither to Enquire about some Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the late War. This was some Months after his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till she call'd him down; and there I found a Person to me unknown, which, it seems, was <hi>Young Tonge,</hi> as I was afterwards En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Master of the Lodgings when he came down. I found the Fopp to be Talkative, and so I let him run on in a Nonsensical Story of the Privacies that had pass'd betwixt <hi>Oates,</hi> and his <hi>Father,</hi> certain <hi>Papers</hi> concerning the <hi>Plot</hi> that were Written in <hi>Greek Characters,</hi> and hid behind the <hi>Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scout</hi>; and a Foolery of one <hi>Green,</hi> a <hi>Weaver,</hi> that meeting his Father in the <hi>Court of Requests,</hi> told him for News (and without any knowledge of him too) that <hi>E've long, there would be a Popish Massacre</hi>: Whereupon, (says <hi>Young Tonge</hi>) my Father made an acquaintance with him, and out came the <hi>Plot.</hi> He shew'd me likewise an Abuse upon some of the <hi>King's Evidence,</hi> in a kind of a Disguise like a <hi>Romance,</hi> which he said was of his own Composing, and I found he had a mind to Unriddle it to me; but I stopp'd him short; Adviz'd him against it; and made what haste Civilly I could, to get quit of his Company, and to deliver my self from the <hi>Nauscous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as well as the <hi>Danger</hi> of so <hi>Impertinent,</hi> and <hi>Suspitious</hi> an <hi>Acquaintance.</hi> This was before I had ever seen the Eyes of <hi>Capt. Ely</hi>; but coming soon after to the knowledge of him, it was my Lesson both to <hi>him,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Choqueux,</hi> to have a Care of that Young Fellow for fear of having a Trick put upon them: So far was I from making <hi>that Fool</hi> my <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> that I did not think it safe to have any thing at all to do with him; The <hi>Incredibility</hi> of his <hi>Evidence</hi> being the best <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> that any Man can have that keeps him <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after This, Capt. <hi>Ely</hi> returns from <hi>Windsor,</hi> (where he had been it seems upon <hi>Tonge</hi>'s Errand) and my having some Inkling of his Business there, made me a little curious to find him one, and learn from him the Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

the <hi>Councel</hi> against <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Choqueux,</hi> and that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> was brought in for a <hi>Third Man.</hi> This <hi>Alarum</hi> put me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think my self, and to provide for the worst that Malice and Perjury could pretend against me: For I could easily see tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Tonge</hi>; and <hi>Oates</hi> had already pronounc'd me, in all his <hi>Haunts</hi> and <hi>Gangs,</hi> as deep in the Practice, as the most <hi>Confident</hi> and <hi>Shameless Asseveration</hi> of any thing; short of a <hi>Verbum Sacerdotis</hi> could make me.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I apply'd my Self to Captain <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur Choqueux,</hi> (being both Clear of the Councel) to make Oath before some Master of the <hi>Chancery</hi> to the Truth of certain Particulars, wherein I might possibly come to be Concern'd, if there should happen to be any Combination carryed on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me.

                        <p>This Deponent further Enformeth, that the said <hi>Tonge</hi> made mention of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> in a certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per about the latter end of <hi>July</hi> last, (to this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents best Remembrance) as a person that might be

                        <p>☞ Being informed that my Uncle, Captain <hi>Tonge,</hi> hath maliciously aspers'd me, that I have made a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and disown'd my former Enformation given in to his Majesty; <hi>As I hope to be saved</hi>; I never did make any such Recantation, though I was mightily urg'd thereunto by my Uncle, and to lay it upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. But the Enformation was all true, and in the Discharge of my Duty and Conscience; And that it was my own spontaneous Act, without the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of any Advantage, Benefit, or Reward; or by the Procurement, Direction or Abetting of any Person whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>This Declaration being by him the said <hi>Sympson Tonge</hi> Written in the presence of two other Persons, and this Deponent, of his own proper motion, and without any advice thereunto; and it was likewise attested by this Deponent and the two Persons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.

one half hour, (as this Deponent verily believes) from the time after this Deponent's first hearing the Report.</p>
                        <p>And finally, This Deponent saith further, That he heard Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> (being in Discourse with Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi>) caution the said Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> to have a care what he said to that Fellow (meaning Young <hi>Tonge</hi>) for he would lay hold of any thing to ruine you.

                        <p n="2">II.

                        <p n="7">VII. That hereupon, this Deponent told Mr. <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi> (upon Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi>'s desiring it) that Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> offer'd to inform him of what he had delivered to the King; and that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> reply'd, If he has any thing material to present to me, as a Justice of Peace, for the King's Service, I'le give him his Oath and receive it; upon condition that he declare it to be his own Act, without any motive to it from my self; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I will not meddle in it; or Words to the same import: And that Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> said this was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, but that he had not such an Information rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawn: That so this Deponent went away to a place hard by, and about a quarter of an hour after, returning that way, saw Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> come out of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s House with two or three little Printed Books in his hand, which he said Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> had given him.</p>

            <p>Upon the whole matter here's more then enough said to this point, and to prove that it was thus far an <hi>Intrigue</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on in a direct Train for the Inveighling of me into a share. I shall now proceed to the laying open of a <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or rather a <hi>Repetition</hi> of the <hi>same Project,</hi> under the <hi>Countenance,</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>same Prosligate Agents.</hi> I shall here Publish the whole truth of the matter, in hope that the <hi>Government</hi> will proceed for the <hi>securing</hi> of <hi>honest men,</hi> in their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Reputations,</hi> against a Band of <hi>Sanguinary Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers,</hi> and <hi>Prostitute Knights of the Post</hi>; and not suffer the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> to be <hi>Shamm'd,</hi> and <hi>Expos'd</hi> to the Highest degree of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> and <hi>Discredit imaginable,</hi> only in the Contemplation of drawing in some <hi>Conscientious Protestant</hi> or other, that has a true Veneration for the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> barely to the <hi>hearing</hi> of the <hi>Story</hi>; for that's sufficient to the Case here in question.

            <p>In the <hi>First</hi> business of <hi>Tonge,</hi> I kept my self upon such a <hi>Guard,</hi> as in <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> I thought my self oblig'd to do, and it was well I did so, for a much wiser man then my self might have ventur'd further, perhaps, then in that Case I thought it convenient to do. I do not speak as to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49721:13"/>
entering into any <hi>Unlawfull Act,</hi> or <hi>Consultation</hi>; but to the keeping of my self clear from any Reasonable Ground for the least <hi>Jealousie,</hi> or <hi>Suspicion.</hi> And yet all this Pre-caution notwithstanding; how did the <hi>Weekly News-papers</hi> Publish me over the <hi>Three Kingdoms</hi> for <hi>the Greatest Villain in Nature!</hi> For a matter of six weeks or two months together, without either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Controll</hi>; and no more in the whole matter, than the <hi>Impudence</hi> of Two or Three <hi>Mercenary Rascals</hi> to raise all this <hi>Scandall</hi> and <hi>Clamour.</hi> This experience taught me so much wit, (though to my cost) as for the future, never to have any thing to do with this sort of Catell again, but upon Terms of stricter <hi>Reserve</hi>; so that I took up a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; if ever any further attempt of the same kind should be made upon me, I would fairly endeavour to spoil the jest, and set the Saddle upon the Right Horse. And this is my present Case, wherein I shall Govern my self by the <hi>Rules of a Good ChristJan,</hi> a <hi>Good Subject,</hi> and an <hi>Honest Man.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>You say that you were prest by your</hi> Uncle <hi>first, and afterward by</hi> College <hi>and</hi> Oates, <hi>to Accuse me falsly.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But you do not say how often he sent for you: by whom: to what place, or places: whether by word of mouth, or by Letter: Or if upon your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p>I Received yours, and am very desirous of the <hi>Truth,</hi> being very confident that a great deal of Roguery and Villany lyes still undiscovered at the bottom of the <hi>Plot.</hi> But I am no wayes able to answer those Questions you Propose to me, so as to give you any tolerable satisfaction, unless that I were in Possession of my Fathers Papers, which would best clear what you desire. After my Fathers Death, I was enform'd, that those Papers he left at <hi>Colleges</hi> House, were seiz'd by the <hi>Counceil,</hi> and my <hi>Uncle,</hi> under pretence of <hi>Administring</hi> for me has seiz'd on the rest. This I am certain of, that if those Papers ever come to light they will discover very strange things. I have been now confin'd upwards of a <hi>Twelve-month</hi>; and am now in a very <hi>Indigent Condition</hi> on the <hi>Common-side</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other <hi>Subsistence</hi> then the <hi>Basket:</hi> and the place I am in is no wayes suitable for writing, or any thing of serious thoughts. I Question not your Zeal for his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family</hi>; and I think you could not do a greater service than to enquire, if you can any wayes know which way my Fathers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were disposed. Untill that be found out, I shall be in the dark, and no way able to give ye any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable result to any Questions: For the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> by reason of the several Persons concerned in it, is so <hi>Intricate</hi> a thing, that to unravell it from first to last, and give you a Particular account of all the several Transactions, is more then I dare Assume upon me; and by reason of my confinement, I have forgot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny material things, which before would have occur'd

            <p>Any man with half an Eye may see the Drist of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The <hi>Charity</hi> of a <hi>Single six pence</hi> would have pass'd for a <hi>Subornation.

At the same time with the former of the <hi>second,</hi> I received from him also this following Letter. Superscribed, <hi>For his Honoured Friend</hi> Roger L'Estrange.</p>

                     <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>

                  <p>I Received yours of the last <hi>Instant,</hi> (mistaken for <hi>Dec.</hi> 31.) and do briefly return you this Answer, untill I can better recollect my memory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to your first Question, what means was used to bring me to accuse you, when I was examind'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> at Captain <hi>Richardson's</hi> House, <hi>Oates</hi> asked me if you were not concern'd with me, I told him I had seen you once, but could not accuse you of any thing; then he replyed he knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and if I would not discover it, it should be the worse for me, and threatn'd me very much, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49721:18"/>
me no money; and none were present with me, but Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> his Clerk and <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The first Message I had, from my Uncle Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Tonge,</hi> was by a young man that waited on him; who brough me a letter, and desir'd me to come to him to the <hi>Golden Anchor</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> whether I came, and having drunk several Bottles of <hi>Canary</hi> with him, I desir'd to take my leave of him; who importun'd me to stay, and then call'd for several Bottles more: and said he had a Paper that I must sign, and sinding me unwilling, he drunk me to such a pitch that I was quite drunk, and then I sign'd the Paper.</p>
                  <p>He sent likewise twice for me to the Half <hi>Moon</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where he likewise drunk me very high, and said he would give me some allowance towards my relief, and sent one Mrs. <hi>Lamb</hi> to me with half a Crown, and promised that hence forwards he would send me three shillings and six pence a week, which I constantly had sent me till of late.</p>
                  <p>The arguments he made use of were, that though I were imprison'd, I should be supply'd with what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries I wanted, and that he would endeavour to purchase me my liberty, and discharge my Chamber Rent, and Fees on the <hi>Master-side</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Father used to take Notes out of a great Book, it was a Suppliment after <hi>Hollinshed</hi> left off, and was joyn'd to his, and was writ as I have heard him say by one <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>Hows,</hi> and there were other little Books written by <hi>Hocker</hi> or <hi>Hopper,</hi> that was the Witness, and Prosecuted the <hi>Jesuits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not very well remember which, but it may be found by comparing the Letters with <hi>Oates</hi> and my <hi>Fathers</hi> Hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49721:19"/>One <hi>E</hi>— knows much, for he helped to write some of the Papers which my Father left were taken at <hi>College's</hi> House, and my Uncle sent one Mr. <hi>H</hi>- to me, in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and brought one who was a stranger to me, with a Paper, to <hi>Administer</hi> on my behalf, and sign'd it, and under pretence of <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring</hi> for me hath seiz'd on the rest of my Fathers Papers.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>H</hi>— studies <hi>Physick,</hi> and lives not far from <hi>C</hi>— but I cannot remember the Court, but the Person he Lodges near, is <hi>High-Constable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I can make no better Answer at present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have no place to recollect my self: In the mean time I desire you would accept of this, which is no other then the Truth, from</p>

The <hi>Contrivance</hi> was thus: That under the pretence of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> (which my <hi>Father</hi> first Imagin'd was on foot, and afterwards <hi>Oates</hi> at his <hi>Second Return,</hi> swore to be true) Their main and principal Design was to Disinherit His <hi>Royal Highness.</hi> The First persons that manag'd the <hi>Plot,</hi> and were privy to it, were my <hi>Father Oates,</hi> &amp;c. The last time I was with <hi>B</hi>—, he told me he had something to write, that was not sit to be nam'd, but he had burnt it; and said, he was afraid those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would make him mad, should he write any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and that my Father would trust none but him to Transcribe them, and he could not deny him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no other <hi>Livelihood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49721:20"/>My Father advis'd <hi>Oates</hi> to write the <hi>Plot</hi> in <hi>Greek Letters,</hi> because that none but themselves might be privy to what was doue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copy</hi> which was in <hi>Greek Letters</hi> was burnt by <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they came to <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> Mr. — was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in for an <hi>Assistant,</hi> after he had been sworn to Secrecy.</p>
                  <p>They went to <hi>Fox-Hall</hi> by my Father's advice, to the end they might be the more private, where those Papers they wrote at — were put into Form, and deliver'd into the <hi>Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After they all Three remov'd from <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> and Nail'd up the Chamber-door, having left several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers behind; and my Father understanding by <hi>Mr. Lambert,</hi> that the Door was broken up by the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,</hi> and the Papers like to be seiz'd on, was much troubl'd at it, and sent away the Rent that was due by his Man <hi>Richard</hi> — now living at — who brought back the <hi>Papers</hi> with him, and can Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the same.</p>

            <p>By this time, <hi>Tonge,</hi> and his <hi>Advisers,</hi> finding that they could not Compass their End; and Mr. <hi>Thompson</hi>'s <hi>News-Paper</hi> having given Vent to the Design, they lay'd their Heads together to make the best Retreat they could; and to Face a <hi>Shamm</hi> upon the World, as if <hi>L'Estrange had been already up to the Ears in a New Plot:</hi> But they were so Thankful however as to Cover the Back-side of the Poor Fellow for his <hi>Good-Will,</hi> put some few Pence in his Pocket, and preserve him from Starving this bout, in hope of a more favourable Opportunity. But this shall not serve their Turn, if there be any Reverence left for the Memory of the <hi>Popish Plot</hi>; or any Justice to be obtain'd upon Those Miscreants that make it their business to teare up the very Foundation of it by the Roots; For the worst is yet to come, and <hi>under Tonge's Hand,</hi> and <hi>by him Attested,</hi> as well as all the rest.</p>

               <p>When I came from the University (<hi>says he</hi>) in the Year 77. I found <hi>Oates</hi> with my <hi>Father,</hi> in a very poor Condition, who complained he knew not what to do to get Bread; who went under the Name of <hi>Ambrose.</hi> My Father took him home, and gave him Cloaths, Lodging, and Dyet, saying he would put him into a way.</p>
               <p>And then he perswaded him to get acquainted among the <hi>Papists;</hi> and when he had done so, then my Father told him, there had been many <hi>Plots</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to bring
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49721:22"/>
in <hi>Popery,</hi> and if he would go over among the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and Observe their ways, it was possible it might be One now; and if he could make it out, it would be his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ever. But however, if he could get their <hi>Names,</hi> and a little <hi>Acquaintance</hi> from the <hi>Papists,</hi> it would be an Easie matter to stir up the people to fear <hi>Popery.] And again,</hi> My <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>He</hi> (Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>) went and Lodg'd at <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> at One <hi>Lamberts,</hi> a <hi>Bell-Founder,</hi> (which House was call'd by the Neighbours the <hi>Plot-House</hi>; And there <hi>Oates</hi>'s <hi>Narrative</hi> was Written; whereof <hi>several Copies</hi> were VVritten, very <hi>Different,</hi> the One from the Other; and the <hi>Four Jesuites</hi> Letters (wherein <hi>Oates</hi> pretended was the whole Discovery) were <hi>Counterfeits,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All this I have to shew under <hi>Tonge</hi>'s Hand, and I Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Men and Angels, if, it be not the Boldest Attempt that ever was yet made upon the Credit of the <hi>Popish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy:</hi> And sufficient to shake any Man's Faith, as to That Point, that were not Proof against the Utmost Effects of <hi>Malice, Impudence,</hi> and <hi>Imposture.</hi> So many Particulars, so Boldly, and Openly Attested; in the Face of so many <hi>Witnesses, Tryals, Convictions, Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Executions!</hi> And all this, Expresly Level'd at the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Publique Justice</hi> with only the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate, and Faithless Practices of the Instrument to Weigh against the Impious Design, and the Desperate Effects and Consequences of so Daring a Scandal. But let the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be never so Incredible and Ridiculous; It is a thing of great Mischief yet to suffer the Authors of these B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>its and Rumours to pass Unpunish'd: for Malevolent Spirits will be apt to say; <hi>If there were not something into, how is it, that the Reporters of these Fables come to scape?</hi> The Best thing he has to say for himself, will be, perhaps, that he has not so much publish'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These <hi>Shamms</hi> by way of <hi>Affront</hi> to the <hi>Plot,</hi> as thrown them out for a <hi>Bait</hi> for <hi>L'Estrange</hi> to Chop at: So that the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49721:22"/>
               <hi>English Government</hi> must, at this rate, be <hi>Expos</hi>'d, upon the Experiment of Trying to Engage, and Hamper <hi>L'Estrange</hi> in the <hi>Intrigue.</hi> But alas! I am so thoroughly satisfied in the Business of the <hi>Plot</hi>; and the whole Scheme of it is so Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and Distinctly in my Head, that I have not the least Curiosity in the World to know more on't; Beside; That <hi>In vain is the Net spread in the sight of the Bird.</hi> I have not Concern'd my self to Hunt after <hi>his Fathers Papers,</hi> to Trace out <hi>his Fathers Agents</hi>; nor Directly, or Indirectly made any sort of Applications Pursuant to his <hi>Purpose,</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi>; but Innocently held him in play with <hi>Letter</hi> for <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to keep up the <hi>Rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Only Thing that stuck with me upon the thought of this Publication, was the Nicety of Committing those Papers to a Publique View, which might seem perhaps to be deposited in my Hands under some sort of <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Trust:</hi> But when I consider'd, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> other hand, that These Letters were meant only as <hi>Snares</hi> to me under the Semblance of That <hi>Confidence,</hi> I was my own Confessor in the Case, and easily discharg'd my self of That Scruple: And not without a Further Sense neither of Duty to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>In Conclusion; I have here made a Fair Discovery of a Foul Practice, both upon the <hi>Publique,</hi> and upon my <hi>Self</hi>; I was to have been <hi>Trappan'd</hi> the <hi>One</hi> way, and <hi>Tonge</hi> is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected</hi> the <hi>Other.</hi> I shall remit the rest to the Wisdom of my Superiors, how far it may be either Safe, or Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Encourage this way of Proceeding; Even to the Violation of <hi>Common-Faith,</hi> and <hi>Society. The Plot's a</hi> Sham (says <hi>Tonge</hi>;) If <hi>L'Estrange</hi> says so too, 'tis almost as much as his Neck's worth: Why should not This <hi>Scandalous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front</hi> now, be as <hi>Dangerous</hi> to <hi>Tonge</hi> for the <hi>Starting</hi> of it, as it would have been to <hi>L'Estrange</hi> if he had <hi>Joyn'd</hi> in't? <hi>Trapanning</hi> will become a <hi>Trade,</hi> (Nay, and <hi>Forswearing</hi> too) if Men shall find it their <hi>Interest,</hi> First to play the <hi>Knaves,</hi> or the <hi>Cheats,</hi> and then (as I said before) come off for the <hi>Discovery,</hi> and set up for <hi>Enformers.</hi> This is the Case; and if I had done less, I had been wanting both to the <hi>Publique,</hi> and to <hi>My Self.</hi>
