            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46166:3"/>
Treatise to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, The rise and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it.</p>
            <p>What I have collected, the faults excepted, hath been much out of your own Observations, writ in a Stile, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship must pardon, that it may live.</p>
            <p>When I first visited your <hi>Spaw,</hi> I approacht its Avenues with some prejudice, being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't of the Efficacy of
<pb facs="tcp:46166:3"/>
Waters (though I have observed some, and read of more) in comparison of a well order'd Method in Physick, which I still favour: Though in pertinacious obstructions, and diseases, that must be long hewing down, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to those Parts through which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may pass, incline much to their use, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if Patients (nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating variety of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines)
<pb facs="tcp:46166:4"/>
can comply with These, as more natural and obvious to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, I cannot approve of such fictitious waters, as some by a pretended skill, in opposition to natural <hi>Spaws,</hi> say they can apt to this or that distemper. No, I am not convinct that Art (though in some great Masters of it, it may arise to a wonderful
<pb facs="tcp:46166:4"/>
Excellency) can yet ever so deliciously compose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as to equal the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Spirits, which God and Nature hath with so much Curiosity mixt in the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
            <p>A truth <hi>Fallopius</hi> seems to deny, <hi>hac ratione du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, quod ob eorum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditatem</hi> (speaking of concrete Minerals) <hi>nihil ab iis abradi possit;</hi> which

               <hi>Julius Caesar Claudinus</hi> in his <hi>ingressu ad infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos (p. 373.)</hi> clearly confutes, aswell from their first as their second quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; with whom our Learned <hi>Jorden</hi> in his discourse of Baths, and mineral waters (<hi>p. 63.</hi>) agrees, that before Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals have their full Consistence, whilst they are <hi>in solutis principiis,</hi> as earth, juice, or vapours (afterwards indeed they
<pb facs="tcp:46166:5"/>
will need some Medium, or Corrosive to unite them with the water) they may be communicated with water, <hi>non qua Talia sunt</hi> (to inforce <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his words) <hi>secundum suam substantiam, sed per soluta sua Principia, terras (scil.) succos &amp; vapores.</hi>

            <p>And here I would not be mistook, as if by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial consulting of the manner of drinking these <hi>Spaws</hi> I insinuate such a necessity of advising alwaies with Physicians, as no Dose could effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually be took without them: No, that were to supply the defect of practice by the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

                  <p>Adjoyning to it, there is a large field (of late repurcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> for the freer access of all comers thither) by nature cast into such order, as men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may have a full conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency for their walks and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, without trespassing on eithers modesty, and that with diversity of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46166:14"/>
too, there being shrubs, plants, and young trees of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sorts and uses.</p>
                  <p>A fathom scarce sounds the bottom, where there is laid a large Mill-stone, through the hole of which the Spring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces its passage, casting up (within a foot of the surface) a cleer silver sand, mixt with such variety of little thin Cockle-shells, and some Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwinkles curiously filed by the penetrable quality of the vitriol, as the finest glass is not more perspicuous, more smooth, that were a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope set to inlarge their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute bodies, what figures, what improvement, what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46166:15"/>
objects might thence capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the eye? more and no less I am perswaded than Mr. <hi>Hooke</hi> in his Book hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to admiration, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing (as Dr. <hi>Power</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy hath it) the dull world how curiously the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutest things are wrought, and with what signatures of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich't, which (as it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently observed in the Beauty of Providence) doth not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall under our sense and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation: And yet none of these, or any of the sand ever mixes with the stream, though it issues (through a large hole
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46166:15"/>
in the side of the Cistern) with a current flux bubling in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places at once, and is of that strength, that if one try the deepness of it with a stick, it immediately buoys it up.</p>
                  <p>Some (from the Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells and Periwinkles found in this water) conjecture, that this <hi>Spaw</hi> may be fed by subterraneous veins from the Sea, whose shore is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stored with such shells; nor is the opinion wholy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, though the earth (in its matrice) may also have such a plastick vertue, as (from its prolifick ferment actuated by the Sun) it may produce such shells, which, as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46166:16"/>
case stands, is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Childrey</hi> in his <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Baconica</hi> (a good piece) page 75. mentions Cockle shells, and Periwinkles found at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derley</hi> neer <hi>Severn</hi> in <hi>Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi> but so as he rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them attempts of Nature failing in her workmanship for want of fit matter, than such in reality, which those we speak of are in figure and other similitudes exceeding like, though very minute, and without the least substance found in them; though in a Close hard by, there are like shells which have full fishes in them; Ours (as Mr. <hi>Childrey</hi>'s)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46166:16"/>
are not found neer the surface of the Earth, but in the body of the sand cast up by the force of the Spring.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> (by its Effects and the separation of its parts) seems impregnate with Vitriol and some Allum out of Iron, and not in the least saturated with any ill quality.</p>
                  <p>That Allum is an Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not the main Principle, nothing discommends the <hi>Spaw;</hi> As by <hi>Forestus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we shall hereafter more fully evidence and cleer.</p>
                  <p>And here before I proceed, I must (from all whom I have discoursed with) insert, that if this <hi>Spaw</hi> proves slow, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46166:17"/>
getting off with some, it is but with a few, and that through their want of advice first, whose distempers have such a nicety of complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may (in prudence) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire advice, (which I think ought regularly to be taken by such. <hi>Ne fortè aqua noxios hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores incurrens, eos secum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat, inventamque obstructionem augeat,</hi> as <hi>Abheers</hi> observes) or if it comes off slow, it is through the irregularities of others in taking the water too late in the day, and dining too early and plentifully after, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging besides a more than ordinary freedom; Yet none ever complained that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46166:17"/>
them in the least.</p>
                  <p>I have heard that Dr. <hi>Sprat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> (a Person worthily respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, though somewhat morose and cloudy) commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this <hi>Spaw</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>Penwerden,</hi> and others, as singularly good.</p>
                  <p>And this Testimony I have from a Reverend Prelate, one of the most ingenuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Sons of the inmost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of Nature, that He hath a very good Opinion of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> though he drank but one morning of it: In which opinion is Dr. <hi>Pope,</hi> one of the Councel of the Royal Society; And Dr. <hi>Howorth</hi> of <hi>Manchester</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46166:18"/>
(my honoured friend) a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whose desert intitles him to no mean Credit, writes to me, That he lately viewed and drank of the <hi>Latham Spaw,</hi> and perceived it to be as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnate with the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Iron and Vitriol Minerals as any water in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi> or the <hi>Yorkshire Spaw:</hi> adding further, That the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Test now must be from Those, that by experience make further discovery of its usefulness and benefit it affords, which he believes may answer the hopes and expectation he hath of it.</p>
                  <p>And old <hi>Spaw</hi> drinkers, of which I met some at this <hi>Spaw,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46166:18"/>
told me cheerfully, that a less quantity effected their business than at <hi>Tunbridg, Epsom, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and other <hi>Spaws,</hi> of which (in an ingenious Persons Case here following) you will have a notable proof, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be an excellent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, considering thereby that the Hypochonders are less stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Obstructions are more powerfully opened, the filth of the stomach impacted in its folds and wrinckles is sooner fetcht off, especially if an easie vomit of <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> vitrioli albi,</hi> which as well <hi>astringendi vi,</hi> streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as evacuates the stomach in robust and obstinate bodies, precedes, and the membranous
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46166:19"/>
Parts (by the speedier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming off of the water) are easier reliev'd, especially if this <hi>Spaw</hi> be a little acuated (as I have advised some) with Salt of Vitriol, or Steel, or Cakes of Cream of Tartar, the <hi>German</hi> way prepared, freely bestowed by the Countess of <hi>Derby,</hi> who obliges (by her great indulgence) her Neighbours thereby.</p>
                  <p>There is an Ingenuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, one of a quick and through apprehension, who coming (more out of a complacency than complaint) to this <hi>Spaw,</hi> drank of it with others some daies successively, but seldom
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46166:19"/>
more than three pints at a time, yet made within an hour and an half two Chamber-pots full of Urine; which clearly demonstrates its celerity and vertue. And that he might not be without a blessing (though the healthfulness of his Constitution knew not what he might desire) he yet found much gravel, to which his Parents are addicted, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by it, and himself freed of an Ebullition of blood, which Critically (about Midsummer) had expressed its virulency in small pimples, for some late years, with much offence.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> I have throughly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46166:20"/>
tried as to the turning its colour with the powder of galls, oak leaves, the boyling it with milk, the bearing of soap, which (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes, <hi>Nat. Hist. p.</hi> 87.) hungry water will not admit of, such kills the uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature of the soap. As likewise I have tried other experiments (frequent in the like Case) and I find few <hi>Spaws,</hi> if any sooner answer all their Tests than this. Less than a grain of the shavings of Gall will immediately tincture a considerable glass full of the water, first purple, then inky. Nay, I have experienced that after some of this <hi>Spaw</hi> had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46166:20"/>
been kept seven weeks in a bottle, it yielded to the Gall a full colour, though indeed, it putrifies soon, being out of its body, which argues highly the fineness of its Spirits, they being thin and aerial, and is an evincing token of its vertue, in the Judgment of the Lord <hi>Verulam, Paulus Aegineta, Oriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>And that I might be yet fuller informed (desiring to lay no Fucus on a wither'd face) I caused three pints of this water (after it had been carried seven miles) to be distilled in a Lamp Still, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently performed by my Lords
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46166:21"/>
Apothecary in the House: The first four or five spoonfuls of which so distil'd, I turn'd (as I had done the rest from the Well) with a little Gall, though what was afterwards distil'd never altered in the least, notwithstanding how much Gall soever I put in, but remain'd insipid and clear.</p>
                  <p>I put also into a glass of <hi>Spaw</hi> water, at the Spring a few drops of the volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Harts-horn, which made a white separation, with a strong scent, not of the faetor of the Harts-horn, but the <hi>Spaw,</hi> as if it had drawn all its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46166:21"/>
into a narrower compass, which a few drops of the oyl of Tartar reduced to its clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and scent.</p>
                  <p>The scent of this <hi>Spaw</hi> is not loathsom, somewhat it is like ink, more (in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) like the Sea-shore when the Tide's gone out, brackish and subtile.</p>
                  <p>Further, I exactly weighed a glass of fresh Spring-water with as much to a drop, as we could measure it, of <hi>Spaw</hi> water, which in three ounces (so much the glass contain'd of Spring-water) the <hi>Spaw</hi> water came short of the Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46166:22"/>
a full half ounce, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates the levity of its parts, and the subtilty of its Spirits, which in the opinion of the Lord <hi>Verulam (Nat. Hist. pag.</hi> 86.) makes much for the better: Though I must confess too with <hi>Heurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that Learned and intire Physician on <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Aphorisms 26. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>Non lance semper aestimanda est aqua, sed si non gravis sit Hypochondrio, verùm si ea subito pervadat, nec ibi cunctando putrescat,</hi> is the best quality, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifested are extant in our <hi>Spaw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> hath a blewish
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46166:22"/>
Cream, or skin which swims upon the water after it hath stood a very little while, <hi>Instar iridis, vel caudae pavonis in aquae superficie,</hi> to use <hi>Hadrianus</hi> a Mynsichts expression in his <hi>Anima Vitrioli,</hi> a medicine of admirable use, as this <hi>Spaw,</hi> (for this reason) may be in many of the like Cases, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when obstructions are the original of such distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
                  <p>I know coal waters, and others which are not without some ill quality (as standing Lakes and the like) have the same coloured scum, but not from the like Principle, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46166:23"/>
one being from putrification, This the innate vertue of the Minerals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abheers</hi> (who in concerns of this nature leaves nothing unsearcht) believes this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colour'd fat, or skin in the superficies of the <hi>Spaw</hi> to be liquid Amber, though others think it Sulphur: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the one or the other, certainly much vertue is specified by it, both being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients active and effectual.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> works several waies, most by Urine, often by Urine and stools, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Vomits, but least free
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46166:23"/>
that way, unless the stomach be before foul and nauseous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaw</hi> at first drinking, is exceeding cold; to avoid the inconveniences of which falling suddenly on the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a sensible part and the bowels, I advise, as is usual in the like case, Fennel seeds, Coriander seeds, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Orange pills, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica roots, or roots of Enula Campana candied, to be taken with it, which brings off the water gratefully: And if some few drops of that Noble and generous Medicine <hi>Elixar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis</hi> be taken in a draught of the water now and then,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46166:24"/>
I am perswaded it may further its excellency, as the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> fully experienced when he took the water in reference to an indisposition on his stomach, which this <hi>Spaw</hi> hath happily removed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting besides an excellent appetite.</p>
                  <p>Some (<hi>Claud. p.</hi> 382. not without Authority) admit of a spoonful of Salt in their first Cup, <hi>ut facultatem intestinorum irritent, ac alvum subducant,</hi> which in robust bodies replete with gross humours, I shall not forbid according to <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Mesue</hi> cited by Dr. <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, p.</hi> 130. though it is too
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46166:24"/>
severe, and harsh for finer contextures, having such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of parts as may fret the guts and bowels.</p>
                  <p>In the weaker and finest bodies Manna may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Rhubarb with Cream of Tartar, or <hi>Tartarum vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or my Deobstructive powder, which I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hath done singularly well.</p>
                  <p>Some have been for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Spaw</hi> warm (as they were they say the first Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that course at other <hi>Spaws</hi>) the stomach being apt to suffer by the contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water may make on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46166:25"/>
the nerves through its active quality, the nerves enduring no cold, in pursuance of the Lord <hi>Verulams</hi> advice for warm drinks, (Hist. Life and death p 214) which may be in some constitutions more proper at meals than in a course of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and I believe his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship means so, for so drunk in a course of Physick it makes it more nauseous, diminishes its spirits, renders it less pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, and gives it another quality, though in weak bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the water with good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may be taken warm, yet if such who desire to take it so would either drink it in their bed, or go to bed soon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46166:25"/>
after they have drunk their dose (as with some is usual at other <hi>Spaws</hi>) all inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of its chilness would be easily prevented, especially if the former rules of taking some gentle Correctives with the water were faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, or a little white wine drunk with it, <hi>Ut si vestigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um aliquod frigiditatis ventriculo ab illis communicatum fuerit, ab his deleatur.</hi> Claud. p. 390.

                  <p>The Right Honourable the Countess of <hi>Derby</hi> when she first began to drink of this <hi>Spaw</hi> (three or four years since) was forc't to take Cardamum seeds with it, now a few Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel seeds, sometimes without any thing, the <hi>Spaw</hi> passes off
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46166:26"/>
with much ease and benefit.</p>
                  <p>Exercise (whilest the <hi>Spaw</hi> is in drinking) is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: light walking is good, but in that the body is apter thence to sweat, than distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the water, the matter of which is much spent by sweat, especially if the motion be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, whereby the strength being drawn into a narrow room, the Spirits become more sharp, and predatory, I commend riding, shooting, bowling, or what may make the water more easily descend, and inlarge its distribution; and if some easie exercise to warm the bowels be had before one
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46166:27"/>
drink the water, I conceive it may make way for the water to proceed with less prejudice.</p>
                  <p>What diet (in this case) is most necessary, is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, <hi>viz.</hi> meats of easie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, all fruits of the season must be avoided; early rising, going to dinner when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are come off, and soon supping is most requisite; yea <hi>Lipsius</hi> his advice to <hi>Lessius</hi> from the <hi>Spaw</hi> in his Epistles is excellent, <hi>vix quandocunque venietis coenulam vobis paratam apud me scitote ex legibus spada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, tenuem frugalem cum fame dimissuram:</hi> so is a cheerful spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, moderate exercise, and all

temperance, and the body by Art, if the water effects it not, is constantly to be kept open.</p>
                  <p>In what Cures this <hi>Spaw</hi> hath been most happy I shall in brief run over some; Time, which matures all, and my leisure, (at present somewhat disturbed) being to enlarge further as there is occasion.</p>
                  <p>In facilitating the passage of the stone and gravel, and abstersing its sordes and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, I find it very successful.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46166:28"/>
found such ease, that the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum virile</hi> (swelling <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apismi instar,</hi> constantly before when he endeavour'd to make water) grew orderly, and he voyded the next morning a stone with two discoverable branches.</p>

few to make a through Cure) he drank freely, and with that effect, as ever since he is restored to such a competency of health and strength, as he travels in his new Chariot with ease, and walks without the least disturbance, who for some years before could not stir without stooping and much pain.</p>

After a day or two, the <hi>Spaw</hi> wrought so effectually with her, as first it mitigated her pains, then les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened her belly, and at length, <hi>Oh numen Aquarum!</hi> It brought away such <hi>Bladders,</hi> as many of them equall'd a pigeons egge, which being broke, with some noyse, yeilded a spoonful of limpid liquor somewhat jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying: Before the voiding of which, pains, not unlike <hi>Throws,</hi> pressed her in her belly, groins, and lower parts. I had (by the favour of the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi>) one of those <hi>Bladders,</hi> the last I think, she
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46166:31"/>
ever voided, sent to me, whose outward Tunicle was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Swines bladder, but without <hi>Fibres</hi> or veins; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was smooth, and had adhering to its sides a slimy blewish jelly substance. Upon discourse with her, of which afterwards she assured me, that she had not voided less (since she took notice of them) then two hundred, each with pain and trouble, though the last with least. What to think of these I am somewhat uncertain; That there are Monsters in Physick, as in Nature, is no late Exclamation. <hi>Ludovicus Nonnius,</hi> a learned Physician of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in an Epistle to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46166:31"/>
most ingenious <hi>Beverovicius</hi> of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> inserted in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>De Calculo,</hi> writes that as in the Yard Caruncles may be generated, which inclose U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, so the like substance may be bred in the body of the bladder: And <hi>Zacutus Lusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> that admirable observer of especial Cases, <hi>p.</hi> 184. gives an excellent evidence, that <hi>multa monstrosa in vesica innasci, &amp; membranae nerveae Globi cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalli formes, incredibilis quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas pituitae, &amp; alia mira quae intus corercita deinde excernuntur cum urina.</hi> Nor is <hi>Sennertus,</hi> that Learned and excellent man less observing in his Chapter, <hi>de vermibus &amp; aliis praeter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam</hi>

                  <q>Multa tegit sacro involucro Natura.</q>
                  <p>Though till I am better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't, I must suppose these <hi>Bladders</hi> voided by our Patient to be bred in her bladder, if there, or in her womb, as Aposthumes, of which there are great varieties arising from choice of matter, as <hi>Sennertus</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:46166:32"/>
well observes, disseminated through the whole body, some of them inclosed in a proper tunicle, receiving form and matter from the place they are generated in. I have been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assured by a Person worthy to be credited, that having had some years since, discourse with an Eminent Physician in these parts, whose infirmities generally tyed him to his Chamber, he was then told by him that he once had a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, a Gentlewoman of good quality, who on her Urine had a fat scum with various colours in it, under which swam many Bladders, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a large pins head, very
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46166:33"/>
clear, which being broke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a slimy water, which he conceived were the effects of some Apostumated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Reins, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, so various is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the discharge of her burden. But that which sways most, next to what may be imputed to the irregularities of the womb, is the opinion of a Learned Physician, whose deserts challenge more than is paid to his years and merits. He conceives these <hi>Bladders</hi> come from the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> and are the <hi>involucra</hi> and <hi>Cystes</hi> of <hi>Scrophulous Tumors</hi> generated there, there being, as <hi>Vigo</hi> maintains, the focus and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46166:33"/>
of the <hi>Scrophula</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thence, as <hi>Schenckins</hi> observes of other evacuations, <hi>per ductus occultos;</hi> and hence <hi>Forestus</hi> in his Treatise of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical observations (<hi>lib.</hi> 3 <hi>p.</hi> 259. in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>) from <hi>Arnoldus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, that <hi>Aquae minerales alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minosae non solùm infernos hos strumosos, ac pituitosos abscessus, sed externos quoque &amp; summa corporis occupantes imminuunt, ac discutiunt;</hi> from whence this Patient received so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: But to our intent.</p>
                  <p>The Collick seldom here misses of a Cure; <hi>Holmes</hi> who had lately the ground in Lease, gives an excellent Testimony

of this, as others whilest I was on the place.</p>
                  <p>Since, Mr. <hi>William Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> of <hi>Billings,</hi> a young Gentleman, having some sharp heats breaking forth in his body, went the last <hi>Autumn</hi> to <hi>Holywell,</hi> in hopes the coldness of that Well (certainly a clear and fresh one) would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him; But washing there, returned notwithstanding with the same heats increast, and some days after had the Collick so extreamly, as it tormented him much; Whereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>Spaw,</hi> he drank plentifully of it, and was that day cured of his Collick, and

forth very violently in his arm, thighs and back, in his back so violently as it ran extreamly distempering his whole body, sufficient indeed, and more than sufficient to make him an object of great Charity; which the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, ordered (about the midst of <hi>July</hi> last,) that he should be brought with much Care to This <hi>Spaw</hi> from <hi>Chester,</hi> of which he drank freely, it agreeing (after two or three daies) excellently with him, working by stools, and urine, very kindly, so kindly as after six weeks stay there, observing an orderly Course, both as to Physick and diet,

Before he came to the <hi>Spaw,</hi> oftentimes the Orifice in his side would be shut up, upon which he would breath extream short, and spit up exceeding bitter matter in great quantity, ready to suffocate him (the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being translated to his Lungs) which, after drinking a day or two of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> turned it's Course to the Wound, never reversing it's order since: So happy hath this <hi>Spaw</hi> been to this poor neighbour.</p>

                  <p>In the Worms, nothing proves more effectual. The House-keepers Wife of <hi>Cross-Hall</hi> (a sweet Retirement of the Earl of <hi>Derbys</hi>) maintains it, that one of her Children being very ill, and as she thought at the point of Death, and she her self too, at that time, indisposed and ill, drank both of this <hi>Spaw</hi> brought to them in a bottle, by <hi>James Holmes</hi> the Husband, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46166:45"/>
immediately they both grew well. The Mother thereupon voiding two, and the Daughter three worms Indeed the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, as I am informed, drinks it often upon that score, and with much benefit.</p>
                  <p>Mistris <hi>Elizabeth Nowel,</hi> being troubled with the Palpitation of the Heart from the womb, and Spleen, drank some days of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> and found not relief only, but (for ought I yet hear) a Cure.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46166:45"/>
too apparent here to insist on, that through the whole, glance only at some Cures; As also in loosenesses, bloudy fluxes, fluxes of the Liver, This <hi>Spaw</hi> effects considerable Cures, and that not so much as some suppose, by a restringent, and thickning quality condensing the prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Humours preying on Nature, thereby disabled to act in her own vigour, as by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, and discussing vertue, precipitating the Morbifick Cause of these and the like flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whereby Nature (being rid of her superfluities) she reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her pristine strength, as <hi>Abheers p.</hi> 24. excellently well observes to this effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:46166:46"/>The same may be affirmed of the Gonorrhea, and all the diseases incident thereto: Of which you may take two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, One of a young man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 29 years, who having run through a Course of Physick, not less terrible than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, drinking of this water, was speedily cur'd of a notable Flux of Bloud in the frenum with its consequents.</p>
                  <p>The other was of a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30. who having a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in his back, drank freely of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> and in few daies gathered strength, such as (if a Quartan, which hath seiz'd on him this winter, do not again impair his strength
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46166:46"/>

                  <p>I may here likewise mention one (related to him that looks to the Well) who having spent much in the Cure of a dysente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was by his friends advised to come from <hi>Manchester,</hi> where he lived, and lack't not advice of Learned and eminent men, to drink of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> which he did, and in a short time return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cur'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any wonder that this <hi>Spaw</hi> impregnate with suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent virtue, should have such an effect on the Diseases last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, since (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves of the taking of the <hi>Aquae Thermales,</hi> in the Dysentery, the

                  <head>A further Account of LATHAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPAW, as IT may conduce to the publick Advantage, with ease and little Expence, under the favour of the ILLUSTRIOUS PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS, the Proprietors of IT, whose Charity exposes IT to All, as their Countenance gives Life and encouragement to IT.</head>
                  <p>MAny having been encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the success, which They and their Friends have found on their Repair to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham-Spaw,</hi> to enquire further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Effects, and the Times and Customs to be observed there; (too cursorily glanc'd at in the first Treatise of this Subject) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but in order to the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Season, so far yield to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Truth, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick benefit; as briefly to affirm what the most knowing and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous testifie, that the Excellency of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46166:49"/>
that Water far excell'd the attempt of its Praise and Vertue: though it being remote from the Business of the Nation, the Access to it may not be so universal, as is observ'd in other Places weaker impregnated with the Minerals, Iron, Vitriol, and Sulphur. Nor were the Effects more visible on the Plebean, than the Patrician, as hereafter may be more particularly expressed; though some circumstances in their Cases, are more remarkable, than a short time may well comprehend; to which at present (intending few Notes only, not a Tract) I am nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly confin'd. Hence for their clearer Information, who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither, for the opening of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, either of the Liver, Spleen, or Mesentery, the Inn of slow Fevers, and other contumacious Effects; freeing the Uriters of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, Stone, or Phlegm, restoring the Appetite, clearing the Vessels of the Gall and curing the Diseases inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto, also the suppression
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46166:49"/>
of Urine, painfulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Womb, furthering Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, menstrual Evacuations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying other Infirmities of Women; dissipating Hypocondrick Vapours, or Melancholy, removing old Pains, Scorbutick affections, with its prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and virulent Progeny, Dropsies, Asthmas, Morphew, distempers of the Reins, Worms, Reliques and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fuels of intermitting Fevers; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling old Sores, sore Mouths, inflam'd Eyes, inveterate Dysenteries, Laskes, and Fluxes, with many Diseases lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Channels, through which the water passes. I shall add some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, observing (to the Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great Blessing) how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously, how brutishly most flock thither, (as to other Spaws) without discrimination, or rules to be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by in their Drinking; as if the Water were a Spell, not a Medicine: whereas the influence even of the Plei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades, and Orion, have not their natural Effects, but as the Bodies (they work on) are capacitated to imbibe their Energie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46166:50"/>In pursuance of which, so grateful to the most illustrious Indulgers of this Spaw, whose Interest is never so well advanced as in the Community of Good, I shall set down some Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which (observed) may make the Waters (influenced from above) true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healing and beneficial; not here only, but where ever the like are drunk, so as these Rules may prove a general Benefit summ'd up in a narrow Room: In publishing of which, I comply rather with their Charity, (diffusive as their vertues) then seek my Ease or Repose.</p>
                  <p>First, as to the Time, though some are of opinion, Waters may be drunk in winter as being stronger then: Yet the Air being then cold, the Pores are more condensed, whence the passages are not so relax; and commonly one is driest in the Summer months, so more inclin'd to drink freely, a good Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to carry them off readily; in which respects, I conceive the fittest Time to repair hither, is, from the end of <hi>May</hi> to <hi>August,</hi> inclusively.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46166:50"/>
Some (so the constitution of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son disswades not) commend <hi>August</hi> most, though generally then the first Rains begin, and that (according to the Proverb) discovers the Poverty of Nobility: The Trees thence forward casting their Livery, whence People cloathing themselves warmer imply Waters (afterwards) are ill Visitors of the inward parts: But this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance may be ore-rul'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the seasonableness of the year, no maxim being truer than that, <hi>Change of Seasons principally begets Diseases.</hi> Certainly the hottest Season, and clearest Air, are fittest Times to drink Waters in: the Air (a vehicle by which Diseases are conveyed to us) being much indisposed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, consequently Waters, and we by them, in case Wind, Rain, or Air prove unwholsom; Yet I have known <hi>Those,</hi> whom the strongest Medicines could not move, the Waters (though in Winter) have wrought on effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but such Patients are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make the Rule general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46166:51"/>Secondly, let <hi>such</hi> (as would drink these Waters) advise with their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, whether the Cause (for which they would apply themselves hither) be probable to be relieved here: <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> was not for all; since Luxury, complicate Diseases have flown in upon us. Nothing is so soveraign which (in some respect) may not be attended with an inconvenience, though I havebeen so strict, in my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this Water, that I cannot charge the least <hi>Ill</hi> upon it; <hi>Who</hi> were fit to drink it; <hi>Who</hi> have took it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, <hi>that</hi> have not been spent with Age, or whose Heat or Vital parts have not been asleep.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, having rightly discovered the Disease (for one may emulate a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>other, and yet is not to be cured by the same means) let <hi>them</hi> carefully pursue Rules, drink orderly, and keep within the compass of a sober Dyet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rules</hi> consist first in Purging, either by Vomit, or Stools, of which more in the larger Treatise on this Subject, it being impossible to apt Medicines
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46166:51"/>
to every ones <hi>Necessities,</hi> though (in general) the <hi>Nauseous</hi> may help their Stomachs by Hiera Picra, in Pills, from half a Drachm to a Drachm, or take it in its <hi>Species,</hi> with Syrup of Wormwood, and strengthen their Stomach afterward with Zedoary, Galinga, <hi>China</hi>-Ginger, sweet Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Roots candied, and the like. The costive may do well to take <hi>Diacassia cum Manna</hi> an ounce, Cremor Tartar a scruple, made into a Bolus the night before, or some of the lenitive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries with a little Hiera Picra, which by morning may relax the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. Let the Patient drink the Water early, on an empty Stomach, and walk, jump, ride, swing the Arms, shoot at Butts, or exercise gently after, also a little before; the better to relax the Passages, and excite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat: <hi>weak Persons</hi> may drink them in their bed, some what warm, but never too much at once, least dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obstructive Matter into the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Waters find not a current flux; or (the Stomach being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46166:52"/>
the Patient be forced to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: not that a <hi>Vomit</hi> the first or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day may be inconvenient, though the Custom of it may effeminate the Stomach, and divert the Course more natural and intended. Hence I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow drinking in the afternoon, unless a Cup or two, four or five hours after Dinner, that the Chylus diluted may be the better distributed; but then I am against <hi>such</hi> as would sleep upon it, for that (as some well observe) the Water lying longer in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, than at other times, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat, it sends up Vapours apt to oppress the Brain. 3. After the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins to come off kindly, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may drink thin Veal or Mutton Broth altered with Asparagus, Fenel, Parsley roots and the like, with Tops of young Wheat, Succory, Chervil, and seasonable Herbs, the better to warm the Stomach and open the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. 4. Dine not till the Water be come off: A little White or Rhenish Wine (in a glass or two of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) furthers that; sometimes a Pipe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46166:52"/>
of Tobacco, also Elecampane or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica Roots candied, Orange Pills, Tablets of Aromaticum Rosa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um, and the like, mentioned under the first head (strengthening the Stomach) help concoction, then which nothing can bring off the waters sooner. 5. As one ascends by degrees to his Dose, (which is impossible to assign positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any, for that the Water works not alike with All) so let him descend gradually; and if he will not admit of other Physick, let <hi>him,</hi> at least, take a Glister in conclusion, that (what the waters have thrown into the Bowels) it may cleanse and relieve; Else <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evacuations,</hi> (sometimes Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) may ensue very prejudicial: indeed Glisters (and those of the Spaw Water) may (in case of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiveness, or obstinate obstructions) be of excellent use through the whole course. 6. Feed on meats easie of Disgestion, such as may rather satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie than whet the Appetite; <hi>The Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's cheaply fed:</hi> especially avoid the crude Fruits of the Season, <hi>viz. Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46166:53"/>
                     <hi>Cucumbers, Millons, Pease, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> or what may raise the least sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; the fertile <hi>Parent</hi> of divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate inexplicable Diseases. 7. Spend the vacant time in gentle exercise, as before is specified, also in Mirth, and good Company, that together with the Body, the mind may be relieved. 8. Get convenient sleep in the nights, rarely in the day, unless the Patient be very weak, and that sleep may be taken with Advice; and in case you sweat kindly in the night, check not favourable Dews; although <hi>such</hi> I am against, in the <hi>Act of Drinking;</hi> for that it spends much of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is more natural to come away by Urine, so, infeebling the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it much indisposeth the Patient. 9. Less then fourteen or twenty days (a respect being ever had to the habit of the Patient, and his strength) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well serve to run the Course in: <hi>In</hi> the strict observance whereof, some times Headach, Maziness, and the like (by reason of vapours) affect the Patient. In others the pains of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46166:53"/>
the Hemorrhoids prove offensive: And the Waters get off difficultly with others. All which may thus probably be remedied.</p>
                  <p>First, the Patient (having been seasonably purg'd) may take a Tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Sugar of Roses, preserv'd Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the like, mentioned in the first Head under the Rules to be observ'd, which, gratifying the Brain, repells the grosness of the vapours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Hemorrhoids may be prevented by a Glister (in a little quantity the better to retain it) of common Oyl, or Oyl of Violets and Butter, injected a convenient space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Patient drinks the Water; or make an Oyntment of Oyl of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Mucillage of Psylly seeds; and a little Wax, wherewith (as also with Oyl of Eggs, well beaten with the yolk of an Egg) the Part may be well anoynted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as to the difficult coming off of the Water, sharp Glysters may be excellent, yet in respect there is some doubt of those as not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46166:54"/>
reaching the Parts most burthened, <hi>Caesar Claudinus</hi> his <hi>Bolus Sylvius,</hi> his <hi>Electuarium Hydragogum,</hi> a neat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Medicine, or the deobstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Powder mentioned in the first Treatise, pag. 27. may do well in a draught of white Wine early in the morning. Nay the same Powder ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (sometimes from a Drachm to a Drachm and a half with the water) may be a ready <hi>means</hi> to bring it off, or to prepare the Body at first, as hath been long experienced: Though if the Body still proves obstinate, its better to desist, then force Nature to what she will not readily yield to. And yet I have found, nor are <hi>others</hi> without the same Notion, that where these, or the like waters come not off readily, they often spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (even some months after) in beneficial sweats, or large salivations, nay (not seldom) in great quantities of Urine; that it hath amazed some, where the treasures of these Waters should be so long deposited without further prejudice, which (as obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46166:54"/>
very important) I could not but insert, that where the Waters are slow, hopes may not be cold. <hi>Some</hi> complain of sharpness of Urine, after drinking the Waters, though <hi>Others</hi> are certainly cur'd (even of this complaint) by their orderly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein; to remedy which, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulsions of the greater cold Seeds, white Poppy Seed, and Almonds sweeten'd with Sugar of Pearl, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup or Sugar of Althea, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much: though I have long experienc'd, that a draught of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Wine well defecated hath not had less happy effects on this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, than it hath found in the Dysury, or Strangurie, proceeding from cold Indistempers fomented by refrigerating accidents; <hi>Of which,</hi> and the other Heads I might say more, the Field being spatious, but so <hi>these Rules</hi> (with the rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions that may favourably be gathered thence) may be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, I see not why brevity to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46166:55"/>
the Reader as well as to my self may not be an advantage. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
