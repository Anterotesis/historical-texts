            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>¶ A louing Epistle, written by <hi>Ruphilus</hi> a yonge Gentilman, to his best beloued Lady Elriza, as followeth.</head>
               <l>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wice hath my quaking hand withdrawen this pen away</l>
               <l>And twice againe it gladly would, before I dare béewray</l>
               <l>The secret shrined thoughts, that in my hart do dwell,</l>
               <l>That neuer wight as yet hath wist, nor I desire to tell.</l>
               <l>But as the smoothered cole, doth wast and still consume,</l>
               <l>And outwardly doth geue no heate, of burnyng blaze or fume:</l>
               <l>So hath my hidden harmes, béen harbred in my corpce,</l>
               <l>Till faintyng limmes and life and all, had welnigh lost his force:</l>
               <l>Yet stand I halfe in doubt, whiche of these two to choose,</l>
               <l>To hide my harmes still to my hurt, or els this thraldome loose.</l>
               <l>I will lay feare aside, and so my tale beginne:</l>
               <l>Who neuer durst assaile his foe: did neuer conquest win.</l>
               <l>Lo here my cause of care to thée vnfolde I will:</l>
               <l>Help thou <hi>Minerua,</hi> graunt I pray, some of thy learned skill.</l>
               <l>Help all you Muses nine, my wofull Pen to write:</l>
               <l>So stuffe my verse with pleasant wordes, as she may haue delight,</l>
               <l>With héedyng eares to reade my gréeif and great vnrest:</l>
               <l>Some wordes of plaint may moue perhaps, to pitty my request.</l>
               <l>Oft haue I hard complaint, how Cupid beares a sway</l>
               <l>In brittle youth, and would commaund: and how they did obay.</l>
               <l>When I with skorning eares did all their talke dispise:</l>
               <l>But well I see the blinded boy: in lurking den hée lies,</l>
               <l>To catch the careles sorte: awayting with his Darte:</l>
               <l>Hée threw at mée when I vnwares, was wounded to the harte.</l>
               <l>To speake and pray for helpe, now loue hath mée constrainde:</l>
               <l>And makes mée yéeld to serue the sorte, that lately I disdainde.</l>
               <l>Sith beggars haue no choyce: nor néede had euer law</l>
               <l>The subiecte Oxe doth like his yoke: when hée is driuen to draw.</l>
               <l>That <hi>Ruphilus</hi> this wrote: thou wonder wilt I know,</l>
               <l>Cause neuer erst in louinge vearse: my labor I bestowe,</l>
               <l>Well, woful loue is mine, and wéeping lines I wright,</l>
               <l>And doubtfull wordes with driery chéere: beséemes a careful wight</l>
               <l>O thou <hi>Elrisa</hi> fayre, the beuty of thine eyes</l>
               <l>Hath bred such bale within my drest, and cau'sde such strife to ryse.</l>

               <l>To ease the gréedy gripes I féele, and end my great mischéefe.</l>
               <l>As due to mee by right, I can no mercy craue,</l>
               <l>Thou hast the power to graunt mée life: refuse not for to saue.</l>
               <l>Put to thy helping hand, to salue the wounded sore,</l>
               <l>Though thou refuse it for my sake: yet make thine honour more,</l>
               <l>Too cruell were the facte: if thou shouldst séeke to kill</l>
               <l>Thy faythful fréend that loues thee so: and doth demaund no ill.</l>

               <l>And euery wight that hath her séene, I say (not one) but all</l>

                  <l>Whose famous voice of ancient rule, through all the world yet ringes:</l>
                  <l>Two great estates did whilom dwell: and places ioyned so,</l>
                  <l>As but one wall eche princely place, deuided other fro:</l>
                  <l>These Nobles two, two children had, for whom Dame Nature sought,</l>
                  <l>The déepest of her secret skill, or shée their byrth had wrought:</l>
                  <l>For as their yeares in one agréed, and beauty equall shone,</l>

                  <l>And as it pleased Nature then, the one a sonne to frame,</l>
                  <l>So did the glad olde Father like him <hi>Pyramus</hi> to name:</l>
