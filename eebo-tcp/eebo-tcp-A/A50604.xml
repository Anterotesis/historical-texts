            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

JOHN
EARL of

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing man can glory in
nothing, but in that
he is GOD's Image;
certainly, that must be
his most glorious state
wherein that Image is
most clearly seen, and this is <hi>solitude;</hi>
wherein his composed soul (like the smooth
face of the Ocean) represents, with much
advantage, this glorious image which the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59999:3"/>
unequal risings of stormy and aspire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
waves of ambition do exceedingly
conceal. The heathen Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi>
describes the great perfections of the
Deity to consist in that it is,</p>
            <q>â€”Privata dolore omni privatapericlis
Ipsa suis pollens opibusâ€”</q>
            <p>And <hi>Cicero</hi> upon this score confesses,
that the Philosophers life was of all
others most preferable, because of all
others, it approached nearest to that of
the gods. This, <hi>my Lord,</hi> invited
me to write this Discourse in it's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
which because I intended as a
bundle of rods, for whipping such as
were fondly ambitious, I did therefore
strip naked of these leaves and flourishes
of Eloquence, which by making them
more pleasant, could not but make them
less sharp. And if any tax me for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Book to publick view, from that
<hi>solitude</hi> which both it and I so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend;
my answer is, That either it will
convince these who read it, and then it
will gratifie that <hi>solitude</hi> which it hath
left; or else it will meet with censure and


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59999:3"/>
disdain, and then it's fate will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
how dangerous it is to gaud abroad;
to press which, is another of my great
designs.</p>
            <p>I intend not really to depreciat such by
this Discourse as injoy Honours and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
that design lyes as far out of
my road, as it is rais'd above my power:
but I intend by it to congratulate with
such as either undervalue them out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
or have lost them by accident;
and to discipline such unquiet humours,
as like powder, do, in blowing up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
destroy all that is above them, or
resists their violent ascent: wherein, as
I obliege Philosophers, by complementing
the object of their complacency; So I
gratifie States-men, by reclaiming such
as are the ordinary object of their fears.
Neither should any thing in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which is picquant against those
Courtiers who have been rather great then
good, displease such as are both good and
great, more then it should displease a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of noble shapes and features, to see
a Painter draw another man (though of


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59999:4"/>
the same species with himself) under all
the disadvantages that can be trac'd by
a deforming Pencile.</p>
            <p>That I should choose your Lordship for
my Patron, is no act of virtue; because
your condition, as it stands circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat,
made you almost the only person who
deserv'd it at all, and altogether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who deserv'd it most; for, being the
best Pattern for solitary persons, ye were
the person who deserv'd most to be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of <hi>solitude</hi> it self: especially, having
oblieged it so far, as to prefer it to that
rival against which it now disputes for
precedency; and prefer'd it, after it's
adverse party had been your old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and had offer'd to bribe you, for your
suffrage, with a purse heavy enough to
have weighed down a light spirit. Fear
not, <hi>my Lord,</hi> the want of <hi>fame</hi> (which
is the only thing that <hi>solitude</hi> is thought
to want) For, as the heathens resembled
it to a Maid, so it hath this of a coy Maid
likewise, that it courts most these who
seem most to undervalue it; and rarely
any person admires his own servants so


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59999:4"/>
much, as it doth these who are stranger<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
to it. And great men have this loss,
that their superiors will not admire them,
as being less then themselves; their
equals will not, because they hate them;
nor their inferiours, because they envy
them, and do but too oft imagine that they
are opprest for feeding their luxury. That
famous rod which wrought so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
for others openly in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> did
never it self flourish till it was laid up in
the tabernacle, (according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
who will have both these to have
been one and the same) and the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
ceases not to enjoy a greater lustre,
though hid in the darkest corner, then
these pleasing blossoms do, which the
weakest breath of a storm will command
down from the highest branch upon which
they pearch. <hi>Fame</hi> then shall transmit
your name to posterity, as the Iews did
their embalm'd bodies which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
perfumed and odoriferous in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and retired Grotts and Sepulchres;
whereas it will preserve that of more
publick persons, only as the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59999:5"/>
did theirs, whom by exposing to
the open Sun, they kept as mummie, but
so black and parcht, as that it had been
better they had return'd to their former
ashes. But, though <hi>fame</hi> should not thus
gratifie you, yet virtue (who hath so few
deserving followers now, that it cannot
but pile up pyramids of favours upon such
as are) will recommend you to succeeding
ages, both to let see that she wants not
her Trophees even in this dotage of
the world (wherein she is not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by age, as not to have charmes
strong enough to conquer such as deserve
her favour) and to engage others, by this
act of gratitude, to a dependence upon her.
And amongst her admirers, you, as one of
her Minions, shall have still all defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

you, but as the being

bodies; from which
state they cannot be
so properly said to fall, as to run with
inclination to that beloved centre and
level, from which they were at first
rais'd. I know you made no other use
of that height which makes others gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
then to take from off it's loftiest
tops, a full prospect of all these vanities
which so much ravish mean spirits.
And your publick deportment being


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59999:6"/>
thus, so exact a picture of true Virtue,
I hope your retirement will be the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
of that noble draught.</p>
            <p>In the confidence of this, I send you
this Elogy of <hi>solitude;</hi> not as Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
send Pills, with praises to their
averse Patients: for, as it were below
your Stoicisme to need such; So it is
above my skill, to be able to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
the meanest remedy, to so well a
complexion'd soul as yours. But I
praise it to you, as we use to praise a
Mistris to her enamoured Gallant,
whose intimacy with her, though it far
exceeds the acquaintance of the praiser,
yet it breeds not in her <hi>enamorato,</hi> an
unwillingness to hear what he already
knows; complacency being oftner the
product of our knowledge, then the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of our enquiry. In paralleling
greatness and <hi>solitude,</hi> as to their moral
advantages, I shall first make some few
reflections upon the ends for which
both are sought, upon the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherein both are exercised, and
lastly upon the revenue made upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59999:6"/>
of these enjoyments, when fate or
death shall force us to leave both.</p>
            <p>As to the design which men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to themselves,<note place="margin">Sect. 1. <hi>The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to both compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </note> in pursuing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and publick Employment; all
will tell you, that they seek these, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to under-prop their falling fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
(whose proud tops begin to bow,
in homage to that mortality, which will
needs one day triumph over us and
ours) or else to defend themselves
against some considerable enemy; or
to wipe off the stains and scarres of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
or prejudice. For, when opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or great Persons undertake them,
the very rabble have so much prudence,
as to condemn these for mad men;
when Philosophers or strong Spirits
embarque in them, they say they do it
to serve their Countrey, and not their
inclinations; and flatterers pretend,
that they design in these, the pleasing
of their Prince, and not of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
So that as if all were ashamed
of them, all do excuse their zeal after
them: whereas, <hi>solitude</hi> (like a great


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59999:7"/>
beauty) is courted for it self, and not for
it's portion. And such as intend pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employments, will pretend a love
and design for <hi>solitude;</hi> and when they
have attained their honours, they will
still praise retirement: whereas, such
as live privatly may sometimes pity,
but will never seem to envy such as are
in publick Employment. And not
only is <hi>solitude</hi> courted for it self, and
Greatness for some remoter end; but
even Greatness and publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are themselves oft (if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes)
design'd as subservient to <hi>soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
Thus Merchants hazard drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and like the Sun, reel about the
world, that they may gain as much as
may affoord them the conveniency of
a recess. For this Lawyers empty their
brains, and Souldiers open their veins;
and have oft nothing to sweeten their
anxieties, but the remote prospect of a
solacing retirement: So that <hi>solitude</hi>
must be excellent, seing it's enemies
buy it at so dear a rate. And even
<hi>Cesar</hi> behoved to recreat himself, with


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59999:7"/>
an <hi>aliquando mihi licebit, mihi vivere,</hi>
esteeming that part of his life to belong
to others, which was spent on other
mens employments. And seing all aim at
<hi>solitude,</hi> it must certainly be by as much
more nobler then publick Emplyoment
as the end is more noble then the
means: and in this it approaches very
near the nature of happiness, which is
defined to be that, <hi>to which all things
tend, and which it self respects nothing
yet acquireable.</hi> But yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
these, who are at all this pains to
gain <hi>Solitude,</hi> whom for this I esteem
as unskilfull in the art of happiness, as
these Navigators in <hi>Solomons</hi> time,
were of the art of Sailing; who crused
alongst so many tedious shoars for
reaching the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> a journey
easily to be accomplished, in far less
then half the time. Happiness is not
the product of such endeavours, and
these are rather hinderances then helps
to <hi>Solitude.</hi> And this remembers me
of that notable answer, given by <hi>Cineas</hi>
the philosopher to <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> who when


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59999:8"/>
he told him that he intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<hi>Greece,</hi> then <hi>Rome,</hi> and so all the
world; askt him, why he proposed all
that toil to himself? To which
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> answering, that he would do
it, to the end he might at his return
live happily and merrily with his friends
the residue of his life. <hi>Cineas</hi> tancing
him most sharply, told him, that he
might live so, and do so presently, and

            <p>
               <hi>Man</hi> is so frail a Creature, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
are so great and many, that
that can only make him be reputed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
which can best conceal his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
frailties: And albeit our judgements
are but shallow, yet here lyes our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that we are not able to abide
the test of one anothers judgement.
And this is the knack, for which men
who are silent and reserved, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and dumpish, are reputed wise
for we admire not what we see, but what
we see not. And yet, neither melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
nor silence serve so to skreen out


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59999:8"/>
infirmities, as <hi>solitude</hi> does; seing such
as converse in the world may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed
by other means then discourse,
and may, upon unexpected rencounters,
be even provoked to that likewise.
Wherefore it is a virtuous imposture,
and an allowable charltanry, to design
retirement; because that secures against
all the inconveniences of either of
these, by abstracting us from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the one, and from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of the other: and if melancholy
or silence possesses any thing in their
nature, which can be thought excellent,
certainly <hi>solitude</hi> enjoys the same in a
more eminent measure; for these make
but parcels of that noble state, silence
being but a <hi>solitude</hi> in discourse, and
melancholy a <hi>solitude</hi> in humour:
whereas <hi>solitude</hi> is more excellent then
these, because in possessing both their
advantages, it wants the adust, bile and
jealousness of melancholy, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stipation
of silence.</p>
            <p>Except some volatile Heads, whose
mercurial Complexion hath inclined


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59999:9"/>
them rather to a restlessness, then vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
activity, and who like the wind,
are nothing at all when they are not
moving: and ye will find the residue
of men so averse from toil and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they must be either bryb'd
to them by gain, or baited with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
and the most diligent amongst
active States-men will wish, that their
long'd-for triumphs, or desired em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
were at a period, that they
might <hi>enjoy themselves</hi> (for so they
terme it) <hi>in a solitary retirement;</hi> which
is that <hi>Canaan</hi> of rest, which like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
on <hi>Pisgah,</hi> they see afar off, but
without hopes of enjoyment: and so
fond are these upon one moment of it,
when enjoyed, that they will disobliege
for it on-waiters, neglect their interest,
and slight oft great advantages. Thus
then we see, that nature, inclination and
pleasure, vote all for <hi>solitude;</hi> and that
publick Employment is unnatural in
it's rise, and wearying in it's sequel, as
it is dangerous (if not fatal) in it's ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59999:9"/>
I know that there are some great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who like great fishes, never come
to shoar till they be wounded, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters,
affronts and necessities driving
them there for shelter, rather then
choice; and this makes many think,
that these <hi>encomiums</hi> given to <hi>solitude,</hi>
are either contrived by Pedants, who
could never reach preferments, or by
degraded Courtiers, who after they
have been outed of their publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
harrangue against what they
have lost, to satisfie, not their reason,
but their revenge. But, to these I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that <hi>solitude</hi> is by this objection
prov'd to be an excellent state, seing
even the distrest expect an asyle and
protection there: for distress makes us
run where we may expect help; and
that must be the securest harbour, to
which the distrestest vessels make their
application. And I believe best these
Elogies, which <hi>solitude</hi> gets from such
who know both states; and because
some use this as a Pretext, therefore
it must be excellent: for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59999:10"/>
things are only used, and can only
serve as Pretexts; and that cannot but
be much respected amongst men, whose
very shadow can make misery pass for
virtue, and make misfortunes be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
happiness. Yet, certainly, misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
may make men real Philosophers,
as afflictions makes real Christians: and
it is very probable, that one, who after
much confidence in Court and Riches,
hath been tumbled down unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will be more really convinced of
it's slipperiness and emptiness, then
such as never found the effects of so
much revolution. But there are many
also, such as <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, both Emperors, and many others,
who after a compleat fruition of all
Courtly successe and pleasure, have
taken a solemn congy of it, whilst it
yet smiled upon them, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
many moe would, if they did not
apprehend much hazard in their retreat,
from these who thought themselves
injured by them in their prosperity.</p>

               </note> with these of greatness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
greatness will still struggle for
precedencie, I shall therefore scann
first it's disadvantages; amongst which,
this is one, that either publick Persons
have attained to the fruition of what
they design'd; and in that case, there
are many wayes to make them miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
because the substraction of any
one of these many enjoyments, robs
them of all the satisfaction they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
in what remains. And there are but
few wayes to make them happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
little can be added to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
possessions: or, they have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to what they have projected;
and then they fret more, and suffer
moe disquietings, then the meanest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
whom they command, And like
that man in the Parable, consider more
the one lost sheep, then the ninety
nine which yet remain. Did the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of all that the Sun sees, restrain,
<hi>Alexander</hi> from weeping, because he
could conquer no more? No. For,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59999:11"/>
Ambition is like hunger, which though
it is once satisfied, continues no longer
so, then it hath for a little time prey'd
upon what was at first presented to it:
and like the fire, is so far from being
satisfied with what is thrown into it,
that it is by that new fewel, not only
enabled to destroy, but likewise forc'd
to seek more aliment for sustaining it's
wasting rage.</p>
            <p>These who are in publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have either many dependers, or
not; if they have not, they are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
for, the scope of such is to be
depended on, and the missing of this
renders them more miserable, then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
or sickness could a <hi>Stoick:</hi> but if
they be incircled by crouds of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
then are they interessed, not only
in maintaining their own Posts, but
likewise in sustaining their numerous
Clients; in whose fall, their reputation
is, as in their own standing, equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed.
And when they have been
at great pains to effectuat the pretences
of these their dependers, if these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59999:11"/>
succeed, then either the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
whom they assist, do arrogat
the success to themselves, or their own
merits: or else they think it but the
price of their attendance, and so look
upon it as paid before bestowed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the party with whom these have to
do, will ever thereafter carry the Patron
at implacable malice: Or, if these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
succeed not, then they impute
it to the want of conduct, or of gratitude
in these their lofty Patrons. And if
any two, or moe of these dependers,
should justle amongst themselves (as
ordinarily falls out amongst such as are
rivalls in favour) then the Grandee is
divided in his resolution; and as he
gains no new friend by assisting the
one, So he losses an old servant by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the other. And when a Grandee
hath spawn'd out his Estate amongst his
Favourits, one of a thousand will not
prove gratefull; but though all the
thousand should prove gratefull to one,
the ingratitude of that one will be more
unpleasant, then can be repair'd by the


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59999:12"/>
gratitude of all the remanent nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ninety nine.</p>
            <p>As to their equals, such as are in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employment, lye under this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
that either they please them
not, and these they either find, or make
their enemies; or, if they endeavour
to please all, then the task is either
impossible, or unprofitable: impossible,
because after that they have crook'd
their own humour to make it fall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to another mans vn-even fancy,
then they may instantly loss their
pains; when vpon the same principle
(of pleasing all) they indeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege
one, who either is, or is believed
to be, either rival, or enemy to him who
was first oblieged. And is there any
thing more ordinar (though nothing
more vnjust) then to hear, <hi>ye must either
not be my friend, or that mans enemy?</hi>
This pleasing all is likewise unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
because things are not valued by
advantage but by propriety: and thus
we value that friendship most, which
is born to us solely, or in a greater


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59999:12"/>
measure then to others. Whereby
it appears clearly, that if ye carry equally
to all, ye obliege none, and if more to
some then to others, ye disobliege these
to whom ye carry least; which certainly
(because our love is like our selves, most
finit) must be the greatest part: and
these who are disoblieged, are more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in their enmity, then these who
are oblieged, are in their friendship.
The conclusion of all, which is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the great pleasure of publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is, that thereby they may
obliege many to a dependance upon
them, yet men gain by it moe, and more
vigorous enemies, then such as are
recluse do, albeit they profuse none of
their inesteemable time upon so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a purchase.</p>
            <p>As to their Superiours, it vexes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
such as are at so much toyl to be
high themselves, to see any yet higher
then themselves; and they count as
many crosses, as they do Superiours. If
States-men be not at the highest pitch
of favour, they fret at the vnluckiness


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59999:13"/>
of their own fate, and exclaim against
their ill-faced stars: and if they attain
to it, then they are oft jealoused by their
promotters: And <hi>Sejanus</hi> is loaded with
more contumely by his Patron <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
then ever he was with honours. And
after that these ploding pates, have
raised their designs to that line, that
they conceive, they may justly admire
it's noble structure, and their own skill
in it's contrivance; then that fabrick,
upon which, for (possibly) their whole
life, they have laid out the whole stock
of their happiness and expectation,
may be in one moment, blown over by
one word from their Prince, who is
a man subject to his own fate, as they
are to theirs: and when they perceive
that the same Prince is thereafter forc'd
to yield to his own destiny, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conclude, that they have been
themselves mean persons, who was so
easily destroyed, by one who was so
easily destroyed himself. If <hi>Parmenio</hi>
had not killed <hi>Attalus,</hi> or <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eander Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
their disobedience had been a


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59999:13"/>
crime; and when they obeyed, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was really a crime in them, and
was hated as such by <hi>Alexander</hi> who
commanded it: so that superiours do oft
tye their favourits to the observance of
what is contradictory, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require what is impossible.</p>
            <p>It was nobly said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> by that grand Mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Stoicisme, <hi>Seneca,</hi> that, <hi>qui multa
agit, saepe se fortunae objecit.</hi> And pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
persons are in this, like great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
which by how much the greater
they are, are so much the worse to be
defended, and by how much the richer
they are, are so much the more stoutly
assaulted. For establishing this great
truth which is <hi>unum ex mirabilibus
Stoicorum,</hi> I shall under-prop it by
these two subservient conclusions;
first, that seing that is only, in all the
Schools of philosophers, defin'd to be
morally good, which is compleat at all
points; and that to be evil, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the least defect: certainly it
must be a great task, not only to
do good, but even not to fall into the


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59999:14"/>
commission of evil. The second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
shall be, that as it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
not to slip into the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of evil, yet our escapes are never
forgot, when once committed; and
not only wrong they us as to that
action, but they likewise detract from
all our subsequent good actions: and
albeit it be very hard to do what is
good, yet our good actions are most
unfrequently remembred; or if they
be, then they are esteemed duties, and
so they bring us by that remembrance,
no other advantage from men, then
not to bring a tash upon us. <hi>Marshal
Biron</hi>'s many victories, obtained by his
valour, for <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steins</hi>
for the Emperour, nor <hi>Essex</hi>'s for
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did not excuse their
after-treason. And <hi>Balaams</hi> beast
(though otherwayes an Ass) could tell
it's Master, <hi>have not I ridden with thee
ever since I was thine without stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling?
and yet now thou hast struck me
thrice?</hi> From all which it follows,
that publick employments, because


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59999:14"/>
they obliedge a man to many actions,
they therefore engage him in many
misfortunes, and lay him open to much
detraction. Neither doth mans mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
stint it self here; but, which is
worse, envy, malice and mistake,
blaze us for more vitious then really
we are; we commit some escapes,
wherein we mistake our selves, but
we are said to commit others, wherein
others do but mistake us; we commit:
some, which are really our own trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
but we are said to commit
others, which are but other mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.
Such as are in publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
can never want rivalls; and
such as want not rivalls can never miss
mis-reports; especially in our Country,
where the way to preferment is so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that we imagine no man can get by
his neighbour, except he run over him.
O! what a divine state then must <hi>soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
be, wherein a virtuous in activity
fortifies us against all these inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and begets in us a tranquillity, not
conceivable by such as do not possess it?.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59999:15"/>
Have ye not, my Lord, oft heard
great men say, <hi>I must do this, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to that, though neither the one
nor the other satisfies my judgment?</hi>
Have ye not seen great men forc'd to
abandon their most deserving friends,
forc'd to connive at, and oft to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
the promotion of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
enemies? will they not be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
oblieg'd to put on a constrain'd
countenance, feign an unnatural mine,
and express what is diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
to their thoughts; all which are
servitudes which greatness exacts from
us: for every force is a yoke ty'd
upon our nature; and man being more
noble then brutes, because he is more
free then they are, certainly what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
his freedom, destroyes his reason:
and most of these restraints, as they
are against nature, in being servitudes;
So they are against virtue, in being
opposite to what our reason would (if
not over-power'd by interest or fancy)
exact of us. And I should think, that
the same impulse, which hurries men


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59999:15"/>
on to desire to be great, that they may
be Masters, should, with far more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
carry them to be solitary: for there
they are emancipat from these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and have none to obey but God
and nature; Masters who commands us
to do nothing, but what were fit for
our selves to do, albeit we were not
commanded.</p>
            <p>As these Countreys are esteemed
most excellent and preferable, whose
necessities are supplyed by their native
commodities, pulling out of their own
bosome all that their Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
So by the same rule, <hi>solitude</hi>
must be, by much preferable to
publick Employment, seing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and wants but little, but the
other needs much, and is not satisfied
when it gets what it needs. <hi>Solitude</hi>
requires no avarice to maintain it's
table, nor oppression to bear up it's
train; it is satisfied without Coaches,
Lacquies, Treasures and Embroideries:
The solitary man is not vext, that
others must take the door of himself, or


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59999:16"/>
is able to maintain a more sumptuous
table then he; he is not disquieted at
the infrequency of guests, nor echoes
of his equals praises. And seing great
men are still disquieted at the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, they must still be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
for though they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to receive, yet they are not able
to sustain the weight of all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
alone.</p>
            <p>Consider these clouds which sit oft
upon the countenance of men in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
their gate like to that of
an disrudered Ship, and their discourse
dis-joynted, and blown, as it were, all
to pieces by their tempestuous passions;
and ye will find such (many times) to
differ but by an ace, from these who
have Keepers at <hi>Bedlam:</hi> And by these
disorders ye may perceive, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
and madnes are of too near an
alliance; and if the one, certainly both
must be diseases, seing both have the
same symptoms, and the same prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks.
And in these distempers,
how oft speak they things, which are


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59999:16"/>
thereafter either quarre led openly, or
at least are the seed-plot of continual
heart-burnings to these at whom they
aimed? But to abstract from all these
accidental disadvantages, Is it not a
madness for a rational Soul, for whom
all the world was created, to observe
nothing in this world, but whether
another manages his Process well, with
what harmony stricks another man's
pulse, or how to brigue the favour of a
Minion? Acts so extrinsick to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an immaterial creature, such as
the Soul, that if men got not money
by these Employments, they would
themselves condemn them as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
And is there any thing more
ordinar, even amongst the herd of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
busie-bodies, then to chide their
friends for attending either the persons
or employments of those who reward
not such pains, and for so doing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
them as mad men? and so they are
indeed. By which it is most evident,
that men in employment have nothing
to excuse their madness, but that they


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59999:17"/>
are not madd, but for money or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And is it not a shame for so
noble a creature as Man, to be content
to shew himself madd for any hire
what soever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solitude</hi> has likewayes this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over publick Employment, that
there is no vice commissable in <hi>solitude,</hi>
to which men in publick lye not yet
more open; whereas, there are some
crimes, such as, treason, sedition, osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and a whole tribe of the like
nature, which retired persons can hardly
commit; and though they could, yet
hardly does that state admit of these
temptations, which are previously ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar
to the commission of them. Is
there any thing more ordinar, then to
hear one who is accused for deserting
his friend, or party, to answer, that
his office, or present designs, occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and required that defection? And
are not men, for accomplishing their
projects, tempted to betray secrets, to
become rivals to their friends, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
to their enemies? Whereas, no


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59999:17"/>
Record can witness against retired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that they ever either ruined their
native Country, betrayed their Prince,
or deserted their Friend? At least, if
any in that state have been tempted to
the least degree of any such crime, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they had committed moe, and
greater villanies, if they had lived in
publick, where those wicked inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might have been strengthned, by
example, design, passion, revenge,
or some such temptatoin. And if our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
be so wild, when they are
caiged up in <hi>solitude,</hi> how untame will
they become, when they are licenced to
range abroad? He who would stob his
Prince, who had never the occasion to
offend his remote Cell, would burn the
world, if he had a design, to which that
might be subservient. Did not <hi>Nero, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,
Heliog abulus</hi> and others, enjoy
the repute of noble souls, before their
mounting the Imperial Throne, brought
them new vices, with new honours,
and made them as much beyond other
in their debauches, as they were in the


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59999:18"/>
power, which fed them in that their
dissolut humour. Since then no honest
person can deny, but that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
never to have the greatest honour,
then to be said by after-ages to have
committed the least villany: certainly
the state of publick Employment is
scarce to be wished for, seing therein
men are tempted to commit the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of crimes; especially, seing these
their escapes must be committed in
publick, where they are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and but seldom (if ever) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>

other murders of King's and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees:
and as to the disgrace of others,
these can hardly be sufficiently either
numbered or regrated. And albeit
others are not deter'd from embracing
those honours under which their first
owners have been crush'd upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that they imagine their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
ruine to have flow'd from some
personal frailty or error, against which
they are confident they can guard; yet
certainly all should, even from this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
conclude, that greatness must be
most undesirable, seing, at least, it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
these frailties, or tempts men to
commit these errors, which thereafter
occasions these ruines. Neither find
we any such dangers to attend <hi>solitude,</hi>


               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59999:19"/>
either necessarily<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or by accident: So
that albeit these be the misfortunes of
those men, and not of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet seing these are only the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of men in employment, I see
not why employment should be so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by men who fear misfortunes. But
the truth is, it is impossible to warde
against the unexpected blows which
are thrust in at such, for they are so
cunningly contrived by the attacquers
(because of the danger of being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered)
that they are sooner felt then
foreseen. Who could dis-appoint the
malice of those who killed these noble
Princes, <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth of <hi>France?</hi> Who could
have targetted <hi>Buckingham</hi> against
<hi>Feltons</hi> thrust? And all the prudence
of <hi>Cesars</hi> Court could not avert his
massacre in the Senat, especially being
contrived by his confident, <hi>Brutus;
Et tu fili Brute</hi> said that great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
And that which renders the
suddain fall of these Heroes the more
deplorable, is, that by being suddain,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59999:19"/>
it not only disorders their affairs and
endangers their souls, but likewise so
amazes their friends and followers, that
they are thereby incapacitate from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
against the sequels of that fall,
and are themselves (who only can help
their falling friend) brought to fall
with him. I have oft remarked with
wonder, how ghastly the favorites of a
falling Minion do look, and how asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishingly
they are lookt at by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
intimats; and which is strange,
not only do the enemies of a fallen
Grandee insult over his misfortunes, but
even these who were his former well-wishers,
are (to avert the jealousie of
those who occasioned his fall) necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
to enveigh most bitterly against
his memory;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Dum jacet in ripa calcemus</hi> Cesaris <hi>hostem.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither can I see how greatness can
be defended against misfortunes; for
ordinarly these rise from such unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beginnings, that none see in (or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the least danger by) them: and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59999:20"/>
all the world is not able, by conjecture,
to fall upon that <hi>medium</hi> by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
intends to infer their ruine.
Who could have guessed, that <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi>'s
discovering a plot to <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>
wherein <hi>Haman</hi> was not concerned,
would be the mean to destroy that great
Favourite? I have oft heard the friends
of those who are now low, ask at such
as told them of the slipperiness of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
how could their Patron ever be
destroyed? and it was impossible that
could fall out during such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And yet I have my self seen
these men outed of all their confident
expectations; a passionat expression,
a rash act, a jealousie or mis-information
which could not be foreseen, because
then there was no bottom for such
a conjecture, hath ruined oft-times such
as never expected any alteration: and
who can promise that they shall never
drop one word in passion, act any thing
without a previous deliberation, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall under mis-information? And
which is yet worse, when mis-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59999:20"/>
are forged against great men: They
are not acquainted by such as either
gives or receives them, and so their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
becomes imprestable. I have heard
of Favourits who have been ruined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Queen said they were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
men, or the King thought them
to excell himself in any thing wherein
himself pretended to a mastership: and
what plodding pate could have stav'd
off, or foreseen these misfortunes?
No, no.
<q>
                  <l>Ludit in humanis divina prudentia
rebus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And seing there are many who have
the courage to throw away their lives
upon the revenge of a small affront, or
to hazard them in an open, and yet
almost a barren robbery, why should
it be thought, that to saitsfie so impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
a passion as Revenge, there
should not be some found who will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
death, by giving it in the revenge
of either an injury done to a Family
or Nation, much more of an affront
fixt upon the undertaker himself, in


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59999:21"/>
his honour, or entire fortune, as oft
falls out?</p>
            <p>But albeit great men and publick
Ministers escape the fate of a murder or
massacre, yet how is their happiness
founded? is it not either upon the
humour of a capricious people, if in a
Commonwealth? and then how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solid
is that happiness where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is so fleeting? Consider <hi>Rome,</hi>
which, though the wisest of all Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
yet, upon a jealousie or a mistake,
or some times out of wantonness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
in an instant the most carressed,
and most deserving of her Favourits,
Or, upon the favour of a Prince, if in a
Monarchy; and then ye must confess
them oft-times subject to all the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a lofty humour, licenc'd by the
extent of his power, to equal his power
and his humour; and entic'd, by the
instigation of enemies or rivals, to
stretch his humour beyond his allowed
power. Why did <hi>Solyman</hi> the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
cut the throat of <hi>Ibrahim Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
his Confident? was it not to satisfie


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59999:21"/>
the fancy of a Concubine? Or <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
pull out the eyes of valiant <hi>Bellisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius?</hi>
was it not to gratifie an insolent
Wife? So that a States-man lyes open,
not only to the hazard of his Masters
fancy, but to the passion of his Wife,
his Concubines, his Favourits and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-servants,
and even to Fate it self,
which is the most comprehensive of all
dangers.</p>
            <p>But albeit a States-man were able to
escape privat revenge, and to mannage,
with success, his Princes humour, and
to satisfie that of his Favourits, yet
he is still obnoxious to <hi>ragione del stato,</hi>
and interest of State, by which his
Prince is oft (to evite the rage of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude)
either forc'd to object his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their rage, as the head in a natural
body defends it self by throwing up it's
hand or arm to receive the stroak, or
else he may be pull'd from the kind
bosome of his unwilling Master: And
of this hazard our own age affords us
a lamentable instance in the person of
the great Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whom


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59999:22"/>
popular fury did drag to the Scaffold;
his Princes protection not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for his defence; who viewing,
from that deplorable Stage, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of Courtship and Advancement,
did leave in legacie to his Son, a strait
command never to aim at higher pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
then that of a Justice of Peace
in his own County.</p>
            <p>Consider likewayes how sometimes
the satiety of a Prince produces the
same ruine of Favourits, which is at
other times the product of his cruelty.
And <hi>Comines</hi> observes, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the
eleventh of <hi>France</hi> used to say, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes did weary of Houses, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and other inanimat things, which
could never offend them, and which no
rival or enemy was at the pains to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
It was no wonder that they weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Favourits, who were subject to all
these inconveniences. Princes do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ruine their Grandees, sometimes
to satisfie their vanity, in shewing that
their power is able to remove those
who think they cannot fall without a


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59999:22"/>
miracle; and sometimes to make way
to new Favourits, thinking it injustice
to entail all honours upon the same
persons. And, as in the body natural;
So likewise in the politick, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that nature hath provided
more diseases, then the best of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
can prevent by remedies.</p>
            <p>To conclude this period, be pleased
to conclude the unluckiness of publick
Employment from this, That not
only amongst rivals, one of two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
satisfie, by their fall, the rage
of fate, but when it hath assisted the
one to destroy the other, it then turns
it's fury against the late victor: Thus
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cesar</hi>'s blood purpl'd equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the swords of murderers, agreeing
in nothing but their destiny. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
beats the Romans; <hi>Scipio</hi> beats
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the Romans banish
<hi>Scipio. Bellisarius</hi> makes <hi>Gilimer</hi>
King of the <hi>Goths</hi> ridiculous, leading
him as a prisoner in his triumph; and
Fate renders <hi>Bellisarius</hi> yet more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
driving him to beg, with this


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59999:23"/>
expression, <hi>bestow but a farthing upon
Bellisarius.</hi> And it is most observable,
that during our civil wars, four most
eminent persons, who did head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as well as different parties, did
all loss both their heads, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in the quarrel; whereas it might
have been expected, that at least one
of the opposits, should have worn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fadeing
lawrels: and really there was
more hazard in the fear, of being the
one who was to be destroyed (for they
might certainly have expected, that
one of themselves, should fall) then all
the grandour, which the survivers,
might expect, could sufficiently
requite.</p>
            <p>And when the monarch or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which a States-man hath long
served, intends either in compliance
with their interests, or to gratifie their
humour, to out their servant of his
employment, or in order thereto to fix
a crime upon him: then how can he
escape from that tryal, or defend his
right against that persuit? for where


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59999:23"/>
the Judge is party, there the Law
may prove Advocat. And in these
<hi>contrasto's,</hi> I remember few dicisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
amongst all who have collected
them, of any subject, who came off
with honour.</p>
            <p>Seing as of all other things,<note place="margin">Sect. 3. <hi>Motives to</hi> soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </note> so of our
thoughts the first-born should be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to our almighty Maker; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resolved, to begin my first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with these reflections, which
<hi>Solitude</hi> might borrow from devotion.
But, since Orators recommend the last
place in our discourse, to the strongest
perswasives (as being able when plac'd
there to leave the freshest impressions;
upon the leaving Reader) I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this last place, (which is,
alas! the too ordinar room allowed to
devotion) recommend to you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that GOD possesses moe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and we labour under moe sins,
then can be fully contemplated, in the
one case, or lamented in the other,
throughout the whole flux of eternity.
And after that we have evacuated our


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59999:24"/>
more refined spirits; in chase of these
fleeing follies, will it satisfie him to
to have our dulled thoughts (the lame
of the flock) served up upon his holy
Altars? And seing he stiles himself
a jealouse GOD: certainly he cannot
but be jealous, that because we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verss
with others more then with him;
we must therefore, either love these
better or expect more, either advantage
or pleasure in their society then
in his.</p>
            <p>I confess that publick Employment,
is lawfull in it self, and necessar to
the Common-wealth, and that men
may serve GOD in the intervalls of
their other publick negotiations. But
the question is not, what is lawfull in it
self; but what is convenient for us,
and seing we run already, but too slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that divine race; I see not why we
should slow our pace yet more by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on the burthen of publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
And seing all our time is
but too short, for the service of him
whom far more excellent creatures then


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59999:24"/>
we worship uncessantly, time without
end: I think it strange, that we should
content our selves to serve him <hi>per
parenthesin,</hi> or by intervals.</p>
            <p>To these I shall add this import con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that most of temptations,
are in <hi>Solitude</hi> disarm'd of these charms,
which renders them formidable to us
in publick: love wants there the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of an enflaming object to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
it; revenge wants the presence
of the party injured to press it: and
vanity when it wants admirers, wants
force. Though <hi>Moses</hi> was the meekest
man upon the earth, whilst he lived
in the desert; yet the extravagancy
of those whom he governed, when
providence had advanced him, made
him offend his Maker, so highly, that all
his former services, could not obtain,
even from the Father of mercies, a
liberty to enter into an earthly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
If <hi>Naaman</hi> had lived an Hermit, he
needed not have crav'd the Prophet
leave, to bow to the idols of his master;
in the house of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> And if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>


               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59999:25"/>
had not been governor of <hi>Israel</hi>
he had wanted the means both to
humble <hi>Bath-sheba;</hi> and kill <hi>Urriah,</hi>
such is the ill fate of publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it not only affords us temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
but the means likewise of
effectuating that to which we are
tempted.</p>
            <p>It was I confess GODS own verdict of
man, that it was not good for him to be
alone, but this was when because of his
congenial innocence, he needed not fear
the contamination of society; but to
demonstrat what the hazard of being in
company is: even <hi>Adam</hi> could not live
one day in it, and live innocent, for the
first news we hear of him, after that
<hi>Eve</hi> was associat to him, is, that he
had forefeited that native purity.</p>
            <p>I know that our Saviour, was carried by
Satan to the wilderness, that he might
tempt him there. But it is most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that after that experienced
enemy, found that his Divinity would
not yeild to any thing therein repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
he thereafter (as the last and


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59999:25"/>
so the strongest shift left to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essayed,
did bring him to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and
having advanced him above the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he proffer'd him the halfe of the
belted world, and all it's glories;
a temptation, sitted only for such as
value honour and publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When GOD Almighty intended to
converse with <hi>Moses,</hi> He called him
from the populous camp, to the top
of Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And our Saviour
did not disclose the glories of his
Transfiguration at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top of the Mount of <hi>Olives.</hi>
The Widow who intended a lodging
for <hi>Elisha</hi> that great Prophet, did build
it apart upon the wall,<note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 10.</note> furnishing it
only with a Stool and Candlestick:
and when he asked her, if he should
speak for her to the King, or Captain
of his Hoast, she told him, without
farther answer, <hi>that she dwelt amongst
her own Friends, and in her own
Countrey;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 12.</note> intimating thereby, that
there was no need of any favour Kings


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59999:26"/>
could bestow upon such as enjoy'd so
happy a recess. I recreat my self to
think I see <hi>Elijah</hi> sitting under a
juniper Tree, or in a concealed Grove,
visited in that <hi>solitude</hi> by the same
GOD, who refused His presence to
mighty <hi>Ahab;</hi> and to contemplat how
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> was able to find no ease upon
his purpred couch, till he dispatched
in quest of it some of his chiefest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to court it from the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
sitting upon the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
By all which places and postures,
the Spirit of GOD (who losses no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation)
intends doubtless to enamour
us of <hi>solitude</hi> and recess. And it is
very observable, that none of these
old Prophets are found, in Scripture,
at Court or in Publick, but as bearded
Comets appear in the air, where they
have no other earand then to denounce
Judgments to the place over which
they hover.</p>
            <p>GOD Almighty, who because he is
the object as well as enjoyner of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
should, and does upon these and


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59999:26"/>
many other scores, best know how to
address them; hath commanded us to
retire into our Closets (the most soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of all our rooms) and to make
these yet more retired, hath ordained us
to close our doors behind us when we
make any religious applications to him;
promising, that <hi>he who seeth in secret,
will reward us openly:</hi> And if we will
consider these gawdy distractions,
whereby our publick devotions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
rendered no devotion at all, and
that there is more noise in the world
then will suffer us to hear that still
voice which cryes behind us, <hi>This is the
way, walk ye in it;</hi> certainly we may
conclude, from both reason and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
(as well as out of obedience to
divine Commands) that <hi>solitude</hi> is the
true forge of the purest devotions.
When GOD did intend to discipline his
beloved (though rebellious) <hi>Israel,</hi>
he chose first the wilderness of <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and then the two Captivities to be his
sacred School. And, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 14. he
tells his own people, that <hi>he will allure


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59999:27"/>
her</hi> (meaning the Jewish Church) <hi>and
bring her to the wilderness, and speak
comfortably unto her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion hath another quarrel at Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
which is, that it devests oft-times
it's enjoyers, not only of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and of friendship, which is a moral
virtue, but even of affection; which is
so natural to brutes themselves, that a
man is worse then these when he wants
it: and not only forget they it upon
such necessities as might at least excuse,
if not justifie, their so doing, but do so
likewise to satisfie their humour; a
slavery which deserves to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though it's object were in it self ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable.
No man could have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if Scripture had not told it,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.</note> that <hi>Saul</hi>
would, from being an absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
descend to so low a baseness, as to
cast away his daughter <hi>Michael</hi> meerly
that he might destroy her Husband:
Or that a Prince of <hi>Midian</hi> would have
prostitute his daughter <hi>Cozbi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> to the
promiscuous multitudes of the Israeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sh
camp, of design to tempt them


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59999:27"/>
to a sin: which could not but be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with his own infamy, as well as
their ruine. Was it not for this that
<hi>Romulus</hi> cemented the first foundation
of the Roman walls with the blood of
his brother <hi>Remus?</hi> And though <hi>Abel</hi>
and <hi>Cain</hi> had the division, of what
tempts (I will not say) satisfies now the
ambition of many thousands to gratifie
their expectations; yet, was not so
ample a partage able to prevent the spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
even of a brothers blood, by one
whose crime was so much the greater
that it was without president, and was
to become an example to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of succeeding ages? Many where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
might, and have been thereby not
only encouraged to commit afresh this
old sin, but likewayes to seek, in the
greatness of this offence, excuses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to lessen their own barbarity.</p>
            <p>But if any call in question the
advantages that accrew to devotion by
<hi>solitude,</hi> let him cast back his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the primitive Church, wherein the
material fabrick was contriv'd dark,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59999:28"/>
and situat in the remotest corners and
solitary Groves, both by Pagans and
Christians; as if that black enamel
hightned the lustre of the golden
Candlesticks: and upon the infinit
swarms of such as became Moncks and
Hermits, encourag'd thereto by the
homilies and entreaties of the noblest
Fathers; of which state the Emperour
<hi>Iustinian</hi> did, after he had kept that
oecumenick Councel, become so ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd,
that he hath registrat it's noble
Elogies in the Frontis-piece of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>codex.</hi> Whilst, upon the other
hand, the Heathens of old, and now the
Mahumetans did, and do teach, that one
of the chief torments in their hell shall
be, that men will there be cast louse to
to these occupations and civil employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which here exercis'd them;
esteeming it a torture for illuminat spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and such as are defecat from sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
to be re-embarast with such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
affairs as busie us in this our
earthly state. Pardon, my Lord, this
in-road I have made upon devotion;


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59999:28"/>
and learn from it, that <hi>solitude</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
are so nearly related, that we
can hardly praise the one, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the other.</p>
            <p>I shall hear use the authority of great
Hero's; who, after the fruition of
both, have by much prefer'd <hi>solitude,</hi>
whereas (which is very strange) there is
not a single testimony to be had from
such as these, in favours of publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>The first shall be of <hi>Charles</hi> the

What hath my Kingdom, or the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of so many men gain'd me? Much
more happy had I been, if in stead of a
Scepter, I had weilded an hedging Bill;
and if of a King I should have made my
self a Clown:</hi> Following in this almost
the very expressions of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his
brother: <hi>Suatocopius</hi> King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
and <hi>Moravia,</hi> having lost a battel
against the Emperour <hi>Arnold,</hi> did retire


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59999:29"/>
himself into a wilderness, where, after
he had lived a long time with three
Hermits, he at his death told them,
that there was not any greatness
preferable to the tranquillity of that
<hi>solitude. The safe sleep</hi> (said he) <hi>which
we enjoy here, makes the roots savoury,
and the waters sweet; whereas the cares
of a Kingdom makes all meat and drink
taste bitter. That part of my life,
which, I have past with you, was
true happiness; whereas that which I
led upon my royal Throne deserves more
the title of death then of life.</hi> And
<hi>Giges</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> puff'd up with
his great wealth and many victories,
having asked the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> if
there was any man happier in the world
then himself, had <hi>Agesilaus</hi> the poor

And <hi>Similis,</hi> one of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

why is there so much pains, taken for
<hi>Fame,</hi> which is nothing else but a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of their suffrages: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
recommends much to me,
that stoical fear, given to <hi>Hannibal</hi> by

passion, be pleased to consider, that
either our souls, have the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iod

and what advantage brings it to us

And then the loud Halelujahs of my

voice of <hi>Fame</hi> in our ears, that it will not
be heard by us; and our souls will be

air, must yeild and flee out at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of any thing, that is more solide,
or else the souls of these, who are
praised, will be damned: and then they
will not be susceptible of any pleasing
impressions. And I am confident that
one of the torments of damned spirits,
is that they imagine all the world to be
full of their infamy. And seing the
<hi>Fame</hi> of the greatest of men, is not able
to solace him in the fit of a feaver, or
gravel; Why should we imagine that
it can lessen the weight of such pressing
torments, as infernal horrour, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
damnation? To talk of <hi>Amphialus,</hi>
who never was, is the same thing as to
talk of <hi>Alexander:</hi> only <hi>Amphialus,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be stained with cruelty, vanity and
drunkenness as <hi>Alexander</hi> is: but albeit
<hi>Fame</hi> were to be courted, what share
of it can we expect, who are scarce
known beyond the line of our own
History, and but transiently in that
likewise? Who amongst us would
toil as we do, to be esteemed, as <hi>Popen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
or <hi>Bajard,</hi> (whom I believe very


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59999:31"/>
few have heard of) and yet these acted
upon the continent of the world, and
did greater things then the present state
of affairs will admit us to do. And I
am confident, that there liv'd lately at
the Court of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Courtiers, who injoyed fat
taller honours then we, and who would
not have embraced the honours we
grasp after; and yet <hi>Fame</hi> scornes to be
at so much pains as once to mention
their names. How many know not
at present, the name of that grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,
who but lately made <hi>Germany</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
and to say that it was the grand-Visier,
is to praise his Office, and not
himself. Who can name the greatest
Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Dogi</hi> of <hi>Venice?</hi>
And yet, what infinit pains is taken to
gain these employments, by such as live
upon the place?</p>
            <p>I smile to see underling pretenders, and
who live in a Country, scarce design'd
in the exactests maps, sweat and toil
for so unmassie a reputation, that when
it is hammered out to the most stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59999:31"/>
dimensions, will not yet reach the
nearest towns of a neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Whereas, examine such as have but
lately returned from travelling in most
floorishing Kingdoms, and though cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
was their greatest errand, yet ye
will find that they scarce know who is
Chancellour or first President in these
places; and in the exactest Histories,
we hear but few news of the famousest
Pleaders, Divines or Phisitians; and
by Souldiers these are under-valued
as pedants, and these by them as
madcaps, and both by Philosophers
as fools.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Fame</hi> were desirable, yet
publick Employment is not always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by it: for, either advancment
is attributed to the fancy of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancer,
or to fate and hazard. And in
either of these cases, the person pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
is not honoured, but his fate;
and it will be loudly proclaimed as a
thing most strange, that one of so
mean merit or so rebellious principles,
or tainted with any such vice (as envy


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59999:32"/>
will either find or make) should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to such honours: whereas if
the same person had satisfied himself
with a solitary life, his reall vices had
neither been discovered, nor such forged
vices proclaimed; and because people
blame Minions, whilst they live for
what they dare not charge upon their
Master, their envy or revenge transmits
to posterity, that character which was

they yet governed. Was <hi>Perenni<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

report, is by law judged, to be unstable
as water, So in this it resembles much
the water that it presents (like to it)
the straightest objects to our sight, as
crooked and uneven. And since <hi>Fame</hi>
depends upon the credulous multitude,
and upon unrestrainable accidents, who
can assure himself of it's suffrage? or
believe it when it is obtained? If the
Souldiers prove cowardly, and lose a
battle, the General is for ever affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet he cannot help it: or if a
Servant betray a States-mans secret,
then the Masters prudence is for ever
traduced. Ignominy being like all
other black spots (a tenaciousness pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
only to that colour) which cannot
be worn off, nor washt out: And the
designs of States-men being as latent,
as the springs which do inwardly
move mechanick machins, the people
(whose intelligence cannot reach
these) judge of the designs by the
events: And if at any time the event
answer the contrivers expectation, then
the malicious multitude ascribe this


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59999:33"/>
success, either to hazard, or to their
power. And, to speak seriously, <hi>power</hi>
is so happy a suffragant, that it takes
off much of that repute which is due
to the contriver: for, who can be foyl'd
having such a second? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, that power and command
conceals what strength and energie
there is really in the Governours wit,
reflect but a little upon those pitifull
rebels, who govern'd lately this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and did seem most wise, whilst
they were vested with power: Of
which, being now again devested, their
wit falls far short of the first cast. Like
those Venetian Ladies, whose native
stature rises, and lowes in appearance,
according to the height of these, <hi>soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>
whereupon they walk. But
if <hi>Fame</hi> be the great prize, I see not
why the <hi>Literati</hi> and <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> or
retir'd <hi>Curiosi,</hi> may not put in for as
large a share in it, as most (if not any)
States-man: For, if that maxime hold,
that <hi>propter quod unum quodque est
tale, propter hoc, illud ipsum est majus


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59999:33"/>
tale:</hi> certainly it follows in true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
that seing solitary persons are
the dispensers and bestowers of <hi>Fame</hi>
upon great men, they cannot miss it
themselves. How had <hi>Aeneas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or <hi>Achilles</hi> valour, been forgot,
had not <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> sung their
Elogies? And after a great man hath
defeated Kingdoms, a pedant is (like
the sillie worm) able in one night, to
consume that blossoming gourd of his
reputation: And seing the world know
not what the one did, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what the other said. History
(which is the grand-register of <hi>Fame</hi>)
is known for the most part only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
persons, and these will admire
most what suites most with their own
humour: And <hi>Fame</hi> it self being most
oblieged to such as study <hi>solitude,</hi> it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieges
ordinarily these most, because
they have oblieged it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath
prov'd himself, by his Syllogisms, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
person then <hi>Alexander</hi> his famous
Schollar; <hi>Solon</hi> is more famous for his
moral advice to <hi>Cresus,</hi> then <hi>Cresus,</hi>


               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59999:34"/>
who possest those mountains of gold;
which were the subject of his advice:
and <hi>Cicero's</hi> tongue, though pull'd out
of his head by <hi>Anthony,</hi> hath spoke out
his praises louder, then all the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the Roman legions and
echoing artillerie could proclaim that
more then Monarch. And seing that
man is happiest, who is happy whil'st
he is a man, such as attain to <hi>Fame</hi> by
<hi>solitude,</hi> are happier then great men,
because they are happy whil'st they
are able to find it, whil'st the others
have it only when they are not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of what they have. Compare
<hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> (to the stature of whose
repute our dwarffish endeavours will
never be able to rise) with <hi>Lucan,</hi> who
wrote the story of his wars, and ye
will find <hi>Lucan</hi> the much happier:
Consider <hi>Cesar,</hi> macerat oft with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
stiffned with unrewarded toil,
jealous of his own souldiers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of the Senat, tortured with
the uncertain events of the war, and
terrified by the having kill'd his Son


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59999:34"/>
in law <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he was sure of the
victory. And then return your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon <hi>Lucan,</hi> sitting in the
bosome of a shaddowie grove, flanckt
with a christal stream, and there creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those noble lines, which have
since carried his fame as far as <hi>Cesars</hi>
actions; and having in this the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Cesar,</hi> even as to posterity,
that <hi>Cesars</hi> souldiers, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ill fate,
the Senats irresolution, and the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of their Auxiliaries, share with
<hi>Cesar</hi> in the event, and really more
then he; whereas <hi>Lucan</hi> inherits the
sole praise of his story now, as he did
the pleasure of having wrote it whil'st
he was yet alive. But to conclude the
folly of <hi>Fame,</hi> consider even this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Lucan,</hi> falling under the sword
of <hi>Nero;</hi> because that cruel Prince was
ashamed to see himself so far out-done
in wit by one of his own Subjects: and
from this learn, that <hi>Fame</hi> is suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to its dependers, when it bestows
it's favours, and injust, when it denyes
them.</p>

as one of the ravishing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

the soul of man in this, seems to have

the judgement and purity of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

prove also ineffectual; I find that
little hopes can be entertained of our
succeeding in it. But consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
that it being a congenial humour
in all mankind, to desire freedom;
certainly great men must conclude,
that their dependers would not bow
to such homages, If they thought not
thereby to obliege their Patrons, to the
full requitall of what they so highly
value: And therefore, these being

and Offices are expected, all which
put us to real pains; consider if these
imaginary pleasures deserve to be
bought at the rate of such real vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The <hi>Magnifico</hi> must himself
bow to his Prince, bear his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
swear a friendship with these
whom he hates, dispence with affronts,
spend all his time in attendance at
Court, and in observing these humours,
which he must thereafter supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
obey; and all this, that he
may gain wherewith to repay saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
flatteries, legs, congies, and such

may scrue himself so far into the respect
of the people, that he may have hats

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59999:36"/>
being bribed to depone what they say
of him, is not this satisfaction a meer
act of fancy? And is it not saifer to
translate our fancy to some other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
then to moderat it here? And
who can assure himself, that when he
hath arrived at that pitch of command
which he presently proposes, that this
shall terminat his ambition? and is
not the French King as much troubled,
that he cannot command the Grand-signior,
as a french courtier is for being
lower then his King. And after that
a Chancellor, hath rendred his place, by
any short possession familiar to him, he
then despises what he enjoys, by the
same principle which invited him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that imployment, when it was yet
above his reach. But abstracting from
these considerations, what can it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
any man that another bows to
him? It can neither cure Gout nor
Gravel: And when he is displeased
at any thing else, it is so far from being
able to solace him, that that which
vexes him most, is, that any person can


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59999:36"/>
be found who dares displease one who
is so great as he: and if he had not
been so great, that accident which now
grieves him, could not have vexed
him: so that in wishing to be great,
we wish that we may be made more
susceptible of affronts, then nature hath
already made us.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, <hi>Celador,</hi> that great
men are oblieg'd to attend more submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
their Superiors, then we do them:
because these have moe designs then
we; and design is the occasion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.
So that if there be any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in liberty, we enjoy it more then
these; and if there be none, why is
there so much pains taken to be great,
upon expectation, that greatness sets
at liberty? A private man is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
to oppose his Relations, fight
against his Country, give his own
Judgement the lye; all which are but
the meanest impositions that some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslay

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59999:37"/>

and that as to the possession of this, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litariness
seems to cede to publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.
But when we consider, that
the prerogative of society stands not
in seeing one another, but in rational
conversation, it will appear that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is not wide. For, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
can be received by talking of new
Fashions, buying and selling of Lands,
advancement or ruine of Favourits,
victories or defeats of stranger Princes,
which is the ordinary subject of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
conversation? And really I have
admir'd to see persons of virtue and
honour long much to be in the City,
where when they come, they found
nor sought for no other divertisement
then to visit one another, and there to
do nothing else then to make legs, view
others habit, talk of the weather, or
some such pitifull subject: and it may
be, if they made a farther inroad upon
any other affair, they did so pick


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59999:37"/>
one another, that it afforded them mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of eternal quarrel; for what was
at first but an indifferent subject, is by
interest adopted into the number of
our own quarrels. This begets heats;
heats opprobries; opprobries revenge;
and revenge leads either to fret, if we
cannot satisfie its thirst; or to ruine,
if we cannot quench it. How many
likewise are in these rencounters,
tempted either to betray their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or malice? and if one know not
the new name of such a dish or dress,
such an intrigue, or such a quarrel or
marriage, then they are esteemed
block-heads. Most of men desire to
frequent their Superiors, and there men
must either suffer their raillery, or must
not be suffered to continue in their
society: If we converse with these
who speak with more address then our
selves, then we repine equally at our
own dulness, and envy the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that accomplishes the speaker;
or, if we converse with duller ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
then our selves, then we weary


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59999:38"/>
to draw the yoke alone, and fret
at our being in ill company: But, if
chance blow us in amongst our equals,
then we are so at guard to catch all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and so interressed in point
<hi>d' honneur,</hi> that it rather cruciats then
recreats us: How many makes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cheap by these occasions, whom
we had valued highly if they had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
us less? and how many fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
persons, who laugh at that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
which the addresser admires in
himself as wit, and yet both recreat
themselves with double laughters? It
is remarked by Geographers, that no
King alive is worship'd by his Subjects
but the King of <hi>Binon,</hi> and that he is
never seen by them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and certainly, if he
were seen, he would not be worship'd.
And thus these ancient Hero's were
never deifi'd, till death had, by bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves, buried the memory of
these infirmities, which, though they
were but few in some, and mean in
others, had notwithstanding enough
of allay in them to make the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59999:38"/>
not only be conceived no gods,
but oft-times to represent them as frail
men. <hi>Familiarity is</hi> (in the proverb)
<hi>said to breed contempt;</hi> which it does
not only by that natural saciety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
nothing can become common and
continue (to our apprehension) good,
but likewise, by laying open to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
these lapses and failours, which
if they deserve not contempt, do, at
least, lessen that repute which was in
others founded for them rather upon
<hi>Idea's</hi> which they framed of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
then upon these merits which
might justly challenge them. Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
hath likewise this prejudice in
it, that it blunts those endeavours in
us, whereby repute is ordinarily acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and in remitting that exactness
whereby we entertain strangers, we
loss that share of esteem which exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and politness deserves; these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
parad's, made ordinarily to
our less familiars, being a holy-dayes
dress in conversation, which though
it flatters, ceases not therefore to weary


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59999:39"/>
us. Our Saviour does himself, and of
himself, say it in holy Scriptures, that
<hi>a Prophet hath no honour iu his own
countrey;</hi> and the foolish Jews gave
him ground to say so, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that he could not work miracles,
because his mother and brethren dwelt
amongst them, and because they did
know him and his extraction.</p>
            <p>But if variety be that which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
in society, certainly our own
thoughts, or other mens Books, can in
these far exceed conversation; posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
above it this advantage, that we can
never be either importun'd or betray'd
by these, as is much to be fear'd from
the other. And it is most remarkable,
that after <hi>Solomon</hi> hath fixt a <hi>vanity
and vexation of spirit</hi> upon all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, and hath after several times
subjoyned it to publick Employment,
he only sayes, that <hi>reading is a weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the flesh,</hi> without adding it to
be <hi>a vexation of spirit.</hi> But albeit so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
were to be valued at the rate ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,

addressers consider only what is sit for
their private interest, and little else is
added, besides the dropping of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
expression or two: and when
any dis-interessed subject is fallen upon
with them, it is spoke to with so much
constraint, and the speakers are so
hem'd in by discretion and respect, that
the discourse is manag'd with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
And our very duty teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, that to speak learnedly, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry
there, and to speak religiously is
impertinent: So that we must either
transgresse our duty, or else be mean in
our conversation. But, albeit the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Grandee were so noble,
as to admit of freedom in conversation;
yet few ingenuous spirits (who are the
only best companions) can speak freely
in publick, or to publick persons: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
the most hide-bound Orator can pour
his conceptions into his neighbours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
in their natural set and fashion, and
with as little alteration as a discourse


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59999:40"/>
receives, by being cast off the Press
upon paper.</p>
            <p>Reflect but upon these many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
apologies which are carry'd up and
down amongst such as converse much
together; and which, as they make
up the greatest part both of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
and vexation; So are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to any who live solitarly, these
being the natural product of conference
and rencounters: And ye may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that either these who make
such apologies, are as real in making
them, as they seem passionat in having
them to be believed; and then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
may appear to be most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
seing these prove, that men
may easily mistake, and are so easily
mistaken by such as daily frequent
them, as yet to need so solemn and so
numerous apologies; or else these are
but feing'd, and then they prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
to be yet more dangerous; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as men are subject to mistake and be
mistaken, so our own real apologies


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59999:40"/>
for those mistakes will not be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
because of the frequency of other
counterfeits; nor can we, for the same
reason, discern whether such as are
made to us be real or not: what was
the subject of this dayes conference,
will be the subject of an accusation to
morrow; and that secret, which we
thought we did but lately depositate in
our friends breasts, will shortly fly in
our faces from the mouth of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
But though our friend were
real and secret, yet his inconstancy
may make these either no virtues at
all, or ineffectual and unprofitable
ones; a quality now so ordinary, that
I take pleasure to see both my self and
others mistake the several interests
which they knew intimatly a year ago,
cabals and intrigues moulding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
almost every month in different
shapes, according to the humours or
interests of the parties concern'd: And
so pestilential is the malignity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
that even Ladies fail here,
and this piece of frailty they are suffer'd


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59999:41"/>
to cary about them to keep them from
being ador'd,, because of their other
amiable qualities: For, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
were not dangerous, because that
any error is there a crime, and no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
can there be reveng'd, certainly
there should no place else be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Consider, I pray you, how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
are laught at, though never so
witty, if three or four combine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them as ridiculous; how a slip,
either in the choice or accent of a
word, becomes irreparable, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
in a society where nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
but censure; and when any proves
happy in that trade of jybing, they
must be gauding abroad (so tempting
is this folly) though sure to meet
in these journeys the repute of <hi>slight</hi>
or <hi>dishonest;</hi> and that Jearer, who at
the beginning was esteem'd a wit,
is, by continuing his trade (yea though
he improve in it) undervalued as a
Buffoon.</p>
            <p>It was nobly observed by <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi>
that great Emperour and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59999:41"/>
that a Weaver or Cobler,
would willingly sequestrat themselves
from all society, that they might prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their several trades; and yet man
cannot retire himself, that he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the creation, and exercise his own
soul, which is the great trade of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creature, and of a true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
And since gain can prevail with
all so far, as to make them renounce
society, and esteem company an idle
folly; certainly, if we would reflect
upon the great advantages of <hi>solitude,</hi>
both as to morality and devotion, it
were an easie matter to prefer it to
those which are in themselves but
trifles, if not burthens.</p>
            <p>I have these three Arguments to
perswade me,<note place="margin">Sect 8.</note> that <hi>solitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That solitude is more pleasing then publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
or a Countrey-life, have more
of pleasure in them then publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
The first is, that pleasure,
being in men, an act of the fancy, and
consequently of the soul; certainly
these pleasures, which do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
affect the soul, must needs be the


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59999:42"/>
most active pleasures; and such are
these which arise from contemplation:
whereas sensual pleasures, and such as
arise from exterior objects, do arrive
but consequentially at that immaterial
agent, and so they do move it with
far less vigour. A second is, that
Contemplation does often drive our
souls into extasies, and is so charming,
that it may be rather said to ravish
then please, committing so open a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon our souls, that it pulls them
almost into a state of separation: Thus
those old Hermits are the members of
the ancient Church, who are oftest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark't
to have become thus nobely
sensless, being as far transported out
of themselves, as they had transported
themselves formerly out of the world,
and lying whole weeks under that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
amazement, and drunk, as it
were, with those streams of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which slow from those blessed
Cisterns, the open wounds of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Saviour. And amongst the
Heathens, did not <hi>Pithagoras</hi> almost


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59999:42"/>
distract with the satisfaction conceiv'd
in finding that noble and famous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
mention'd in the second
Book of <hi>Euclide?</hi> Was not <hi>Pliny</hi> so
ravisht with the pleasure of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
the rarities of the hill <hi>Vesuvius,</hi>
as, for further enquiry to approach so
near, that he lost himself in its flames?
And was not <hi>Archimedes</hi> so much
pleas'd with his demonstration upon
the sands of <hi>Siracuse,</hi> that he would
not lose so much time from it as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he might beg his life from the rude
conquerours: Whereas, besides what
comes from fear or revenge, we read
nor hear of no such mighty passion in
any of these who live in the fruition
of publick Employments, or sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
satisfactions. The third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that we find the satisfaction
resulting from honour and ambition,
to ced to very mean pleasures, and to
such as have nothing of satisfying in
them, besides what they owe to the
corruption of our senses, and to be such
as do themselves yield easily to this


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59999:43"/>
energetick pleasure of contemplation.</p>
            <p>Is not a Gallant, and even a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who is in love with a Mistris, and
sometimes with a whore, or hath an
unquenchable thirst for wine or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panionrie,
willing to prefer the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of these passions to all advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the pleasures which he can
receive by them? And this evidences,
that this desire to govern, is, of it's
own nature, none of the strongest; at
least that our fancy may have other
objects less dangerous, and equally
pleasing, whereupon to dote. And a
Pedant, reading <hi>Pompey</hi>'s actions in
good Latine, is as much enchanted
with it, at least with the having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
handsomely his Epitaph, as <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
could have been himself in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of all his glories, and the most
spreading ruff of his pride. And a
Countrey Gentleman is as much taken
with a happy chase, or a Clown with
a mean hire, as the happiest Favourit
can be with the purchase of the highest
office, which the fear to lose, or new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59999:43"/>
and much anxious attendance,
doth lessen much to him: But if these
concessions of gain or honour occasion
raptures in the receivers, that joy brings
more tickling with it, then is fit for the
spirit of man to receive; and occasions
want of sleep, discomposure in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and all these other extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which proceed from grief at other
times: Whereas, <hi>Solitude</hi> gives no other
pleasures then what is fit for our recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or sutable to our reason and
stoicall indifferency; so that seing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
state hath pleasant objects provided
for the enjoyers fancy, that state must
be most preferable which fancies objects
the least dangerous; and such is <hi>Solitude,</hi>
but such is not publick Employment.</p>
            <p>I think the ancient Philosophers put
but a mean complement upon man,
when they call'd him <hi>a little world:</hi> for
certainly, his vast soul hath in it nobler
<hi>idea's</hi> of all that is created, then the
finitness of matter will allow to the
Creation it self; whose spirit is so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
but it can in one thought repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59999:44"/>
larger Sphears, a more vast Globe,
and more boundless Seas, then all these
which were brought from the bosom
of the first <hi>Chaos?</hi> And after infinit
expence hath impoverished a building
Prince, the meanest Peasant can in his
fancy add exceedingly to it's bulkish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and which is more, that faculty
can mould <hi>idea's</hi> of thousands of species
never yet created, that can bring forth
moe monsters then <hi>Africk,</hi> and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
moe novelties then <hi>America:</hi> and
as we cannot but admire these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
for their variety; So we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but love them, because they are our
own. And thus, seing there can be no
pleasure in that variety which is to be
decerned in the world, but what our
fancy takes, (for, what else is there in
beholding real Castles, Navies, Courts
or Cities, but a divertising of our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?
for nature needs none of those)
certainly, retirement hath in this the
start of it's rival: for there, fancy is at
fuller freedom, and roaves with less
contraction then when it is limited by


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59999:44"/>
the narrowness of the senses; through
which wickets, certainly nothing can
enter which is angust or ample. In
publick we see the same men most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
still act the same things; and we
our selves are so much busied with our
interest, that we regard little even the
small variety which is discoverable in
them. And certainly, it is a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
to the Creation to think,
that there is not variety enough there,
to busie our meditation; or that there
is less there then in a City or Court:
It is true that we'll see there variety of
Hangings, Cabinets, and such like toys;
but if we would view the various faces
of the sky but one day, we would
perceive more of variety in those, more
of excellent colours and various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then in ten thousand such
trifles as these. Consider but the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of one tulip, and it's several freckles;
the motion of one Bird, and it's several
wheelings; the shapes of several
worms, and their different crawlings;
and ye will find task enough, and more


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59999:45"/>
variety there, then a City can afford,
wherein they may represent you a
painted Rose, but not it's smell; the
shape of a Foule, but not it's motion:
And yet men there dot upon that one
quality of shape in pictures, more then
upon ten thousand reall species in the
<hi>complex</hi> of all their excellent qualities;
which if ye call fineness, I see no reason
why ye may not call madness virtue.
It is not then want of variety in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but want of observation in us,
which occasions this errour; and he
understood all things infinitly better
then we, who said, <hi>that</hi> Solomon <hi>in all
his glory was not like one Lily of the
field.</hi> It's reported of a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
that for fifty years he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
himself in the observation of
Bees, and all that time found both new
task and pleasure; and never any
could say that he had observed fully
all that was to be observed in floures,
Anatomy, Astrology, or any of these
Sciences, amongst which the least co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
in measuring lengths hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59999:45"/>
of our lives; and yet we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
that retirement (where these
are only to be found) hath not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or divertisement enough for us.</p>
            <p>But if these suffice not, my dear
<hi>Celador,</hi> enter into your own breast,
and there survey the several operations
of your own soul, the progress of your
passions, the struglings of your appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
the wandrings of your fancy;
and ye will find, I assure you, more
variety in that one piece, then there is
to be learned in all the Courts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</hi>
Represent to your self the
last age, all the actions and interests in
it, how much this person was infatuat
with zeal, that person with lust; how
much one pursued honour, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riches; and in the next thought,
draw that Scene, and represent them
all turn'd to dust and ashes.</p>
            <p>The world is a Comedy, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man acts that part which providence
hath assigned him; and as it is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more noble to look on then to act,
So really, I know no securer box, from


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59999:46"/>
which to behold it, then a safe <hi>solitude,</hi>
and it is easier to feel then to express
the pleasure which may be taken in
standing aloof, and in contemplating
the reelings of the multitude, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick
motions of great men, and how
fate recreats it self in their ruine, as if
it fed them with success, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
fed their Gladiators, who serv'd
for nothing else but in beating one
another, to recreat the disinteressed
beholders. Consider how some are
cartelling for not drinking of a glass,
others fretting at the promotion of
their equals; one vext that he was not
safely delivered of his prepared har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue;
another scanning every syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
of his frowning Mistris letter:<note place="margin">Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus. Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus. Sect. 9. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>enriches more then publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </note>
And even these humours again laugh't
at by some; and that laughter weept
at by others of these <hi>Virtuosi</hi>'s, who
pretend to a Dictatorship in moral
philosophy.</p>
            <p>Some admire publick Employment,
and prefer it to <hi>solitude,</hi> because the
one gains (whilst the other wastes) an


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59999:46"/>
opulent fortune: But these should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that as these Merchant-ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
would eminently deserve to be
esteemed mad, who would hazard their
Stock in a voyage, where certainly
ten of a thousand bottoms will not
return unshipwrack't; So pretenders
to advancement must be mad, seing
scarce ten of a thousand prove suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull
in the design, so few are
the preferments which can enrich,
and so many the hazards in reaching
them; and which is worse, of these
ten which are prefer'd, scarce four will
be found, who do not prove so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
long-liv'd, as not to survive their
conquests and honours; and having
got a glimpse only of happiness, <hi>En
passant,</hi> do become so much the more
miserable, that they have been once
happy. And as to these with whom
greatness is pleas'd to continue, do they
not oft-times, by raising themselves
as high as their fancy, raise themselves
too high for their estates, and the one
by swelling make the other to burst?
How few Grandees are not forc'd to


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59999:47"/>
eek up their spendings with contracted
debts after their own revenues are
wasted? whereas such as live privatly,
and in a Countrey-life, transmit to
their posterity the remainders of that
yearly rent which rests after all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
are defray'd: So that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man
must be rich, seing his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
overcome not his fortune; and
publick persons must be reputed poor,
seing they have not sufficiency for their
maintenance. Is not a little man as
well cloath'd in his four yards of cloath,
as a taler is in six? And are not the
Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> esteem'd but petty
Princes, because in desiring to be such,
they have made these fortunes which
might have made them rich Subjects,
too small for the support of so weighty
titles, as that of Soveraign? But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that these enjoyments continued
for the enjoyers life-time; yet GOD
ordinarily takes from the length of the
duration what these added to the
breadth of their conquests: As a too
hasty concoction destroyes the body;


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59999:47"/>
So a too soon conquest estate destroyes
the conquest: and what like <hi>Ionah</hi>'s
Gourd flourishes in one night, loses the
next these blossoms wherewith it was
adorn'd. <hi>Hasten not to be rich,</hi> was
the counsel of a great Moralist, as well
as Divine, and GOD Almighty gave
us no other task, then to <hi>gain our
bread,</hi> and that <hi>with the sweat of our
brow:</hi> So that in desiring great and
suddain estates, we are peccant both as
to the matter, and manner of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition:
And what can we propose
reasonably to our selves in thus doing?
for little can defend us against our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessities, and nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
against the future. And when
these riches are pyl'd up, they serve
either to satisfie nature, and that is
easie; or to satisfie fancy, and that is
impossible. When a publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath gain'd, by either toil, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
or a long courted favour, a
great sum, he possibly makes a great
entertainment, or buy's a great Jewel,
with that or the equivalent, and


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59999:48"/>
either surfets in the one, or vexes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in losing the other; and albeit he do
not, what pleasure is there in either of
these, but the serving of our fancy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner that children do,
when we laugh at them for hugging
toyes and bables? Most men are as much
troubled in the spending of what they
gain, as in gaining it; and thus one trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creates another by an alternat suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.
All we gain (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is
either for food or rayment (pomp and
supersluity being no design allow'd by
nature) and much or fine of either of
these, serve not to defend against either
cold or hunger: And so seing the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
or solitary Philosopher, attains
sooner to the true end of riches by his
sobriety, then the other by his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
certainly he must be the richer;
and that is most excellent which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
soonest to the end for which it was
destinat: If such want money to give
Lawers or Physicians, they also want
employment for these; and without
employment no man desires money:


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59999:48"/>
So that riches are really (though they
remain) but like the <hi>manna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 18</note> whereof
<hi>he who gathered little had abundance;
and he who gathered too much, had

not but <hi>take the wings of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and flee away,</hi> as oft they do, then
consider that publick Persons are most
subject to these alterations; for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiturs,
alterations of Government, or
favour, intestine wars, luxurie, gain,
popular fury, or an heir confiding
in his fathers prosperity, or educat
amidst many spending wanters, and
such other dissolute persons as frequent
publick places, will sooner drive to
that necessity, which men should only
fear, then moderation or retirement
can do: And when great men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish't
by these accidents, they are
asham'd, because of their former state,
and incapable by want of suitable
breeding to repair their losses, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their necessities by pains or frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as privat men can; and which is
worse then all this, their former pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59999:49"/>
makes want far more unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to such, then to the other, to
whom the greatest hardships have been
rendered familiar.</p>
            <p>As to such who think,<note place="margin">

Employment and Command will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them convenience to satisfie their
lust, I can say nothing, but that it's
better to live in a sober <hi>solitude,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men may so tame their lusts, that
they need not satisfie them: There is
no pleasure in eating but to such as are
hungry; and certainly, it were for our
advantage, rather that we could live
without being hungry, then even to
have as much as might satisfie hunger
when it comes: High feeding, and
want of better employment, begets
this; and what impairs these extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
it: Whereas, I am confident,
such as are servilly subject to it, suffer
more anxiety in the purchasing of that
conveniency, then private men can do
by the want of bread: For they will
for that purchase disobliege friends,
cheat their intimats, prove ungrate to


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59999:49"/>
their sweet bed-fellows, suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be talked of, and run a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other hazards, which they would
not encounter for staving off the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of these necessities under which mean
men suffer; and when this is gain'd,
what brings it, but sickness, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
horrours in conscience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
amongst men?</p>
            <p>When I compare <hi>solitude</hi> with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of both compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> as to their recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I find, that the one follows only
such as because nature hath invented,
it doth therefore sweeten, and such
as have no danger in them, besides
that of being too much charming;
as hunting, hawking, angling, and the
like, wherein we have occasion to
learn, as well as to praise, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of our mighty Maker: And
in the other, such divertisements are
most familiar, as if they have not been
invented to gain money, or seed lust, yet
are not really recreations, if they look
not towards these ends; and which
are attended by so much toil, fretting,


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59999:50"/>
sweating, swearing, lying, cheating, and
other vices, that their great pleasures
are the worst of torments except their
tragick periods; of which nature, are
cards, dice, tennis, danceing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
feasting and whooring, which do
oftner divert men from being real
Christians, then divertise those who
are really such. If great men enjoy
not recreations, they become unfit
for employment, and employment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a burden to them; and if they
sequestrat the meanest portion of time
for privat recreations, they are curst by
those thousands, whom multitude of
affairs, rather then laziness, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
and who are so unreasonable
as only to consider that they are put
off, but not to consider wherefore.</p>
            <p>Though food and rayment are no
constituents,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Both compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to their food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</note> yet they are too often
lookt upon as considerable appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
of our more material happiness;
and these used by great men, though
they cannot make the enjoyer happy,
yet serve to make the by-standers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59999:50"/>
themselves unhappy in the want
of them: And therefore I shall make
these few reflections upon both,
whereby it will appear, that as to these,
the meanest men are more happy then
the greatest Monarch.</p>
            <p>As to Raiment, certainly, that
used by private men, is most noble,
most easie, and attended by fewest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences:
Most noble, because
in these great men follow the mode,
but mean men make their own mode,
and so the one, as to that, is a Subject,
and the other a Soveraign: Great men
are servants not only to the fashion,
but to such cloaths as are in it, they
must abstain from every thing which
may soil or disorder them, and must
employ much of that time and life,
which is the only thing they pray for,
and which they buy with much torture
and money from Physicians, meerly in
adjusting them every morning, and
though it should prejudge their health
or estate, they must have these fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and rich. How many shifts will


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59999:51"/>
be used, and other pleasures abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that money may be got to give for
these; whereas a solitary person wears
such as are convenient for his health,
and may be subservient to any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and that his are more easie,
appears from this, that great men, when
they resolve to take their ease, lay
aside their robes, which serv'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but make themselves sweat,
and others gaze: Jewels and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderies
may make cloaths, by being
stiff, useless and insupportable, but
neither are necessary to cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
or entertain our natural heat.
And wen the fashion changes, these
rich sutes serve only either to make
the owner ridiculous, if he wear them,
or to make him fret and grumble when
he must lay them aside; and though
they continue fashionable, yet if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out-strip us in a more sumptuous
suit or retinue, then we repine, and
by missing our design of being more
gallant then others, we likewise miss
our happiness; which, because it was


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59999:51"/>
not plac'd upon something which
was in our own power, it is therefore
in the power of every other man to
take from us.</p>
            <p>As to Food, that which is us'd by
mean men is both more natural and
more pleasant; more natural, because
it is prepar'd with less toil, and being
cook'd by nature it self, serves nature
more adequatly, as to all intents and
purposes; it neither entices men to
eat till they be unable for their affairs,
nor brings it sickness; it affords
strength, and prolongs life; whereas,
when publick Employment brings
riches, and these have hir'd cooks, all
they can do, is to cheat the stomach
into an oppression, and by fumes sent
from thence, chase away fine thoughts
out of our heads to make room for
vapours. Solitary persons dine when
they please, but great men when it suits
with their business; and as they are
more subject to invitations, to feasts
and entertainments; So they must
there sit longer, and eat more then


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59999:52"/>
nature requires, and they must either
dis-obliege their Hoste, or kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
I know many, who in place
of complementing such as they invite,
make them envy them; and many
who are vext when they hear of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who lives at a nobler rate then
themselves, and who pillage the poor,
that they may entertain the rich; That
the Food of private men is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
arises from this, that the stomach
hath, by its fumes, depraved the
taste, so that nothing can rellish; or
custome hath render'd the finest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies
so ordinary, that nothing
can appear pleasant; a Peasant by fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
longer, or working more labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
then at other times, can thereby
heighten the rellish of his dish beyond
all the art in the Emperours kitchen, or
Apothecaries shop. And I have heard
of a Merchants wife, who being much
subject to diseases whil'st her husbands
trade flourish'd, did live very long,
and very healthfully, after he was
broke. And when rich persons fall


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59999:52"/>
sick, who knows but their Physician
may contribute to make the disease
continue long, or the apparent air to
make it end suddainly: And when the
Physician is honest, does he not forbid
the use of all these delicacies, whereof
greatness boasts of as an advantage?</p>
            <p>The greatest pretext used to excuse
this zeal,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 3. Object,</hi> That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey must be serv'd.</note> after publick Employment,
is, that the Countrey must be served,
and man is not made for himself: To
which my answer is, that this makes
employment the object of our duty,
not of our passion, and infers it as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
not as a choice, which is all
that is contended for: Who is so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
as to deny his Countrey that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which is really but the return of
it's protection? Or, who will be so
mad as not to contribute either skill
or agility in saving that Ship from
sinking, wherein himself sails? And
this makes me conclude such as rebell
against their Governors, to be as mad
as these are, who pull down their
own houses, which defends them oft


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59999:53"/>
against the circumambient and bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
storms; and gives me a veneration
for the persons of such as are my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
to whom nothing said here, that
is disadvantagious, should be applied.
But if the serving of our Countrey be
that impulse, which only acts us on to
undertake employments, this same
design should make us wait till we be
called for by our Countrey: do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to employment, in desiring
each to enter first, obstruct all entry
to employments? As we see, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
at publick places, where the
pressing of all hinders the entry of all;
do we not upon this account oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that offices are kept vacand by
Princes, because of the multitude of
rivals who compet for preference, and
so by their hast to enter, prejudge the
Countrey more, then by their entry
they can assist it: Whereas, if it were
for the publick good that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
these employments, all would
wait till their rational reluctancy were
vanquisht, with either the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59999:53"/>
of their Prince, or conveniency
of their Countrey: And when that
design for which they were called, were
satisfi'd or driven to it's design'd pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
they would willingly solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
again, by their retreat to these
Countrey-employments, from which
they were at first rather driven, then
brought. And certainly, if the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
interest were that which only did
invite men to appear in publick, they
would not repine at their being laid
aside, nor force an entry through the
very sides of their Countrey, making
a breach in its ramparts, because they
cannot enter at it's gates, as too
many pretenders daily do.</p>
            <p>Should not such as the State have
thought fit to remove from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14 It is just that there should be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in favour.</note>
consider, that others have
an equal title by nature, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
with them; and that,
as if their predecessors in these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had not been remov'd, they had
not been advanc'd? So either it was
injustice to remove these, or else i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>


               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59999:54"/>
is no injustice to remove them; and
they should rather prove grateful for
having enjoy'd these honours so long,
then ingrate in repining, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
them not still, which were as
unnatural as if the Sun should constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dwell in one of his twelve houses
(making that the only Summer-house
in heaven) and should not, by successive
withdrawings and returns, magnifie his
presence by his absence, and by that
constant change be so just, as not to
gratifie all, that he may please a few.
If these, who are in offices, were not
subject to alterations, they would
presume too much, and such as wanted
them would certainly dispair; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
now the fear of being degraded,
makes such as are in employment vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and compassionat, fearing least
their practice become their dittey;
and the hope of advancement makes
such as yet have not attain'd to it, walk
so as may deserve applause, and so as
they may shun reproach: If such alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
were not incident to great men,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59999:54"/>
they would oft want occasion and time
to repent of those sins which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in publick, either by inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
having their thoughts distracted
with many things; or by extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
having their thoughts rais'd above
their just level. And if there were
not such alterations, great men should
neither have time to admire GODS
many wonders, nor to review his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mercies, and it should be unknown
whether Greatness or <hi>solitude</hi> were the
most Christian state.</p>
            <p>Many noble spirits have been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>solitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 15 Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> lessens not our vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> as conceiving it to be
a state wherein the soul contracts a
rust, which cankers it's own substance
and makes it unpleasant to others, and
that it begets men the name of a
Countrey-clown, and unfashions him as
to the world. But these should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that seing the finitness of our
souls allows not a compleat accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is our wisdom to fill our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
rooms with the most necessar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and these are, <hi>the knowledge of


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59999:55"/>
God, and his works;</hi> from which will
result that tranquility of spirit which
is peculiar to Philosophy, and is the
guest of <hi>solitude:</hi> So that when in
exchange of complement, courtship,
knacks, reparties, and such other
appanages of conversation, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
pious, learned and moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers;
I think us losers in no other
sense, then a tree is, when it's gaudy
flourish ripens into such fruit as can
both please the rellish, and feed the
body. It may be, a Philosopher may
forget by his solitude whether to give
a Lady his right or left hand; but if
in his solitude he hath learn'd to know
what is right or wrong in her or his own
actions, I think she should esteem him
so much the more, and he is by much
the more happier. And if the world
conclude him improven, who in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to order an Army, hath forgot
how to order a ball; I see not why they
should account him an Apostate in
breeding, who is so intent upon the
contemplation of a Deity and it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59999:55"/>
as not to care to adore these
mortal goddesses, except for whom the
pressers of this objection have little or
no devotion, being rather devoted ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to these, then devout servants to
the Almighty: and how can that soul
rust which is in continual exercise, as
these of Philosophers are? And this is
more to be feared in such, as by living in
publick are still busied, and yet idle:
for, may not we be busie in soliciting for
unnecessary favours to others, in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and paying visits, in driving on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
factions, and yet our souls
contract a rust, whose cancker may
make it at last moulder away to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
For, what share can our souls
take in such actions, wherein it hath no
other concernment then such as a man
hath in the motions of his enemies?</p>
            <p>Let us then admire <hi>solitude</hi> (noble
<hi>Celador</hi>) seing to it religious persons
flee when they would seek GODS face;
sick men when they would seek

            <p>Having thus rais'd this pitifull
structure to i'ts Cape-stone, I resolve
to furnish it with these two Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips;
the one of <hi>solitude,</hi> the other of

I must confess that it's advantages are
so great, as that if any thing can surpass
them, it must be the esteem I have of
them. And for contriving it's Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip,
I represent to my self <hi>Quintus
Maetius post humius,</hi> that noble Roman,
who having been brought from his
plough to govern that great City, did
after he had conquer'd it's enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his former employment; and
being ready to leave them, call'd for a
ballance, and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by putting the <hi>falces</hi> (or
marks of Authority) in one scale,
and his plough in the other, did let


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59999:56"/>
them see, that these Imperial Ensigns
were the far lighter. Not far from
him, I represent <hi>Timon</hi> the noble Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
and <hi>Gerson</hi> Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi>
who starv'd after they had spent
their estates in complement and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality;
exclaiming against all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
persons as perfidious, and friends
(as they found) to a mans fortune, but
not to himself. Here <hi>Diogenes</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values
so far all <hi>Alexanders</hi> presents, as
to prefer one sight of the Sun to all
that he could command, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all that the Sun shin'd upon:
and there <hi>Fiacre,</hi> that illustrious Scot,
refuses to return from his Hermitage
to receive the Crown of his Ancestors.
Here lurks St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> laughing in the
midst of his own torments at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the world: and there the great
<hi>Constantine</hi> bewails with tears the
want of <hi>solitude;</hi> and the multitude
of these distractions, which though
they did not extinguish, yet did disturb
his devotions. Below these stands a
Countrey-gentleman, admiring the


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59999:57"/>
folly of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassador, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a chair; and smiling to see a <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Embassador, who could not step
(though very sound) till he was led by
two attendants; and to hear of the
Emperour and Turks Embassadours,
who at their last meeting, behov'd
like two Pendula's Clocks, either
to set their paces equally, or else not
to be reputed just. Represent to
your self rich Valleys, where the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
soyl needs neither be bryb'd by
yearly accessions, nor courted with nice
attendance, nor torn by instruments
(as in City-gardens) before it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
any thing upon it's Masters; but
without keeping close doors (as these
do) keeps an open house to all passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for herbs and floures of all tastes
and liveries. Here the Nightingale
is constrain'd to stay without any other
cage, then that of the native pleasures
of the place; and here the Sun looks
from morning to night with a pleasing


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59999:57"/>
countenance, upon the off-spring of
his own beams, neither clouded with
smoak, nor intercepted by angles of
falling houses; and these, in effect, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from Gardens, but as Prose from
Meeter, where the materials are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
richer, though the contrivance
be not so artificial. Here the levelling,
though aspiring, trees, lay their heads
together, to protect such as seek shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under their well-cloath'd branches:
and the Cristal-streams run slowly and
turn many windings, as if by that and
their quiet murmurings, they would
express an unwillingness to leave so
pleasant a field; and in token of their
thankfulness, do in a generous manner
(because without shewing how) enrich
freely the neighbouring Lands, and
draws to their Master his picture in one
instant, without putting him to the
pains of frequent or long sitting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the skill of <hi>Vandyck</hi> or <hi>Angelo;</hi>
entertaining likewise for him whole
plantations of fishes, which may afford
him both aliment and recreations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

all that the City can boast, where
water never comes, but empty, and as a
prisoner, and like all other things and
persons corrupts, if it but stay a while
there. Here old age crowns, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence's
livery, these who have inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
improven their youth; and
youth bestows strength, because it
knows that the strength it bestows is
not to be revel'd away in whooring and
banqueting. Here Ladies scorn, and
need not submit their native colours to
fairding, and in their blushing at the
sins and impudence of City-gallants,
shew a scarlet far exceeding the noblest
Lillies, though <hi>Solomon</hi> and all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Court was not to be compar'd
to one of these. Here Complements
(which, like cob-webs, are but the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
texture of pitifull stuff, woven
by poisonous spiders) are look'd upon
as unnecessar and dangerous; unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
because there goes much of time
and pains to their contrivance, yet do
they not perswade such as they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
to, to believe them so well as

Countrey-ingenuity does it's inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
and dangerous, because they are
ordinarily but handsom disguises for
such cheating inclinations as are sent

Here Lovers are not like prisoners,

nor joyn'd, like Princes, in a league
for civil interest. Jealousie, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

governs as Queen-regent, and receives

he the other) and all this to gain as
much as might make him a person wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of being poyson'd; and esteeming
all his greatness so meanly, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to it's enjoyment the embraces
of a whore, who would have prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
her self to the meanest of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders.
Here lies <hi>Tiberius</hi> toiling more
for the title of Emperour, then a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would do for bread, and yet prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all that Roman pomp (after he
knew what it was) the pleasure of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a naked Strumpet, then which no
man is so mean, as not to enjoy many
greater pleasures. There stands <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
as a <hi>Switz,</hi> guarding the King of
<hi>Bithinia;</hi> here Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> starts
at liberty, and there the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi>


               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59999:59"/>
starv'd in prison; in this bed lyes a
jealous Courtier, tortured with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
growing, not only greater, but
even equal with him; and in another
lyes one loaded with wounds, received
for his Countrey or Prince, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
by them: not far from these lyes
<hi>Anthony</hi> stobbing himself, and <hi>Cesar</hi>
stob'd by the Senate. In another cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ye may perceive a rich heir selling
that rich Suit to a frippery, wherein he
had but lately spent a great Fortune at
Court; and another despairing under
these wounds which he did receive, for
challenging one who took the wall of
him. Here ye may see the head of a
Nobleman, who to be reveng'd of his
Prince for complementing another, was
content to hazard the happiness both
of Prince and Countrey, in a rebellion
which at last could not but ruine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his family; and there ye may
see the quarters of another, who after
he had gain'd much more honour then
he at first design'd, yet was so desirous
to have more, as that to satisfie that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59999:60"/>
super-addition, he would hazard
what he was already possessed of in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardies,
which any man not blinded by
ambition, might have seen to be fatal.
In a third corner, lyes heaps of such as
<hi>Somerset,</hi> Marquess <hi>D' Ancre,</hi> Duke
<hi>Murdock,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> and others,
whom nothing but their affronts have
made famous, albeit they were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Ministers and Minions of their age.</p>
            <p>In a fourth corner are represented
many great men, who having left a
pleasant Country to come to a City,
covered with smoak and infected with
stink, are there vext to get money to
entertain their Ladies in that luxury
and fineness, whereof the one tempts
them, and the other tempts others to
entertain these amours which are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and may prove fatal; and who
have likewise quit their own families,
wherein all these respects were pay'd
them, that they are glad to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to pay at that Court, for which
they exchang'd their former residence;
and who, by the diseases occasion'd by


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59999:60"/>
want of that free air which they have
left, are rendred unable to rellish all the
other pleasures which they expected
to enjoy in the City. And if after all
this, ye will not conclude a solitary Life
to be more noble then publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
yet at least ye will, with
seraphick Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> confess, that there
is such a kind of difference betwixt
virtue shaded by a private, and shining
in a publick life, as there is betwixt a
a candle carryed aloft in the open air,
and inclosed in a lantern; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which situations it gives more
light, but in the latter it is in less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be blown out.</p>
            <p>I shall (<hi>Celador</hi>) in this last place,
close this Discourse with the last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>solitude;</hi> which is, that by
abstracting 'its favourits from being
rivals to great men, and from being
sharers with covetous men, it conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liats
to them that applause, which as it
was due to their merit, so was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by these and the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives.</p>
