            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which fals and cruell sentence, and from

I make it knowen to your honours, that I
appeal to a laufull and generall counsil,
to suche I mean, as the most auncient lawes
and canones do approue to be holden, by
suche as whose manifest impietie is not to
be reformed in the same:<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Iohn Knoxe.</note> most humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of your honours, that, as God hath
appointed you princes in that people, and
by reason therof requireth of your handes
the defence of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes troubled in your
dominion, in the meane tyme, and till
the controuersies, that this day be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
be laufully decided, ye receaue
me and suche others, as most vniustlie by
those cruell beastes are persecuted, in your
defence and protection.</p>
            <p>Your honours are not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it is
not I alone, who doth sustain this cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t generation of Papistes,
but that the most part of Germanie,<note place="margin">The peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testantes.</note> the

with many other Cities and Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fromed,
appeall from the tyrannie of that
Antichrist, and most earnestly do call for a
laufull and general cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sil, wherin may all
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies in religion be decided by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7080:4"/>
auctoritie of Goddes most sacred worde.
And vnto this same, as said is, do I appeal
yet once againe, requiri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of your honours
to hold my simple and playn appellation
of no lesse value nor effect, then if it had
bene made with greater circunsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, solem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie,
and ceremonie, and that ye receaue
me calinge vnto you, as to the powers of

against the rage of tyrantes, not to
mentaine me in any iniquitie, errour, or

as God by his worde, auncient lawes,
and determinations of most Godlie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils,
graunte to men accused or infamed.</p>
            <p>The word of God will that no man
shall die except he be found criminall and
worthie of death for offence committed,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note>
of the whiche he must be manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
by two or three witnesses. Ancient
lawes do permitt iust defences to such as
be accused (be their crimes neuer so horri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble)
and godlie counsilles will that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Byshopp nor Person ecclesiasticall
whatsoeuer accused of any crime shall sit
in iudgement, consultation, or counsil,
where the cause of such men, as do accuse
them,<note place="margin">The peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Iohn Knoxe.</note> is to be tried.</p>
            <p>These thinges require I of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to be graunted vnto me: to wit,
That the doctrine which our aduersaries
<pb facs="tcp:7080:5"/>
condemn for haeresie may be tried by the
simple and playn word of God, that iust
defenses be admitted to vs that sustain the
battaile against this pestilent generation
of Antichrist, and that they be remoued
from iudgement in our cause, seinge that
our accusation is not intended against any
one particular perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but against that hole
kingdome whiche we doubt not to proue
to be a power vsurped against God,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> against
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and against the orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance
of Christ Iesus established in his
Church by his chefe Apostles: Yea we
doubt not to proue the kingdome of the
Pope to be the king dome and power of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist.
And therefore my Lordes I can
not cease in the name of Christ Iesus to
require of you that the matter may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me
in examination, and that ye the estates of
the realme by your auctoritie compell
such as will be called bishoppes, not only
to desist from their cruell murthering of
such as do studie to promote goddes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in detecting and disclosing the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
impietie of that man of syn the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Antechrist, but also that ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell
them to answer to suche crimes as shall be
laid to their charge for not righteously
instructing the flock committed to their

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answer</note> But here I know two thinges shalbe

doubted. The former:<note place="margin">1. to obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> whether that my

seing that I am damned as an heritike:
and secondarely whether your honours
be bound to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such as call for your sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>port
in that case,<note place="margin">2</note> seing that your bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
(who in matters of religion claime all
auctoritie to appertaine to them) haue by
their sentence allredy condemned me.</p>
            <p>The one and the other I nothing doubt
most clerely to proue. Fyrst that my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
is most Lawfull and iust: and
secondarely that your honours can not
refuse to defend me thus calling for your
aid,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> but that in so doing ye declare your
selues rebellious to God, mentainers of
murtherers and shedders of innocent
blood.</p>
            <p>How iust cause I haue by the ciuile law
(as for their canon it is accursed of God)<note place="margin">The appel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation is iust and lawfull.</note>
to appeale from their vniust sentence my
purpose is not to make long discourse.
Onlie I will touche the poyntes which all
men confesse to be iust causes of appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Fyrst laufully could I not be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by them being for that tyme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from their iurisdiction, charged with
the preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Christes Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gill in a free
citie not subiect to their tyrannie.</p>
            <p>Secondarely to me was no intimation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of their sommondes, but so secrete was
<pb facs="tcp:7080:6"/>
their surmised malice that the copie of the
sommondes being required was denyed.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie to the realme of Scotland
could I haue had no free nor sure accesse
being before exiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same by their

            <p>For this sermon was Ieremie appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
and a sentence of death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against hym and that by the pree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes,

            <p>Then the princes and the people (saieth

proueth whatsoeuer before I haue affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med.
To wit, that it is Laufull for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes

you haue hard à sentence of death prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unced

oght to speak no decept, because they are

of whom I am one rebuking theire ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
apostasie and defection from God
which is the onlie cause they seke my life.
But a thing most contrarie to all equitie,
law a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iustice it is, that I a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sent of God
to call them, this people, and you againe
to the true seruice of God, from the which
you are all declined, shall suffer the death
because that my ennemies do so pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

God hath made princes, your power is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
their tyrannie, before you do I expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7080:8"/>
my cause I am in your handes aud can

lest that my lenitie and patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce should ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
make you negligent in the defence of
me in my iust cause appeali<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to your iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
either yet encorrage my ennemies

make not only my ennemies gyltie of my

By these wordes I say, it is euident, that
the prophete of God bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to death
by the preestes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the prophetes of the

threatnyng his blood to be requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
of theyre handes, if they by theyre au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorite
did not defend hym from the furie
of his ennemies: alledging also iust cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his appellation, and why he oght
to haue bene defended: to wit, that he was
sent of God to rebuke theire vices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from God:<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and why he oght to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue bene defended.</note> that he taught no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which God before had not pronoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced
in his Law: that he desired theyre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
to God, continuallie calling vpon
them to walk in the wayes which God had
approued and therefore doth he boldlie
craue of the princes, as of Goddes lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
to be defended from the blynd rage &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7080:9"/>
tyrannie of the preests, notwithstanding
that they claimed to themselues auctoritie
to iudge in all matters of religion. And
the same did he what tyme he was cast in
pryson and thereafter was brought to the
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of king Zedechias, after I say that
he had defended his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, affirmyng
that he neither had offended against the
king, against his seruantes nor against the
people, at last he made intercession to the
king for his life, saying,</p>
            <p>But now my lord the king take
hede,<note place="margin">Ierem. 38.</note> I beseche thee let my prayer
fall in to thy presence commaund
me not to be caried againe in to
the house of Ionathan the scribe,
that I dye not there.</p>
            <p>And the text witnesseth that the king
commaunded the place of his impryson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be chaunged. Whereof it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the prophet did ofter then once
seke help at the ciuile power and that fyrst
the princes, and thereafter the king did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cknowledge,
that it appertained to their
office to deliuer him from the iniust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which was pronounced against him.
yf any thinke that Ieremie did not appeall
becaus he onely declared the wronge
done vnto him, and did but craue defence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7080:9"/>
according to his innocencie let the same
man vnderstand, that none otherwise do I
appeale from that fals and cruell sentence,<note place="margin">Iust cause of appella<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note>
which your Byshoppes haue pronounced
against me. Neither yet can there be any
other iust cause of appellation but inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie
hurt, or suspected to be hurt, whether
it be by ignorance of a iudge, or by mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and corruption of those, who vnder the

a thefe, murtherer, blasphemer, open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,
or any offender whome Gods

committed, my appellation were vaine
and to be reiected: but I being innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea
the doctrine which your Byshoppes haue
condemned in me, being Gods eternall
veritie, haue no lesse libertie to craue your
defence against that crueltie, then had the
Prophet Ieremie to seke the ayde of the
Princes and King of Iuda. But this shall
more plainly appear in the facte of sainct
Paule, who after that he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Act. 22. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; 25.</note> did fyrst claime to the
libertie of Romayne citeze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for auoiding
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what tyme that the captayn would
haue examined hym by questions: there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile, where no rightious iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
was to be hoped for, he affirmed
that he was a Pharisie, and that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of the resurrection of the dead, and
<pb facs="tcp:7080:10"/>
last in the presence of Festus he appealed
from all knowledge and iudgement of the
Preestes at Ierusalem to the Emperour: of
which last point, because it doth chefelie
appertaine to this my cause, I will som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
speak.</p>
            <p>After that Paule had diuerse tymes
bene accused, as in the Actes of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
is manifest, at the last the chefe Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
and theyre faction came to Cesarea
with Festus the preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who presented to
them Paule in iudgement, whome they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of horrible crimes: which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
they could not proue, the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
that he had not offended neither
agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nst the Law, neither against the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
neither yet against the Emperour.</p>
            <p>But Festus willing to gratifie the
Iewes,<note place="margin">Act. 25.</note> said to Paule: Wilt thou
go vp to Ierusalem, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there be iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
of these thinges in my presen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce?
But Paule said: I stand at the iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stice
seat of the Emperour, where
it behoueth me to be iudged, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
done no iniurie to the Iewes as
thou better knowest. Yf I haue do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
any thing iniustly, or yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
crime worthie of death, I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7080:10"/>
refuse not to die. But if there be
nothing of these thinges true, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
of they accuse me, no man may
geue me to them: I appeall to
Cesar.</p>
            <p>It may appear at the first sight that Paule
did great iniurie to Festus the iudge, and
to the hole order of the preesthode, who
did hope greater equitie in a cruell tyrant
then in all that session and learned compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie.
Which thinge no dout Festus did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
pronouncing these wordes: Hast
thou appealed to Cesar? thou shalt go to
Cesar. As he would say, I as a man willing
to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the truth before I ꝓnou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence,
haue required of thee to go to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
where the learned of thyne owne na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
may heare thy cause and decerne in
the same. The controuersie standith in
matters of religion. Thou art accused as
an apostatat from the Law, as a violator
of the temple, and transgressor of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of theyre fathers: in which matters
I am ignorant, and therefore desire infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by those, that be learned in the
same religion, wherof the question is.
And yet doest thou refuse so many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fathers to hear thy cause, and doestappe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ale to the Emperour: preferring hym to all
<pb facs="tcp:7080:11"/>
our iudgements, of no purpose belike, but
to delay tyme. Thus I say it myght haue
appeared that Paule did not only iniurie
to the iudge and to the Preestes, but also
that his cause was greatly to be suspected:
partly for that he did refuse the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those that had moste knowledge
(as all men supposed) of Gods will and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion:
and partly because he appealed to
the Emperour, who then was at Rome farr
absent from Ierusalem, a man also ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of God and ennemie to all vertue. But the
Apostle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering the nature of his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and what thinges they had intended
against hym, euen from the fyrst day that
he began freelie to speak in the name of
Christ,<note place="margin">why Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le wold ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mytt none of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in his cause.</note> did not fear to appeale from them,
and from the iudge that would haue gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
them. They had professed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues
plain ennemies to Christ Iesus and to his
blessed Euangill, and had soght the death
of Paule, yea euen by factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and treasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracie: and therefore by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
would he admit them either iudges in
his cause, either auditours of the same as
Festus required:<note place="margin">Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what reasons the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Paule was grounded.</note> but grounding him selfe
vpon strong reasons, to wit, that he had
not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Iewes, neither yet the Law,
but that he was innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and therefore that
no iudge oght to geue hym in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of
his ennemies: grounding I say his appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7080:11"/>
vpon these reasons, he neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the displeasure of Festus, neither
yet the brute of the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t multitude, but
boldely did appeal from all cognition of
them to the iudgement of the Emperour,
as said is. By these two examples I dout
not but your honours do vnderstand, that
lawfull it is to the seruantes of God op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie to seke remedie against
the same, be it by appellation from theire
sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or by imploring the helpe of ciui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
Magistrates. For what God hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in Ieremie and Paul, he can condemne
in none that likewise be e<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>reated. I might
alledge some histories of the primatiue
Church seruing to the same purpose: as of
Ambrose and Athanasius, of whom the one
would not be iudged but at Millan, where
that is doctrine was hard of all his Church
and receaued and approu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by many: and
the other would in no wise geue place to

against the trueth of God should
sit in iudgement and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sultatione. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Scriptures of God are my only

two former testimonies sufficient, aswell
to proue my appellation reasonable and

with safe conscience ye can not refuse to

admit the same. Yf any thinke it arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie
or foolishnes in me to compare my selfe

they espie in me. But touching the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and cause which that adulterous a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
pestilent generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrists serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

nor shame to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse and auow before man

aeternall God. And in that case I dout not
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare my selfe with any menbre in w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>home
the trueth hath bene impugned se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
the begynnyng. For as it was the trueth w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
Ieremie did preach in these wordes,</p>
            <p>The Preestes haue not knowen
me (saieth the Lord) but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
haue traiterously declined
and fallen back from me.<note place="margin">Ierem. 2.</note> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes
haue prophesied in Baal,<note place="margin">Ierem. 1.</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7080:12"/>
and haue gone after those things,
which can not helpe. My people
haue left the fontaine of liuing
waters, and haue digged to them
selues pits, which can containe
no water:</p>
            <p>As it was a trueth that the pastors and

do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me dogs blynd, ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">Esa. 56.</note> proud
and auaricious And finally as it was a

were murtherers of Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Act. 3. &amp; 4.</note> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cruell
persecutors of his Apostles: so likewyse it
is a trueth (and that moste infallible)
that those that haue condemned me (the
hole rable of the papisticall clergie) haue
declyned from the true faith,<note place="margin">Tim. 4.</note> haue geuen

Iesus, deniers of his vertue, and horrible
blasphemours of his death and passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
further as that visible Churche had no cri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me,
where of iustly they could accuse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prophetes, either the Apostles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
theyr doctrine only: so haue not such

<pb facs="tcp:7080:13"/>
to proue,<note place="margin">Let the cause be noted.</note> that the religion, which now
is maintained by fier and sword, is no lesse
contrarious to the true religion taught
and established by the Apostles, then is
darknes to light, or the Deuill to God: and
also that such as now do claime the title
and name of the Churche ar no more the
elect spouse of Christ Iesus, then was the
Synagoge of the Iewes the true Church
of God what tyme it crucified Christ Iesꝰ,
damned his doctrine and persecuted his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
And therefore seing that my bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
is against the proude and cruell hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
of this age, as that battaill of
those most excellent instrumentes was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the fals Prophetes and malignant
Church of theyr ages: neither ought any
man think it strange that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare my self
with them, with whome I sustaine a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
cause, neither ought you my Lordes iudge
your selues lesse addetted and bound to

            <p>My purpose is not greatly to labour to

will I studie to alledge all reasons that
iustly may be broght to proue that ye are

you in his chaire, hath appointed you
to be his lieutenantes, and by his owne

and to rule aboue your brethren, to whom
nature neuertheles hath made you lyke in
all points (for in conception, birth, life,
and death ye differ nothing from the
commune sort of men, but God only, as
said is, hath promoted you, and of his
especial fauour hath geuen vnto you
this prerogatiue to be called Gods:)
how horrible ingratitude were it then,
that you should be founde vnfaithful to
hym, that thus hath honored you? And
further what a monster were it that you
should be proued vnmerciful to them,
aboue whome ye are appointed to reigne
as fathers aboue theyre children? because
I say that verie Ethnicks haue graunted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7080:15"/>
that the cheefe and fyrst care of Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

lest that in so doing I should seme to
make you lesse careful ouer Gods true

may appere more hard and difficile
to be graunted, I purpose brefely,<note place="margin">The due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrats.</note> but yet
freely, to speak what God by his worde
doth assure me to be true. To wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fyrst
that in conscience you are bounde to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysh
malefactors, and to defende inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
imploringe your helpe: seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
that God requireth of you to prouide
that your subiects be rightly instructed in
his true religion, and that the same by you
be reformed whensoeuer abuses do crepe
in by malice of Satan and negligence of
men: and laste that ye are bounde to remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
from honour, and to punish with death
(if the crime so require) such as deceaue
the people, or defraude them of that foode
<pb facs="tcp:7080:16"/>
of theyre soules, I meane Gods liuely
worde. The fyrst and seconde are moste
playne by the wordes of S. Paule thus
speaking of lawfull powers.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let euerie soule (saieth he) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
hym selfe vnto the hygher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.
for there is no power but of
god. The powers that be, are ordai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
of God. Whosoeuer therefore
resisteth power, resisteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, and they that resist
shall receaue to them selues damna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.
For rulers ar not to be feared
of those that do well, but of those
that do euill. Wilt thou then be
without fear of the power? do that
which is good, and so shalt thou
be praised of the same. For he is
the minister of God for thy welth.
But if thou do that which is euil,
fear. For he beareth not the swor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
for noght: for he is the minister
of God to take vengance on them
that do euil.</p>
            <p>As the Apostle in these wordes moste
straytly commaundeth obedience to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7080:16"/>
geuen to lawfull powers, pronouncing
Gods wrathe and vengance against such
as shall resist the ordonaunce of God, so
dothe he assigne to the powers theyre offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
which to be take vengance vpon euil
doers, to maintaine the well doers, and so
to ministre and rule in theyre office, that
the subiectes by them may haue a benefite
and be praised in well doing. Now if you
be powers ordeined by God (and that I
hope all men will graunte) then by the
plaine wordes of the Apostle is the sworde
geuen vnto you by God for maintenance
of the innocent, and for punyshement of
malefactors. But I and my brethren with
me accused, do offre not only to proue our
selues innocents in all thinges laid to our
charge, but also we offre most euidently to
proue your Byshoppes to be the verie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,
who haue infected all christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And therefore by the plaine doctrine
of the Apostle you ar bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to maintaine
vs, and to punysh the other being euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict and proued criminall.<note place="margin">In what pointes be Powers bounde to theyre sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iestes.</note> Moreouer
the former words of the Apostle do teach,
how far hie powers be bounde to theyre
subiectes: to wit, that because they are
Gods ministers by hym ordained for the
profitt and vtilitie of others, moste dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
oght they to inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the same.
For that cause assigneth the holie Ghost
<pb facs="tcp:7080:17"/>
commaunding subiectes to obey, and to
pay tribute: saing,</p>
            <p>For this do you pay tribute and
tole.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That is because they are Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
bearing the sworde for your vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Wherof it is plaine, that there is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
without a charge annexed. And this
one point I wishe your wisdomes dipely
to consider: that God hath not placed
you aboue your brethren to reigne as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes
without respect of theyre profitt
and commoditie. You heare the holie
Ghost witnesse the contrarie, affirmyng
that all lawfull powers be Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
ordened for the welth, profitt and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of their subiectes, and not for theyre
destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Could it be said (I besech you)
that Magistrates,<note place="margin">Let the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude be noted.</note> inclosing theyre subiects
in a citie without all victuales, or geuing
vnto them no other victuales but such as
were poisoned, did rule for the profitt of
theyr subiet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es? I trust that none would
be so foolishe as so to affirme: but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euerie discrete person would bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirme, that such as so did, were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes
vnworthie of all regiment. Yf we
will not deny that, whiche Christ Iesus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
to be a trueth infallible, to wit,
That the soule is greater and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7080:17"/>
then is the bodie: then shall we ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
espye how vnworthie of auctoritie be
those, that this day debarre theyre sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
from the hearing of Gods worde,
and by fier and sworde compell them to
feede vpon the verie poison of theyre sou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les,
the damnable doctrine of Antichrist.
And therefore in this poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I say, I can not
cease to admonish your honours dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to take heede ouer your charge,
which is greater then the most parte of
men suppose. It is not ynough that you
abstaine from viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te wrong, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

by negligence not prouiding true

syncerely preached. It wil not excuse you
in his presence, who will require accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pte
of euerie talent committed to your
charge, to say that ye supposed that the
charge of the soules had bene committed
to your Byshoppes. No no, my Lordes,
so ye can not escape Gods iudgement. For
if your Byshoppes be proued to be no
Byshoppes, but deceauable theues and

            <p>When God did establish his Law,<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion appertaine to the care of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile power Exod. 21. 24. 25, &amp;c.</note> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and ceremonies in the middest of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
he did not exempt the matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
from the power of Moses, but as he
gaue hym charge ouer the ciuile politie,
so he put in his mouth and in his hand:
That is, he fyrst reuealed to hym, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter
commaunded to put in practise w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatsoeuer
was to be taught or done in mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nothing did God reueale
particularely to Aaron, but altogither
was he commaunded to depend from the
mouth of Moses: Yea nothing was he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to do to hym self or to his children
either in his or theyr inauguration and
sanctification to the preesthode,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but all
was committed to the care of Moses, and
therefore were these wordes so freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
repeted to Moses,</p>
            <p>Thou shalt seperate Aaron and
his sonnes from the middest of the
people of Israel,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.</note> that they may
<pb facs="tcp:7080:20"/>
execute the office of the Preestho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
thou shalt make vnto them gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments,
thou shalt annoynte them,
thou shalt wash the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou shalt fill
theyr handes with the sacrifice.</p>
            <p>And so furth of euerie rite and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie,
that was to be done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, especiall
commaundement was geuen vnto Moses,
that he should do it. Now if Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his
sonnes were so subiect to Moses, that they
did nothing but at his commaundement,
who dar be so bold as to affirme that the
ciuile Magistrate hath nothing to do in
matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For seing that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
did so straytly require, that euen those,
who did beare the figure of Christ, should
receaue from the ciuile power as it were
theyre sanctification, and entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to theyr
office, and seing also that Moses was so
far preferred to Aaron, that the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
and the other did obey, who dar
esteme that the ciuile power is now beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so prophane in Gods eyes, that it is
sequestred from all intromission with the
matters of religion. The holie ghost in
diuers places declarethe the contrarie.</p>
            <p>For one of the chefe praecepts commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the king, when that he should be
placed in his throne, was to write the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7080:20"/>
of the boke of the Lordes law, that
it should be with hym, that he might
read in it all the daies of his life, that he
might learn to fear the Lord his God, and
to kepe all the wordes of his law, and
his statutes to do them. This praecept re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
not onlye, that the king should
hym selfe fear God, kepe his Law, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
but that also he as the chefe ruler,
should prouide that goddes true religion
should be kept inuiolated of the people
and flock, which by God was committed
to his charge. And this did not onlie Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and Salomon perfectly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but
also somme godlie kinges in Iuda after
the apostasie and idolatrie,<note place="margin">The factes of Godlie kings are an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the law and decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of theyre po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</note> that infected
Israel by the meanes of Ieroboam, did pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctise
theyre vnderstanding and execute
theyre power in somme notable reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For Asa and Iosaphat kinges in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
fynding the religion altogither cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
did applie theyre hearts (saieth the
holie ghost) to serue the Lord, and to walk
in his waies: and thereafter doth witnes
that Asa remoued from honours his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
somme say gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmother, because shee
had committed and laboured to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
horrible idolatrie.<note place="margin">2. Paral. 14. &amp; 17.</note> And Iosaphat did
not only refuse strange goddes hym selfe,
but also distroying the chefe monuments
of idolatrie, did send furth the.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Leuites
<pb facs="tcp:7080:21"/>
to instruct the people, whereof it is playne
that the one and the other did vnderstand
suche reformations to appertaine to theire
dueties. But the factes of Ezechias, and of
Iosias do more clerely proue the power
and duetie of the ciuile Magistrate in the
reformation of religion. Before the reign
of Ezechias so corrupt was the religion
that the dores of the house of the Lord
were shut vpp,<note place="margin">2. Paralip 29.</note> the lampes were extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
no sacrifice was orderly made, but
in the first yeare of his reigne the first
moneth of the same, did the king open
the dores of the temple, bring in the Pree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
and Leuites and assembling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
did speak vnto them as folloeth.<note place="margin">Aduert that the kinge ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the preestes.</note>
Hear me o yce Leuites and be sanctified
now, and sanctifie also the house of the
Lord God of your fathers and carie furth
from the sanctuarie all filthynes (he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

haue committed wickednes in thee eyes of
the eternall our God, they haue left hym
and haue turned theyre faces from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore is the
wrath of the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med vpon Iuda and
Ierusalem. Behold our fathers haue fallen
by the sworde, our sonnes, daughters a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
wifes are led in captiuitie, but now haue
I purposed in my heart to make a couenan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te

with the Lord God of Israel, that he
may turne the wrath of his furie from vs.
And therefore my sonnes (he swetely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth)
be not faint, for the Lord hath cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen
you to stand in his presence and to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
hym. Such as be not more then blynd
clerely may perceaue that the king dothe
aknolledge, that it appertained to his char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
to reforme the religion, to appoint the
Leuites to theyre charges and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theyre duetie and office, which
thing he more euidently declareth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his lettres to all Israel, to Ephrtaim,
an Manasses, and sent the same by the han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of messingers hauing this tenour.</p>
            <p>You sonnes of Israel return to
the Lord God of Abraham Isaac,<note place="margin">2. Pa. 30.</note>
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Israel, and he shall return to the

and as your brethren were who
haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressed against the Lord

made them desolate as you see.
Holde not your heart therefore,
but giue your hand vnto the Lord,

hym and he shall shew mercie vnto
you, to your sonnes, and dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

pitifull and easie to be intreated.</p>
            <p>Thus far did Ezechias by lettres and
messingers prouoke the people, declined
from God to repentance, not only in Iuda,
where he reigned laufull king,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> but also in
Israel, subiect then to an other king. And
albeit that by somme wicked men his mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>singers
were mocked, yet as they lacked
not theyre iust punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (for within sixe
yeares after Samaria was destroyed and Is<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rael led
captiue by Salmanazar) so did not
the zelous king Ezechias desist to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his duetie in restoring the religion to
Gods perfecte ordenance, remouing all
abominations.</p>
            <p>The same is to be red of Iosias, who did
not only restore the religion, but did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
distroy all monumentes of idolatrie,<note place="margin">2. par. 34.</note>
which of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tyme had remained. For it is
written of him, that after that the boke of
the law was found, and that he had asked
counsil at the prophetesse Hulda, he sente
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gathered all the elders of iuda and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>salem,
and standing in the temple of the

and testimonies with all theyre heart,

ratifie and confirme,<note place="margin">The king commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded the preestes.</note> what soeuer was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Helkias the hic preest, and the preestes
of the inferiour order, that they should ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
furth of the temple of the Lord all the
vessels, that were made to Baal, which he
burnt and did carie theire pouder to Beth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>el.
He did further distroy all monuments
of idolatrie, yea euen those that had remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dayes of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He did burn
them, stampe them to powder, whereof one
part he scattered in the broke Kidron and
the other vpon the sepulcres and graues
of the idolaters, whose bones he did burn
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the altars, where before they made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
not only in Iuda, but also in Beth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>el,
where Ieroboam had erected his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
yea he further proceded, and did kyll
the preestes of the hie places, who were
idolaters, and had deceaued the people: he
did kyll them, I say, and did burn theyre
bones vpon theyre owne altars, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Ierusalem. This reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
Iosias, and for the same obtained this te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stimonie
of the holie Ghost, that neither
before hym neither after hym was there
any suche ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, who returned to God with

according to all the law of Moses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7080:23"/>Of which histories it is euident that
the reformation of religion in all points,
togither with the punishement of false
teachers doth appertaine to the power of
the ciuile Magistrate. For what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them, his iustice must require of
others hauing the like charge and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
what he did approue in them, he can
not but approue in all others, who with
like zeale and synceritie do interprise to
purge the Lordes temple and sanctuarie.
what God required of them, it is before
declared, to wit: that most diligently they
should obserue his Law, statutes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
And how acceptable were theyre
factes to God, doth he him selfe witnesse.
For to somme he gaue most notable victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries
without the hande of man,<note place="margin">2. Par. 32.</note> and in
theyre most desperat daungers did decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

signes supernaturall: to other he so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the kingdome, that theyre enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were compelled to stoupe vnder
theyre feete. And the names of all he hath
regestred not only in the boke of life, but
also in the blessed remembrance of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities
sence theyre daies, which also
shall continue till the commyng of the
Lord Iesus, who shall rewarde with the
crowne of immortalitie not only the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
also such, as vnfaynedly studie to do the

father in the middest of this corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
generation. In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration whereof
ought you, my Lordes, all delay set apart,
to prouide for the reformation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in your dominions and boundes,
which now is so corrupt that no part of
Christes institution remaineth in the
original puritie, and therefore of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
it is, that spedely ye prouide for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatione
or els ye declare your selues,
not only voyde of loue to werdes your
subiectes, but also to liue without care of
your owne saluation, yea without all
feare and true reuerence of God. Two
thinges perchance may moue you to este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
these histories before briuely tuched
to appertaine nothing to you. Fyrst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are no Iewes but Gentiles: and
secondarely because you are no kinges,<note place="margin">The factes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie kings in Iuda do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the powers among the genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ</note>
but nobiles in your realm. But be not
deceaued. For neither of both can excuse
you in goddes presence from doing
your duetie, for it is a thing more then
certein, that whatso euer God required
of the ciuile Magistrate in Israel or Iuda
concernyng the obseruation of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
during the tyme of the Law, the
same doth he require of lawfull Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
professing Christ Iesus in the tyme of
the Gospell, as the holie Ghost hath
<pb facs="tcp:7080:24"/>
taught vs by the mouth of Dauid, saying
Psal. 2.</p>
            <p>Be learned you that iudge the
earth, kysse the sonne, lest that the
Lord waxe angrie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that yee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
from the way.</p>
            <p>This admonition did not extend to
the iudges vnder the law only, but doth
also include all such as be promoted to
honours in the tyme of the Gospell, when
Christ Iesus doth reigne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d feight in his
spirituall kyngdome, whose ennemies in
that psalme be fyrst most sharply taxed,
theyr furie expressed, and vanitie mocked:
&amp; then are kings and iudges, who think
them selues free from all law and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
commaunded to repent theyre former
blynd rage, and iudges are charged to be
learned: and last are all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the eternall in feare, to reioyce before
hym in tremblyng, to kysse the sonne,
that is, to geue vnto hym most humble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
whereof it is euident that the
rulers, Magistrats and iudges now in
Christes kingdome are no lesse bound to
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were those vnder
the Law. And how is it possible that any
shall be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who dispise his religion,
in which standeth the chefe glorie, that
man can geue to God, and is a seruice,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7080:24"/>
which God especially requireth of kings
and rulers?<note place="margin">Epist. 50.</note> Which thing saint Augustine
plainely did note, writing to one Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius
a man of warr, according to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
argument and purpose, which I labour
to persuade your Honours. For after that
he hath in that his epistle declared the dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the heresie of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
and Arrians, and hath somwhat spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of theyr crueltie, he sheweth the way
how theyr furie should and oght to be
repressed, and that it is lawfull for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
afflicted to seke support and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
at godlie Magistrates. For thus he
writeth:</p>
            <p>Either must the veritie be kept
close,<note place="margin">Aduert.</note> or els must theyr crueltie be
susteaned.</p>
            <p>But if the veritie should be concealed,
not only should none be saued nor dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by suchsile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but also shoulde many
be lost through theyr decept. But if by
preaching of the veritie theyr furie should
be prouoked more to rage, and by that
meanes yet somme were delyuered, and
made stronge, yet should feare hinder ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
weakli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to folowe the veritie, if theyr
rage be not stayed. In these fyrst wordes
Augustine sheweth three reasons, why the
afflicted Church in those daies called for
<pb facs="tcp:7080:25"/>
the help of the Emperour and of godlie
Magistrates against the furie of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters.
The fyrst,</p>
            <p>The veritie must be spoken or<note place="margin">Note well.</note>
ells mankind shall perish in errour.</p>
            <p>The second, the veritie being plainlie
spoken prouoketh the aduersaries to rage.
And because that so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me did alledge that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we oght to suffer all iniurie, then to
seke support by man, he addeth the third
reason: to witt that many weakones be
not able to suffer persecution and death
for the truethes sake, to whome not the les<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
respect oght to be had, that they may
be won from errour and so be brought to
grater strength.</p>
            <p>O that the rulers of this age should
ponder and wey the reasons of this godly
writer, and prouid the remedie, which
he requyreth in these wordes foloi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, Now
when the Church was thus afflicted yf any
think that rather they should haue sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all calamitie,<note place="margin">Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes words.</note> then that the helpe of
God should haue bene asked by Christian
Emperours, he doth not well aduert, that
of such negligence no good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptes or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could be geuen. For where such, as
would that no iust lawes should be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
theyre impietie, alledge that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
soght no such thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of the kinges
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7080:25"/>
of the earth, they do not consider that then
the tyme was other then it is now, and
that all thinges are done in theyr owne
tyme. What Emperour then beleued in
Christ, that should serue hym in making
lawes for godlines against impietie?</p>
            <p>whill yet that saying of the ꝓphet was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plete,
why hath nations raged, and people
haue imagined vanitie? The kinges of the
earth haue stand vp, &amp; princes haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
together against the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his annoynted. That which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
said in the same psalme, was not yet
comme to passe. And now vnderstand, o
you kinges, be learned you that iudge the
earth, serue the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in fear, and reioyce
to hym with tremlinge.<note place="margin">Aduert the mynd of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> How do kings
serue the Lord in fear? but in punishing
and by a godlie seueritie forbidding
those thinges which are done against
the commaundement of the Lord. For
otherwise doth he serue in so far as he
is man, other wise in so far as he is king.</p>
            <p>In so far as he is man,<note place="margin">In two sor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes oght kinges to serue God</note> he serueth hym
by liuing faithfully, but because he is
also king he serueth establishing lawes,
that commaund the thinges that be iust,
and that with a conuenient rigour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd
thinges contrarie. As Ezechias ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
distroying the groues, the temples
of idols and the places, which were buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:7080:26"/>
against goddes commaundement. So
serued also Iosias doing the same: so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the king of Niniuites compelling the
hole citie to mitigate the Lord: so serued
Darius geuing in the power of Daniel the
idol to be broken, and his ennemies to be
cast to the lions: so serued Nabucadnezer,
by a terrible law forbidding all, that were
in his realme, to blaspheme God. Herein
therefore do kinges serue the Lord in so
far as they are kings, when they do those
things to serue hym, which none except
kings be able to do. He further procedeth
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, that as, when wicked kings
do reign, impietie can not be brideled by
lawes, but rather is tyrannie exercised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the title of the same,<note place="margin">O that the worlde should vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand.</note> so is it a thing wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout
all reason, that kinges professing
the knolledge and honour of God, should
not regard nor care, who did defend, nor
who did oppugne the Church of God in
theyr dominions. By these wordes of this
auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and godlie writer your Honours
may perceaue, what I require of you,
to wit, to represse the tyrannie of your By<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shoppes,
and to defend the innocents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
the trueth. He did require of the
Emperour and kings of his daies profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Christ, and manifestly concludeth,
that they can not serue Christ, except that
so they do. Let not your Byshoppes thinke
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7080:26"/>
that Augustine speaketh for them, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
he nameth the Church. Let them read
and vnderstand, that Augustine writeth
for that Church, which professeth the
trueth and doth suffer persecution for the
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the same, which your byshoppes
do not, but rather with the Donatistes and
Arrians do cruelly persecute all such, as
boldly speak Christes eternall veritie to
manifest theyre impietie and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But thus much we haue of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
that it appertaineth to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and seruice,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> which kinges owe to
God aswel now in the tyme of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
as before vnder the Law, to defende
the afflicted for matters of religion, and to
represse the furie of the persecuters by
the rigour and seueritie of godlie lawes.
For which cause no doubt doth Esaie<note place="margin">Esaie 49.</note> the
prophete say, that kinges should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishers
to the Church of God, that they
should abbase their heades, and louingly
embrase the children of God. And thus I
say your Honours may euidently see, that
the same obedience doth God require of
rulers and princes in the tyme of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that he required in the tyme of the
Law.<note place="margin">An ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the second ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iection.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yf you do think, that the reformation
of religion and defence of the afflicted
doth not appertaine to you, because you
<pb facs="tcp:7080:27"/>
are no kings, but nobils a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d estates of a real
me, in two thinges you are deceaued: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
in that you do not aduert, that Dauid
requireth aswell, that the princes and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the earth be learned and that they
serue and fear God, as that he requireth,
that the kings repent. Yf you therefore be
iudges and princes, as no man can deny
you to be, then by the playn words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
you are charged to be learned, to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
and fear God, which ye can not do, if
you despise the reformation of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And thys is your fyrst errour. The
seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, that ye neither know your duetie,
which ye owe to God, neither yet your auc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toritie,
which of hym ye haue receaued, yf
ye for pleasure or fear of any earthlie man
despise goddes true religion, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in his name cal for your
support. Your dutie is to hear the voyce of
the Eternal your God, and unfainedly to
studie to folow his preceptes: who, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said, of especiall mercie hath promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you to honours and dignitie. His che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
and principall precept is, that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
ye receaue and embrace his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
beloued sonne Iesus: that ye promote
to the vttermost of your powers his true
religion: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ye defend your brethren
and subiectes, whome he hath putt vnder
your charge a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d care. Now if your king be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7080:27"/>
a man ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, ennemie to his true
religion, blinded by superstition, and a
persecuter of Christes membres, shall yee
be excused, if with silence yee passe ouer
his iniquitie? Be not deceaued my Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
ye are placed in auctoritie for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose then to flatter your king in
his folie and blind rage: to witt, that as
with your bodies, strength, riches, and
wisdome ye are bound to assist and defend
him in all things, which by your aduise he
shall take in hand for Gods glorie and
for the preseruation of his commune we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth
and subiectes, so by your grauities,
counsil and admonition yee are bound to
correct and represse whatsoeuer ye know
him to attempt expressedly repugning to
Goddes word, honour, and glorie, or
what ye shall espie him to do, be it by igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance
or be it by malice, against his subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes
great, or small. Of which last part of
your obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce yf ye defraud your king, ye
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit against him no lesse treason, then yf
ye did extract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him your due and ꝓmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
support, what time by his ennemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
he wer pursued. But this part of their
duetie I fear do a small nomber of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of this age rightly consider: neither
yet will they vnderstand, that for that
purpose hath God ꝓmoted them. For now
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune song of al men is, We must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb facs="tcp:7080:28"/>
our kinges be they good, or be they
bad, for God hath so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. But hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible
shall the vengeance be, that shalbe
powred furth vpon such blasphemers of
God his holie name, and ordinaunce. For
it is no lesse blasphemie to say, that God
hath commaunded kinges to be obeyed,
when they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund impietie, then to say,
that God by his precept is auctour a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of all iniquitie. True it is, God hath
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded kinges to be obeyed, but like
true it is, that in things, which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
against his glorie, or when cruelly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout
cause they rage agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st theire brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the members of Christes body, he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
no obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but rather he hath
approued, yea and greatlie rewarded such
as haue opponed them selues to theyre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
commaundementes and blind rage:
as in the exampls of the three children, of
Daniel, and Abdemelech it is euident. The
three children wold nether bowe nor stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
before the golden image at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement
of the great king Nabuchadnezar.
Daniel did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly pray, his windoes being
open, against the established law of Darius
and of his counsil: and Abdemelech fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not to enter in before the presence of
Zedechias a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d boldly to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the cause a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Ieremie the prophet,<note place="margin">Ieremie 38</note> whome
the king and his counsil had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7080:28"/>
deth. Euerie one of these factes should this
day be iudged foolishe by such, as will not
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession God doth requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
of his children, when his veritie is oppu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gned,
or his glorie called in doubt: suche
men, I say, as prefer man to God, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
present to the heauenlie inheritaunce,
should haue iudged euerie one of these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes
stubburn inobedience, foolishe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and singularitie, or elles bold
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolinge of the king and his wise coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.
But how acceptable in Gods presence
was this resistance to the vngodlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes
and determinations of
theyr king the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did witnes. For the three
children were deliuered from the fornace
of fyer, and Daniel from the den of lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to
the confusion of their ennemies, to the
better instruction of the ignorant kinges,
and to the perpetuall comfort of goddes
afflicted children. And Abdemelech in
the day of the Lordes visitation, when the
kinge and his counsil did drink the bitter
cupp of goddes vengeance,<note place="margin">Ierem. 39</note> did fynde his
life for a praye, and did not fall in the
edge of the sword, when manie thousan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
did perishe. And this was signified
vnto him by the prophet him self at the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God before that Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
was destroyed. The promesse and cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
were recited vnto him in these wordes,
<pb facs="tcp:7080:29"/>
I will bring my wordes vpon this citie vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
euill and not vnto good: but most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
I shal deliuer thee because thou hast
trusted in me, sayeth the Lord. The
trust a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hope, which Abdemelech had in
God, made him bold to oppone him selfe,
being but a man, to the king and to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sill, who had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to death the
Prophet, whome his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science did acknol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
to be innocent. For this did he speak
in the presence of the king sitting in the
port of Beniami<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: My Lord the kinge, saith
Abdemelech, these men do wickedly in all
thinges, that they haue done to Ieremie
the Prophet. Aduert and take hede my
Lordes, that the men, who had condemned
the Prophet, were the king, his pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and
counsill, and yet did one man accuse them
all of iniquitie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did boldly speak in the
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whose innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie he was per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suaded.
And the same, I say, is the duetie of
euery man in his vocation, but chefely of
the nobilitie, which is ioyned with theyr
kinges to bridel and represse that folie
and blind rage. Which thing if the nobili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
do not, neither yet labour to do, as they
are traitours to their kings, so do they pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke
the wrath of God agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st them selues
and against the realme, in which they abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
the auctoritie, which they haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of God to mentaine vertue and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
vice. For hereof I would your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7080:29"/>
were most certainly persuaded, that
God will neither excuse nobilitie nor peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,
but the nobilitie least of al, that obey
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d folow theyr kinges in manifest iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but with the same vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce will God
punishe the Prince, people, and nobilitie
conspiring togither against him and his
holie ordenances: as in the punishment
taken vpon Pharao, Israel, Iuda and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
is euidently to be sene. For Pharao was
not drowned alone, but his captayns, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retes,
and greate armie drank the same
cup with him. The kinges of Israel, and
Iuda were not punished whitout co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pagny,
but with them were murthered the counsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
theyre Princes imprisoned and thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
people ledd captiue. And why? because
none was found so faithful to God, that he
durst enterprise to resist nor against and
the manifest impietie of theyr Princes.
And therefore was Gods wrath powred
furth vpon the one and the other. But the
more ample discource of this argument I
differ to better opportunitie: onely at this
tyme I thoght expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to admonysh you,
that before God it shall not excuse you to
alledge, We are no kinges and therefore
neither can we reforme religion, nor yet
defend such as be persecuted. Consider
my Lordes that yee are powers ordened
by God (as before is declared) a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore
<pb facs="tcp:7080:30"/>
doth the reformation of religion, and the
defense of such, as iniusty are oppressed,
appertaine to your charge and care, which
thinge shall the law of God, vniuersally
geuen to be kept of all men, most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare: which is my last and most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
reason,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> why I say yee oght to remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
from honours and to punish with death
such as God hath condemned by his owne
mouth. After that Moses had declared
what was true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, to honor God
as he commaunded, adding nothing to his
worde, neither yet diminishinge any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
from it, and after also that vehemently he
had exhorted the same law to be obserued,
he denounceth the punishment against the
tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressours in these wordes, Yf thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sonne, doghter wife or neghbour,
whome thou louest as thyne own life, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate
thee secretly, saying, Let vs go ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
other goddes,<note place="margin">Deut. 23. &amp; 27.</note> whome neither thou, nor
thy fathers haue knowen, consent not to
hym, hear hym not, let not thyne eye spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hym, shew hym no indulgentie or
fauour, hide him not, but vtterly kill hym,
let thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be the first vpon hym, that he
may be slaine, and after the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
people. Of these wordes of Moses are-two
things, apperteani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to our purpose, to
be noted. Former, that such, as solicitate on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
to idolatrie oght to be punished to death
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7080:30"/>
without fauour or respect of person.<note place="margin">Idolatrie oght to be punished without respect of person.</note> For
he that will not suffer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to spare his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,
his daughter, nor his wife, but straitly com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeth

with vs) will not wink at the idolatrie
of others, of what estate or condition so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they be.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowen,<note place="margin">If anie estate might haue claimed priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, it was the prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.</note> that the prophetes
had reuelations of God, which were not
commune to the people, as Samuel had the
reuelation, that Eli and his posteritie
should be destroyed, that Saul should first
be king and thereafter that he should be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iected,
that Dauid should reign for him.
Micheas vnderstode by vision that Achab
should be killed in battaile against the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
Elias saw that dogges should eat
Iesabel i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fortres of Iesrael.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3.</note> Eliaesus did
see hunger come vpon Israel by the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of seuen yeares.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9. 15.</note> Ieremie did foresee
the destruction of Ierusalem and the tyme
of their captiuitie,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 22</note> and so diuerse other
prophetes had diuerse reuelations of God,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 21.</note>
which the people did not otherwise vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 8.</note>
but by their affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore
in those dayes were the prophetes named
Seears, because that God did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that, which was hid from the multitude.
Now if anie man might haue claimed anie
<pb facs="tcp:7080:31"/>
priuiledge from the rigour of the Law,
or might haue iustified his fact, it should
haue bene the Prophete. For he might
haue alledged for hym selfe his singular
prerogatiue, that he had aboue other men
to haue goddes will reuealed vnto hym
by visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or by dream, or that God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
particularely vnto hym, that his
pleasure was to be honoured i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that maner,
in such a place, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by such meanes. But all
such excuses doth God remoue, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
that the Prophete, that shall solicitate the
people to serue strange goddes, shall die
the death, notwithstanding that he alledge
for hym selfe dream, vision, or reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yea althogh he promisse miracles,
and also that such thinges as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
come to passe, yet I say commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
God, that no credit be geuen to hym,
but that he die the death, because he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
apostasie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d defection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
your Honours may easely espie, that
none prouoking the people to idolatrie
oght to be exempted from the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of death. For if neither that inseparable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iunction,
which God hym selfe hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
betwixt man and wife, neither that
vnspeakable loue grafted in nature, which
is betwixt the father and the sonne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet that reuerence, which goddes
people oght to bear to the Prophetes, can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7080:31"/>
excuse anie man to spare the offendour or
to conceale his offense, what excuse can
man pretend, which God will accept? Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is that no estate, condition nor
honour can exempt the idolatour from
the handes of God, when he shal call him
to accomptes, or shall inflict punishment
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for his offence: how shall it then
excuse the people, that they according to
goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t punish not to death
such, as shal solicitate or viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly draw the
people to idolatrie? And this is the fyrst,
which I would your Honours should note
of the former wordes. To witt, that no per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
is exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if he can be
manifestly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted to haue prouoked or
led the people to idolatrie: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this is most
euidently declared in that solemned othe
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenante, which Asa made with the
people to serue God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
adding this penaltie to the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sours
of it: To wit, that whosoeuer should
not seke the Lord God of Israel,<note place="margin">2. Par. 15.</note> should
be kylled, were he greate or were he small,
were it man or were it woman. And of this
oth was the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleased, he was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rest on euerie parte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they soght hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their hole heart,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did swear to punishe the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
to the precept of his Law without
respect of persons. And this is it, which
<pb facs="tcp:7080:32"/>
I say I would your Honours should note
for the fyrst, that no idolatour can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> punishement by goddes Law.
The seconde is, that the punishment of
such crimes as are idolatrie, blasphemie,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d others, that tuche the maiestie of God,
dothe not appertaine to kinges and chefe
rulers only, but also to the hole bodie of
that people, and to euerie membre of the
same accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and according to that possibilitie and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
which God doth minister to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
the iniurie done against his glorie,
what time that impietie is manifestly kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen.
And that doth Moses more plainely
speak in these wordes,</p>
            <p>Yf in anie of thy cities,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> saieth he,
which the Lord thy God geueth
vnto the to dwell in them, thou
shalt hear this brute, There are so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
men the sonnes of Belial pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
furthe from thee, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the citizens of theyr cities
by these wordes, Let vs go a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d serue
strange goddes, which you haue
not knowen, search and inquire
diligently, and if it be true, that
such abomination is done in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7080:32"/>
middest of thee, thou shalt vtterly
stryke the inhabitants of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with the sworde, thou shalt
destroy it and whatsoeuer is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin
it, thou shalt gather the
spoile of it in the middest of the
marketplace, thou shalt burne that
citie with fier, and the spoile of it
to the Lord thy God, that it may
be a heap of stones for euer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Let nothing of that execration
cleaue to thy hand, that the Lord
may turne from the furie of his
wrath, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be moued to werdes thee
with inward affection.</p>
            <p>Plaine it is that Moses speaketh nor
geueth not charge to kinges rulers and

should not do,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. and 30.</note> except that in their heartes
they did sanctifie the lord God, that they
embrased, and inuiolably kept his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
established: and finally except they did
cutt oute iniquitie from amongest them,
declaring them selues earnest ennemies to
those abominations, which God declared
hym selfe so vehemently to hate, that fyrst
he commaunded the hole inhabitants of
that countree to be distroyed and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of their idolatrie to be broken
doune,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.</note> and thereafter he also streatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth,
that a citie declininge to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
should fall in the edge of the sworde,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the hole spoile of the same,<note place="margin">Godds iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gements to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man appear ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</note> should
be burned, no portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it reserued. To the
carnal man this may appeare a rigorous
and seuere iudgement, yea it may rather
seme to be pronounced in a rage, then in
wisdome. For what citie was euer yet, in
which to mannes iudgement were not to
be found manie innocent persons, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
children, and somme simple and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7080:33"/>
soules, who neither did nor could
consent to such impietie? And yet we fynd
no exception, but all are appointed to
the cruel death. And as concernyng the
citie and the spoile of the same, mannes
reason can not think, but that it might
haue bene better bestowed, then to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sumed
with fier, and so to profitt no man.
But in such cases will God that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
stoupe, couer their faces, and desist
from reasonyng, when commaundement
is geuen to execute his iudgement. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I could adduce diuerse causes of such
seueritie, yet will I search none other
then the holie Ghost hath assigned. Fyrst,
that all Israel hearing the iudgement
should fear to commit the like abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and secondarely, that the Lord
might turn from the furie of his anger,
might be moued towerds the people with
inward affection, be mercifull vnto them,
and multiplie them according to his oth
made vnto theire fathers. Which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as they are sufficient in goddes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to correct the murmuring of the
grudging fleshe, so oght they to prouoke
euerie man, as before I haue said, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
hym selfe ennemie to that, which so
highly prouoketh the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the hole people. For where Moses
saieth,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7080:34"/>Let the citie be burned, and let
no part of the spoile cleaue to thy
hand, that the Lord may return
from the furie of his wrath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He plainely doth signifie,<note place="margin">For the idolatrie of a smale number is goddes wrath kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the multitude not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dours.</note> that by the
defection and idolatrie of a few goddes
wrath is kyndled against the hole, which
is neuer quenched till such punishement
be taken vpon the offenders: that what
soeuer serued them in their idolatrie, be
broght to destruction, because that it is
execrable and accursed before God. And
therefore he will not, that it be reserued
for anie vse of his people. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that this law was not put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as God commaunded. But what did
thereof insue and folow histories declare:
to witt, plage after plage till Israel, and
Iuda were led in captiuitie, as the bokes
of kings do witnesse. The consideration
whereof maketh me more bold to affirm,
that it is the duetie of euerie man, that
list to escape the plage and punishement
of God, to declare hym selfe ennemie to
idolatrie not only in heart, hating the
same, but also in externall gesture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
that he lamenteth, yf he can do
no more,<note place="margin">EZech. 9.</note> for such abominations. Which
thing was shewed to the ꝓphete Ezechiel,

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7080:34"/>

his wrathe and indignation v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the citie, that was full of blood and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie,
which became so impudent, that
it durst be bold to say, the Lord hath left
the earth, and seeth not. At this tyme, I say,
the Lord reuealed in vision to his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
who they were, that should fynd fauour
in that miserable destruction. To witt,
those that did murne and lament for all
the abominations done in the citie, in
whose foreheades did God commaund to
print and seal Tau, to the end that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer,
who was commaunded to stryke
the rest without mercie, should not hurt
them, in whome that signe was found. Of
these premisses I suppose it be euident,
that the punishment of idolatrie doth not
appertaine to kinges only, but also to the
hole people, yea to euerie membre of the
same according to his possibilitie. For
that is a thing most assured, that no man
can murne, lament, and bewaile for those
thinges, which he will not remoue to the

            <p>To this same Law, I say, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenante
are the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles no lesse bounde, then som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
were the Iewes, when soeuer God

the sworde in their own hand to remoue
such enormities from amongest them, as
before God they know to be abominable.
Then, I say, are they no lesse bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
theyr dominions,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cities and countries
from idolatrie, then were the Israelites,
what tyme they receaued the possession of

if any go about to erect and set vp ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
or to teach defection from God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the veritie hath bene receaued and
approued, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

they haue made to God, to reuenge to the
vttermost of their power the iniurie done
against his Maiestie. In vniuersal defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in a general reuolt, such as was
in Israel after Ieroboam, there is a diuerse
consideration. For then because the hole
<pb facs="tcp:7080:37"/>
people were togither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st God,
there could none be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that woulde exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute
the punishement, which God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
till God raised vpp Iehu, whom
he had appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for that purpose. And the
same is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered in all other general

But I do speak of such a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they haue receaued goddes perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

that so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me or the most part fal back:
(as of late daies was i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) vnto such a
no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, I say, it is Laufull to punish the ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latours
with death, if by anie meanes God
geue them the power. For so did Iosua and
Israel determine to haue done against the
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rube<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gad a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Manasses for their

And the hole tribes did in verie dede exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that sharpe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the tribe
of Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iamin for a lesse offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then for idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trie.
And the same oght to be done wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
Christ Iesus a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gill is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7080:37"/>
vnder king Edward of late dayes was done
in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. In such places, I say, it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawful to punish to the death such, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to subuert the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrates

they wil prouoke the wrath of God agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues. And therfor I fear not to affirm,
that it had bene the duetie of the nobilitie,

with all the sort of her idolatrous Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
together with all such, as should haue
assisted her, what tyme that shee and they
openly began to suppresse Christes Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
to shedd the blood of the sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cts of God,

which ones most iustly by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune
oth was banished from that realme. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not at this present discusse this ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument,
as it appertaineth, I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled
to omitt it to better opportunitie, and so
returning to your Honours, I say, that if
ye confesse your selues baptised in the

that the care of his religion doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to your charge. And if ye know that
in your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des God hath put the sworde for

<pb facs="tcp:7080:38"/>
but that the punishement of obstinate
and malepert idolatours (such as all your
bishoppes be) doth appertaine to your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
yf after admonition they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat.
I am not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what be the vaine
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses of your proude prelates. They clai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
first a prerogatiue and priuiledge, that
they are exempted, and that by consent of
Councils and Emperours from all iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the temporaltie. And seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darely,
when they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted of manifest impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
abuses, and enormities aswell in their
maners as in religion, neither fear, nor sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
they to affirme, that thinges so longe
established can not suddenly be reformed,
althogh they be corrupted, but with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of tyme they promisse to take order.
But in few wordes I answer, that no priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
graunted against the ordenance and
statutes of God, is to be obserued althogh
all Councils and men in the earth haue ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed
the same. But against goddes orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance
it is, that idolatours, murtherours,
fals teachers, and blasphemers shall be exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
from punishement, as before is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and therefore in vaine it is, that they
claym for priuiledge, when that God say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
The murtherer shalt thou riue from
my alter, that he may die the death. And
as to the order and reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they
promisse, that is to be loked or hoped for,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7080:38"/>
when Satan, whose children and slaues
they are, can cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his nature. This answer
I doubt not shall suffice the sober a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
reader. But yet to the end that they may
further see their own confusion, and that
your Honours may better vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what
ye oght to do in so manifest a corruption
and defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from God, I aske of them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
what assurance they haue for this their
immunitie, exemption, or priuiledge? who
is the auctour of it? and what frute it hath
produced?<note place="margin">God is not auctour of anie priui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unted to papistical bishoppes, that they be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the power of the ciui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le sword.</note> And fyrst I say that of God
they haue no assurance, neither yet can he
be proued to be auctour of anie suche
priuiledge. But the contrarie is easie to be
seen. For God in establishing his orders
in Israel did so subiect Aaron (in his pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthode
being the figure of Christ) to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that he feared not to call him in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,
and to constrain hym to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes
of his wicked dede in consenting
to idolatrie, as the historie doth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witnesse. For thus it is written,</p>
            <p>Then Moses toke the calf,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> which
they had made, and burned it with

thereafter Moses said to Aaron, what
hath this people done to the, that
thou shouldest bring vpon it so
great a syn?</p>
            <p>Thus, I say, doth Moses call and accuse
Aaron of the destruction of the hole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and yet he perfectly vnderstode, that
God had appointed hym to be the high

to make sacrifice, praiers, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He knew his dignitie was so great,<note place="margin">The digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not exempt him from iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note>
that only he might entre within the most

that Moses, being taught by the

what dignitie Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was appointed, and yet
he feared not to call hym in iudgement,
and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell hym to make answer for his
wicked fact. But if this answer doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice,
yet shall the holie Ghost witnesse fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the matter. Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remoued from
honour Abiathar being the high preeste,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to cease from all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7080:39"/>
and to liue as a priuate man. Now if
the vnction did exempt the preest from
Iurisdiction of the ciuile Magistrate, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
did offend, and iniured Abiathar.
For he was anoynted, and had caried
the ark before Dauid. But God doth not
reproue the fact of Salomon, neither yet
doth Abiathar claime anie prerogatiue
by the reason of his office, but rather doth
the holie Ghost approue the fact of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
sayinge,</p>
            <p>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eiected furth Abiathar,<note place="margin">1. Regu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 2.</note>
that he should not be the Preest of
the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.</note> that the word of the
Lord might be perfurmed, which
he spake vpon the house of Eli.</p>
            <p>And Abiathar did think that he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
great fauour, in that he did escape the
present death, which by his conspiracie
he had deserued. Yf anie yet reason, that
Abiathar was no otherwise subiect to the
iudgement of the king, but as he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the executour of that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which God before had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,<note place="margin">Note well.</note>
as I will not greatly denie that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so require I that euerie man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the same God, who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
sentence against Eli, and his house,
hath pronounced also, that idolaters,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remongers,
murtherers,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> and blasphemers
<pb facs="tcp:7080:40"/>
shall neither haue portion in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, neither oght to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to bear anie rule in his Church
and congregation. Now if the vnction
and office saued not Abiathar, because
that goddes sentence must nedes be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furmed,
can anie priuiledge graunted
by man be a buckler to malefactours, that
they shall not be subiect to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
pronounced by God? I think no
man will be so foolishe as so to affirm. For
a thing more then euident it is, that the
hole preesthode in the tyme of the Law
was bound to giue obedience to the ciuile
powers. And if anie membre of the same
was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de criminal, the same was subiect
to the punishement of the sworde, which
God had put in the hand of the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.
And this ordenance of his father did
not Christ disanul,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> but rather did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme
the same, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding tribute to be payed
for hym selfe and for Peter. Who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knowing the mynd of his maister,
thus writeth in his epistle,</p>
            <p>Submit your selues to all maner
ordenance of man,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> (he excepteth such
as be expressely repugnyng to goddes
commaundement) for the Lordes
sake,<note place="margin">Act. 4. and 5.</note> whether it be to king as to
the chefe head, or vnto rulers as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7080:40"/>
vnto them, that are sent by hym
for punishement of euill doers,
and for the praise of them, that do
well.</p>
            <p>The same doth the apostle saint Paule
most plainely commaund in these wordes,</p>
            <p>Let euerie soule be subiect to
the superiour powers.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Which places make euident that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ neither his Apostles hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
any assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this immunitie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiledge,
which men of Church (as they
wil be termed) do this day claime. Yea it
was a thing vnknowen to the primitiue
Churche many yeares after the daies of
the Apostles. For Chrysostome,<note place="margin">Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 13. to the Rom.</note> who ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Churche at Constantinople
foure hundreth years after Christes ascen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion,
and after that corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was greatlie
increased, doth yet thus write vpon the
forsayd wordes of the Apostle,</p>
            <p>This precept,<note place="margin">Let Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Chry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sostome.</note> saieth he, doth not
appertaine to such as be called se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
onlie, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those, that
be Preestes and religious men.</p>
            <p>And after he addeth: Whether thou be
Apostle, Euangelist, Prophete, or
whosoeuer thou be, thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st not
<pb facs="tcp:7080:41"/>
be exempted from this subiection.</p>
            <p>Hereof it is playn that Chrysostome
did not vnderstand that God had exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted
any person from obedience and subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the ciuile power, neither yet that he
was auctour of such exemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as Papistes do this day claime. And
the same was the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vniforme
doctrine of the primatiue Church many
yeares after Christe. Your Honours do
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, I doubt not, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine then
did this theyr immunitie, as they terme it,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d singular priuiledge spri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. I shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tuch that, which is euident in their own
law and histories. When the Byshoppes
of Rome, the verie Antichrists had partly
by fraud, and partly by violence vsurped
the superioritie of some places in Italie,
and most iniustly had spoiled the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of their re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and  possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Lett theyr owne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and had
also murthered somme of their officers, as
histories do witnesse, the began Pope after
Pope to practise and deuise, how they
should be exempted from iudgement of
Princes and from the equitie of lawes,
and in this poynt they were most vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
till at length iniquitie did so preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
in theyr handes, according as Daniel
had before prophesied of them, that this
sentence was pronounced,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:7080:41"/>Neither by the Emperour,<note place="margin">The mouthe of the beast spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kinge great thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the clergie, neither yet by
the people shall the iudge be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
God will, saieth Symmachus, that
the causes of others be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by men,<note place="margin">Distin. 9. quest. 3.</note> but without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
he hath reserued the Byshop
of this seat, vnderstanding Rome,<note place="margin">Theyre lawes do witnesse.</note> to
his own iudgement.</p>
            <p>And here of diuerse Popes, and exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of their lawes would seme to geue
reasons. For saieth Agatho,<note place="margin">Dist. 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>All the preceptes of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolik
seat are assured, as by the
voice of God him self.</p>
            <p>The auctour of the glose vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
affirmeth, that if all the world should
pronounce sentence against the Pope, yet
should his sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce preuaile. For saieth he,<note place="margin">Cap. de transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione titul. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope hath a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie will,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore he may chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
of thinges, he may apply the
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of one thing to an other,
and of nothing he may make som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
and that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which was
nothing (that is) by his mynd fals
<pb facs="tcp:7080:42"/>
and iniuste, he may make somew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat
that is true a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iust. For, saieth he,
in all thinges, that please hym, his
will is for reason. Neither is there
any man, that may aske of hym,
why doest thou so. For he may
dispens aboue the Law, and of
iniustice he may make iustice. For
he hath the fulnes of all power.</p>
            <p>And manie other most blasphemous
se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces did they pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce euery one after
other, which for shortnessake I omitt, till
at the end they obtained this most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
decrie: that albeit in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
they were so wicked,<note place="margin">Distinct. 40.</note> and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
that not only they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned them
selues, but that also they drew to hell and
perdition manie thousandes with them,<note place="margin">Note the equitie of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
yet that none should presume to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
or rebuke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This being established
for the head (albeit not without somme
contradiction, for somme Emperours did
require due obedience of them, as goddes
word commaunded, and auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
had geuen before to Emperours, and
to their lawes, but Satan so preuailed in
his suete before the blynd world, that the
former sentences were confirmed, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7080:42"/>
power being graunted to the head) then
began prouision to be made for the rest
of the membres in all realmes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where they made residence. The
frute whereof we see to be this, that
none of that pestilent generation (I mean
the vermine of the Papistical order) will
be subiect to anie ciuile Magistrate, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normious
that euer his crime be, but will
be reserued to their own ordenarie, as they
terme it. And what frutes haue hereof
ensued, be the world neuer so blynd, it
can not but witnesse. For how their head
that Romane Antichrist hath bene occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
euer se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of such priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
histories do witnesse, and of late
the most part of Europa subiect to the
plage of God, to fier and sworde, by his
procurement hath felt and this day doth
fele. The pride, ambition, enuie, excesse,
fraude, spoile, oppression, murther, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
life, and incest, that is vsed and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
amongest that rabble of Preestes,
freers, monkes, channons, byshoppes and
Cardinalles, can not be expressed. I fear
not to affirme, neither doubt I to proue,
that the papisticall Church is further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
from the puretie of Christes
doctrine,<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is more then eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> from the footesteppes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and from the maners of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue
Church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the Church of the
<pb facs="tcp:7080:43"/>
Iewes from goddes holie statutes, what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
it did crucifie Christ Iesus the onlie
Messias, and most cruelly persecute his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
And yet will our Papistes claime
theyr priuiledges and auncient liberties,
which if you graunt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, my Lords,
ye shall assuredly drink the cupp of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
vengeance with them,<note place="margin">whosoeuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Papists, shall dri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k the cupp of gods ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geance with them</note> and shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
before his presence compagnions
of theues and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tainers of murtherers, as
is before declared. For theyr immunitie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
priuiledge, whereof so greatly they bost,
is nothing els, but as if theues, murtherers
or briggandes should conspire amongest
them selues, that they would neuer answer
in iudgement before anie laufull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
to the end that their theft and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should not be punished, euen such I
say is their wicked priuiledge, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue of God the father, neither
of Christ Iesus, who hathe reuealed his
fathers will to the world, neither yet of
the Apostles nor primatiue Churche, as
before is declared. But it is a thinge
conspired amongest them selues, to the
end that their iniquitie, detestable life,
and tyrannie shall neither be repressed
nor reformed. And if they obiect, that
godlie Emperours did graunt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the same, I answer that the godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of no man is, or can be of sufficient
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7080:43"/>
auctoritie to iustifie a foolishe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie
fact, such I mean, as God hath not
alowed by his worde. For Abraham was
a godlie man, but the deniall of his wife
was such a fact, as no godlie man oght to
imitate. The same might I shew of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Ezechias and Iosias, vnto whom I
think no man of iudgement will prefer
anie Emperour sence Christ, in holines a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
wisdome, and yet are not all theyr factes,
no euen such, as they appeared to haue
done for good causes, to be approued nor
folowed. And therefore, I say, as errour
and ignorance remayn all waies with the
most perfect man in this life, so must their
workes be examined by an other rule, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by their own holines, if they shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued.
But if this answer doth not suffice,
then will I answer more shortly, that no
godlie Emperour sence Christes ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hath graunted anie such priuiledge to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
such Churche or person, as they (the
hole generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Papistes) be at this day.
I am not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me Emperours of
a certaine zeale and for so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
graunted liberties to the true Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for theyr mentainance against ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
but what serueth this for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of theyr tyrannie? Yf the law must be
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the mynd of the
lawgeuer, then must they fyrst proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:7080:44"/>
selues Christes true a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afflicted Churche,
before they can claime anie priuiledge
to appertaine to them. For only to that
Churche were the priuiledges graunted.
It will not be their glorious titles, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the longe possession of the name,
that can preuaile in this so weghtie a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
For all those had the Churche of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
which did crucifie Christ, and
did condemne his doctrine. We offer to
proue by theyr frutes and tyrannie, by the
Prophetes, and playn scriptures of God,
what trees and generation they be, to witt
vnfrutefull and rotten, apt for nothing,
but to be cutt and cast in hell fier, yea
that they are the very kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
of whome we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.
And therefore, my Lordes, to return
to you, seing that God hath armed your
handes with the sworde of iustice, seing
that his Law most streatly commaundeth
idolaters and fals prophetes to be punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with death, and that you be placed
aboue your subiects to reigne as fathers
ouer theyr children: and further seing
that not only I, but with me manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
famous, godlie and learned persons,
accuse your Byshoppes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the hole rabble
of the Papistical clergie of idolatrie, of
murther and of blasphemie against God
committed: it appertaineth to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7080:44"/>
to be vigilant and carefull in so
weghtie a matter? The question is not of
earthly substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but of the glorie of God,
and of the saluation of your selues, and of
your brethren subiect to your charge, in
which if you after this playne admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be negligent, there resteth no excuse by
reason of ignorance. For in the name of
God I require of you, that the cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may be tried in your prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the
playne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d simple worde of God: that your
Byshoppes be compelled to desist from
theyr tyrannie: that they be compelled to
make answer for the neglecting of their
office, for the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the poore, which
vniustly they vsurpe and prodigally they
do spend, but principally for the fals and
deceauable doctrine, which is taught and
defended by theyr fals prophetes, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
freers, and other such venemous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custes.
Which thing if with single eyes
ye do (preferring goddes glorie and the
saluation of your brethren to all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
commoditie) then shall the same God,
who solemnely doth pronounce to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
those, that do honour hym, power
his benedictions plentifully vpon you,
he shall be your buckler, protection and
captayne, and shall represse by his stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngth
and wisdome, whatsoeuer Satan by
his suppostes shall imagine against you.
<pb facs="tcp:7080:45"/>
I am not ignorant, that great troubles
shall ensue your enterprise. For Satan
will not be expelled from the possession
of his vsurped kingdome without resistan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.
But if you, as is said, preferring god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
glorie to your own liues, vnfeaned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seke and studie to obey his blessed
will, then shall your deliuerance be such,
as euidently it shall be knowen, that the
angels of the eternall do watche, make
warr, and feght for those, that vnfeyned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear the Lorde. But if you refuse this
my most reasonable and iust petition,
what defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that euer you appeare to haue
before men, then shall God (whome in
me you contemne) refuse you. He shall
pourefurthe contempt vpon you,<note place="margin">Deu. 28.</note> and
vpon your posteritie after you.<note place="margin">Leuit. 26.</note> The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of boldnes and wisdome shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from you, your ennemies shall reign,
and you shall die in bondage, yea God
shall cutt doune the vnfrutefull trees,
when they do appeare most beautifully
to florish,<note place="margin">Esa. 27. &amp; 30.</note> and shall so burn the roote, that
after of you shall neither twigge, nor
branch againe spring to glorie. Hereof
I nede not to adduce vnto you examples
from the former ages, and auncient hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.
For your brethren the nobilitie
of England are a mirrour and glasse, in
the which ye may beholde goddes iust

punishment. For as they haue refused him,
and his Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gil, which ones in mouth they
did professe, so hath he refused them, and
hath taken from them the spirit of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
boldenes, and of counsil. They see
and fele theyr owne miserie, and yet they
haue no grace to auoid it. They hate the
bondage of strangers, the pride of pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
and the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>striferous empire of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet are they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
their neckes to the yock of the Deuill,
to obey what soeuer the proude Spaniards,
and wicked Iesabel list to commaund, and
finally to stand like slaues with capp in
hand till the seruantes of Satan the shauen
sort call them to counsil. This frute do
they reape a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gather of their former rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and vnfaithfulnes towardes God.
They are left co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused in their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils.

haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. The same plages shall fall
vpon you, be you assured, if ye refuse the

haue deceaued: that I be not condemned

admitt the one and the other, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in all matters debateable, three thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(which iustly can not be denied)
being granted vnto me. First, that the most
auncient Councils nighest to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, in which the learned and
godlie fathers did examine all matters
by goddes word, may be holden of most
auctoritie. Secondarely, that no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Councils nor man be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the plaine veritie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
word, nor against the determination
of those foure chefe Councils, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7080:47"/>
hath bene and is holden by them
equal with the auctoritie of the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes.
And last, that to no doctour be
geuen greater auctoritie, then Augustine
requireth to be geuen to his writinges:<note place="margin">In prologo Retract.</note>
to witt, if he plainely proue not his
affirmation by Gods infallible worde,
that then his sentence be reiected and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the errour of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. These thinges
graunted and admitted, I shall no more re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuse
the testimonies of Councils and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
then shall my aduersaries. But and
if they will iustifie those Councils, which
mentaine theyr pride, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vsurped auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and will reiect those, which plainly
haue condemned all such tyrannie, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and wicked life, as byshoppes now
do vse: and if further they will snatche a
doubtfull sentence of a doctour, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
his mynd, when he speaketh plainly,
then will I say, that all man is a lyer, that
credit oght not to be geuen to an vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
witnes, and that no Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cils oght to
preuaile, nor be admitted against the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which God hath pronounced. And
thus, my Lordes, in few wordes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude
I haue offred vnto you a triall of mie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie:
I haue declared vnto you, what

thinges if ye refuse, defending tyrantes in

<pb facs="tcp:7080:49"/>
amongest you is this day defended by fier

most assuredly persuaded, that, what soeuer
is vsed in the papistical Churche is al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
repugning to Christes blessed ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,

because that long silence of goddes worde
hath begotten ignorance almost in al sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

conuersation. Here I know, that it
shalbe obiected, that I require of you a
thing most vnreasonable. To witt, that ye
should call your religion in doubt, which
hath bene approued and established by so
long continuance, and by the consent of so
manie men before you.<note place="margin">Answer to an obie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction.</note> But I shortly ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that neither is the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g processe of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
neither yet the multitude of men a suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
approbation,<note place="margin">Lactanti.</note> which God will alow
for our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Firmian.</note> For as somme of the most
aunncient writers do witnesse,<note place="margin">Tertulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> neither can
long processe of tyme iustifie an errour,<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note>
neither can the multitude of such, as folow
it, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the nature of the same. But if it
was an errour in the begynnyng, so is it in
the end, and the longer that it be folowed,
and the mo that do receaue it, it is the
more pestilent, and more to be auoided.
For if antiquitie or multitude of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could
iustifie any religion, then was the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of the Gentiles, and now is the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Turkes good religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
antiquitie approued the one, and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
hath receaued and doth defende
the other. But otherwise to answer, godlie
men may wonder, from what fontaine
such a sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth flow, that no man oght
to trie his faith and religion by goddes
worde, but that he safely may beleue and
folow euerie thing, which antiquitie
<pb facs="tcp:7080:50"/>
and a multitude haue approued. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God doth otherwise teach vs.<note place="margin">Iohn 5. &amp; 7.</note> For
the wisdone of God Christ Iesus hym sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
remitted his aduersaries to Moses, and
the scriptures, to trie by them, whether his
doctrine was of God or not. The Apostles
Paule and Peter commaunde men to trie
the religion,<note place="margin">Actes 17.</note> which they professe, by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
plaine scriptures,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> and do praise men
for so doing.<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.</note> S. Iohn straytly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that we beleue not euerie spirit, but
willeth vs to trie the spirits, whether they
be of God or not. Now seyng that these
euident testimonies of the holie Ghoste
will vs to trie our faith and religion by
the plaine worde of God, wonder it is, that
the papistes will not be content, that theyr
religion and doctrine comme vnder the
triall of the same. If this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ
be true (as it is most true, seing it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
from the veritie it self) who so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
doeth, hateth the light,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> neither will he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to the light lest that his euill workes
be manifested and rebuked, then do our
papistes by their own sentence condemne
them selues and theyr religion. For in so
far as they refuse examination and trial,
they declare, that they know somme fault,
which the light will vtter: which is a cause
of theyr feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d why they claime to that
priuiledge, that no man dispute of theyr
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7080:50"/>
religion. The veritie and trueth, being of
the nature of fyne purified gold,<note place="margin">why Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes will not dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of the ground of theyr religion.</note> doth not
fear the trial of the fornace, but the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and chaf of mannes inuentions (such
is theyr religion) may not abyde the
flame of the fier. True it is, that Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
pronounced this sentence, that no
man should in paine of death dispute or
reason of the grounde of his religion.<note place="margin">Mahomet and the Pope do agree.</note>
Which law to this day by the art of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is

mortal blindnes and horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
of Christ Iesus, and of his true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And from Mahomet (or rather from
Satan father of all lies) hath the Pope
and his rabble learned this former lesson.
To witt, that theyr religion should not be
disputed vpon, but what the fathers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
beleued, that oght and must the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
approue. And in so diuising Satan lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
not his foresight. For no one thing
hath more established the kingdome of
that Romane Antichrist, then this most
wicked decrie. To witt, that no man was
permitted to reason of his power, or to call
his lawes in doubt. This thing is most assu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
that whensoeuer the papisticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
shall comme to examination, it
shalbe founde to haue no other grounde,
then hath the religion of Mahomet. To
witt mannes inuention, deuise and drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb facs="tcp:7080:51"/>
ouershadowed with somme colour of
goddes worde. And therefore Brethren
seing that the religion is, as the stomake
to the bodie, which, if it be corrupted, doth
infect the hole membres, it is necessarie
that the same be examined, and if it be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde
replenished with pestilent humors
(I mean with the fantasies of men) then of

your bodies and soules perishe for euer.<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>

betwixt the rulers and the commune peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the regiment and administration of

the seruante, but all are one in him, so is
there but one way and meanes to attaine
to the participation of his benefites and
spirituall graces, which is a liuelie faith
wurking by charitie. And therefore I say
that it doth no lesse appertaine to you,
beloued Brethren, to be assured that your
faith and religion be grounded and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
vpon the true and vndoubted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

For as your bodies can not escape cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral
death, if with your princes ye eat
or drink deadlie poison (althoghe it be by

escape the death euerlasting, if with them
ye professe a corrupt religion. Yea except
<pb facs="tcp:7080:52"/>
in heart ye beleue, and with mouth ye con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse
the Lord Iesus to be the onlie Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

as the iust liueth by his own faith,<note place="margin">Marc. 16.</note> so doth

And as true faith is engendred, norished,
and mentained in the heartes of goddes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
by Christes Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gile truelie preached,
so is infidelitie and vnbelefe fostered by
concealing and repressing the same. And
thus if ye loke for the life euerlasting, ye
must trie if ye stand in faith, and if ye
would be assured of a true a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liuelie faith,
ye must nedes haue Christ Iesus truely

knolledge iustifie many:<note place="margin">Iohn 3. &amp; 5.</note> to wit, all
that vnfeanedly beleue in hym.</p>
            <p>Of this equalitie, and that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
no lesse of the subiect, be he neuer so
poore, then of the prince and riche man in
matters of religion, he hath geuen an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
declaration in the law of Moses. For
when the tabernacle was buy lded, erected,
and set in order, God did prouide, how it,
and the thinges appertaining to the same,
should be sustained, so that they should
not fall in decay. And this prouision (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d earth obey his empire) would
he not take from the secrete and hid treasu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res,
which lie dispersed i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vaines of the
earthe,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> neither yet would he take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
riche and potent of his people, but he did
commaund, that euerie man of the sonnes
of Israel (were he rich or were he poore)
that came in compt from twentie yeares
and vpward, should yearely pay half a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
for an oblation to the Lorde in the
remembrance of their redemption, and
for an expiation or clensing to their sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
which money God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded should
be bestowed vpon the ornamentes and
<pb facs="tcp:7080:53"/>
necessaries of the tabernacle of testimonie.
He furthermore added a precept, that the
riche should giue no more for that vse,
and in that behalf, then should the poore,
neither yet that the poore should giue any
lesse, then should the riche in that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
This law to mannes reason and
iudgement may appear verie vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For somme riche man might haue
geuen a thousand sicles with lesse hurt of
his substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me poore man might
haue payed the half sicle. And yet God
maketh all equall, and will that the one
shall pay no more then the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the poore any lesse then the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.
This law I say may appeare verie
vnequall. But if the cause, which God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
be obserued, we shall fynde in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the great mercie and inestimable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God to appear, which cause is ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pressed
in these wordes,</p>
            <p>This money receaued from the
children of Israel thou shalt geue
in the seruice of the tabernacle,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note>
that it may be to the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rael
for a remembrance before the
Lord, that he may be mercifull to
your soules.</p>
            <p>This cause, I say, doth euidently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7080:53"/>
that as the hole multitude was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the bondage of Egypt by the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghtie
power of God alone, so was euerie
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of the same without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified by his grace, the riche in that
behalf nothing preferred to the poorest.
For by no merit, nor worthynes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
he moued to chose, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to establishe his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
and dwellinge amongest them.
But their felicitie, prerogatiue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d honour,
which they had aboue all other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceded
only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fontaine of his eternal
goodnes, who loued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freely, as that he
freely had chosen them to be his preestlie
kingdome a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d holie people from all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of the earth.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> Thus to honour them, that he
would dwell in the middest of them, he
neither was moued (I say) by the wisdome
of the wise, by the riches of the potent, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
yet by the vertue and holynes of any
estate amongest them, but of mere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
did he loue them, and with his presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
did he honour that hole people, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
to paynt owt the same his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune
loue to the hole multitude, and to cutt

from the riche, then from the poore, for
the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that his tabernacle, by
the which was represented his presence,
and habitation amongest them. Yf the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:7080:54"/>
had bene preferred to the poore,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sented in the taber nacle.</note> then
as the one should haue bene puffed vp with
pride, as that he had bene more acceptable
to God by reason of his greater gift, so
should the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of the other haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
troubled and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, thinking that his
pouertie was an impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he could
not stand in so perfecte fauour with God,
as did the other, because he was not able to
geue somuch, as did the rich, to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of his tabernacle. But he, who of
mercie (as said is) did chose his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongest them, and also that best
knoweth, what lieth within man, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
the remedie for the one, and for the
other, making them equal in that behalfe,
who in other thinges were most vnequal.
Yf the poore should haue founde hym
selfe greued by reason of that taxe, and
that asmuch was imposed vpon hym, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the riche, yet had he no small cause of
ioy, that God him selfe would please to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare
hym, and to make hym equal in the
mentena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his tabernacle to the most ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che

was commaunded by God for mentena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of that transitorie tabernacle, which was
but a shadoe of a better to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> is not the

            <p>And for that purpose, and for the more as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>surance
of his promisse he hath erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
vs here in earthe the signes of his
owne presence with vs, his spiritual ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
the true preaching of his worde,
and right administration of his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
To the mentenance whereof is
no lesse bounde the subiect,<note place="margin">The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual taber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacle and signes of Christes presence with vs.</note> then the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
the poore, then the riche. For as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for mannes rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption,
is one, so requireth God of all, that shalbe
partakers of the benefites of the same, a
like duetie, which is a plaine confession,
that by Christ Iesus alone we haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
what soeuer was lost in Adam. Of
the prince doth God require, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
hym selfe, and that he folow Christ
Iesus: of the subiect he requireth the same.
Of the kinges and iudges it is required,
that they kysse the sonne, that is, giue
honour, subiection, and obedience to hym.
And from such reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth not God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
the subiect, that shalbe saued. And
<pb facs="tcp:7080:55"/>
this is that aequalitie, which is betwixt the
kinges and subiectes, the most riche or
noble, and betwixt the poorest, and men
of lowest estate: to wit, that as the one is
oblished to beleue in heart, and with
mouth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the Lord Iesus to be the
onlie sauiour of the world, so also is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Neither is there anie of goddes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(who hath attained to the yeares of dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cretion)
so poore, but that he hath thus
much to bestow vpon the ornamentes,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and
maintenance of their spiritual tabernacle,
when necessitie requireth: neither yet is
there anie so riche, of whose hande God
requireth any more. For albeit that Dauid
gathered greate substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the buylding
of the temple:<note place="margin">1 Par. 29.</note> that Salomon with earnest

and Iosias purged the religion,<note place="margin">2. Para. 29. 30. &amp; 35.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was corrupted, yet to them was God
no further dettour in that respect, then
he was to the most simple of the faithfull
posteritie of faithfull Abraham. For theyr
diligence, zeal, and workes gaue rather
testimonie and confession before men,
what honour they did bear to God, what
loue to his worde, and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
then that any worke proceading from
them did either establishe, or yet encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
goddes fauoure towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7080:55"/>
did loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ his sonne before
the foundation of the world was laied. So
that these forenamed by theyr notable
workes gaue testimonie of theyr vnfained
faith, and the same doth the poorest, that
vnfeanedly and openly professeth Christ
Iesus, that doth embrase his gladtydinges
offred, that doth abhorre superstition, and
flie from idolatrie. The poorest; I say,
and most simple, that this day in earth in
the daies of this cruel persecution fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
beleueth in Christ, and boldly doth
confesse hym before this wicked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is no lesse acceptable before God,
neither is iudged in his presence to haue
done any lesse in promoting Christ his
cause, then is the king, that by the swor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

God, wrooteth owt idolatrie, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth

that the care and reformation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

vnto you our labours faithfully to instruct

of Antichrist (I mean by the pope, and by

back from God, and from his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Christ

shall drink the cupp of his vengeance, so
many I mean as shall contemne and dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
this louing calling of your heauenlie
father. It wil not excuse you (dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)

will it auaile you in the day of his visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to say, We were but simple subiects,

of our rulers, Byshoppes, and clergie:
we called for reformation, and wished for
the same, but Lords brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were Byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
theyr sonnes were abbottes, and the
frendes of greate men had the possession
of the Churche, and so were we compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to giue obedience to all, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.
These vaine excuses, I say, will
nothing auaile you in the presence of
God, who requireth no lesse of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
then of the rulers, that they decline
from euil, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that they do good, that they
abstaine from idolatrie, superstition, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
murther and other such horrible

earth at that tyme did perishe, (Noah and
his familie reserued) that none escaped in
Sodom and in the other cities adiacent,
except Lot and his two daughters. And
euident it is, that in that famous citie Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
in that last and horrible destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the same none escaped goddes
vengeance, except so many as before were
dispersed. And what is the cause of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie,
seing that all were not a like offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders?
Let fleshe cease to dispute with God;
and let all man by these examples learne
betymes to flie and auoid the societie and
compagnie of the proude contemners
of God, if that they list not to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of theyr plages. The cause is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
if we can be subiect without grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

them selues are most holie and iust. For in
the original world none was founde, that
either did resist tyrannie and oppression,
that vniuersally was vsed, either yet that
earnestly reprehended the same. In So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7080:59"/>
was none founde, that did against a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that furious and beastlie multitude, that
did compasse about and besiege the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of Lot. None would beleue Lot, that the
citie should be destroyed. And finally in
Ierusalem was none found, that studied to
represse the tyrannie of the Preestes, who
were coniured against Christ and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangil,
but all fainted, (I except euer
such, as gaue witnesse with theyr blood,
or theyr flying, that such impietie displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them) all kept silence, by the which all
approued iniquitie, and ioyned ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with
the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and so were all arrayed and set,
as it had bene in one battayle against the
omnipotent, and against his sonne Christ
Iesus. For whosoeuer gathereth not with
Christ in the day of his haruest, is iudged

Lo the way in few wordes, O Britanie, to
winne goddes fauour, and therefore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
thyne ennemies. But to prynt
this more deeply into your heartes, o ye
<pb facs="tcp:7080:63"/>
princes and people of that Iland, whome
God hath bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to punishe, seke I warne
you no shifting holes to excuse your faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
no political practises to resist goddes
vengeance. And first I speak to you (ô Ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers
and Princes of both the realmes) repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
your treason, and bewaile your vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.
For by no other meanes can you es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
goddes iudgementes. You stomack I
know to be called traitours, but what shall
it auaile to spare the name, where the facts
are more then euident. You hath God ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end that
by your wisdome and godlie regiment
your subiectes should be kept aswell from
domestical oppression, as from bondage
and slauerie of strangers. But ye alas decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
from God are made the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
to betray and sell the libertie of those, for
whome ye oght to haue spent your liues.
For your consent and assistance is the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that strangers now oppresse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deuoure
the poore within your realmes: who short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if God call you not to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, shall
recompence you, as ye haue deserued. For
the cupp, which your brethren do now
drink, shall be put in your handes, and you
shall drink the dreggs of yt to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der it is if ye be beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me
so foolishe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so blynd, that ye think your
selues able long to continue, and to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
when your brethren rounde about you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7080:63"/>
shall perishe: that you can pack your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
well enough with the princes, that
ye can make you stronge with mariages,
with flateries, and other fonde practises,
or that with your multitude or strengthe
ye can escape the daies of vengeance, or
that you can hide your selues in holes or
corners. Nay thoghe you should hyde you
in the hels, God can drawe you thence, if
you had the egles wynges to flie beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
the east seas, you cannot auoid goddes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Submitt your selues therefore vnto
hym, which holdeth your breath in your
nostrels, who with one blast of his mouth
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> destroy all his ennemies. Embrase his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
Christ, lest ye perishe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for your obsti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacie
agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st hym a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his worde repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes,
as we all do admonishe. Repent for
your crueltie against his seruants and the
contempt of his worde so plainely offred,
as it was neuer sence the begynnyng of the
world. Repent we cry repent. For repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is the onlie way of your redresse and
deliuerance. Did God euer longe spare
any people, whome he hath taught by his
Prophetes, without somme euident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
or vseth any father to pardon
his childe, whome he hathe begonne to
chastice, without somme token of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Consider how the Lord hath intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Israel and Iuda his owne people: how
oft they trespassed, and how he gaue them
<pb facs="tcp:7080:64"/>
ower into the hand of their ennemies. But
whensoeuer they repented and turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to God vnfeanedly, he sent them
iudges and deliuerers, kinges a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Sauiours.
This way then of repentance and vnfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
turning to God by obedience is the
onlie way before God accepted and alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.
Therefore was Noah sent to the old
world to bring this doctrine of repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
and all the old prophetes, as Elias, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus,
Esaias, Ieremias and Malachias, and
he, who excelled all the prophetes, Iohn
Baptist. Any of whose stiles, and sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
of synners if I should now vse, it
would be thoght full strange and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would be suffered: yet were any of their
lessons, wherebie they called to repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
most mete for our tyme and age, and no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thinge
disagreinge from this my present
purpose. For the same spirit still striueth
against the malice of our tymes, thoghe in
diuerse instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and sundrie sortes and
fashions. Noah pronounceth, that within
an hundreth and twentie yeares all fleshe
should be destroyed. We haue many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haes,
that so crieth in our tymes, yet no
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth. All the tyme, that Noah was
preparing for the arke to auoide goddes
vengeance, the multitude derided this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
prophete, as the multitude of you two
realmes doth at this day deride all them,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7080:64"/>
that by obedience to goddes worde seke
the meanes appointed to auoid gods iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes.
Then the people would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but as they should liue for euer, they
maried, they banketed, they builded, they
planted, deriding gods messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Do not
you the like? I appeale to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
You marie, but not in God, but to
betray your countries, you ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ket and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
with the blood of the poore.</p>
            <p>The Lorde calleth to fasting
(saieth the prophete Esaie) to mortifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues, and to kill their lustes, but they
kill shepe and bullockes. Ieremie
crieth for teares and lamentation, they
laughe and mock. Malachie crieth to the
people of his tyme, Turne vnto me a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
I will turne to you, saieth the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of hostes, and they proudly answer,
wherein shall we returne? Are ye not
suche? Do not ye aske wherein shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
when ye will not know your sinnes?
when ye can not confesse, nor acknolledge
your faultes, thoghe ye go a hooringe in
euerie street, towne and village with your
idols? thoghe the blood of the oppressed
crie euerie where against you for vengean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce?
So that seyng no token of repentance I
can not crie vnto you with Iohn Baptist,
Qye generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vipers who hath
<pb facs="tcp:7080:65"/>
taught you to flie from the wrathe
to comme?</p>
            <p>O that I might see so good tokens, that
ye would fear goddes wrathe and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
But this must I say to you bothe to
your confusion, and shame, that ye are such
vipers and serpentes, vntil I see better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens.
You do what ye can to destroy your
parentes, you cast of God your heauenlie
father, ye will not fear hym calling you to
repentance, you destroy and banishe your
spiritual fathers, which once had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you as spiritual children by the worde
of trueth, you consume your countree,
which hath geuen you corporal life, you
sti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge with tounges a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tayles all, that would
draw you from your wickednes. Finally
man, woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and childe are either venemed
with your poysons or stingged with your
tayles. In you are fulfilled the wordes of
Dauid.</p>
            <p>Their throte is an open sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
with theyr tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges they haue
deceiued, the poyson of aspis is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their lippes, their mouthes are
full of curse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bitternes, their fete
are swift to shedd blood, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and wretchednes are in their
wayes, and the way of peace they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7080:65"/>
haue not knowen, the feare of God
is not before there eyes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do know your tendre eares, you can
not be grated with such sharpe sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of
conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, that thus prick you to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts:
howbeit thus it behoueth, that ye be
taught to iudge your selues, that in the end
ye be not da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with the wicked world. But
I will wounde you no more with the words
of the Prophetes, with the sayinges of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
or of this holy sainct of God Iohn the
Baptist, but with our sauiour Christs two
most swete parables of the two sonnes and
of the tilme, to whome he set his vineyard,
I will labour to set before your eyes your
rebellion, hypocrisie, and crueltie, if so I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
bring any of you to repentance. Our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christe putteth furth this parable,</p>
            <p>A certaine man had two sonnes,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he came to the first, and said so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
go a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worke to day in my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.
Who answered, I will not, but
afterward repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and went. Then
came he to the second, and said li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise,
and he answered, I will syr,
but went not.</p>
            <p>Wherein a wonderful comforte first is
to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, how the Lord our God ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ker
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d earth doth hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble him selfe
<pb facs="tcp:7080:66"/>
not only to be called a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d man, a
housholder, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such like, but he abaseth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
of mercie to vs vile earth and asshes,
that his sonne becometh ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
glorious in his sight, to make all tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se,
that do not refuse his grace offred, of the
slaues of Satan his sonnes by adoption.
You are his sonnes, you are his vineyard,
you are as dear vnto hym, as the apple of
his eye, as Moses speaketh, if you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
it: he sweareth that you shall be his
inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and he will be yours, if ye will
only receiue his grace and beleue hym,
when he sweareth. Will ye call his trueth
into doubt? his glorie into shame by your
misbelefe? Better it were, that all creatures
should perish, heauen, man and angels,
then that God should not haue credit, or
that his glorie in the least iote should be
diminished. He hath called you by his
worde now many a tyme to worke in his
vineyard, I aske what you haue answered:
your conscience can witnesse and all the
world seeth it. So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of you haue said plai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
lyke rebellious childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ye would
not do it, that ye would not worke in your
fathers vineyarde. Shall I applie this part
to Scotland? I may right well do it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to a greate parte in England. But Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in dede called most plainely and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
through the mercies of God both
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7080:66"/>
by their own faithfull countrie men, and
also by earnest trauail of our English na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to comme to the Lords vineyard in
the tyme of king Edward, hath to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually refused, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science
of many this day beareth witnesse.
That tyme, as ye know, the vineyarde in
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the children of God was not all
togither neglected, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most earnestly
were ye (O Brethren of Scotland) required
to ioyne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des with vs i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lords worke,
but Satan alas would not suffer it. His old
fostred malice, and Antichrist his sonne
could not abyde, that Christ should grow
so strong by ioynynge that ile togither in
perfect religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whome God hath so many
waies coupled a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthended by his worke
in nature: the papistes practised all theyr
fyne craftes in England, Scotland, and in
France, that the Ghospellers should not
with so strong walles be defensed, lest this
one iland should beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me a safe sanctuarie,
as it began to be, to all the persecuted in
all places. They moue sturdie stomackes,
they dispens with periuries, they worke by
theyr craftie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessions, they raise vp war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in the end, whereby ye (deare Brethren
of Scotland) were sore plaged. Of all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
traiterouse sleghtes ye can not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
For yet it is not passed the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of man, that your king made promisse
<pb facs="tcp:7080:67"/>
to haue mett king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rie the eght att Yorke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whose purpose (albeit in other things I do
not alow him) in that case was most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and praise worthie. For it was to make
an end of that vngodlie warre, and cruell
murther, which lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued betwixt
the two realms. Your king, I say, made pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>misse
to mete him: the breche whereof as
it was the occasion of much trouble, so is
it euidently knowen, that your Cardinal,
and his clergie laboured and procured the
same. For it is not vnknowen to somme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
you, how many thousand crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
the churchmen did promisse for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the warre,<note place="margin">I suppose they pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed litle.</note> which king Henrie
did denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the reason of that breche.
Superfluous it were to me, to recite all the
causes mouing your pestilent preestes to
solicitat your king to that infidelitie. But
this is moste euident, that they feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the fall of their glorie, and the
trouble of their kingdome, which then in
England beganne to be shaken by suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the abbaies. This moued your pree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
ernestly to labour, that your kinge
should falsly breake his promisse. But
what affliction ye sustained by that and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their practises, your selues can witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
For your borderrs were destroyed, your
nobilitie for the most parte were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and your king for sorowe sodenly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7080:67"/>
died. But these your miseries did nothing
moue your preestes to repentance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did inflame them against God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the ꝓpfit of their natiue realme. For
when againe after the death of your ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship and fauours were soght, first
by king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rie, and after his death by king
Edward his sonne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by him, who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
chosen Protectour, how craftely, I say, did
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your preestes vndermine all, ye are not
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. When your Gouernoure with the
consent of the most part of the nobilitie
had sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nely sworne i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abbay of Haliro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ode
house, syr Raphe Sadler the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to perfurm the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted betwixt king Edward and
your yonge quene, and faithfully to stand
to euerie point co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded and agreed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
perfurma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when seales were
interchanged, and the embassadour dimis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
what sturr, tumult, and sedition raised
your Cardinal in that your realme, it is
not vnknowen. To witt, how that by his
craft and malice the realme was deuided,
the Gouernour compelled to seke his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
to violate his oth, and so to becomme
i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>famous for euer. And finally by the pride
of the papistes was that leage broken. But
what did thereof ensue? Edinburgh, Leith,
Du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die, yea the most part of the realme did
fele. Your shippes were stayed, your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:7080:68"/>
were lost, your chefe townes were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and at the end the beautie of your real
me did fall in the edge of the sworde, the
hand of God manifestly feghting against
you, because against your solemne oth ye
did feght against them, who soght your
fauours by that godlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction, which
before was promised. But still proceaded
your ennemies the clergie, and theire ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
in theyr purposed malice. Wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der
not that I terme them your ennemies. For
albeit they be your countrie men, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they seke nothing more, then the
mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their owne ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gdome, which
is the power of darckns, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the king dome
of Antichrist, they are becomme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iured
ennemies to euerie citie, nation or man,
that labour to comme to the knolledge of
the trueth. That pestilent generation, I
say, did not cease, till they obteined their
purpose, by deliueringe your yonge que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to the handes of the French king, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
mindinge by that meanes to cutt for
euer the knot of the frendship, that might
haue ensued betwixte England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
by that godlie coniunction. What
the papistes feared is manifest. For then
Christe Iesus being more purely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in England, then at any tyme before,
would shortly haue suppressed their pride
and vaine glorie: and therefore they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7080:68"/>
that he should not reigne aboue them
also. But what is like to apprehend you, for
because ye did not betymes withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their
most wicked cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sils, wise men do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider.
How heauie and vnpleasant shall the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and yock of a Frenchman be to your
shoulders a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d necks, God graunt that expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rience
do not teach you. But to returne to
my former purpose, by all those means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed,
by his messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, by the blood of
his saincts shed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest you, by fauours a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
frendship, by warre and the sword, yea by
famin, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all other mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hath
God your mercifull father called you to
labour in his vineyard, but to this day, alas,
we heare not of your hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble obedience, but
stil ye say with stubburn faces, we will not
labour, we will not be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to such thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to abide the burthens of the viney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.
Ye think percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I am to sharpe, and
that I accuse you more then you deserue.
For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest you many do know the will
of your father, and many make profession
of his Ghospel, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it
is not enoug he to know the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and to ꝓfesse the same in mouthe, but it is
necessarie, that ye refuse your selues, your
owne pleasures, appetites, and your owne
wisdome, if ye shall be iudged faithfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
in the Lordes vineyard, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ye
beare the burthens togiter with your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb facs="tcp:7080:69"/>
and suffre heate, and sweate, before
ye taste the frutes with them. God will
not stand content, that ye loke ouer the
hedge, and beholde the labours of your
brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he requireth, that ye put your
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des also to your labours, that ye trauail
continually to pluck vpp all vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
wedes, albeit in so doing the thornes
pricke you to the hard bones: that ye as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theyr labours, thoghe
it be with the icopardie of your lifes, the
losse of your substance, and displeasure of
the hole earthe. Except that thus ye be
minded to labour, the Lord of the viney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde
wil not acknolledge you for his faith
full seruantes. And because this matter is
of weight and greate importance, I will
speake so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what more plainely for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
It is bruted (to the greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of all godlie, that heare it) that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of you (deare Brethren of Scotland)
do desire Christ Iesus to be faithfully prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest you, which thing if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
heart you desyre and with godlie wisdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and stowt courrage folow your purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
and enterprise, ye shall be blessed of the
Lord for euer. But in the begynnyng ye
must beware that ye folow not the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
of your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in whose han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
albeit the worke of the Lord appeared
to prosper for a time, yet because the eye
was not single, we see to our grief the ouer
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7080:69"/>
throw of the same. They began to plante
Christ Iesus in the heartes of the people,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nish that Romish Antichrist, they
did driue owt the fylthie swyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr
dennes and holes (I mean the monkes and
other such papisticall vermin from their
cloisters a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d abbayes). This was a good be
ginning, but alas in the one and the other
there was great faulte. For the banishi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of
that Romish Antichrist was rather by the
feare of the lawes pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced against him
by actes of parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the liuelie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
of Christ Iesus, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the discoueri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
of his abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And the suppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the abbaies did rather smell of auarice, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Those venemous locustes,
which before were holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within their cloi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters,
were then set abrode to destroy all
good a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d grene herbes. For superstitious fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers,
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d idle abots were made
archbishoppes, bishoppes, persons, vicars,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such as oght to fede the soules of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who thus set at libertie did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otup
the Lords vineyard. And one crafty
Gardener, whose name was Stephen, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
wolflik co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, did mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many a wolfe,
did sow wicked seed in the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cheri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed
many weedes to deface the vineyard.
And his maid Marie, who after was his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stres,
now maried to Philip, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g no wil to
wickednes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was at the weakest norsto
<pb facs="tcp:7080:70"/>
make to do euill, when she gatt the mastrie
did cherishe many weedes. Those two I say
haue so broken the hedges of the same vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyarde,
(God so punishing the sinnes of
those, that oght to haue made better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
for the same) that the husbandmen
are hanged vp, the diggars, dressours, and
planters are banished, prisoned and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Such hauock is made, that al wilde bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
haue power to pollute the sanctuarie
of the Lorde. O heauens beholde her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
o earthe cry for vengeance, o seas,
and deserte mountains witnesses of her
wickednes, break furthe against this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of England. But whether do I runne
by the bitternes of my grefe? I must nedes
leaue the o Scotland, after that I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
the of this, that thou folow not
the example, as I haue said, of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but
in the bowels of Christ Iesus I exhorte
the, that if thou prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest any reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in religion, which is the chefe labour of
the vineyarde, that thou do it at the first
with a single eye, and all simplicitie, that
from yeare to yeare thou be not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to change, as was England, but let thy
reformation be full and plaine, according
to goddes holie will and worde without
addition. Let all the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father hath not planted, be rooted
owt at once, let not auarice blind the, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet wordlie wisdome discourage thy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7080:70"/>
hearte, let none beare the name of a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
that is knowen to be a fosterer of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or any kynde of wickednes. And
thou so doing shalt moue God of his grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
mercie to send vnto the faithfull worke
men in abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to blesse the worke, that
thou prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest in the vineyarde, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the to the glorie of his own name,
and to thy euerlasting comforte. Thus
must thou Scotland repent thy former ino<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedience, if that thou wilt be approued of
the Lord. And now do I return to the (O
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) I do liken the to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de sonne
in the parable which answered his father
with flattering wordes, saying,<q>I go father, but yet he went not
at all.</q>For sence the time, that I had any re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance,
our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie father of his gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at
mercies hath not ceased to call the in to
his vineyard, and to these late daies thou
hast said alwayes, that thou woldest enter
and be obedient. In the tyme of king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the eght, when by Tyndale, Frith, Byl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
and other his faithfull seruantes God
called Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to dresse his vineyard, many
promised full faire, whome I could name.
But what frute folowed? nothing but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grapes, yea breeres and brambles, the
wormewood of auarice, the gall of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the poiso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of filthie fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, flowing
from head to foote, the contempt of God
<pb facs="tcp:7080:71"/>
and open defense of the Cake Idol by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be red in the Churches
in the stead of goddes scriptures. Thus was
there no reformation, but a deformation
in the tyme of that tyrant and lecherous
mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster. The bore I gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te was busie wroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d digging in the earth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all his pig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
that folowed hym. But they soght on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t frutes, that they winded
with their longe snowtes. And for their
own bellies sake they wrooted vp many
weeds, but they turned the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de so, mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling good a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d badd togither,<note place="margin">Kinge Henry his boke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Luther is noted.</note> swete and so

no good thing could grow, but by great
miracle, vnder such Gardners. And no mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uail,
if it be rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered: for this bore
raged against God, against Deuill, against
Christ and against Antichrist, as the fome

alone to haue this title. Wherefore in this
pointe (o England) ye were no better then
the Romishe Antichrist, who by the same
title maketh hym selfe a God, sitteth in
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences, ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nysheth the worde of
God, as did your king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rie, whome ye so
magnifie. For in his best time nothing was
hard, but the kings booke, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the kings ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings,
the kinges homelies in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
where goddes word should onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
bene preached. So made you your ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a
God beleuing nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but that the alowed.
But how he died, I will not write for sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
I will not name how he turned to his
vomet. I will not write your other wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of those times, your murthers without
measure, adulteries and incestes of your
kinge, his Lordes, aud co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munes. It greueth
me to write those euils of my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, saue
onlie that I must nedes declare, what fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in the vineyarde after you
promised to worke therin, to moue you to
repentance, and to iustifie Godds iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how greuously so euer he shall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
you hereafter. Wherefore I desire you
to call to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance your best state vnder
king Edward, when all men with generall
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t promised to worke in the vineyarde,
and ye shall haue cause I doubte not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
your wickednes, that so conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the
<pb facs="tcp:7080:72"/>
voice of God for your owne lustes, for
your crueltie, for your couetousnes, that
the name of God was by your vanities e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
spoken of in other nations. I will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
no particulare thinges, becaus I reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
those tymes, saue only the killing
of both the kinges vncles, and the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
of Hoper for popishe garments.</p>
            <p>God graunt you all repentant heartes, for
no order nor state did any part of his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in those dayes. But to speak of the best,
whereof ye vse to boast, your religion
was but an English matyns, patched fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
of the popes portesse, many thinges
were in your great booke supersticious a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
foolishe, all were driuen to a prescripte
seruice lyke the papistes, that they should
thinke theyr dueties discharged, if the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
were said of psalmes and chapters. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
there could no discipline be broght
into the Churche, nor correction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
I will touche no further abuses, yet
willing and desiering you to consider the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in your heartes, that knowing your negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ye may bring furth frutes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For this I admonishe you (o ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England) wheresoeuer you be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
or placed, that onles ye do right spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
repent of your former negligence, it
is not the Spanyardes only, that ye haue
to feare, as roddes of goddes wrath, but all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7080:72"/>
other nations, France, Turkie, and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,
yea all creatures shall be armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you for the contempt of those ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
when your heauenlie father so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
called you. To what contempt was
goddes worde and the admonition of his
prophetes comme in all estates, before
God did stryke, somme men are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
The preachers them selues for the
most part could fynd no fault in religion,
but that the Churche was poore and lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
liuing. Trueth it is, that the abbay la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and other such reuenues, as afore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to the papistical Churche, were
most wickedly and vngodly spent, but yet
many thinges would haue bene reformed,
before that the kitching had bene better
ꝓuided for to our prelates in England. It
was moste euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that many of you vnder
the cloke of religion serued your own bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lies:
somme were so busie to heap benefice
vpon benefice, so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to labour in parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for purchesing of lands, that the tyme was
small, which coulde be founde for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of abuses, and very litle, which
was spent vpon the feeding of your floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
I nede not now to examine particular
crimes of preachers. Only I say, that the
Ghospell was so lightly estemed, that the
most part of men thoght rather, that God
should bow and obey to theyr appetites,
<pb facs="tcp:7080:73"/>
then that they should be subiect to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
commaundementes. For the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
did continew in malice, and rebellion,
in craft and subtiltie, notwithstanding all
lawes, that could be deuised for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of abuses. The merchants had their
own soules to sell for gaines, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were becomme Ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rods and Gyants,
and the nobilitie and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sile would suffer
no rebukes of Gods messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers thogh theyr
offenses were neuer so manifest. Let tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that preached in the court, the lent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
king Edward deceased, speak theyr
conscience, and accuse me, if I lie, yea let
a writing written by that miserable man,
then duke of Northumberland to master
Harlow for that time Byshoppe of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
be broght to lighte, and it shall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that he ashamed not to say, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of the preachers tonges would
cause the counsile and nobilitie to ryse
vppe against them: for they could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
so to be intreated. These were the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
euen in the tyme of haruest a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the winter came. And of the tyme of
Marie what should I write? England is
now so miserable, that no penne can paynt
it. It ceaseth to be in the nomber of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
because it openly dispiteth God the
father. It hath cast of the trueth knowen
and confessed, and foloweth lies and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7080:73"/>
which once it detested. It buyldeth
the buylding, which it once destroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
raiseth vp the idols, which once were the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
confounded: it murthereth the sainctes,
it mainteineth Baals prophetes by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of Iesabel. Such are the euil
husbandes, that now haunte the vineyard,
so that this is true, that our Sauiour Christ,
saieth:</p>
            <p>The Lord hym selfe hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a faire vineyard, he hedged it
round about, and buylded a tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
&amp;c. And when the tyme of the
frute drew nere, he sent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to the tilmen to receyue the
frutes thereof, but they caught
his seruantes, they bett one, they
killed an other, and stoned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Againe he sent other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
mo, and they serued them
like wise.</p>
            <p>What nede any exposition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
this vnto England? All is fulfilled,
that is spoken in that parable, onles they
do waite for the sonne hym selfe, for to
comme, that they may handle hym lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as they haue done his seruantes. But
all is one, saieth our Sauiour Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7080:74"/>That, which ye do to one of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
litle ons,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> the same ye do to me,
be it good or bad. Why doest thou per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secute
me, saieth Christ to Saul, when
he was, as he now is, at the right hand of
God his father in the heauens. Therefore
they persecute, they banishe, they burne
Christ the sonne of God in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.
The iudgement therefore now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
which the wicked then gaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them selues,</p>
            <p>That the Lord of the vineyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
will cruelly destroy those euill
persons, and will let furth his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyarde
vnto other husbandes.</p>
            <p>And the confirmation of the same by
the sentence of the chefe iudge, that</p>
            <p>The kingdome of God shall be
taken from such, and geuen to a
people, that shall bringe furth
the frutes thereof.</p>
            <p>The which iudgement is begonne in
Englande, and shortly alas will be fully
executed and finished without right spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
repentance. Somme hope is in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which hath not shewed furth any
such crueltie, and hath not contemned the
knowen treasures: but lyke wanton chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7080:74"/>
haue contemned the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of theyr father, partely of frailtie,
partely of ignorance. But Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uante,
that knew the will of his Lord and
maister, which was once lightened with
most clere beames, which hath tasted of
the swetenes of the worde of God, and of
the ioyes of the worlde to comme, which
hath abiured Antichrist, and all idolatrie,
which hath boasted to professe Christ
with greate boldnes before all the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
must be beaten with many stripes, it
can not be auoided.</p>
            <p>But to be shorte this only remaineth
for bothe these nations, that they repent
and returne into the vineyarde with the
fyrst sonne. For neither shall ignorance
excuse any land or nation, as is playn in
the fyrst to the Romanes, neither can any
people be receyued without the frutes of
repentance, as Iohn Baptist proclaimeth.</p>
            <p>The frutes of repentance I call not only
to know your synnes, and to lament them,
but to amend your liues, and to make
streght the Lordes pathes by resisting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and synne, and obeying God in doing
the workes of righteousnes, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
goddes praecepts, and iudgementes, so
longe amongest you contemned.</p>
            <p>For euen now is the axe put to<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:7080:75"/>
the roote of the tree, so that euerie
tree, that bringeth not furthe
goode frute, shalbe hewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe,
and cast into the fier. The Lord
hath now his fanne in his hande,
and will purge his flore, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gather
the wheate into his garner, but
will burne the chaffe with vnque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
fier.</p>
            <p>Repent therefore, whiles ye haue ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
before ye be fanned, hewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe and
fiered. When I do behold both your two
realmes, I see the fanne, I see the axe. But
this I am suer is the begynnyng of your
ruine, that ye do mary with strangers, and
giue your power to forraine nations, such
as feare not God, but are open idolaters,
blasphemers, persecuters of the saincts of
God, that careth neither for heauen nor
hell, God nor deuill, so that they may
wynne landes, townes and countries. God
shall hew you downe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore, as
he hath done other nations by like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and causes, and they shall fanne you
furthe of your own huskes and homes, to
make you vagaboundes and beggars, and
after possesse your landes and goods, as
God threatned by Moses, as was before
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7080:75"/>
alledged. Trust not to thy strengthe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde,
when thy ennemy is setled, if
thou haue no strengthe to resist his begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges,
no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou canst ouercome
a canker, that hath ouerrunne many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.
That God would not haue you to
truste to your force of men, townes, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels,
there is enough exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, that you bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
haue felt to your grefe. And I can not
write without murnyng. For how litle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
the multitude, and stowt courrage
of you (dear Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) att Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selburgh,
or Pinkefield, the carcases alas of
many thousands, who that day fell in the
edge of the sworde, may teach you. And
how vaine be all strengthes, (be they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
neuer so stronge, or inexpugnable)
lett Calice lately taken admonish you.</p>
            <p>But I do leaue such exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to your consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
to teache you to call to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
Lord, who offereth hym selfe, as a
mercifull father vnto you, still calling
you to repentance by wordes, by writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and most gentle corrections, if ye
will not be harde harted.</p>
            <p>Yet here haue we to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
state of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynde, which is so seduced
by the subtile serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he can not know
his miserie, when he is admonished, nor
perceaue his perdition, when it draweth
so nere. When the seruantes of God set
<pb facs="tcp:7080:76"/>
furthe his trueth, they are charged to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
realmes, and countries, as was Elias:
when they warne men not to ioyne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
with wicked kinges and princes, they
are counted traitours, as was Esaias and
Ieremias. Such is mannes malice. But
if there be a God, that is fyrst of all to be
soght, and without whome nothing can
be profitable vnto vs, but without hym all
thinges are vnhappie and accursed: if
the kingdome of God and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
thereof must fyrst be soght, and then
all thinges shall be ministred: if our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
kinge must before man be obeyed,
then all such doctrine, as calleth vs from
man to God, is easie to be perceaued, and
oght not to be resisted. Wherefore I do
admonish and exhorte you bothe in the
name of the liuinge God, that how so euer
you haue hitherto shewed your selues the
seruants of men to beare and to flatter
with the worlde, that now ye learne in
goddes cause to despise the faces of men,
to bend your selues against this wicked
world, neither regarding the visars of
honours, vaine titles nor dignities any
further, then they seke God his onelie glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie.
For his glorie will he not suffer to
be contemned for any cause. No he will
powre contempt on those princes, that
striue against his trueth: but those, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7080:76"/>
glorifie hym, will he glorifie. And what
king dome, realme or nation so euer it be,
that will not seke to sanctifie his name,
they shall in the day of goddes greuous
visitation, which is now at hand, be vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, theyr stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth shalbe straw,
theyr honours shall be shame, and all their
idolatrous preestes, in whose lies they
delyte, togither with their idols, with
whome they are bewitched, shall be stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and brymstone to burne togither, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the wrathe of the Lorde of hostes shall set
them on fier. The preestes shall not saue
theyr goddes, nor the goddes their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
but both alike accursed shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
perish for euer. And thoghe our mercifull
father hathe longe suffred heretofore in
the tyme of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet now in the ende
of the world he calleth all people so plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
by his worde to repentance, that he
must nedes take spedie vengeance, if his
callinge be contemned: especially becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the day can not longe be delayed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
he hath determined to iudge all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and nations of the whole world, and
to put an end to wickednes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to conclude, behold, your
onlie remedie remaineth to repent your
tyme of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of stubburnnes, of cruel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
of idolatrie, wherein ye haue so long
continued. And now with all diligence
<pb facs="tcp:7080:77"/>
to seke for knolledge of the worde of
God, and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to professe the Ghospell,
which is the power of God, whereof ye
oght not to be ashamed. Cease at the last
from your olde stubburnnes, wherbie ye
haue deserued vengeance, and labour in
the vineyarde with all mekenes, that ye
may receaue mercie and grace: cease from
your crueltie against Christes membres,
and learne to suffer for Christes sake, if
ye will be true Christians: banishe all ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
and popishe superstition from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
you, els can ye haue no parte in
Christes kingdome, no more then Christ
can be partaker with Antichrist. Pray to
the Lorde of hostes and armies to giue
you the courrage, strengthe, and meanes.
The Lords arme is not shortened now, no
more then of olde. Be stronge therefore in
the Lord for the defence of the trueth,
thogh all the worlde ryse agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st itt. Now
when the battaile is fierce against the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
God for dead idols, (euen for the
vile wafercake, the most vaine idol, that
euer was) against the Ghospel of Christe
for the inuentions of Antichrist, against
Christes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres for Popishe ceremonies,
can any of you, that wilbe compted gods

that haue no force to saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues:
if Christes Ghospel and doctrine be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to saluation, and by receauing of it
ye are called Christians, away with all An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichristes
inuentions broght into your Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mish

ye wyll make answere to your heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

if it be possible, yet shall ye all be confoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded.
The Lord shall plage you one with
an other, vntill you be consumed, your
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, wherein ye trust, shall be shake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to

maintaine Gods trueth in the earthe, he
<pb facs="tcp:7080:78"/>
will receaue you as his children into the

this wicked generation, Christ shall con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse
you before his father in the heauens,
in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his angels. But if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste

be suer, that in this worlde ye shall haue
