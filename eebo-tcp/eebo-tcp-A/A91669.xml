         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> REPLY <hi>to the Popular Arguments uſed for Confirming the preſent</hi> Eaſt-India Company, <hi>by</hi> Grafting <hi>upon them, with a Word or two in behalf of the</hi> New Subſcriptions.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST the Friends of the preſent <hi>Company</hi> make a great Out cry, <hi>That the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans will ſuſtain great Loſs by a Diſſolution of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> preſent</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That conſidering the Number of thoſe concerned, the Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans will be found to be very few, as appears by the Liſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Adventurers. But ſuppoſing it were true what they alledg, and that the Number were much greater, I would only ask the Adventurers, whether they think the <hi>Parliament</hi> obliged to eſtabliſh them, whether they ſhall find it practicable and reaſonable or no? But ſurely this they will not aver; if not, then their Argument will appear to have no weight, and none can have reaſon to complain, it being impoſſible to obviate, but that in ſuch great Mutations and Alterations, ſome ſeeming Hardſhips will fall on ſome or others of ſuch a Community.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, they ſay, <hi>That if they have an Act, they ſhall be able to carry on their Trade without the aid of an additional Subſcription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope they will not pretend to do it with 38000 <hi>l.</hi> which is the ballance of all their Eſtate in <hi>Europe,</hi> by their own Accounts given in to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> But I anſwer, That any Twelve Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Experience and Reputation, with the help of an <hi>Act,</hi> can do the ſame as well as their worthy ſelves. For how is this to be effected? Why, by the credit of an <hi>Act,</hi> ſay they; and that truly, they cannot fail to take up what Money they pleaſe at Intereſt: So that this their Aſſertion, although very true, is yet rather a Jeſt than an Argument that they ſhould have the Preference of ſo noble an Experiment, which any others of their Fellow-Subjects are as capable of improving to as good Purpoſes as they can themſelves.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, they give out, <hi>That a</hi> Diſſolution <hi>will be a great Hardſhip on them upon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that their Factors and Servants abroad, in ſuch a Caſe, may be apter to imbezzle and waſt their Effects, and ſo their Eſtate may come ſhorter home, than if they had the Countenance of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Sanction of an</hi> Act.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, That I have good Grounds to believe, that notwithſtanding the plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Accounts given in to the <hi>Parliament</hi> by the <hi>Company,</hi> touching their Eſtate here and in <hi>India,</hi> that if our <hi>Auguſt Senate</hi> ſhould think it worth their while to enter upon the Scrutiny of that Maze and Labyrinth of their perplext Accounts, and that it were poſſible by any human means to make a true Judgment upon them, they would appear as bold and fallacious an Impoſition as ever was offered to that <hi>grave Aſſembly.</hi> But ſuppoſing their Eſtate to be what they ſuggeſt, yet ſtill they may blame themſelves, and none elſe, that they have embroil'd and embarraſt their Affairs in ſuch a manner, as to render it ſo difficult, even to the Wiſdom of the <hi>Nation,</hi> to extricate and ſet them right again.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with replying to their Arguments, I cannot but make ſome Reflections on their Folly; that theſe few <hi>Adventurers</hi> ſhould be ſo fond, as to expect, that ſo extenſive and advantageous a Trade ſhould, by a <hi>Law,</hi> be confin'd to the narrow limits of them and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, excluſive of all other their Fellow-Subjects, which Point the Managers give out among their Friends they hope to obtain. Methinks they ſhould have patience till they can bring better Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials of their former Behaviour, or ſhew that they have been more meritorious in ſome inſtance or other in diſcharge of their Truſts, than hitherto it appears they have been, before they preſume to make ſuit for ſo <hi>Royal</hi> a Donative, as would prove the richeſt was ever granted in <hi>England</hi> to ſo few Men, ſhould they have the good fortune to gain ſo important a Point.</p>
            <p>What I have to add is in behalf of the new Subſcribers, and is this, That the Adventurers can depend upon a real Fund and Eſtate; whereas <hi>Grafting</hi> upon the old <hi>Company,</hi> although at never ſo low a value, will ſubject the new <hi>Adventurers</hi> to a poſſibility of being impoſed on, till a term of Eighteen Months or Two Years give them a clearer ſatisfaction, upon what bottom they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked their Eſtates; whereas, confirming the New Stock can be attended but with one Difficulty that I know of, and that not conſiderable, which is to determine <hi>What ſhall be that equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and valuable Conſideration to be made good to the old Company for their Forts, Cuſtoms, and other Pretenſions in</hi> India.</p>
