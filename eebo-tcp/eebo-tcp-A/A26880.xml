            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT'S known that Christ suffered between Two Malefactors, reputed by his Persecutors the greatest of the Three: One of them was penitent, and justified Christ, and reproved the other, who reproached, even dying, him that should have been taken for his only Hope. <hi>Ignatius</hi> compared the Teeth of the Lions, to the Milstones, which must grind him to be Bread for his Fathers use. The two Extreams have been at this unhappy Dividing-work, since the Christian Church began to prosper: <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Imposers on the one side, and the Self-conceited separating Sects on the other, were used by Satan to fight against Saving Truth and Love. They were foretold by <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts <hi>20.</hi> both that <hi>grievous Wolves should enter, and devour the Flocks;</hi> and that of <hi>their own selves should men arise, to speak perverse things, and draw away Disciples after them.</hi> But when Christian Power had lent one Party the Sword, or made it the Executioner of Clergy-wrath, the Church hath ever since between two Milstones, been ground to Meal. There hath indeed be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n much Differences in their dividing ways. The upper Milstone hath still been violently active: The nether Milstone thought it self innocent, because it was passive. Even before the Church-Tympanites, many score several Sects rose up, that had their several Societies, separating from the rest, on pretence of greater Orthodoxness and Piety. No two of the Contraries could be in the Right; much less all: Therefore all, or all save one, did separate for Error. But as <hi>Luther</hi> saith <hi>(De Conciliis)</hi> these Divisions were but a Play (as at Foot-ball) in comparison of the <hi>Strages,</hi> or bloudy destructive Divisions which were made by Patriarchs and Councils of advanced Prelates. If under Heathens, the <hi>Novations</hi> sprung up from a Strife, to have their Captain the great Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Donanists</hi> from a Strife, to have their Captain the great Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and so many other Sects; What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the Strife of Patriarchs, Metropolitans and Councils, when they were like great Secular Princes, did cut all the Churches into those Shred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or Schisms, which have continued it's Diseases and Reproach these <hi>1200,</hi> if not <hi>1300.</hi> years, to this day, unhealed, and unlikely to be healed; four of these Patriarchs condemning <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Fifth condemning them: As it was said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> The Under sects and Schisms have killed their thousands, and the Uppermost Patriarchal, Conciliary, Tyrannical Schisms, their ten thousands.</p>
            <p>Alas, to what a horrid degree of Pravity is Humane Nature fallen! What a scandalous Temptation give Men to the Bruitists, who prefer the Bruits, yea, the wildest before M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n? When even the Learned sort, who think themselves so fit to guide all the rest, that none is worthy to Preach Christs Gospel, who dissent from their prescribed Opinions and Ceremonies, are yet unable after <hi>1200.</hi> years experience of the Churches, to understand that the terms and ways which have hitherto distracted and torn them, and to this day made them the scorn of the Infidels, and like the Sherds of a broken Pot, are not the only ways and terms of Catholick Union and Communion; which, if any deny, he is unworthy to live in Christian Society. Lord! is there no hope, that the World, at least the Learned part, may be healed of this self-laceration and distraction. If there be no Love and Peace but in Heaven, and with the few that the World abhorreth, O cause us all that are fervent Lovers of Love and Peace, to be more weaned from this earthly Nest of Wasps, and to love and long for the World where Love and Peace are perfected.</p>
            <p>I have seen Canons which have <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicated Men (how wise, how holy, how useful, and how many soever) that do but affirm any things in their Church-Offices, Liturgies, Words and Ceremonies, to be at all repugnant to the Word of God; and at once oblige Men to subscribe to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, That not only they, but General Councils are fallible. So that I stand amazed to think what Spirit made such Canons, and what such Men thought of themselves, and of Humane Nature, and of the History of all former Ages of the Churches. If they must be acknowledged fallible, and yet all cut off from Christ or from the Church, who say they have any Error, so much as in the said Offices, Forms, Words or Ceremonies, sure they suppose that some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouus Power so wonderfully over-ruled fallible Men, and therefore should shew us miracles to convince us. For my part, I am far from believing, that I am so secured from Error; and therefore only say, Tho I be an unfit Iudge of my Superiors Acts, I would not for all the Riches on Earth, be charged at Gods judgment with the guilt of making and justifying such Canons; much less, with all the Consequents of their Executions.</p>
            <p>And because I am unwilling to be guilty of any dividing-errors on the other side, I have here impartially confuted them; telling those that would not have the Authors, or their former Actions so much remembred and blamed as I have done, That God is against their carnal Policies; and that it neither hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered, nor will do: And that when Men justifie Sin, or lay it upon God,
<pb facs="tcp:59354:3"/>
he will with disdain cast it back upon them. As I thank God, who kept the main Body of the Religious Persons innocent, from the crimes of a few tumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Sectarian Soldiers, who by advantage subdued all the rest, (tho Malignity would ruine them by a false Accusation of such a Guilt), so I will not so much as by Silence, encourage that false Malignant Accusation, nor leave the sober godly People of the Land, under the intimated Suppositions, That they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Subversion of Civil or Ecclesiastical Order and Governmenment, when they were trod down, and suffered for their Dissent.</p>
            <p>But in all Ages and Nations, the Churches that were under the grinding Dividers, have laid more of the blame on the upper Milstone than on the lower; Action and Violence making their Part more notable; bearing more easily the censures and words of such as think <hi>Losers may have leave to talk,</hi> than the Stings, Swords and Flames of the elder Sons of <hi>Abaddon Apollyon.</hi> And indeed, in all Ages, the lower Party have been less averse to Peace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; but whoever have got uppermost into uncontroulable Clergy-Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, have usually disdained and abhorred the Peace-makers. It was King <hi>James</hi> his wisdom to make <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> his Motto; and the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Counsels that are contrary to it, will prove pernicious folly at last. But we have a greater Doctor and Exemplar, even our Saviour and final Iudge, who (while some repraoch such, and talk and write to bring men from Love, to hate each other), hath said, what in despight of malice he will make good <hi>[Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> Matth. <hi>5.9].</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>DID not the Thoughts of a better promised World, afford me Comfort and Relief, the Thoughts of the Case of this so much forsaken Earth, would break my Heart, my Faith and Hope: To see so much of Earth yet Unchristian, and so few of the Christian Nations either in Knowledge, Love or Holiness, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering their Holy Profession, but damning one another, and more themselves: And to see how great a hand the Clergy of almost all Churches, have in this, by notorious, implacable Contention; and to see how little hope there is of a Remedy. If Princes and Patrons chuse Wise, Holy, Peaceable Men in <hi>England,</hi> will they do so in <hi>France, Flanders, Spain,</hi> and other Popish Lands? And either there they will expect the same Royal Power; make the Pope and his Agents the Electors, which is worse. And with such, the Love of <hi>Money, Vain-glory,</hi> and <hi>Self-opinion, Worldliness, Pride,</hi> and Ignorant <hi>Error,</hi> will keep up Envy, Strife and Persecution, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and every Evil Work.</p>
            <p>O how sad is the Case of the Laity, that must hear Men pretending to great Learning and Authority, with raging Confidence damning the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Persons of each others, and calling to Princes to destroy those that they cannot convince, and that will not take them for their Masters; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>subjection to them and all</hi> their ensnaring Laws, is necessary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And with such Confidence do they Write and Talk, that it must be very expert and setled Christians, that can tell who is in the Right; but the Crowd believe them that have most Interest in them, or that speak the last word, or that have greatest Power.</p>
            <p>There is but <hi>one way possible</hi> to cure all this (besides wise and godly Princes) which all Peace-makers have still agreed on, Even to <hi>Unite in the Divine Authority and Primitive Simplicity, of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline,</hi> and to bear with others in smaller Matters. (Supposing the Determination of such mutable Circumstances which belong to each Minister
<pb facs="tcp:59354:6"/>
his Place). Christ hath promised Salvation to all that practically so agree. He hath commanded them all to Love one another, even as themselves; and to receive one another, as Christ received us. Baptism devoting us to the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, then made men Christians and Catholicks. The Creed, the Lords Prayer, Ten Commandments, were thought a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Test, as to the Orthodox Exposition of the Baptismal Covenant. Upon these Terms the Church Formed into Pastors and Flocks, lived in Loving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in the Lords Supper, and in holy Doctrine, Prayers, Praises, and doing good to all they could. <hi>The Kingdom,</hi> (that is, the Church) of <hi>God,</hi> and Christs Reign therein, consisteth not in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> things, <hi>but in Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghost</hi>: The Unity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary hereunto, was that described, <hi>Ephes. 4.3, 4, 5. One Body, One Spirit, One Hope, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, One God and Father of all:</hi> And the keeping of this Unity was in <hi>the Bond</hi> of <hi>Peace, with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in Love,</hi> v. <hi>2, 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Terms were made for our Love and Communion, by Christ, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Church, the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Perfecter</hi> of our Faiih. These Terms are few, sure, plain, possible; as Christs Yoke is easie, and his burden light, and his Commands not grievous: These Terms all Christians are actually agreed and united in. He knows not Mankind, that doth not know, That the ignorance, weakness, and badness of Man is such, as that it is impossible, that all good Christians should unite otherwise, upon things <hi>hard,</hi> dark, doubtful, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. The <hi>Primitive Simplicity, Purity</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> are the only Terms of Universal Concord in the Church on Earth.</p>
            <p>But now by Preachers with wordy confidence, these only healing terms are accused as the way of the most damning Schism. O the subtilty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that beguiled <hi>Eve</hi>! O the folly of Men that will be thus drawn away from the simplicity of Christ, by takeng the only Remedy against Schism, to be the chiefest cause. They have made <hi>Associations</hi> and <hi>Confederacies of Men, to set up New Forms of Churches, Church-Government or Communion, by multitudes of Clergy-Laws or Canons of their own,</hi> to be <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> and consequently to avoid Schsm, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Salvation: By which Arrogancy, and Impositions, and Arbitrary Laws, and Censures thereupon, the Christian World is now almost all bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Sects, condemning and censuring one another; into <hi>Greeks, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, Armenians, Georgians, Nestorians, Jacobites, Abassines, Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Papists, Protestants, &amp;c.</hi> And of all these, the Papists pretend to a Power of Government by Legislation and Iudgment over all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on Earth; some placing it in the Pope as chief, some in a Council, or the Colledge of Bishops, as chief; of which, the Pope is the prime Member; most in Pope and Council agreeing. This Sect unchurcheth all Christians, save
<pb facs="tcp:59354:6"/>
themselves, and have made so many Canon-Laws, as none can understand and keep.</p>
            <p>Some that yet do not own the Pope, tell us, That yet the Church on Earth is one Political Body, not unified by its Relation to Christ, the Head and Form (He is not Visible enough, say the Papists, to Head a Church that may be called Visible): But it is unified by a certain Confederacy of Communion among themselves, which sometime they call an <hi>Universal</hi> Government, and say, they have power to make Universal Laws; and sometime say, It is not One Unifying Government, but One Communion, and yet make Laws which all must hold Communion with: They say and unsay, and know not what to say: They cannot tell us what are the necessary terms of that Communion, nor how to know with what Nations and Churches we must hold it: But this they agree in, That Christ, the Finisher of our Faith, hath left Faith, Worship and Government so unfinished, that Bishops of all the World, or many Nations (they know not who), must make us more Laws (and when they will have done, and compleated Religion, no man knows): And that all that will be Christians, must on the Terms of these Canons, have Communion with them, and refuse not one thing that they command: And therefore must all be learned enough to know, that all that they command is lawful: And if any withdraw for an Oath, or Covenant, or Ceremony, tho he mentally own them as true Churches; or if for dissent he be excomunicated by them, he must worship God in no other Assembly, but live like an Atheist till he be convinced of the Lawfulness of their Impositions: else all that so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God are damnable Schismaticks, and so are all that communicate with them. So that I know but few on Earth that they damn not for breaking their Canons, tho they would keep all the Laws of Christ: And every where they that have strength and possession, presume that it is they that must thus be the Standers and Rulers of all others about them. It is an utter Maze which they make the Terms of catholick communion, and consequently of Salvation, instead of the few plain, certain things which Christ made necessary. We can get but few of the vulgar to understand the sense of Baptism, the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; And our churches are much made up of such, and our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes have too many <hi>Sadduces, Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hobbists;</hi> yet all must be supposed to know, <hi>1.</hi> That all the Bishops and Priests are truly called and authorized (when few know what maketh them Pastors indeed). <hi>2.</hi> And that all their words, ceremonies and impositions, are not repugnant to God's Word. <hi>3.</hi> And that all are to be avoided whom their Canons and Lay-civilians excommunicate. <hi>4.</hi> That it is a company of true Bishops and Churches in other Nations, whose communion they own. <hi>5.</hi> That all are Schismaticks that they so judg, and their churches no true churches of

                        <hi>A.</hi> He saith this is the plainest description he can give: That is not the fault of his Auditors or Readers. 1. As to the <hi>Genus,</hi> a Community of equals without Rulers is a body: but I suppose he meaneth not such. 2. Is it enough that it be of <hi>Men?</hi> sure now they should be <hi>Christians?</hi> 3. Many are <hi>separated from the rest of the World, secundum quid,</hi> that are no Christians; some in one respect and some in another, and none in all respects. 4. <hi>Vnited to God,</hi> is an ambiguous word, no <hi>Creature</hi> is <hi>Vnited</hi> to him perfectly so as to be thereby what he is, <hi>God,</hi> in the created Nature. Only Christ is united to him Hypostatically in his created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. All are so far united to him in natural being, as that in him they live and move and have their being: And the Nature of man is one sort of his Image: All things are united to him as effects to their constant efficient. The Church should not be defined without any mention of Christ: The Churches Union with God is by Christ. 5. Christ himself as Head is an essential part of the Church, and should not be left out of a Definition, thô the meer Body may in common speech be called <hi>the Church,</hi> as the People may be called <hi>a Kingdom.</hi> 6. Will any <hi>Divine Covenant</hi> serve? or must it not be only the Baptismal Covenant? 7. Is it called <hi>Divine</hi> only as <hi>made by God,</hi> or as <hi>commanded by God and made by Man,</hi> or as mutual? Certainly Gods Law and offered or Conditional Promise is most frequently called <hi>His Covenant</hi> in Scripture; and this uniteth not men to God, till they consent and Covenant with him. Their own <hi>Covenant Act</hi> is necessary hereto: And that is a <hi>Divine Covenant,</hi> only as commanded, and <hi>accepted</hi> and done by Gods assisting Grace. 8. The form of a Church is Relative, and the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> is essential to a Relation. It is no definition that hath not the End
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59354:8"/>
of the Association: Therefore this is none at all; and so the beginning tells us what to expect.</p>
                     <p>This description hath nothing in it but what may agree to divers forms of Society, and so hath not the form of a Church: And if he intended not a Definition, but a loose description, I would a defining Doctor had had the Chair, during this controversie.</p>
                     <p>Let us try this description upon a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kingdom, Army, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or suppose them meer Deists.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Such a Kingdom, Army, or Navy may be a Society. 2. Of Men. 3. Separated from the rest of the World <hi>secundum quid &amp; ad hoc</hi> (and none are separated from it <hi>simpliciter &amp; ad omnia:</hi> e. g. No man is separated from the common humanity; No Deist from any but Atheists, and no Christian in believing a God and the Law of Nature and Nations.) 4. They are <hi>Vnited to God</hi> so far as <hi>owning a God</hi> and Worshipping him amounts to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Union of the Creature with the Creator in whom he liveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And no unregenerate ungodly Christian is united to him savingly. 5. They are united among themselves. 6. This is by a Covenant: 7. And by a Covenant Divine, as to <hi>command, approbation</hi> and <hi>object.</hi> It is God that they Covenant to own and obey: The common Profession of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> is, <hi>There is one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> It is Divine in <hi>tantum</hi> as commanded. For God Commandeth all men to Own him; to believe that <hi>God is,</hi> and <hi>that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> And God so far approveth it: St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, (<hi>Thou dost well</hi>) to him that believeth there is a God, much more that is professedly devoted to him.</p>
                     <p>Let us by this examine the Jewish Church: <hi>Iews</hi> now may be 1. A Body, 2. Of Men, 3. Separated from the rest of the World, even in Religion and Church pretensions. 4. United to God as Creatures, as Men, as the corporal seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as professing Belief, Love and Obedience to God, as their God. 5. Strictly united among themselves: 6. By a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 7. Which God once commanded, and still approveth so far as they own God.</p>
                     <p>Let us consider whether this description take not in, those in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that fear God and work Righteousness, that never heard of Christ, (being thus combined.) And whether the Kingdom of God, be not larger than his Church: Joyn the Head and Tail of this mans book together, and by the Head (the description) for ought I see, <hi>Iews, Mahometans,</hi> if not almost all Heathens, are the Church: But at the End, I think none on Earth is the Church: At least none that separate from a pair of Organs, or an ignorant Curate; Nor can any man know who.</p>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 3. §. 3. And in many places, his Confusion and grand errour is repeated, that the <hi>Christian Church is but one:</hi> p. 7. <hi>We know no Church but what all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are members of by Baptsme, which is the Vniversal Church:</hi> p. 8. <hi>There is but one Church, of which all Christians are members, as there is but one Covenant</hi>; p. 19. <hi>If there be but one Church and one Communion, of which all true Christians are members,</hi> &amp;c. p. 23. I am no otherwise <hi>a member of any particular Church, than I am of the Vniversal:</hi> p. 40. It's a <hi>schismatical Notion of membership that divides the Christian Church into distinct memberships, and therefore into the distinct Bodyes:</hi> And p. 19. and often he saith, <hi>those Churches which are not members of each other, are separate Churches and Schismaticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I had hoped that no man but Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> had talkt at this rate.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It's agreed on, that there is but one Universal Church: The contrary is a Contradiction. 2. It is agreed, that there is no lawful particular Church which is not a part of the Universal. 3. That whoever hath just Union and Communion with a true particular Church, hath Union and Communion with the Universal: 4. That all men in their Worship of God, should accordingly perform it (and do all that they do) as Men in that Relation to the Universal Church: None of this is controverted.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But I had hoped never to have heard any but <hi>Seekers</hi> say, that there are <hi>not many lawful</hi> particular Churches, <hi>distinct</hi> from the whole and from one another, though not disjunct in the Common Essentials. For the proof of the contrary,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I begin with that which I expect should be most powerful; The mans own after-Confessions, to which he is oft brought. <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>Distance of Place and the necessities and conveniences of Worship and Discipline, has divided the Church into several parts and members, and Particular Churches,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>All Christian Churches ought to be members of one.</hi> More fully <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. This is <hi>ad hominem, Yea and Nay</hi> is his Resolution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I'le bring other Arguments that prevail more with me. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures oft tell us of <hi>many Churches,</hi> therefore there are many. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. <hi>The Churches had rest</hi>; and 15.4. <hi>Confirming the Churches</hi>; 16.5. <hi>So were the Churches established in the Faith</hi>; Rom. 16.4. <hi>All the Churches of the Gentiles:</hi> So ver. 16. 1 Cor. 7.17. <hi>So ordain I in all Churches</hi>; 11.16. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churches of God</hi> (have such Custom;) 14.33. <hi>As in all the Churches of the Saints</hi>; 34. <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches.</hi> So 16.1.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 Cor. 8.1. <hi>The Grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia:</hi> 18. <hi>Whose Praise is in the Gospel through all the Churches.</hi> So 19.23, 24. and 11.8.28. <hi>The care of all the Churches</hi>; 12.13. <hi>Inferior to the other Churches.</hi> Gal. 1.2, 22. 1 Thes. 2.14. 2 Thes. 1.4. Rev. 1.4. <hi>To the seven Churches,</hi> ver. 11.20. <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Candlesticks</hi> of the seven Churches. <hi>And</hi> 2.7, 11, 17, 29. <hi>and</hi> 3.6, 13, 22, 23. <hi>and</hi> 22.16. His Concordance might have shew'd him all these in order, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.15. <hi>No Church communicated with me (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning giving and receiving) but ye only.</hi> The dispute now must be, whether
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59354:9"/>
the Apostles or this <hi>Resolver</hi> be to be believed: They say, there are <hi>many Churches,</hi> parts of <hi>One</hi>; he saith, <hi>There is but one, and it's Schismatical to divide it into distinct memberships</hi> or <hi>Bodyes,</hi> &amp;c. It's no Schisme here to say, I am for <hi>Paul</hi> and the Holy Scripture: Let who will believe the contradictor.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">3. My next Argument is this: Where there are many Political Societies, consisting of Christian Pastors and People, professedly associated <hi>for the</hi> ordinary Exercise of those Relations as such, in holy Communion, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, Worship, Order and Conversation, for Edification in true Faith, Hope, Love and Obedience, and the Glorifying of God therein. There are many distinct true Churches, parts of the Church Universal; <hi>But on Earth there are many such Societyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Either the controversie is <hi>De re</hi> or <hi>de nomine</hi> (for we called <hi>Separatists</hi> use to separate these.) 1. If <hi>de re</hi>; Let the existence of the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be tryed by Scripture, Reason and common Experience: 2. If <hi>de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; Forma quae dat esse dat Nomen:</hi> Here is the true <hi>specifick form</hi> which is found in many single Churches, <hi>ergo</hi> the Name of such <hi>single</hi> (or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) Churches is due to them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Again <hi>ad hominem,</hi> from the consequences: 1. If there be not many single Churches in the Universal, then there are not many Patriarchal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Provincial, Metropolitical, Diocesan, or Parochial Churches: For <hi>non entium non datur numerus:</hi> Many <hi>nothings</hi> is a contradiction. <hi>Multae sunt ergo sunt; Abest tertij adjecti ad est secundi valet argumentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if there be not many, then 1. All the Parish Churches in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one, and not many, a Patron can have right to present to no one as a Church, more than to another. 2. Then the Parson, Vicar or Curate is no more the Parson of one Church than of another; nor bound to no more Care and Duty; for there is but one. 3. Then no one is bound to go to one Parish Church more than another; for there is but one. 4. Then the Temple and Tithes belong no more to one than another. 5. Then no Bishop is the proper Bishop of one Diocesan Church, more than of another. 6. Then all the revenues of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> are no more appropriate to one Church than to another. 7. Then you owe no more Obedience to the Bishops of one Diocesan Church than another: 8. Then you make the King no more Head or Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 9. Then a Diocesan oweth no Reverence to a Metropolitane Church (if there be none such.) 10. Then many Churches cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor send Bishops to Councils; (if there be not many.) 11. And the charge of Separation from a Church that is no Church, is a contradiction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I adde, from Parity of Reason, if many distinct subordinate Societies may make one Civil Body Politick, so they may one Universal Church: But the Antecedent is undoubted. If it be Learnedly said with Mr. <hi>Cheny,</hi> that <hi>one whole cannot be Part of another whole</hi>; One may attain the perfection by that time he hath worn the Breeches but a few years, to know that a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59354:9"/>
may be part of a whole Village, and a whole Vicinage be part of a whole City, and a whole Colledge be part of a whole University; and a whole City part of a whole Kingdom; and a whole Kingdom part of the whole Earth.</p>
                     <p>And if it be objected, that the Names of the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> are here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but a <hi>Church</hi> and a <hi>Church</hi> are the same Name. I Answer, at the same age one may learn that the same Name proveth not the sameness of the things Named; and that <hi>ex penuria nominum</hi> the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> the <hi>Totum</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> have oft equivocally the same Name, with the Addition of just Notes of distinction. Sometimes an Academy of many Schools is called <hi>Schola,</hi> and so are the single Schools therein: The City of <hi>London</hi> is a <hi>Society</hi>; and so are the Societies of Merchant-Taylors, Drapers, Mercers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>But these Churches must be members of one another, or they are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. How can that be, if they be all but one. 2. This is also above or below the <hi>ferula</hi> age. They are no members of one another, but all members of the whole: Yet how oft have we this with the sting of Schisme (as <hi>Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as <hi>Murder or Adultery</hi>) in the Tail of it. The hand is not a member or part of the Foot, or the Foot of the Hand, or the Liver a member of the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each one of the Man: If ever I were a Schoolmaster again, I would perswade my Boyes, that A is not a member of B, nor B of C, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each of the Alphabet; And that one leaf of their Book is not a member of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but both of the Book; And if they were ripe for the University, I would perswade them that <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge is not a member of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> nor that of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. but all of the Universitie of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And I think that <hi>Bristol</hi> is not a member of <hi>Exeter</hi> or <hi>Gloucester,</hi> &amp;c. but all of <hi>England</hi>; and that the Company of Stationers are not part of the Society of Merchants or Drapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a Priviledg is it, that a Man may believe this about any such thing without Schisme and Damnation! And how dreadful to fall into such Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hands that in their Case make it Schisme, Separation and Damnation. But there is a Remedy.</p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. But he hath reason for what he saith: <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4. [<hi>Indeed it</hi> is <hi>extreamly absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable, to say, that the Christian Church, which is built on the same Foundation,</hi> &amp;c. who <hi>enjoy all Priviledges</hi> in <hi>Common, should be divided into as distinct</hi> and <hi>separate Bodies, thô of the same kind and nature,</hi> as <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are <hi>distinct Persons — It's absurd to say,</hi> That <hi>where every thing is common there is not one Community.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Let us not swallow this without Chewing: 1. Whether all be <hi>extreamly absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> which such Doctors call so; I am grown to doubt as much as whether all be Schism which Schismaticks call so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> is no Proof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What the meaning of this great, Decantate Word [<hi>Separate</hi>] is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59354:10"/>
must anon be enquired: But, may not Churches be <hi>distinct</hi> and not culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly separate? He confesseth afterwards both local distinction and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How far are the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Churches distinct? As <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts?</hi> Must the World at last learn that <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> are not distinct? If you take it for absurd to distinguish a Man from a Body, or from a Liver, Hand or Foot, Dissenters do not; nor to distinguish a Colledge from an University, a House from a Street, a Street from a City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how are the Particular Churches distinguished one from another? Reader, so constantly do such men fight with themselves, that it's meet to ask, whether they that thus say there are not many distinct Churches, do not assert a far wider difference between many, than those they dissent from. We affirm that there are many, and that they differ not <hi>in specie,</hi> but <hi>numero,</hi> as Colledges, Cities do among themselves; but these men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, hold not only a numerical, but a specifick difference, even as Parochial, Diocesan, Provincial, Patriarchal, National; at least Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Diocesans differing <hi>Ordine vel Specie</hi> with them, the Church deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from them must do so too.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. But he confirms it. [Peter, James <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>thô they partake of the same common nature, yet each of them have a distinct Essence and Subsistence of their own, and this makes them distinct Persons; but where the very Nature and Essence of a Body or Society consists in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aving all things common, there can be but one Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I hope its no culpable Separation to distinguish things as differing <hi>specie &amp; numero</hi>; and this is the Doctors meaning, if his words are signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: and the common way of expressing it would have been, [Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>differ numerically but not</hi> in specie; <hi>but two Churches differ neither</hi> specie <hi>nor</hi> numero.]</p>
                     <p>And 1. Reader,, whereas he said before, that the <hi>Church is not divided into distinct Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c.] did you think till now, that <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Doctor, and the several Bishops had not been distinct parts of the Church in their distinct natural bodies?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And why may there not be distinct Politick Bodies, or Compound in one whole as well as natural? certainly, all things corporeal save Attomes are Compounds: A Muscle, a Hand, a Foot, parts similar and dissimilar in man are all compounded of lesser Parts. If many Students may make one Colledge, why may not many Colledges make one University? It's strange if a Doctor deny this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But let us consider of his Reason, and enquire 1. <hi>Whether the Church have all things Common.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether the very Essence of it consist in this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. It is granted that the whole <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> is found in every individual of that <hi>Species,</hi> Natural or Politick; but did we ever hear,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59354:10"/>
till Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> and this Doctor said it, that Politick Bodies differ not <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> as well as Natural? The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> are two; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> long strove which should be uppermost, but who ever said that they were not two?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Have they all things common? Dissenters would have excepted Wives and Husbands, (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Canons called Apostolical do not;) Why should the Essence of a Church lie in this, and not the Essence of a City or Kingdom? Tories in <hi>Ireland</hi> would have all common; Merchants and Tradesmen, Knights, Lords and Princes here would not. But it's no Schism here also to distinguish <hi>simpliciter</hi> &amp; <hi>secundum quid,</hi> Propriety and the use of Propriety: There is no <hi>Community</hi> without <hi>Propriety</hi>: Men have first a Propriety in themselves, their members, their food, the acquests of their Labours, their Wives and Children, and Goods. And they consent to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to preserve this Propriety, because every man loveth himself: And yet they must use their Propriety, (even of Life) for common good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all are better than one: But if they had no Propriety they could not so use it for the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>And I never conformed to the Doctrine that denyeth <hi>Propriety</hi> in Church Members and Particular Churches, and thought all simply <hi>common.</hi> I'le tell you what <hi>Particular</hi> Churches have to individuate them, not common to all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They consist of individual natural Persons, <hi>many</hi> of which as much differ from <hi>many</hi> other Persons, (those in <hi>England</hi> from those in <hi>Spain</hi>) as <hi>one man</hi> doth from <hi>another.</hi>

All Churches have not Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> to be their Teachers: All Churches be not taught all that's in this Resolver. 2.

nor excellency of Parts: It was once taken for lawful to account them <hi>specially worthy of double honour who laboured in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> and to esteem men for their <hi>works sake. Paul</hi> saith of <hi>Timothy, I have no man like minded.</hi> If those that heard not a Sermon in many years differed not from your Congregation, why do you preach?</p>
                     <p>I am reproached in Print for telling the world this notorious truth; That I lived till ten years old, where four men, four years hired successively were Readers and School-masters; two Preached (as it was called) once a Month, the other two never: Two drank themselves to beggery. After I lived where many Parishes about us had no Preachers: The Parish that I lived in, had a Church with a Vicar that never preached, and a Chappel with a Parson eighty years old, that had two Livings twenty Miles distant, and never preacht: His Son a Reader and Stage-player was sometime his Curate: His Grand-son, my School-master, his Curate next that, never preacht in his life, but drunk himself to beggery. One year a Taylor read the Scripture, and the old man (the best of them all) said the Commmon-Prayer without book (for want of sight.) The next year a poor Thresher read the Scripture. After that a Neighbours Son (my Master) was Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, who never preacht but once, and that when he was drunk, (in my hearing) on <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Come ye Blessed,</hi> and <hi>go ye Cursed</hi>;] the saddest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ever I heard. These things were no rarities: Now my assertion is, That the Church that had such as <hi>Austin, Chrysostome, Iewel, Andrews,</hi> and such worthy men as <hi>London</hi> now hath many, had Priviledges distinct from these, (and many the like) that I was in.</p>
                     <p>If you say that every Bishop and Preacher is as much the Bishop and Preacher to all other single Churches, as to that which is his Title; then 1. He must be condemned for not <hi>teaching</hi> them all. 2. Then he may claim maintenance from them all. 3. Then he may intrude into any mans Charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. Then no Church is unchurcht for want of a Bishop, for any one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is Bishop to every Church in the World; and so <hi>ubi Episcopus ibi Ecclesia,</hi> signifieth but that Church and Bishop are on the same Earth; and <hi>Ecclesia est Plebs Episcopo adunata</hi> may be verified if there be but one in the World. 5. And so Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and such are self-confuted before you are aware: <hi>Geneva, Holland,</hi> and all Presbyterians are true Churches, for they have all Bishops; <hi>e. g.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> is Bishop to them all: For if one man be no more a Member of one single Church than of another, and so no more a Subject to one Bishop than to another, then one Bishop is no more Pastor of one Church than of another.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And how can you magnifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a Wise, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pious Clergy above other Churches, if all Priviledges be common, and they have no proper Pastors of their own.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Do you think that the Church, <hi>e. g.</hi> Of <hi>Hippo,</hi> that was in <hi>Austins</hi> dayes, was the same numerical single Church with that which is there now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59354:11"/>
(were there any) or with the Diocesan Church of <hi>London?</hi> if not, then at least distance of time, and change of Persons maketh divers Particular Churches; and it's no more against the unity of the Church Universal to have divers particular Churches in it in the same Age, than in divers Ages.</p>
                     <p>In short, Diversity of matter and form maketh a numerical Diversity (as of Natural, so) of Politick Bodies of the same <hi>species</hi>: But the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna, Thyatira, Philadelphia,</hi> &amp;c. were of divers matter and form numerically; <hi>Ergo</hi> they were divers Political Churches.</p>
                     <p>Sure God doth not commend <hi>Laodicea</hi> for <hi>Philadelphia</hi>'s Church Virtues, nor condemn the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for the other Churches Sins.</p>
                     <p>And if the Angels be Bishops, why are some Bishops praised as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of such Churches, and the Bishops of other Churches threatned.</p>
                     <p>But I confess this is a ready way to end the Controversies between the Bishops of several Churches which shall be greatest, if they be all but one.</p>
                     <p>But I hope that when the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Church was corrupted, it is not true that every Bishop and Church fell with him, (or with any that hath turned to Mahumetanism.)</p>
                     <p>To be no longer on this, (which I thought no Prelatist would ever have put me on) if these men speak not notoriously against Scripture, against the constant Language of Canons and Fathers, Historians and Lawyers, and all Antiquity, and all Christian Countreys and Divines, (yea, even those that at <hi>Trent</hi> would have had only the Pope to be of immediate Divine Right) then I know not any thing by Reading. And if poor Nonconformists must be put to defend themselves against such singularities, and be Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks unless they will differ from all the Christian World of all Ages, there is no Remedy.</p>
                     <p n="7">§. 7. But <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. he tells us, [that <hi>a Church is made by a Divine Covenant— God only can constitute a Church: Such Persons, if there be any so absurd, are not worth disputing with, who dare affirm the Church to be an humane Creature,</hi> or <hi>the invention</hi> of <hi>men.— And no Church can depend on humane Contracts; for then a Church would be a humane</hi> Creature and <hi>Constitution, whereas a Church can be founded only on a Divine Covenant</hi>—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who would think but this man were a Nonconformist, that talks so like them (<hi>e. g. Amesius in Medul. Theol.</hi>) against humane Church Forms? But what then will Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and almost all other Bishops and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be thought of, who affirm Patriarchal and Metropolitical Churches (and many of the Diocesane) to be but humane Constitutions and Inventions. And if these be not worth the disputing with, it seems, that you differ from them more than Separatists do: and then were not all these Schismaticks? and then, are not you a Schismatick if you communicate with them? yea, your Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> himself maketh Diocesan Churches to be a humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and A. Bishop <hi>Bromhall</hi> much pleadeth for mans power to make Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Churches; and so do such others.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59354:12"/>2. But is it true that humane Contracts make not a Church? <hi>Ans.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> alone: But I think that all Churches are made by mutual Contracts, and humane is one part of that which is mutual.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> 1. God as Legislator and Donor, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth the <hi>species</hi> of Covenanting by Baptism, and therein he commandeth mans consent to his <hi>offered Covenant</hi>; and conditionally promiseth to be our God: But, <hi>Conditionale nihil ponit in esse</hi>: This much maketh no Christian, nor Church. To command a man to be a Christian, and conditionally to promise him life if he will be one, proveth him not to be one; else all were Christians that reject an offered Christ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But when man <hi>consenteth</hi> and covenanteth with God, then Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional gift becomes actual and efficacious, the man being a capable Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and not before: and in this it is the Contract that is the <hi>Fundamentum Relationis</hi>; but a single Promise is not a mutual Covenant or Contract.</p>
                     <p>So that it is no wiser Divinity to say, Gods Covenant and not mans consent, Covenant or Contract with God, doth make Christians, and the universal Church; than it is sober Reason to say, That Gods Institution of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or Magistracie only doth make the Relation of Husband and Wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their covenanting consent, or doth make Common-wealths, without the consent or Covenant of Sovereign and Subjects. Did this Doctor think that <hi>Voluntariness</hi> is not as necessary to the Relation of Christianity as to the Relation of Prince and Subjects; yea, or of Husband and Wife? if he do, he is shamefully mistaken. Baptism delivereth men possession of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Grace</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to Glory; and can men have this against their wills? One would think by the Doctrine and course of some men, that they could force men to Pardon and Salvation! if I believed that their force could accomplish this, I would never call it Persecution. If they can force men to be true Christians, they may force them to be justifyed and saved; and then they are very uncharitable if they do not: Let them then cease preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disputing us to their Opinion, but bring us all to Heaven whether we will or not.</p>
                     <p>Yea the self-contradictor, playing fast and loose, confesseth <hi>p.</hi> 6. That <hi>no man at age can be admitted to Baptism, till he profess his faith in Christ, and voluntarily undertake the Baptismal Vow:</hi> And is not that <hi>humane Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, he knoweth that the Liturgie maketh even Neighbours or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, vow and covenant, both in the name of the Child and for the Child. And so necessary doth the Episcopal Church think <hi>humane Covenanting,</hi> that without this no Child must be Baptized publickly though the Parents would covenant, and that they can neither for Love nor Money (for many poor men hire Godfathers) get any one (much less three) who examined, will seriously purpose to perform the Covenant for the Childs holy Education which they make</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59354:12"/>II. But is not <hi>humane Covenanting</hi> a cause of <hi>single Church</hi> Relation as well as of <hi>universal?</hi> I see no cause to doubt it; and I am sure that the Church for a thousand years (before and since Popery came in) have declared him no Bishop that comes in without <hi>consent</hi> of Clergie and People; which <hi>Consent</hi> is their covenanting act.</p>
                     <p>To make a single Church, manifold consent goeth to the <hi>Fundamentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis.</hi> 1. God commandeth single Church Officers, order and consent, and promiseth them his blessing where they are met: The Lord and his Angels are among them: No command is vain, and without a virtual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. 2. To this a threefold humane consent is needful, Ordinarily: 1. the Persons called. 2. The Ordainers (when it may be had.) 3. The Peoples. He that formerly, from the Apostles dayes, for a thousand years, should have said, that neither the covenanting, that is the <hi>consent</hi> of the Pastor, or People, or Ordainers, is necessary to the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Church Relation or Form, would have been taken for a wild-brain'd Schismatick at least.</p>
                     <p n="8">§. 8. But saith this Doctor (and another of them) [<hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>But the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Church Covenant between Pastor and people, is of a very different nature from this: Vnless any man will say, that the voluntary Contract and Covenant which the Independents exact from their Members, and wherein they place a Church state, be part of the Baptismal vow; if it be not, then they found the Church upon a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Covenant; for Christ hath made but one Covenant with Mankind which is contained in the Vow of Baptism; if it be, then no man is a Christian but an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas for the Church that is taught at this rate!</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I never saw what Independents do in this case; but I think none of them that are Sober own any other sort of Church but the <hi>universal,</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Churches</hi> as members of it, and therefore require no Contract but 1. To the Covenant of Baptism or Christianity. 2. To the Duties of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church-relation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And nothing is here of necessity but <hi>manifested Consent</hi> (which is a real Contract) but a clearer or a darker, an explicite or implicite consent differ only <hi>ad meliús esse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is not God the Author of Magistracy, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is it any violation of Gods part, if Rulers and People, Husband and Wife be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters by his command?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is it any renuntiation of Baptism to promise at Ordination to obey the Arch-Bishop and Bishop, and to take the Oath of Canonical Obedience? Is it not still exacted? Are not the Takers of it obliged? are not Covenants imposed on all that will be Ministers in the act of Uniformity? are not multitudes kept out and cast out for not making these Covenants? <hi>Quo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neam nodo,</hi> &amp;c. How should one deal with such slippery men? Good Mr. <hi>Zachary Cawdry</hi> that wrote to have all men to covenant Submission to Bishops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59354:13"/>
and Parish Ministers, did not dream that it was any violation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Do not men owe duty to their Pastors which they owe to no others? If not, put them not on it: Why are you angry with them for going from you? Why doth the Canon suspend those that receive them to Communion from another Parish that hath no Preacher? Why are we ruined for not covenanting as aforesaid? if yea, then is it against Baptism to promise to do our duty?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But hath God commanded or instituted no Covenant but Baptism? Yes sure, the Matrimonial at least; and I think Ordination is covenanting for the Ministry: Did not the Apostle <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. ordain Elders in every Church? if you would have [by <hi>Suffrage</hi>] left out of the Translation, no sober man can doubt but it was by the Peoples consent; and was it without their consent that <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain Elders in every City? Could any then come otherwise in? Did not all Churches hold and practise this after, and was it none of Gods Institution? If so, God requireth us not to take any of you for our Bishops or Pastors: Who then requireth it? What meaneth <hi>Paul</hi> when he saith, <hi>they gave up themselves to the Lord and to us, by the Will of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Can the wit of man imagine how it is possible without consent, for a man to be made the Pastor of any Flock? Who ever ordained a man against his will? or for any man to have Title against his will, to the proper over-sight and pastoral care of any one Pastor, or the priviledges of any Church? If any think they may be cramm'd and drencht with the Sacrament, or that an unwilling man may have a sealed pardon and gift of Salvation delivered him, he will make a new Gospel. And how any particular Pastor is bound to give that man the Sacrament ordinarily, that consents not ordinarily to receive it of him, I know not. No man is a member of any City, or any Company of Free-men in the City, but by mutual consent; and the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King maketh not the Oath of a Citizen as such or of a Member of a Company as such, unlawful.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Doth this Doctor think that he ever yet proved to sober men, that the Covenant aforesaid, of Godfathers and Godmothers, to make Christians, and members of the universal Church, is more (or so much) of Gods Institution, than the Contract or Consent between Bishops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and People to make a single Political Church?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If it follow not, that no man is the Kings Subject that sweareth not to the City; It will not follow, that none is a Christian, but an Independent, or Church-consenter.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. How are your Parish or Diocesan Church members known to your selves or any others? Are all that dwell in the Parish or Diocess your Church members? Then Atheists, Sadducees, Hobbists, and all vicious men and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that never communicate are such: Yea those that you call Separatists.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59354:13"/>
If it be every transient Communicant, have you a proper Pastoral care of every Travellers Soul that so communicates with you? You after plead that his very ordinary Communion maketh him not a member, if he be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be one. And is not his consent then necessary? Or if ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be the test (how few then of great Parishes are of the Church) yet that is because such Communion signifieth their Consent to your over-sight of them.</p>
                     <p n="9">§. 9. But it's much to be approved which <hi>p.</hi> 5. and oft he saith, that <hi>to be taken into Covenant with God, and to be received into the Church is the very same thing,</hi> as to the Universal Church. By which all his gross Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Accusations afterwards are confuted. No man then is out of the Church that is not out of the Baptismal Covenant, either by not <hi>taking</hi> it, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing some <hi>Essential part</hi> of it? And when will he prove, that to take him, rather than Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> that was cast out, to be a Teacher or Pastor at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans,</hi> or to take this man and not another to be the Lawful Bishop or Priest, and to obey him in every Oath and Ceremony, is an Essential part of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal Covenant, or of Christianity? But such a rope of Sand, as Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and this man tye together, to bind men to their Sect, will serve turn with some that know not who speaks Truth, by any surer way than prejudice.</p>
                     <p n="10">§. 10. His Doctrine of <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>gathering Churches out of Churches</hi> is anon to be considered: But whereas he addes, <hi>p.</hi> 7.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> My acquaintance with them is small, save by reading their Books: And there are few Men of any Common Denomination (Episcopal, or other) that are not in many things disagreed. But I must in Charity to them say, that as far as I can judge by their Writings or Speech, he palpably slandereth them; and that none that are grave and sober among them do separate their Churches from the common Christianity or the Universal Church, any more than the Company of Stationers, Ironmongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are separated from the City of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> or Trinity Colledge from the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford.</hi> I never met with man, and I am confident never shall do, that doth not take his Independent Church to be part of the Universal, and Dependent as a part on the whole. If belying others stopt at words, the wrong were small: But when it's made but the stairs to hatred and destroying, it's his way to cure Schism that is commonly painted with Horns and Cloven feet. If a man come from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Village and be made by Covenant a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> how prove you that he renounceth King or Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>But he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>Those who wilfully separate from the Corporation to which the Charter was granted, forfeit their Interest in the Charter.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> What Reader doth this man presume upon that will not ask him, how he proveth 1. That Gods Law or Charter to his Church doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

them to congregate in distinct single Churches (as <hi>London</hi> Charter doth to erect several Companies, and the Universities several Colledges?) 2. And that God hath not in his Word given order or command for such single Churches: But that the Apostles and <hi>Titus</hi> by fixing Elders to their several Churches and Cities, separated from the Universal Church? 3. And that their subordinate Churches have not need of distinct subordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and duty: And that our Diocesan Churches all separate from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal?

                     <p>It may be he will say that the <hi>Diocesan depend on the Vniversal, but the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian or Independent do not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Answer, Dependance is either that of <hi>Subjects</hi> on Soveraign or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates for <hi>Government,</hi> or that of a <hi>Community</hi> of <hi>Equals</hi> for <hi>Communion.</hi> In the former respect they depend on none but Christ as Universal Soveraign, Nor on any Foriegners for Governments: In the latter, they depend on all true Churches for Communion: And Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> and most Diocesans hitherto have said that Diocesan Churches are thus far Independent or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal at most.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. God hath made one General Law, for Christians congregating with their fixed Elders or Bishops in particular Churches all the World over: And his Command is not without Promise of <hi>being with them</hi> to the End of the World; and that Promise becometh a Promise to every Church so congregate. God hath not made distinct Laws or Promises to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: But the Promise to Justifie all Believers justifieth each single Person when he believeth. If the King should make one common Law to command all his Subjects that are Freeholders to live in Corporations or Hundreds, described with their priviledges, those priviledges would be all theirs that are so incorporated: As one Charter may Priviledge every <hi>London</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, diversified by subordinate Agreements.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that God who will have them thus incorporated and distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several single Churches, doth Covenant (or <hi>Promise</hi>) according to their demerits to each. Do I need to recite the peculiar Promises and threats to the seven <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. which are Covenants to them?</p>
                     <p n="12">§. 12. Next <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. He will tell us what <hi>Communion</hi> is, and in many
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59354:14"/>
words, it is to tell us that <hi>Communion</hi> is <hi>nothing but Vnion:</hi> I know that <hi>quoad notationem nominis, Communion</hi> may signifie, <hi>Vnion with others:</hi> But they that write Politicks have hitherto distinguished <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> taking <hi>Communion</hi> for Actual <hi>Communication,</hi> or exercise of the duties of men in Union? But to speak cross to other Writers on the same Subjects and give no reason for it, and to confound <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> is one part of this edifying Resolution.</p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. [<hi>Our Communion with the Church consists in being members of the Church, which we are made by Baptism,</hi>] (saith he.)</p>
                     <p>Then the Baptized are still in Communion with the Church, till their baptism be nullified: And hath he proved us Apostates?</p>
                     <p n="14">§. 14. <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. <hi>Should any man who is no member of the Church, nor owns himself to be so, intrude into the Church and Communicate in all Holy Offices, it's no Act of Communion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I thought communicating ordinarily in Holy Offices, had gone for an owning of Communion: If it do not, would you would tell us how to know who are of your Church.</p>
                     <p n="15">§. 15. <hi>P.</hi> 13. Saith he (<hi>Church-Communion does not consist in particular Acts of Communion, which can be performed among those who are present and Neighbours, but in membership: Now as a member is a member of the whole Body (not meerly of any part of it,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>All the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>who never saw nor converst with each other, are members of the same Kingdom.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. That word [<hi>meerly</hi>] hath more Craft than Justice or Honesty: <hi>Meerly</hi> signifieth <hi>Only</hi> I suppose; and if he would make his Reader think that they that are for <hi>single Church peculiar membership</hi> and consent, do take themselves to be [<hi>meerly</hi> or <hi>only</hi>] members of those single Churches, and not of the Universal, it is shameless injury.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Will he ever draw men to conformity by making them believe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they owe Common Communion to all Christians, therefore we owe no special duty to the Bishops, Priests, Churches or Neighbours where we are setled? Do the Men of one Colledge, School, Corporation, owe no more duty to that than to all others? Do the Free-holders of <hi>Bedford-shire</hi> choose Knights for <hi>Middlesex</hi>; or the Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> choose Officers in <hi>London?</hi> These seem strange Resolutions to us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But doth he remember that [<hi>if Communion consist not in Acts of Communion</hi> to such, <hi>but in membership even with the distant,</hi>] then he that is baptized, and no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate, and performeth no other Acts of Communion to the Bishops, Parson or People where he liveth, than he is bound to perform to them a hundred or thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles off, is no Separatist. Methinks this favours Separation too much.</p>
                     <p n="16">§. 16. <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. When he <hi>denyed any Divine Covenant to make us members of particular Churches distinguish't from the Vniversal</hi> (as all National, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan and Parochial are, as parts from the whole) he presently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confuteth all again, saying [<hi>The exercise of Church Communion as to most of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                     <p>A. <hi>Oportuit fuisse memorem,</hi> — 1. Reader, doth not this man here confess that there are particular Churches? 2. If these be not distinct from the whole, then each particular is the whole. 3. If the <hi>Exercise</hi> must be in particular Churches, must not men <hi>Consent</hi> to their Relations and Duties? Is it a sin to Promise Duty? 4. Sure it is not meer <hi>Place,</hi> but a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Pastors and People that distinguisheth these Churches. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians preach't once in the same Places that you do, and yet you take them not for the same Church Pastors. If one from <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Cornwall</hi> come into your Pulpit without consent, do People stand as much related to him as to you? Some men are of extraordinary sufficiency to resist and conquer the clearest evidence of Truth.</p>
                     <p>But he addes [<hi>every Act of Communion thô performed to some particular Church, is and must be an Act of Communion with the whole Catholick Church.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> And who denyeth this? No sober Independent or Presbyterian that ever I met with. It's a weighty Truth.</p>
                     <p n="17">§. 17. <hi>P.</hi> 14. Saith he [<hi>Praying, and Hearing and Receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per together doth not make us more in Communion with the Church of</hi> England <hi>than with any other true and Orthodox part of the Church, thô in the remotest part of the World.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I think that's not true: With the remotest parts you have only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion with the Church Universal: In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London</hi> you have that and more; even special subordinate Communion with your own King, Bishop and Flock.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And hath not the Church of <hi>England</hi> such Communion in obedience to its own Laws; (as the Act of Uniformity,) Convocation and Canons, which you have not with all abroad? Do your Bishops in Convocation make Canon Laws for all the World? Do you Swear Canonical obedience as much to the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Haffnia,</hi> &amp;c. as to your Ordinary? Do the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of all Churches impose our Liturgy, or <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicate all that affirm any thing in it, or our Ceremonies or Church Government, to be against Gods word? Sure this is a peculiar kind of Communion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If not, why are all the Nonconformists cast out that offer to officiate and Communicate on such terms as are common to all sound Churches?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. Saith he [<hi>There is nothing in all these Acts of Communion which does more peculiarly unite us to such a particular Church than to the whole Christian Church.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> What, neither in these <hi>Acts</hi> nor any other! Then we are no more bound to hear you, or maintain you as our Pastor, than to hear and maintain the whole Christian Church.</p>
                     <p n="18">§. 18. <hi>P.</hi> 20. Saith he [<hi>There is no other Rule of Catholick Communion for

private Christians, but to communicate in all Religious Offices and all Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Discipline with Christians those with whom they live.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Elsewhere you added [<hi>sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi>:] Else they that live with Arians, Socinians, Papists (in <hi>Spain, France, Italy,</hi> &amp;c.) are bound to communicate with them in all Religious Offices and obey them. 2. This concludeth, that where Presbytery or Independency is the way of the place where we live, all must thus communicate and obey. The King and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom then may make any way to become our Duty. 3. If you tell us that <hi>it's only with</hi> the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> you were as good say nothing, unless you tell us who must judge that, whether the People themselves, or who for them. 4. But if this be the <hi>only rule</hi> for private Christians, what shall they do, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>Aethiopa, Egypt, Syria,</hi> and many other Countreys where the Churches are such as General Councils and other Churches judge He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks or Schismaticks? And what shall they do, when at <hi>Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Constantinople,</hi> &amp;c. one party is uppermost (by the Judgment of Councils and Prince) one Year, and another contrary party the next. And what shall they do where the Prince equally tolerateth both, and it's hard to know which is the more numerous? as in <hi>Zeno</hi>'s and <hi>Anastasius</hi> Reign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what shall they do when many Churches in one City are of divers Tongues, as well as Customs? Have the <hi>Greeks, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>London</hi> no rule of Catholick Communion but communicating in all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the English, and obeying all your Bishops Courts?</p>
                     <p n="19">§. 19. <hi>P.</hi> 21. Saith he [<hi>Distinct and particular Churches which are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, must have their distinct bounds and limits, as every member has it's natural and proper place, and Situation in the Body.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Why may not the <hi>Greeks, Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> live in Communion with the Churches <hi>London</hi> though they live dispersedly among them! In <hi>Brandenburg, Hassia,</hi> and many free Cities, and <hi>Belgia,</hi> where Lutherans and Calvinists (as called) live together, and own each other as Brethren, why may not both be Churches of Christ?</p>
                     <p n="20">§. 20. <hi>P.</hi> 21, 22. A great deal more he hath of the like, making Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks at his Pleasure. [<hi>This is plain in the Case of the Presbyterian and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Churches and those other Conventicles</hi> — They <hi>are Churches in a Church, — Nothing can justifie the Distinction of Christians into several Churches, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a distance of place as makes it necessary,</hi> &amp;c. p. 22. <hi>Distinct Churches in the same place can never be under the same Communion.</hi>

                        <hi>A.</hi> These things are repeated so oft, and the word [<hi>separate</hi>] so deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rolled over and over, that I will answer all together under his third Case at the End.</p>
                     <p n="21">§. 21. <hi>P.</hi> 27. See how openly he recanteth most aforesaid:
<q>There is a sence indeed wherein we may be said to be members of one particular Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as distinct from all other particular Churches: <hi>But that</hi> principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Government and Discipline.

Christian Church, and in Communion with it, but he is under the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Government of his own Bishop and Presbyters, and is bound to perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion with them; and this constitutes a particular Church, in which all Acts of Worship and all Acts of Discipline and Government are under the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conduct of a particular Bishop.]</q>

                        <hi>A.</hi> Omitting that he seemeth to make the Parochial Churches no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but parts of one, here he saith all that he seemed to write against, and that those that he reproacheth hold, allowing the difference of the <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Churches.</hi> And is it Edifying to read such a discourse, that saith and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saith by self-contradiction?

<q>Whether Communion with some Church or other be a necessary Duty incumbent on Christians:] <hi>And he thinks the Resolution</hi> of this is as plain, as whether it be necessary for every man to be a Christian: For every Christian is baptized into the Communion of the Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> In this I know no Christian adversary to him: But it being the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church</hi> that he giveth his proof of necessary Communion with, it's odde to say, <hi>We must have Communion with some Church or other</hi>: As if there were more than one Universal Church. 2. But we grant more, that all that can well, should be also members of some single Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>P.</hi> 32. He saith
<q>[External and Actual Communion is an Essential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Church-member (<hi>meaning a</hi> Christian.)]</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. And yet before he denyed that Communion lay essentially in this Exercise, but only in <hi>Vnion:</hi> Yea and Nay is his Custom. 2. Some few Christians (as those that live where such Communion cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are not bound to it; therefore it is not true that it is <hi>Essential</hi> to Universal Church-membership. And I think sickness endeth not the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials, that disableth men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Note Reader, that by this mans Doctrine we are all unchristened and damned if we do not gather into disallowed Churches, if we be unjustly cast out of the allowed ones: For all must be Church members that will be Christians, and an unjust Excommunication cannot disoblige us from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, nor bind us to consent to be damned.

sinful, and answer <hi>Spalatensis</hi> arguments against Excommunicating <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and prove all this just, and you may prove what you will just. But you see where he layeth the Controversie: If any be Excommunicated without suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause, or by Lay Civilians to whom God never gave that power, or by such Bishops or Pastors as have no just Authority for want of a true call or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; or if any unlawful thing be made necessary to Communion, all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must by his own confessions hold Church-communion whether these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers will or not; for all Christians are bound to be of some Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 33, 34. He saith that [<hi>None but publick Prayers are the Prayers of the Church properly, and acts of Communion,</hi> that is, such as are <hi>offered by the hands of men authorized and set apart for that purpose,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Who would have thought that we are more for the Liturgy than he? I undertake to prove, that all the Responsal Prayers, and all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany Prayers, in which the Minister names but the matter to them, and the People make it a Prayer by speaking the petitioning parts, are all the publick Prayers of the Church, and so are all the petitioning Psalms spoke or sung by the People, and not only that which is offered by the Priest: I do not think that he believeth what he carelesly saith here, himself.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. THE next question of <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> as distinct from fixed, he turns out of doors, as if there could be no such thing, and it's very true as to the Church universal; but as to visible, actual Communion with this or that particular Church, it is not true.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Traveller of another Country, who on his journey communicateth with every Church where he passeth, is not a fixed Member of that Church: for, 1. The Pastor or Bishop hath not that peculiar Charge of him as of fixed members. 2. He is not bound where he passeth to take such notice of the lives of Communicants or Pastors, and to admonish the Offenders, and tell the Church, as fixed members are. 3. He hath not the right in choose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pastors or Deacons as the fixed Members have. 4. An itinerant Bishop <hi>in transitu</hi> is not their fixed Bishop; <hi>ergo</hi> an Iterant Lay-man is not a fixed Member.</p>
                     <p>The same I may say of one that is a fixed member of another Church in the same City, and cometh to that only to signifie universal Communion, or

neighbourly; which, though he deny to be lawful, I shall further prove anon.</p>
                     <p>And the same I may say of those that dwell where there is no fixed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Church at all, for want of a Pastor, but they congregate only when some strange Minister passeth through the Town.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. PAge 48, 49. He resolveth his third Case: [<hi>Whether it be lawful to Communicate with two distinct and separate Churches</hi>] negatively, and saith, [<hi>It is contrary</hi> to all the <hi>Principles of Church Communion, as any thing can possibly be; it is to be contrary to our selves, it is Communicating with Schism: That the Presbyterian and Independent Churches have made an actual separation from the Church of</hi> England <hi>he hath evidently proved</hi>; — and <hi>they are Schismaticks, and to communicate with them is to partake in their Schism; and if Schism be a great sin, and that which will damn us as soon as Adultery and Murther, then it must needs be a dangerous thing to communicate with Schismaticks.</hi> And p. 42. <hi>There cannot be two distinct Churches in one place, one for occasional, and another for constant Communion, without Schism.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To save those that are willing from the Poyson of these Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrines, lapt up in confusion by men that abhor distinction, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not what they say; I will first lay down that truth that he fights against, with convincing evidence, and then shew you the mischief of his false Doctrine and Application.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. The confusion of these words [<hi>Church, Communion, Separation</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi>] which every one signifie divers things, is the chief means to blind and deceive his Reader; whether it do so by himself I know not.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Word <hi>Church</hi> signifieth sometime the universal Church; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a single Organized Church as part of it, and sometime humane combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of such single Churches; and that into Diocesan, Classical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, Patriarchal, National, and Papal.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Specification and Nomination of Churches is from the formal cause, and the proper Government is that form: And the Individuation is from matter and form, but principally from the form.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Union of Pastor and Flock in Relation makes that which is a form aptitudinal (as the Soul to the Body) to be the form in act (as the Union of Soul and Body) and Gods command and consent with the consent of the necessary relate and correlate cause that union.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Union is in order to Communion, which is primary by the exercise
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59354:18"/>
of the formal powers on the matter, and secondary by the action of all the parts according to their several capacities and Offices.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Union of the Church is of divers degrees. 1. The formal Union of the Head and Body, which maketh it essentially the [<hi>Christian Church.</hi>] 2. The <hi>Vnion of the parts among themselves as Christian,</hi> which maketh them a <hi>Body</hi> capable of Union with the Head. 3. The Union of the parts as unequal Organized, the Official with the rest, which maketh it an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized Body,</hi> fit for its special use and welfare. 4. Union in <hi>integrity</hi> of parts, which maketh it an intire Body. 5. Union in due temperament and Qualities, which maketh it a <hi>healthful</hi> Body. 6. Unity in <hi>Common Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> which make it a <hi>Comely Beautiful</hi> Body joined with the rest. But, 7. Union in mutable Accidents is unnecessary and impossible.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. These several degrees of Union are found in Bodies natural and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. 1. The Union of Soul and Body makes a man, and an Embryo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be organized. 2. The Union of the Body maketh it capable of the Souls further Operation. 3. The Union of the Organical, chief parts, (as Heart, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to the rest make it a true humane Body compleated to the nutriment and action of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. That it have Hands and Fingers, Feet and Toes, and all integral parts, makes it an intire Body. 5. The due site, temperament and qualities of each part make it a sound Body. 6. Comely colour, hair, action, going, speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make it a <hi>comely Body.</hi> 7. To have all parts of equal quantity and office, would make it uncomely: And to have the same hair, colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unnecessary at all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Union of King and Subjects as such makes a Kingdom. 2. That the People be agreed; for one conjunct interest and Government maketh them a <hi>Community</hi> capable of Politie or Government. 3. That there be Judges, Maiors and Justices, and subordinate Cities or Societies, maketh it an Organized Body, in which Kingly Government may be exercised to its end, the common good. 4. That no profitable part be wanting, (Judge, Justice, Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) maketh it an <hi>entire</hi> Kingdom. 5. That all know their place, and be duly qualified with Wisdom, Love, Justice, Conscience, Obedience to God first, to the Sovereign Power next, to Officers next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh it a sound and safe Kingdom. 6. That it be well situate, fertile, rich, eminent in Learning, Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh it an adorned beautiful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 7. That all be equal in Power and wealth is destructive; and that all be of one Age, complexion, calling, temper, degree of knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is impossible: And that all have the same language, cloathing, utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is needless at least.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Jesus Christ is the only Universal Soveraign of the Church, both of vital influence and Government; nor hath he set up any under him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monarchical, Aristocratical, Democratical, or mixt, Pope, Council, or diffused Clergy, that hath the Power of Legislation and Judgment as governing the whole Chorch; but only Officers that <hi>per partes</hi> govern it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59354:19"/>
them, each in his Province, as Justices do the Kingdom, and Kings and States the World; nor is any capable of more.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. To set up any <hi>universal Legislators</hi> and Judge, (Pope or Council) is to set up an Usurper of Christs Prerogative, called by many a Vice-Christ or an Antichrist; and as bad as making one man or Senate the Soveraign of all the Earth; and to attempt the setting up of such or any <hi>forreign Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in this Land, is to endeavour to perjure the whole Kingdom that is sworn against it in the Oath of Supremacy, and sworn never to endeavour any alteration of Government in Church or State in the Corporation Oath, the Vestry Oath, the <hi>Militia</hi> Oath, the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, with the Uniformity Covenants: And if any should endeavour to introduce such a forreign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction who themselves have had a hand in driving all the Kingdom to all these Oaths against it, I doubt whether all the Powers of Hell can devise a much greater crime against Clergy, Cities, and all the Land. Good reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had Doctor <hi>Isaac Barrow</hi> to write against it as he hath done, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and all such as of late go that pernicious way, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Church Union and Communion. As if one universal Soveraign and Legislator and Judge, were not enough to unite Christs Kingdom, or man could mend his universal Laws, and could not stay for his final judgment; and Churches and Kingdomes might not till then be ruled without one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane universal Soveraign by necessary and voluntary agreement among themselves.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. To be a true Believer or Christian, (or the Infant seed of such) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, according to the sense of the Baptismal Covenant, uniteth each Member first to Christ himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and consequently to his Body or Church; and this <hi>coram Deo,</hi> as soon as it is done by heart consent; and <hi>coram Ecclesia,</hi> regularly, as soon as he is invested by Baptism; which Baptism, when it may be had so, is regularly to be administred by none but an authorized Minister or Deacon; but if through necessity or mistake it be done by a Lay-man, the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians took it not for a nullity, much less if the Baptizer was taken for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister by mistake, being in his place; and if no Baptism can be had, open covenanting is vallid.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The Papists (and their truckling Agents here) have here hampered themselves in a fatal contradiction: To make themselves masters of the World, they would perswade us, that Sacraments only regenerate and sanctifie, and that God saveth none (by any known way and grant) but by his Covenant Sealed by the Sacraments; and that he authorizeth none to administer this Covenant but Prelates and their Priests, and none can validly have it from other hands: And so if you will but abate them the proof of many things that stand in the way, Heaven and Hell, Salvation and Damnation are at the will and mercy of such Prelates and Priests. But unhappily they cannot retrieve their old Opinion, but maintain that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59354:19"/>
and Women may baptize in necessity validly, and that Baptism puts one into a State of Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. As he that swears and keeps his Allegiance to the King is a Subject and Member of the Kingdom, though he be no Member of any Corporation; so, though he disown a thousand fellow Subjects; yea, though he deny the Authority of Constable, Justice, Judge; so he that is devoted to Christ truly in the Baptismal Covenant, is a Christian, and a Member of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, though he were of no particular Church, or did disown a thousand Members, or any particular Officer of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. All faults or crimes are not Treason: A man that breaketh any Law, is in that measure Culpable or punishable: but every breach of Law, or wrong to fellow Subjects or Justices, as it is not Treason, so it doth not prove a man no Subject; though some may be so great as to deserve death and make him intolerable: And so it is in the case of our Subjection in the Church to Christ.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. To own Christs Instituted <hi>species</hi> of Church Officers is needful to the just Order, Safety and Edification of the Church (as to own the Courts of Judicature, Justices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Kingdom) but to own this or that <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Officer</hi> as truly commissioned, is needful only to the right administration of his own Province.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. As Christ did his own work of <hi>universal Legislation</hi> by himself and his <hi>Spirit</hi> eminently in the Apostles and Evangelists, who have recorded all in Scripture, so he settled Churches to continue to the end associated for Personal Communion in his holy <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Order</hi> and <hi>Conversation</hi> with authorized Ministers, subordinate to his administration in his <hi>Prophetical, Priestly, Kingly</hi> and <hi>Friendly</hi> Relations. And thô these may not always or often meet in the same place, their neighbourhood maketh them capable of <hi>Personal</hi> presential Communion, as men that may know and admonish each other and meet by turns, and in presence manage their concerns; which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth single Churches of the lowest order from associated Churches of men, that have Communion only by others at distance.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. As Logicians say of other Relations, the <hi>matter</hi> must be capable of the <hi>end,</hi> or it is not capable of the name and form; so is it here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>e. g.</hi> It is no <hi>Ship</hi> that is made of meer Sponge or Paper, or that is no bigger than a Spoon; it is no Spoon that is as big as a Ship: One House is not a Village, nor one Village a City, nor a City a meer House. So twenty or an hundred or a thousand Parishes associate, cannot be a <hi>single Church</hi> of the <hi>first or lowest Order,</hi> being not capable of <hi>mutual Knowledge, Converse</hi> or <hi>personal present Communion:</hi> Nor are two or three Lay-men capable to be such a Church, for want of due matter. But supposing them capable, thô a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> Church have advantage for <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> yet a <hi>small</hi> and <hi>poor</hi> one is <hi>ejusdem ordinis</hi> as truely a Church; and so is their Pastor, as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eugubium</hi>; so <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Majuma,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gregory Neocaesar</hi> was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59354:20"/>
equally Bishop of nineteen at first, as after of all save nineteen in the City.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. If the Apostles have Successours in their care and Superiority over many Churches, it will prove that there should yet be men of eminent worth to take care of many Churches, and to instruct and admonish the younger Ministers: But it will neither prove 1. That they succeed the Apostles in the extraordinary parts of their Office. 2. Nor that they have any forcing power by the Sword. 3. Nor that one <hi>Church</hi> hath power over others by Divine right; for the Apostles fixed not their power to any particular Churches, but were general <hi>Visitors</hi> or Overseers of many: Yet if the same Man who is fixed in a particular Church, have also the <hi>visiting admonishing oversight</hi> of many as far as was an Ordinary part of the Apostles Office, and be called an Archbishop, I know no Reason to be against him.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. There be <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>Integral</hi> Acts of the Sacred Ministry instituted by Christ: These none may take the Power of from any Ministers, nor alter the <hi>species</hi> or <hi>integrity</hi> of the Office, by setting up any such Superious as shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of that which Christ hath instituted, or arrogating the like uncall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But as in <hi>worship,</hi> so in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Church Government,</hi> there are undetermined accidents: As to choose the time and place of Synods, to preside and moderate and such like: And these the Churches by agreement, or the Magistrate may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to some above the rest: And if the Magistrate affix Baronies, Honours, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, or his own due Civil forcing Power, and make the same Men Magistrates and Ministers, whether we think it prudent and well done or not, we must ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obey them.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. Some call these <hi>humane Accidental Orders, forms of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and affirm (as Bishop <hi>Reignolds</hi> did, and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and many excellent men by him cited) that no <hi>form</hi> of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of <hi>Divine Command.</hi> Which is true of all this second sort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is but Accidental and humane; but not at all of the first sort which is Divine and Essential to Christ himself first, and to Pastors as such by his appointment; so that the essential Government of the Universal Church, by Christ, and of each particular Church by Pastors specified by him (if not of Supervisors of many as succeeding Apostles and Evangelists in their Ordinary work) are of unalterable Divine right. But the humane forms are alterable: Such I account 1. The Presidency and Moderator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and accidental Government of one Bishop in a single Church over the other Presbyters, Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The accidental Government of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan as an Archbishop over these lowest Bishops and Churches. 3. And the Superiority of Metropolitans and Patriarchs over them, so it be but in such <hi>Accidentals</hi> and within the same <hi>Empire,</hi> not imposing a forreign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These <hi>tota specie</hi> differ from the Divine Offices.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. All these single Church being parts of the Universal are less noble than the whole, and are to do all that they do as members in Union with the <hi>Whole,</hi> and to do all as Acts of Communion with them.</p>
                     <p n="20">
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59354:20"/>XX. The General precepts of doing all to Edification, Concord, Peace, Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> oblige all the Churches to hold such correspondencies as are needful to these Ends: And Synods are one special means, which should be used as far and oft as the Ends require: And if National Metropolitans and Patriarchs order such Synods, I am not one that will disobey them. But if on these pretences any would make Synods more necessary than they are, and use them as Governours, by Legislation and Judgement over the Particular Bishops by the use of the Church Keyes, and will affixe to them or Metropolitans, besides an <hi>Agreeing Power</hi> and the said <hi>Government</hi> in Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals, a proper Church Government by <hi>making and unmaking Ministers</hi> or <hi>Christians, excommunicating</hi> and <hi>absolving</hi> as Rulers by the said Keyes, it may be a duty to disown such usurpations. As the King would disown an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Princes any where met that would claim a Proper Government of him and his Kingdom; Thô it were much to be wisht that all Christian Princes would hold such Assemblies for the Concord and Peace of Christendom.</p>

                     <p n="22">XXII. There is no Church on Earth so sound and Orthodox as to want no Integral part of Christian Religion: Proved: There is no man on Earth, much less any multitude, so sound as to want no Integral part: But all Churches consist only of Men; And therefore if all the Men be so far defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, all the Churches are so.</p>
                     <p>It is not their <hi>Objective Religion</hi> Generally and implicitely received that I mean, but their <hi>Subjective Religion,</hi> and their explicite reception of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective. The Scripture is our perfect Objective Religion in it self, and as an Object proposed, and in general and implicitely we all receive it. But as a man may say, I believe all that's in the Scripture, and yet be ignorant of the very Essentials in it; so a man may explicitely know and believe all the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials and more, and yet be ignorant of many Integrals.</p>
                     <p>All things in Scripture proposed to our Faith, Hope and Practice, are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals of our Religion: But no Christian understandeth all these proposals or words of Scripture: Therefore no Christian explicitely believeth them all, or practiceth all. To hold the contrary, is to hold that some Church is perfect in Understanding, Faith, Hope and Practice, without Ignorance, Errour or Sin: that is, not to know what a man or a Christian on Earth is.</p>
                     <p n="23">XXIII. Much less do all Churches agree in unnecessary indifferent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, nor ever did, nor ever will or can do.</p>
                     <p n="24">XXIV. The measuring out Churches by limits of Ground, Parochial or Diocesan, is a meer humane ordering of a mutable accident, and no Divine Determination: And if all were taken for Church members-because they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59354:21"/>
dwell in those precincts, it were wicked: But if it be but all in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts that are qualified Consenters, it is usually a convenient measure: But such as in many Cases must be broken.</p>
                     <p n="25">XXV. If a Church with Faithful Pastors be well setled in a place first where there are not more than should make up that one Church, it is not meet for any there to gather a distinct Church (thô of the same Faith) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such weighty reason as will prove it necessary, or like to do more good than hurt: 1. Because Love inclineth to the greatest Union; 2. Because a Great Church is more strong and honourable than a small, if the number be not so great as to hinder the Ends. 3. And the Ancient Churches kept this Union.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. If Magistrates make such Laws about Church Accidents as tend to further the Churches wellfare, or are so <hi>pretended,</hi> and not <hi>against it,</hi> we must obey them. But if they will either <hi>invade Christs Authority</hi> or <hi>cross it,</hi> by making Laws <hi>against his,</hi> or such as are <hi>proper to his Prerogative</hi> to make, or invade the <hi>Pastors Office,</hi> and the <hi>Churches proper right</hi> given by Christ, or determine Accidents to the <hi>Destruction of the Substance</hi> (the Church, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worship or Ends) these bind the Consciences of none to Obedience; but Christ must be obeyed, and we must patiently suffer.</p>
                     <p n="27">XXVII. Self-interest, Self-Government and Family-Government are all antecedent to Publick Government, which Ruleth them for the Common good, but hath no Authority to destroy them: No King or Prelate can bind a man to do that which would damn his Soul, nor to omit that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Salvation: All power is for Edification: They are Gods Ministers for Good.</p>
                     <p n="28">XXVIII. As it belongs to self-government to choose our own Dyet, and Cloaths, and Wives, and Physicians, (thô we may be restrained from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick hurt on such pretences;) And it belongs to Family Government to educate our own Children, and choose their Tutors, Callings, Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so it more nearly belongs to self-government to choose the most safe and profitable means of our own Salvation, which no man may forbid us; and to avoid that which is pernicious or hurtful; and to Family-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do the like for our Children.</p>
                     <p n="29">XXIX. It is false Doctrine of those late Writers who tell us, that only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments sanctifie or give right to Salvation: The whole Tenor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel tells us that men are brought to Faith and Repentance, and to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and Godly men, and by Faith to be justified, by the Preaching of the Gospel: and that Gods word is his appointed means of Salvation, which his Ministers must preach skilfully, instantly, in season and out of season, to that End: And if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.</p>
                     <p n="30">XXX. The Gospel saveth not like a Charm, by the bare sound or saying of the words; nor the Sacrament like an Amulet; But as a Moral means (specially blest by him that instituted it) to work on man as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the contrary Doctrine feigneth God to Work even constantly by Miracle: And as the Papists make every Mass-Priest a Miracle Worker in Transubstantiation, so do they that make the bare saying over the Words and doing the outward Acts in the Sacrament, to save us <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and the Pastoral teaching and oversight of an ignorant drunken Lad or Reader to be (near) as great a help to Salvation, as the Ministry of a wise skilful, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exemplary Pastor, and the clear affectionate Preaching of Gods word: And that tell us (as Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>) how sufficient a man is to administer the Sacramental Covenant that understands what a Covenant is in matters of Common Conversation.</p>
                     <p n="31">XXXI. If a Wise and Skilful and Conscionable Ministry be as needless to Edification and Salvation as some Men pretend, it is as needless that they should study to be such, and vain to Glory that they are such, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath such a Ministry, and vain to expect that men should pay them any more respect than I owed my Master that never preacht but once, and that drunken; (and divers very like him.) Or that they should use this as an argument to draw men to hear them.</p>
                     <p n="32">XXXII. If the King or Law should settle a Physician of his (or a Patrons) choice in every Parish, it were well done if it be but to have help at hand for Volunteers: But if he command all to use them and to use no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them or against them, where unskilful or untrusty men are placed, no man is bound to obey this command: No mens Law can dissolve the Law of Nature, nor disoblige a man from a due care of his Life, nor bind him to cast it away upon Obedience to ignorant or bad and treacherous Men. And a mans Soul is more precious than his Health or Life; and he is bound to greater care of it; and is no more to trust it on the will of his Superiours How vast is the difference between an ignorant rash Physician or Pastor, and one that is wise, experienced and trusty? They that scorn Men for going for <hi>greater edification</hi> from one to another, do not so if a man prefer a skilful Physician to one that kills more than he cures; or a skilful and careful Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for his Son, yea or a Farrier for his Horse.</p>

And what a Trade for the Booksellers? And why then should their own Books be so valued?

When Councils hereticated and condemned Thousands or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Priests and Bishops, whom Christian Emperours and Princes owned as Orthodox, they did not then think every Patron, Prince or Prelate a competent Judge with what Pastor Men should trust the conduct of their Souls: Nor did they think so that forbad men hearing fornicators; Nor <hi>Cyprian</hi> that required the People to forsake <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martial (&amp; Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorem Praepositum.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="35">XXXV. So full was the proof given in the Book called, <hi>The first Plea</hi> for <hi>Peace,</hi> that the Church from the beginning denyed Princes and Magistrates to be entrusted with the choice of Bishops, or Pastors to whom the Churches were bound to trust the conduct of their Souls, that he who denyeth it, is not worthy to be therein disputed with. And yet we doubt not but they may force Infidel Subjects and Catechumens to hear sound and setled Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Catechists; And may dispose of the Tythes, Temples and many other Accidents of the Church; and may drive on Pastors and People to their Duty.</p>
                     <p n="36">XXXVI. It is false Doctrine that <hi>two distinct Churches</hi> may not be in the same Precincts or City; This being a meer Accident which abundance of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses make unnecessary and unlawful: Which I shall prove.</p>
                     <p>That which is no where commanded by God, is no duty: But that there shall be but one Church (or Bishop) in the same Precincts, is not commanded of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. (Divine of Gods making.)</p>
                     <p>They own the Major in the case of <hi>Indifferent</hi> thing. If they deny the Minor let the affirmers prove any such command. We grant a command of Love and Concord, and a prohibition of all that is against them. But in many instances, to have several Churches in the same precincts, is not against them.</p>
                     <p>If they fly to the Canons of foreign Councils, the reason of them we shall weigh and duely regard; But they were National, and had their Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power only from their own Princes and their Counselling Power only from Christ: And we disown all foreign Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p n="37">XXXVII. In all these Cases following (and more) two Churches may be in the same precincts (yea and a City.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Case that several Bishops are called justly to dwell in the same City, or Diocess, and many of their Flock be with them, <hi>e. g.</hi> Many Bishops of <hi>England</hi> dwell long, yea mostly in <hi>London</hi> or in <hi>London</hi> Diocess: <hi>e. g.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Eli</hi> dwells in the Parish of St. <hi>Andrews Holbourn: Qu.</hi> Whether there he be a Subject to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> as his Pastor, and bound to obey him? or whether many out of his Diocess (thousands) may not as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dwell half the Year in <hi>London</hi> as he? And whether when he preacheth to them, he do it not as their Bishop (in <hi>London</hi> Diocess.) And so of many other Bishops that here reside.</p>
                     <p n="38">XXXVIII. 2. Either our Parish Churches are true Churches, or not. If
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59354:22"/>
not, the Separatists are so far in the right; And separate not from true Churches <hi>eo nomine</hi> because they separate from them. If yea, then many Churches are in the same City and Diocess. (Of their agreement and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the same Bishop I shall speak anon.)</p>
                     <p n="39">XXXIX. 3. In case that in one City there be resident Stranges, that are sent on Embassies, or live for Merchandize, or flee from Miseries, and are the Subject of other Princes, whose Laws and Customs they are under, <hi>e. g.</hi> At <hi>Frankford, Hamburgh, Middleburgh, Dantzick, Constantinople,</hi> there have been English distinct lawful Churches: And in <hi>London</hi> there are <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches: And if the King allowed a <hi>Swedish</hi> Church, a <hi>Danish</hi> Church, a <hi>Saxon</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with their several Bishops, who is so weak as to need proof that this is lawful, and they true Churches?</p>
                     <p n="40">XL. 4. In case men of different Language are not capable of mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse by personal communion or help: As <hi>Dutch, French, Italian, Greeks, Germans,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (oft in <hi>Dissert.</hi> and <hi>Annot.</hi>) do maintain that <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had a Church of <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> a Church of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>: And that the like distribution of Churches of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there was at <hi>Antioch, Alexandria</hi> and other places: And by this they Salve the Contradictions in Church History about the Succession of <hi>Linus, Cletus</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi>: And the Apostles setled not a sinful Church way.</p>
                     <p n="41">XLI. 5. Yea <hi>Grotius</hi> maintaineth that the Apostles setled the Churches at first not like the Jewish Priesthood, but in the order of their Synagogues; (<hi>de Imper. sum. Patest.</hi> and in <hi>Annot.</hi>) And that as there were divers Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues in a great City with their <hi>Archisynagogus</hi> and Elders, so there were divers Churches in a City with Bishops and Presbyters.</p>
                     <p n="42">XLII. 6. When there are a greater number of Persons in one City or precinct than can have any just personal Knowledge and Communion, and more than any one Bishop with his Presbytery can perform the needful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal oversight to, it is lawful and a duty, to gather another Church in that City or Precinct: But this is truly the Case of many great Cities, though worldly Wisdom have at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places oft denyed notorious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and experience. He that will gather up all the duties that Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> saith were charged on the Bishops (in his Annotations on all the Texts that name Elders and Bishops) if he can believe that any Bishop can perform the tenth part of them to all in the Diocess of <hi>London, York, Lincoln, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> &amp;c. I will not dispute against him if he maintain a Bishops Ubiquity, or that at once he can be in twenty places. But if they say, that what then was commanded them to do personally, they may do by others, I say, that if they may change the <hi>Work,</hi> they may change the <hi>Power,</hi> that specifieth the Office; and so it is not the same Office in <hi>specie</hi> instituted in Scripture: And then Lay-men may have Power to preach and administer Sacraments, and do the Office of Priests, and yet be no Priest (as Civilians do of Bishops) which is a Contradiction. Certainly if there be more Scholars in the City
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59354:23"/>
than one Master can Teach and Rule, it is no Schism to set up more Schools and Schoolmasters, but a duty. And if the Lord Mayor on pretence of City Government should put down but as great a part of Family Government, as those Diocesans do of Parochial Church Government, who allow none under them to be truly <hi>Episcopi Gregis,</hi> and have the power of their Church Keyes, I think that it were no Schism to restore Families so that the City might have more than one (entirely.)</p>
                     <p n="43">XLIII. 7. If the Soveraign Power upon Politick or Religious Reasons should determine, that <hi>e. g.</hi> Dr. <hi>A,</hi> and Dr. <hi>B,</hi> and Dr. <hi>C.</hi> shall all be Bishops in <hi>London,</hi> to such Volunteers of Clergy and Laity as shall choose each of them to be their Bishop, and this without altering their dwellings, no man can prove it sinful; And of his reasons the King is judge.</p>
                     <p n="44">XLIV. 8. If the Bishop or Clergy of a City, Diocess or Nation, do agree by Law or Canon to admit none to the Ministry or Communion that will not commit a known sin deliberately as the Condition of his Communion, it is a duty to congregate under other Pastors in those precincts. This is confest: If they should not only hold any errour, or practise sin, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men to subscribe and approve it, and say it is no sin, no man ought to do this; nor yet to live like an Atheist, and forsake all Worship because men forbid him, if it were but to subscribe one untruth: But alas, this is no rare Case: In one Emperours Reign all were Anathematized that subscribed not to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and quickly after all that did, or that would not renounce it: The same division and changes were made by the Councils against and for the Monothelites, <hi>de tribus Capitulis,</hi> Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when all Men living have many Errours, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> disclaimeth her Infallibility, and yet will receive no Minister that will not subscribe that there is nothing in her Books contrary to the word of God, the Case is hard. But when all the things mentioned in the <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> are proved lawful, we shall be more yielding in this Case.</p>
                     <p n="45">XLV. 9. If true and sound Christians mistakingly think one or many things to be heinous sins, (as Perjury, Lying, Renouncing Obedience to God, and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which are things indifferent, but of so great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that most Learned and Godly and Willing Men cannot discern the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and agree, and yet are not necessary nor just conditions of Ministry or Communion, and so it is the Imposer that entangleth them by difficulty in their dissent, it is not lawful for these men therefore to forbear all Church Worship, but must use it as they can.</p>
                     <p n="46">XLVI. 10. If any Church unjustly excommunicate such men; or others, they must not forbear all Church order and worship because men so excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them. No man must Sin to escape Excommunication; and every man in the World is a sinner; And therefore all the World must be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, if all Sinners must be so. As I before said, the times oft were when almost all the Bishops in the Empire were excommunicated by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59354:23"/>
Councils and Popes have oft excommunicated some for trifles and some for Truth end Duty. And such must not therefore renounce all Church Worship and Communion.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> do by their standing Law <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all (as aforesaid) that affirm any thing to be repugnant to Gods Word or sinful, in their whole Church Government, Articles, Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and so to stand till they Publickly revoke this as a wicked Errour. Now many Lords and Commoners in Parliaments, have spoken against some of these particulars; and some out of Parliament: Many Ministers have done the like when the King Commissioned them to treat for Alterations; And many when the Accusations or demands of others have called them to give a Reason of their Actions. Some have maintained that it is repugnant to Gods word that Lay Civilians should have the decretive Power of the Keyes, and that the Parish Minister must cast out of Communnion all that the Lay Doctors or Chancellors excommunicate, and all that dare not receive kneeling, and that they should deny Christendom to all that scruple the English sort of God-Fathers Covenants, and the transient Symbolical Image of the Cross, with abundance such things: Now all these are <hi>ipso sacto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. And thô they be not bound to avoid the Church till this be applicatorily declared, yet <hi>actually excommunicate</hi> they are, and that by a higher authority th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n the Bishops; and they know the Churches decree; and the Priests are sworn to Canonical Obedience; And he that will not tempt them to be forsworn, nor come into a Church that hath excommunicated him, seems therein excuseable: But must he therefore renounce the Church of God?</p>
                     <p n="47">XLVII. 11. If the People are so set against one Bishop for another, as that half being for one and half for the other, and both Orthodox, they cannot be perswaded to unite in one. A Council at <hi>Rome</hi> determined in the Case of <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Flavian</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that both of them should hold their distinct Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and so live in love and peace. And though one or both parties in this were mistaken Sinners, so are all morral men, who yet must not live like Atheists.</p>
                     <p n="48">XLVIII. 12. An undetermined accident must be so determined as most serveth to do the greatest good and avoid the greatest Evil: But whether divers Churches shall promiscuously live in the same City or Diocess or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, is an Accident not determined by God, and either way may be for the greatest good, as circumstances vary. <hi>e. g.</hi> When in a Church half cannot consent to condemn the words of <hi>Theodoret, Theodore Mopsuest,</hi> and <hi>Ibas,</hi> and half will condemn them with the Council; if these can serve God quiet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in Love and Peace in different Congregations, but cannot endure one another in the same, it is most for the Churches Peace that they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to joyn with those of their own Mind.</p>
                     <p>When one Pope declared that it's sound Doctrine to say [<hi>One of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was Crucified,</hi>] when another had declared that it is <hi>not sound Doctrine,</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59354:24"/>
they that held with one Pope, and they that held with the other might both be true Churches in different Assemblies: When <hi>Iustinian</hi> raised the bloody controversie between the <hi>Corrupticolae</hi> and the <hi>Phantasiastae,</hi> wise men thought both sides were true Churches: Yea and so did many wise men think of the Orthodox and <hi>Nestorians</hi> and many <hi>Eutychians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="49">XLIX. 13. It's a common case under Turks and Heathens, that they give liberty of Conscience for Christians of all parties: Now suppose that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Quaere, Whether this was <hi>Schismaticks separation.</hi>

pelting Crabs with a pole, the ground opened and swallowed him and his pole, that they could never be found (being a Cole-mine long on fire:) ever after that, when any one would goe out of Church at a blustering passage, Mr. <hi>Lapthorne</hi> would call to him, <hi>Remember Martin</hi>; Quere, Whether all these were separating Schismaticks?</p>
                     <p>But this is too far off: In <hi>Dunstans</hi> West, where Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> Preacheth, when I was licensed twenty years ago, at <hi>Christmas,</hi> as I was Preaching, some Lime or Stone fell down in the Steeple with the crowd, the Church being old and under suspicion, they all thought it was falling, and most ran out in tumult, and some cast themselves headlong from the Gallery for hast; when they were quieted and came in again, the Boyes in the Chancel broke a Wainscot Skreen with climbing on it, and the noise made them run out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; one old woman going out, cryed, It's just with God because I took not the first warning, Lord forgive me, and I'le never come again: Quere, Whether these, or at least this resolving Woman was a Schismatick, and separated from the Catholick Church?</p>
                     <p>If not, there is some separation that is not so bad as Murder; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Doctor should forgive it for the success; for the Parish hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on resolved to pull down the Church and build it new, a far better Fabrick where the Dr. now Preacheth; and it drove me away that I preacht there no more; Whether this new Church built where the old one had possession before, be not a Schismatical Separatist, I leave to him.</p>
                     <p n="52">LII. 2. <hi>Local</hi> Separation without <hi>Mental</hi> can make no culpable Schism; for <hi>Nil nisi Voluntarium est morale</hi>; if a man be imprisoned or be sick and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the Church, it is innocent Separation; I have been at no Church this half year, much against my will, O that God would heal me of this Separation!</p>

                     <p>If it be said, <hi>That for the sake of these we separate from the Church it self, and therefore from its essence</hi>; we abhor the accusation, and challenge them to prove it: If we separate from the Church essentially, it is either <hi>Locally</hi> or <hi>Mental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; not <hi>Locally,</hi> for we are yet in <hi>England,</hi> nor is <hi>Local distance only</hi> a sin; not <hi>Mentally,</hi> for we own it for a true Christian Kingdom, called <hi>a National Church,</hi> bound to serve Christ in Love and Concord to their Power: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the King to be the Governour, nor Christians to be Christians, no

nor the particular Churches and Ministers to be true (thô culpable) Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Ministers, nor their Sacraments to be true Sacraments; we profess to hold with them one Catholick Body, one Spirit, one God, one Christ, one Faith, one Baptism (in the essentials) and one Hope, and are ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to live in Concord with them in all other things, as far as will stand with our Obedience to God; so that we separate not from the Church of <hi>England as such,</hi> but from some of its <hi>Accidents,</hi> which we dare not be guilty of.</p>

Schism, they must run upon worse, till grace recover them, which is not at their command. And yet all notorious Offenders are prohibited it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non 26. and particularly the Perjured: And if the tenth part so many be perjured in <hi>England</hi> in City and Countrey, as many fear, it's a very great number that are uncapable of Communion with the Church.</p>

By Canon fourty ninth no Person not Licensed as a Preacher, may <hi>in his Cure or elsewhere, expound any Scripture, or Matter or Doctrine,</hi> but onely shall study to read plainly the Homilies: So that all Ministers before Licence to preach, all School-masters, all Parents, or Masters, that do expound to their Schollars, Children or Servants, the meaning of Baptism, or of any Article of the Creed, any Petition of the Lords Prayer, any one of the Ten Commandments (to fit them for Confirmation, or Salvation) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by plain reading the Homilies or Church Catechism, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Law of the Church: And so do all Tutors in the Universities that expound any Scripture, matter or Doctrine to their Pupils, before they are examined or approved by the Bishop; or any Judge on the Bench or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice that presumeth to do it to the hearers, or any Friend or Neighbour in discourse: For it is [<hi>No Person whatsoever not examined and approved by the Bishop of the Diocess.</hi>] How few in <hi>England</hi> separate not from the Church as far as this disobedience amounts to? If by [no <hi>Persons</hi>] be meant only [<hi>no Ministers</hi>] it's hard enough, that Ministers may not be allowed out of the Church what Lay-men are allowed.</p>

utterly unable to Teach otherwise than by Reading, may not lawfully be encouraged in so high a function, (any more than a man in Physick or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaching that hath not necessary skill, or is utterly illiterate,) and thinks it a sin to consent to take such an Ignorant fellow for the Pastor of his Soul if he can have better; If this man, I say, go to the next Parish Church for Sacraments, he is to be suspended first and next excommunicate: Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he should judge that Ignorant Reader, no true Minister for want of necessary capacity.</p>

                     <p n="40">40. All <hi>Ministers</hi> must be <hi>suspended</hi> and then <hi>excommunicate,</hi> that <hi>without the Bishops Licence appoint or keep any solemn Fasts publickly or in private houses, other than by Law appointed, or be wittingly present at any:</hi> Though it were in time of Plague, or when divers of his Neighbours are sick or troubled in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or in preparation to a Sacrament, or on some great occasion in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mens Houses and Chappels: He is not to be trusted to fast and pray with his own Flock or Friends, or come among them, lest being excommunicate he be a damn'd Schismatick.</p>

                     <p n="48">48. They unchurch and damn the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Laodicea, Ephesus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. in the Apostles dayes: For the Scripture tells us of many guilty of Schism in all these, and yet the rest communicated with them; for the Scripture speaks more of <hi>Schism in a Church,</hi> than of <hi>Schism or Separation from a</hi> Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. &amp; 3.3. &amp; 11.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 52, 53. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.15, 16.

                     <p n="49">49. They separate from or unchurch almost all the Ancient Churches in the dayes of the most famous Emperours and Councils: For I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested past doubt that they almost all did Hereticate or separate from one another.

The owning or disowning several Councils, specially that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> and that at <hi>Const. de tribus Capitulis,</hi> &amp;c. was the Schism of almost all the Imperial Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; one part condemning the other. And if either were in the Right, it salves not the Case with them: For most of the same men that went that way call'd the Right in one Princes Reign, went contrary in the next, and so condemned each other round; especially about Images adoration.</p>

that they would have them and cannot? And why cannot they?</p>
                     <p n="58">58. Their Principles make the Bishop of <hi>Oxford, Bristol,</hi> &amp;c. Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: For their Dioceses are Churches taken out of Churches, being late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts of other Dioceses.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. And they condemn all the Parish Churches in <hi>England</hi> as Churches distinct from Cathedrals: For they are all Churches gathered out of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: At first the Cathedrals were the only single Churches: Next Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were gathered; and next our Parish Churches. And the Parish Church of <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> is a Church taken out of a Church.</p>
                     <p n="60">60.

And many more such.</p>
                     <p>Abundance more instances of their Separation, and Damnation, I might adde: In a word, I think their Principles are, as I first said, for damning and separating from all men living; for all men living are gulity of some sort and degree of Schism, that is, of Errours, Principles or Practices in which they culpably Violate that Union and Concord that should be among Christians and Churches: Every defect of Christian Love, and every sinful Errour, is some degree of such a violation. All Christians differ in as great matters as things indifferent: And no man living knoweth all things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to be such: And these men distinguish not of Schism, nor will take notice of the necessary distinctions given (in the third Part of the Treatise of Church Concord,) And <hi>solutio continui</hi> causeth pain: nor do they at all make us understand what sort of Separation it is that they fasten on, but talk of Separation in general, as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p n="87">LXXXVII. They seem to be themselves deceived by the Papists in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Cyprians</hi> words <hi>de Vnit. Eccles.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59354:34"/>
from all the Church that hath profest Communion with him, and with all the Councils and Churches that joyned with him: For <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and his Council erred by going too far from the Schism and Heresie of others, nullifying all their Baptisms, Ordinations and Communions: And for this errour they declared against the Judgment of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and other Churches; and they were for it condemned as Schismaticks by the said Bishop: And here is a far wider Separation than we can be charged with. 2. And <hi>Cyprians</hi> words came from the Mind that was possest with these opinions, and are expressive of his Inclination. 3. Yet they are true and good, understood as he himself oft expounds them; the Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> citeth some instances, many more are obvious, in which he opposeth the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> saying, that none of them pretendeth to be a Bishop of Bishops; and limiting every man to his own Province, and saying that they were to give account to none but God, with much the like.</p>
                     <p>But in what sence is <hi>Episcopacie one</hi>? 1. Undoubtedly not as <hi>numerically</hi> in the <hi>personal Subjectum Relationis</hi>: One Bishop is not another; if you should say <hi>Paternity is One,</hi> none believe that one mans Relation of Paternity is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The <hi>Relation</hi> is an accident of its own Subject, as well as Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Nor doth any man believe that many Bishops go to make up one Bishop in Naturals. 3. Nor did ever <hi>Cyprian</hi> hold or say that all Bishops go to make up one Politick Governing Aristocracie, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go to make one Senate or Parliament, that hath a power of Legislation and Judgment by Vote as one <hi>Persona politica.</hi> He never owned such a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Episcopatus unus est,</hi> 1. <hi>In specie,</hi> all Bishops have one Office; 2. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè</hi>: As the Catholick Church is one, whose welfare all Bishops ought to seek: 3. And so <hi>finaliter</hi> as to the remote End; and are bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour Concord. 4. And as effects, all are from <hi>one efficient institutor.</hi> As it may be said that all <hi>official Magistracy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is one: 1. As from one King or <hi>summa potestas</hi>: 2. As described by one Law, and as Justices of one <hi>Species</hi>: 3. As all their Cities and Counties and Hundreds are but part of one Kingdom, whose welfare all are for: 4. And as they are all bound to keep as much common Concord as they can; if any mean more, they should tell us what: If any mean that all Bishops make one numerical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Government, they are heinous Schismaticks, and the Kingdom is Sworn against their Judgment: And these Men damn them in damning Schismaticks.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Cyprian de Vnitate Ecclesiae</hi> (leaving out the Papists additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) is a good Book, and worthy to be read of all; and take <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Description of the Episcopacy of the Church which we must unite with, and the nature of that Union, and we would rejoyce in such. But if <hi>Cyprian</hi> had lived to see either <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Donatists</hi> the greater number, or any Sect after call themselves the Church because that Princes set them up, and had seen them depose <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and such other, doubtless he would never have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59354:34"/>
pleaded the Unity of Episcopacy for this, but have judged as he did in the Case of <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Basilides</hi>; nor did he ever plead for an universal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p n="88">LXXXVIII. If we are damned Schismaticks, I can imagine no pretended manner of Separation in which our Schism consists, but first, either Local as such. 2. Or Mental, as such. 3. Or Local, caused by Mental.</p>
                     <p>If Local, as such be it: All Christians are Schismaticks, for being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally separated from others, and absent from all Churches and places save one.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Mental Separation</hi> be it, either all <hi>Mental Division</hi> is such, or but some only; if <hi>all,</hi> then all mortal men are Schismaticks, as differing in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things from others; If it be not all, what is it? is it all difference in the <hi>Essentials of Christianity?</hi> we grant it; and we are charg'd with no such thing.

What, I say, if the People now mistooke who had the best Title? Is this separating from the Catholick Church? When the <hi>Interim</hi> cast out hundreds in <hi>Germany</hi>; When <hi>Ludovicus</hi> cast out Multitudes in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and half the People stuck to the ejected, persecuted Pastor, and the rest to the Magistrates choice, which of them separated from the Universal Church? Is every Priest the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> or an <hi>essential</hi> part of it? then it dyeth when he dyeth, and Apostatizeth when he doth. How many Ages in above 23 Duplicates or Schisms, was the World uncertain which was the true Pope? suppose, <hi>e. g.

If not, I know where the old Canons laid the charge and danger. It's wonderful selfishness in those men, that if they can but get into the Seat, take it for granted, that all must own their right on pain of Damnation.</p>

And I would advise these men, did they not despise my advice, for the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> sake, and their own, to retract their Errours, and not lay such a Snare before the People. Should you say in the Pulpit, [<hi>If the Church be guilty of any Schism by her Impositions,</hi> (oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named) <hi>Excommunications and silencing of Christs Ministers, and afflicting good people without just Cause, then I, and all that communicate with it and me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the guilt of Schism,</hi> and are all <hi>in as much danger of Damnation by it as Adulterers and Murderers</hi>] tell not your hearers this, for if you do, some will think you bid them <hi>separate</hi> or be <hi>damned,</hi> and only make a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most men have Noses or not.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> No, it's false: There are twenty cases in which 1.

And as many in which he is not at all guilty that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth with the guilty.</p>
                     <p>And let the world (that is sober and awake) judge now whether these men or we be the greater Schismaticks, and which more condemneth or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> We say that all Churches have some degree of Schism, and so hath the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it hath imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Errour and Sin; but that it is not therefore <hi>no Church,</hi> nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to communicate with it; All Christians and Churches must not be separated from that are guilty of some degree of Schism.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59354:36"/>
those that approve of their Communion and come to them: Joyning with you signifyeth that they are of your way therein; But will you go to <hi>their Churches</hi> and <hi>Communicate</hi> with them? You will receive the damned Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks if they come to you, when yet you make it damnable to joyn in their meetings with them. This quibbling beseems not grave men in great matters.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, Reader, God having allowed more Legislative Power to men in things <hi>Secular</hi> than in Religion, I may say this case is like ours in debate.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Some Judges and Lawyers say, that the Oath of Allegiance makes a Subject in this Kingdom; that the <hi>Renouncing</hi> or Violating it by <hi>Treason,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>deserting the Kingdom,</hi> overthrows the Relation. But that other particular faults or quarrels against Neighbours, Justices, Judges, yea the King himself, are punishable according to the Laws, but are not all Rebellion, nor dissolve Subjection, nor oblige the Subjects to renounce ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil converse with each other; though some contempt and obstinacy may outlaw them. Such is our Judgment of Church Relation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I need not rehearse.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Suppose a sect of Lawyers and Judges arise, that say, no men are the Kings Subjects, but are Rebels, that break any of his Laws, that Shoot not in long Bows, that Bury not their dead in Woollen, that swear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, that eat flesh in <hi>Lent</hi> unlicensed, that have any unjust Law-Suit, that wrong any Neighbour, that oppress any Poor man, all these are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; yea all that plead opposite Causes at the Bar, and all Judges that judge contrary to one another, and all that misunderstand any point of Law and Practice accordingly, and all that besides the Oath of Allegiance do constitute Marriages, Families, Schools, Societyes by any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of their own, and all that are of different Cities and Companies, parts of the Kingdom, or all whose Justices, Mayors, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differ from one another in any point of Law and practice: Or all that obey not every Constable and Justice; or that go to divers Justices in the same Precincts, or that go from one Justice to another to avoid unrighteous Judgment, or that go from the Physician of the Place for Health, and from the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Town for greater edification, or that Travel beyond Sea for Knowledge, yea all that understand not every word in the Law, that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them: If any say, none of these are the Kings Subjects, but Rebels, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to him and one another, and deserve to be all hang'd as Murderers, and so are all that have Communion with them; <hi>Quaere,</hi> 1. Whether these men are for the Unity of <hi>England</hi>? 2. And are Friends to the King that deprive him of all his Subjects; as much as those that would have him have no Subjects, that be not of the same Age, Stature, Complexion and Wit. 3. And whether they are Friends to Mankind? 4. And whether they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59354:37"/>
condemn not themselves if they live not as Anchorets, out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society. 5. And whether that Nation be not by infatuation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Destruction that would believe them, and would hate, scorn and ruine them that are of the first mentioned opinion, according to the saying, <hi>Quos perdere vult Iupiter, hos dementat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the more dangerous Doctrine now threatning this Land, that would subject <hi>England</hi> to a Foreign Jurisdiction, on pretence of a Necessity of either an Universal Church Monarch, or Church-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Senate or Council, or of all the Church on Earth represented by Patriarchs or Metropolitans, or that plead for <hi>Subjection to them,</hi> under the Name of Communion, they require a distinct Answer. But Dr. <hi>Is. Barrow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beverley's</hi> Catholick Catechism, have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done it.</p>

                  <head>The Reasons of Mr. <hi>Raphson,</hi> and such others, against going to the Parish-Churches, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</head>
                  <p>THE Matter of his Book, as against Persecution, is very considerable; the Stile is very close and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: His Doctrine against Communion with the Churches that use the Liturgy, is that which I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>The sum of it is, 1. That kneeling at the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, and the use of the Liturgy, are unlawful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they are false Worship, and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the places where they are used, are Idol-Temples.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That to joyn there in them, is to partake in Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The proof of all this is by this Argument;
<q>Worship not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, is not lawful; but kneeling in receipt of Bread and Wine, is Worship not instituted by Christ: therefore not lawful; therefore

not pleasing, <hi>p.</hi> 160, 161. To which, by way of Motive, he addeth, <hi>p.</hi> 275. How many once in the separation, are returned back to the Vomit they once cast up, and wallow in the mire of a worldly worship? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is compliance in Idol-Temples, going to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> bowing to <hi>Baal,</hi> sitting, or drinking with the supers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>itious in acts of religious adoration, a witness for, or against defection? Are you turned as silly sheep (that once were called shepherds), to bleat after other shepherds, that Christ never sent, nor bid you go after them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Looks it not like a declining of the Camp of Christ, the work of the Gospel, and setting your face towards <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp;c.? Is scandal of no weight with you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>? How dare you venture your souls to sit under Means that he says shall not profit you; and which is worse, lies under his curse? <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.32.</q>
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. with more such. Either this Writer knoweth how ill he dealeth with his Reader, or not: If he do, it's a double fault: if not (which I think), it's a doleful case, that every well-meaning man, that can but be confident in his ignorance and error, and father it on God, should become such a snare to them that cannot see through his Pretences, and should himself suffer for sinning, and call it the Cause of God, and condemn all that sin not as confidently as he; and hereby harden his afflicters, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them his weakness, and impenitently justifying his sin.</p>
                  <p>If he would not have ensnared his Reader, he should first have opened the meaning of the words of his Question, that they might know how much of the Dispute is <hi>material,</hi> and how much only about words. 2. And then he should have so proved his assertion and accusation, as might satisfie a good Conscience in a matter wherein God, the Church, and Souls, are so much concerned; and not have poured out Accusations by way of Motives, upon unproved and false suppositions.</p>
                  <p>I find but one Argument, which I shall now answer plainly:</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Major</hi> is, [<hi>Worship not instituted, is not lawful</hi>]. Ans. 1. The word [<hi>Worship</hi>] in general, signifieth, 1. <hi>Any thing done in honour to another</hi>; and so all our obedience to God is Worship: It is to his glory that we must do all. I suppose that this he meaneth not. 2. <hi>Any immediate act or expression of the honour and reverence of the heart.</hi> If this be not it that he meaneth by <hi>Worship,</hi> I know not what he meaneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59354:40"/>This <hi>Worship,</hi> as <hi>within,</hi> is the secret act of the soul; as exprest, it is the act of the body.</p>
                  <p>Of such Worship there are two sorts: One sort is made necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, statedly, by God's commanding it in particular. To this no man must add the like, or from it diminish any thing so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, either pretending God's authority, or his own. The other sort is but the subordinate <hi>ordering</hi> of the former, and is but the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it. This God doth not institute in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but only give man a general Rule, how to choose it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; which is, That all be done in love, and to edification, decently and in order.</p>
                  <p>Either this latter sort is to be called <hi>Worship,</hi> or not: If it be, then it falls under his opposition: If not, then, 1. He must give us a definition of Worship, which shall exclude it; and so <hi>Worship</hi> must be somewhat else than the <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>immediate acting</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing honour to God:</hi> And then who knows what he meaneth by it? 2. And then when we plead for mens making none but this, he should to avoid deceit, confess that the Controversie is only <hi>of the Name</hi> (whether Modes and Circumstances of God's instituted Worship, may be <hi>called Worship</hi>), and not at all of the <hi>Thing</hi> (whether it be lawful or not): This had been like a Christian Teacher.</p>
                  <p>Now I answer, 1. to his first Proposition: 1. Worship which is neither instituted particularly, nor in the general, appointing man how to choose it, is unlawful. 2. And to invent worship without God's allowance, contrary, or of the same kind, as if he had not done his part, is unlawful. 3. But for man to choose and use such worship as is but the right ordering of God's Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is commanded by him, and a Duty; and therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to his <hi>Minor,</hi> or Second Proposition, I answer, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and communicating with Parish Churches that have tollerable Ministers, are not instituted of God in particular, but the Genus of them is instituted, and we commanded to choose our selves, according to God's general Rules, to the best of our understanding: and so they are our Duty, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p>I give the Instances of these two sorts of worship:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59354:41"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> God hath Instituted, that our Minds Worship him, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and receiving all his Gospel Revelations, and trusting them; and in desiring all things Petitioned in the Lords Prayer, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to all commanded in the Scriptures; and in Dedicating our selves to him cordially in Baptism, and renewing it in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in commemoration of Christ's Death, till he comes. He hath Instituted the Corporal Expresions of all these; That we confess Christ in all the necessary Articles of Faith; That we ask the Petitions of the Lords Prayer; That we perform the Commands of the Decalogue towards God, and all others in the Scripture. These are the Instituted Worship which none must alter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Ordering,</hi> which is the Second sort (which I leave every one to call <hi>Worship,</hi> or not, when they have defined Worship) which man may, and must chuse himself, without any Particular Institution of God, contain such Acts as these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Undetermined gestures of Reverence and Honour in time of Publick Worship. As to be uncovered, or put off the Hat at Prayer, or the Lord's Supper. This we do directly in honour and reverence to God, whom we there Worship; and therefore it is it self a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate act of Worship.</p>
                  <p>So to stand, or kneel at Prayer, and not to sit. Though in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we read of sitting, standing, kneeling, and prostration: yet no one of these is made necessary by Institution: yet are they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Acts of Worship, expressing our inward Worship of God: And the reason why being uncovered, or kneeling, are now chosen, is not a particular Institution, but because the Custom of the Country hath made them the most congruous Expression of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worship: when as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That then and there it was a shame for a man to be covered: and the whole Church for many hundred years forbad all kneeling, in Adoration, on the Lord's Days. And more,</p>
                  <p>To these I add, the gesture of the Adult in Baptism, whether they shall be Baptized kneeling, to signifie Humble Reception, or not, is left to choice.</p>
                  <p>So is the Gesture in singing Psalms: If any think, that speaking to God by prayer, praise, or thanksgiving in Psalms, should in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God be done Standing, or Kneeling, rather than Sitting, it is no addition to God's Institution. And that we commonly use sitting in Psalmody, and not when we Pray in Prose, is meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Custom maketh one more offensive than the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59354:41"/>The same I say of the Gesture of Preaching, which some do sitting with their Hats on, and others stand to avoid a seeming disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods Name and Service. Also, some holy Nonconformists I have known, that would rarely name God but with their Hats put off, or bowing their Heads; or with Hands and Eyes lift up towards Heaven. (Old Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi> at <hi>Tipton</hi> near <hi>Dudley,</hi> did thus use to shew such Reverence, when he named God, that would strike Reverence into those that saw and heard him: and hath oft Affected me more than a Sermon.) This was External Worship, not Instituted in the particulars, but in general of Reverence to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another instance is in <hi>Vows to God,</hi> which are acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: But for the <hi>Matter</hi> of them, several things may be Vowed which are not <hi>particularly</hi> commanded, but onely in the General. And for the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> I do not think that Mr. <hi>Raphson</hi> can shew me all that <hi>Vow</hi> called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in any particular Institution; and yet I conjecture, that he taketh it not to be Idolatry, nor Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Instance is, in things <hi>devoted</hi> and <hi>offered to God</hi> The Scripture in general saith, <hi>Honour God with thy substance, and with the first Fruits of thy increase.</hi> And that Christians at first sold all, and laid at the Apostles Feet; which yet <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Ananias</hi> he might have chosen not to do. And for many hundred years after, they brought their Weekly Donations for the Ministers, Sacraments, and Poor, to the Altar, and Offer'd it first to God: And so <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> give their Collections as to God, for the Saints. But no Institution told them how much they should give, but the General Rule.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Instance is, the length or degree of outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: If I pray two hours rather than one, it is an act of Honour or Worship, not particularly commanded.</p>
                  <p>So whether men shall in Publick read one Chapter, or two; sing one Psalm or two, or more, is undetermined by God</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another is about set Days and Hours for Worship; as to keep a yearly Thanksgiving for Deliverance from the Powder Plot; the Spanish Invasion; for the Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So also Fasts, and what days Lectures shall be kept, and what hour: And what day and hour the Lord's Supper shall be Administred; which are Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Acts of Worship.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another Instance is in the choice of Psalms and Hymns: the use of <hi>Davids</hi> are Lawful, and so are others: but no Institution
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59354:42"/>
tyeth us to <hi>One,</hi> but leaveth us to chuse.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Another Instance is in the <hi>Tunes</hi> and Metre of Psalms, which we use as Subordinate Acts of Worship. It is but lately that the Churches used Metre and Melody of Tune; but <hi>Prose</hi> read with a loud Voice: yet I hope we are not Idolaters for our Metre and Melody: which I may say also of Church Musick, which <hi>David</hi> used, and we may do, where it's Edifying; but it's no Institution now. Yea, when <hi>Paul</hi> directs the Church to use Psalms, <hi>Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs</hi>; which is for <hi>singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord,</hi> and therefore it is Worship, which some men must indite and make.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Another Instance is, in the versions of the Psalms of <hi>David</hi>; where among many we may chuse which seems best.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Another Instance is, in the publick and private Reading of the Scriptures Translated: where every word is the work of man: God wrote it not in <hi>English,</hi> but in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi>; but man Translates it, some well, and some defectively; yet I hope, an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Bible is not an Idol.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So also the dividing the Scriptures into Chapters, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which are the Works of man, is no Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And another Instance is, the Method and Words of Sermons and Prayers: whether a Minister shall Preach by way of Doctrine, Reason, and Use; or otherwise: and Expound by way of Paraphrase, or otherwise; what words he shall use, God hath not instituted in particular; but mens invention maketh these, some suddenly, and some beforehand.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Another Instance is, the use of helps, or written Words; Whether one shall use Notes in Preaching, and read them, or not? Whether the words of a Prayer shall be written, and read, or not; God hath not determined. And so Books of Catechism, Publick Confessions, Prayers, Meditations as formed, are all the works of man, and no Idolatry. And if Parents impose words of Prayer on their Children, it is no Sin; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and 11. shew.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Another Instance is in the form of Ordination, when the Words and many Circumstances are undetermined. Imposition of Hands is a lawful Sign: and so is doing it by a Writing, or by meer Words, without that Imposition; some receive it Kneeling, some Standing; some by one Form of Words, some by another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some from one Ordainer, some from many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And none of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Institution.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59354:42"/>14. The same is true of Discipline; The Form of Words for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, for Absolution, for Excommunication, for the Penitents Confession and Request, are left to Humane Wisdom, so the matter and manner be regulated by the general Law. And they that say, that God hath Instituted, that the Church shall be Governed Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily by fixed Classes, with Appeals to National Synods, and that here a <hi>Major</hi> Vote hath Governing Power over the lesser part; yea, and that these must be made up of Two sorts of Elders, of which one sort are un-ordained, or are not Authorised to Administer the Word and Sacraments, do but add to the Word of God, if they say these National Assemblies are the Supreame Church-Power; what Law of God did ever Institute, That a Minister, or Classis, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>Geneva, Breme, Scotland,</hi> is not as much subject to the Decrees of a larger Council of many Nations; and that the Synod at <hi>Dort</hi> had not as much Power as a lesser at <hi>Hague</hi>: or a Synod of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as much as one in <hi>Scotland</hi>? But if (as by parity of Reason they must) they say, that General or large Councils are the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of National Assemblies, as they are of Classis and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: then they bring us under a Foreign Jurisdiction, which the Kingdom is sworn against; and I think they are <hi>Papists,</hi> but of the <hi>French</hi> sort, who make General Councils Superior Governours of the Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>And if they determine the bounds of Church-Power, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates Laws, and yet damn <hi>Erastians,</hi> they seem in ignorance to deal too hardly with themselves.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Another Instance is, in the Place of Publick Worship: God hath not determined where the Assembly shall meet: where the Pulpit, Font, Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall stand. And if great and lofty Structures, called Temples, be Built, purely to shew how we honour God, and Religion: as <hi>Constantine,</hi> and others after him, did at <hi>Constantinople, Alexandria, Ierusalem,</hi> over the Grave of Christ, and all over the <hi>Empire</hi>: this Actual Expression of Honour to God, is <hi>Cultus modalis &amp; secundarius,</hi> a subservient sort of Worship, and no Idolatry, but Lawful.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The same I say of Church Utensils: If for the Honour of God and Religion, the Pulpits, and Tables have Ornaments of Silk, Cups, and Trenchers, and Flaggons of Silver; the Font and Seats have some special Neatness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is left to Man's Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any particular Institution, and is no Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And if as Judges and Lawyers have distinguishing Habits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59354:43"/>
Ministers have <hi>so,</hi> (officiating, and at other times) to no worse end (or manner) than the said Utensils are put; I know no Institution that is crost by it, nor that forbids it.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Another Instance may be of Speaking in the Assembly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it shall be One Minister, or Two, or Three. Whether Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may not be Interlocutors by Questions, yea, and sometime Preach and Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God hath not particularly determined, but left to Human Choice.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Many good Christians knowing the Lord's Day to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Day of Thanksgiving for the greatest Mercies, do as an Act of Honour wear their best Cloathes, and Feast themselves and the Poor accordingly that day: This is Lawful, by the General Law; but not particularly Instituted by God.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Professing Signs in our Covenantings with God, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of our Religion, are left to be chosen onely by the General Laws of Edification, and Order. When a Nation, or Church, or Person renew their Covenant with God, and their Confession of Faith, it may be done (when the Ruler demandeth their consent) either by <hi>word,</hi> or by <hi>subscribing</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by <hi>lifting up the hand,</hi> or by <hi>standing up,</hi> or by <hi>bowing the Head</hi>; for these are all, or most found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture instances; yea, sometimes they fell <hi>by Prostration to the Ground</hi>: yea, and so they oft did in receiving a Charge or Message from God, by his Ministers.</p>
                  <p>I will add no more Instances; These are enough. If yet it be said, That none of these be <hi>acts of Worship</hi>: I again Answer, 1. Then do not by Slander call them so, and say still, that Man's inventing or using these, is using <hi>false Worship.</hi> If they be <hi>no Worship,</hi> they are no <hi>false Worship.</hi> Confess then, that it's but a <hi>bare name</hi> that you charged with Idolatry: for its onely such things as these that we would add. 2. But <hi>de nomine,</hi> If an Action done directly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God be to be called <hi>Worship</hi>; some of these at least may be called <hi>Secondary subordinate Worship</hi>: But if you appropriate the Name to Gods <hi>stated Ordinances,</hi> these must not be called <hi>Worship</hi>; but the <hi>manner, order, circumstances,</hi> or <hi>accidents</hi> of Worship. But call them what you will, they are but what God alloweth, and the <hi>General</hi> of them he commandeth.</p>
                  <p>I need not say much to his Applicatory Words. 1. To return from <hi>Separation,</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> is as fitly called, a <hi>Returning to their Vomit,</hi> as returning from Drunkenness and Fornication, to Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Chastity may be so called. Repentance is casting up our Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59354:43"/>2. The Names of <hi>bowing to Baal, Dan and Bethel, Babylon, Idols,</hi> &amp;c. are as easily used by Quakers, Ranters, Familists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against all God's Church and Worship: And they were worn so thread-bare by the railing Separatists (then called <hi>Brownists</hi>), against the Old Learned Godly Nonconformists, that they turned to the Speakers reproach. And I suppose he knoweth that the <hi>Scots</hi> were called as bad, and worse, by the Army that conquered them in 1650, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>sitting or drinking with the superstitious in acts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adoration, is a sign of defection.</hi> This would make all Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders who so <hi>sit and drink with him,</hi> and such as he, who is so superstitious, as to turn sin into duty, and duty into sin, and falsly father Laws on God: Yea, that is worse than superstitious, as is after manifested. 2. Superstition is an offering somewhat as pleasing to God, which is not pleasing to him. All Christians have some degree of this in <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi>; for we know but in part, and prophesie in part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so no Christians must joyn with others. But must they not give over all Religious Duty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, seeing their own defects more defile them than other mens? 3. Christ doth not disown all imperfect worship that hath some Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: And we must receive one another as Christ receiveth us. 4. It was Superstitious persons that <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to receive to Communion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. Thus he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apostles, and the Churches then, and the Scripture it self. 6. It is dreadful revolting to choose rather forbearance of all Church Communion, than to Communicate with our Parish Churches, when better cannot be had, and men are not forced to any sin themselves. And he that will communicate with none that sin in Preaching, Prayer, Sacraments, shall communicate with none 7. It is a gross Service of Satan and Popery, to fight against Love and Unity, and bring all the Publick Assemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der disgrace, as unlawful, that Popery may take possession unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His words of [<hi>silly Sheep bleating after any Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c.] are but a Net to catch silly Souls. It's the common Trap of the Papists, to put ignorant people to prove the Calling of the Ministers, or forsake them. They that preach the Gospel, and do the Office (tho faultily), and are in possession, have a Calling sufficient to justifie the Hearers, when it may not be enough to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59354:44"/>
justifie themselves: A better Call than the High Priests that Christ did send men to.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to the Argument of Scandal; It is of dreadful weight to deter a tender Conscience (as from conforming to sin, so) from his groundless Separation, and war against Unity and Love.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>That</hi> God saith <hi>such Means shall not profit; yea, curseth it,</hi> is a slander against God and Scripture, and all the Church on Earth that's known; by perverting and misapplying the Text.</p>
                  <p>I shall now better prove the lawfulness of using such things as these, than he hath proved it unlawful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which no Law of God, or valid Law of Man, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, is not unlawful: but the use of the things forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, no Law of God, or valid Law of Man forbids: Therefore the use of the things forementioned, is not unlawful.</p>
                  <p>He that will say that there is any such Law, must shew that Law, and prove his Affirmative: But let him take heed of adding to God's Law: A false Prophet that fathered a false Message from God, was an heinous sinner. Is it not worse falsly to father a <hi>Law</hi> on him?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they will say, that <hi>God forbids adding or diminishing:</hi> I answer, He doth so: Therefore let them take heeed of it, who say his Law forbids that which it never forbad, but in general commandeth. If we must not add to the Laws of the Land, yet the Bookbinder that covereth them, and the Lawyers and Judges that expound them, do not add thereby to the Law. When the Hearers bowed, and prostrated themselves in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, they did not by this add to the Law; nor yet when they made a Vow uncommanded, or a Free-Will Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And I think it was no sinful addition to the Law, for the Publican to smite his Breast, and look downward; and when <hi>Ieremy</hi> said, <hi>No man smiteth on his thigh, and saith, what evil have I done?</hi> The meaning is not, No man idolatrously giveth God false worship. And I think, that they that rent their clothes to express their repentance, did not add to God's Word, nor yet do it as necessary worship, tho <hi>Ioel</hi> says, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59354:44"/>Some Object, That <hi>Christ's sitting at the Sacramental Supper,</hi> is a Law to us, forbidding any other gesture. But this Author professeth, that all the actions of Christ, or his Apostles, are not Laws binding us to do the like: If they be, we break many such Laws; as when we do not eat a full Meal before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when we do it not without women, only to a Family, or to Twelve, only to Teachers, in an upper Reom, in an Inn, or Private House, and that we do not lie along, leaning, as they did; especially when we take it not at Supper-time, and turn the Lord's Supper to a Breakfast or Dinner. The Apostles brake no Law when they differed from any of these, which were but occasional Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>It's said by some, That Christ's Example binds us to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-gesture: But 1. That may be <hi>convenient,</hi> and yet <hi>not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:</hi> The bare Example binds us not to it. 2. If it did, that were but like the general Law; <hi>Let all be done to edification, and in order</hi>; and binds to no one sort of gesture at all: For then when they eat standing, it would bind us to stand; and if they eat kneeling (as Labourers oft do at Harvest-work in the Fields), it would bind us to kneel; if they eat lying, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did, it would bind us to that: and so this would but tie us to the Custom of the Countrey. But in feasting with God, we may sometimes do it more lowly than in a common Table-gesture, and break no Law. When <hi>Mary</hi> was, it's like, on her knees, washing Christ's feet with her Tears, if he had offered her Bread or Wine, it's like it had been no Idolatry so to take it.</p>
                  <p>But the grand Objection is, that <hi>we worship Bread and Wine</hi>; which can be no better than a slander, when the very Liturgy and Doctrine of the Church, not only renounce Transubstantiation, but the very real <hi>Presence</hi> of Christ's Body, which yet many thousand Protestants believe.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But you kneel before the Bread and Wine, and make it a mediate Object of adoration, contrary to the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. 1. We neither make any Image, nor invent this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> nor yet symbolize with Idolaters, while we renounce the very Object (Transubstantiate Bread) which they adore, and therefore break not the Second Commandment, no more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59354:45"/>
than we do in kneeling in lawful Prayer, because they kneel in praying before Images, or to Angels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An Object of worship is either a meer <hi>motive exciting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> or else a <hi>terminative mediate worshipped Object.</hi> The first is <hi>more</hi> than <hi>lawful:</hi> For we should be moved and stirred up by the works of God, even by our Meat and Drink, by Sun and Moon, and all that we see, to worship God: And this is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but the Object of our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and the <hi>motive</hi> of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts: And the Sacrament is no more. But if we did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our worship <hi>terminatively</hi> to the <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> as a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Object,</hi> by which it should pass to God, this were to break the Second Commandment, like Image-worship.</p>
                  <p>There are many Instances in Scripture, of people that have bowed to God before the Prophet, moved by his word and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, who yet break not the Second Commandment, nor idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Prophets:</hi> So <hi>Ioshua</hi> fell down to the Angel, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 4. We give thanks for the Meat that stands before us on the Table, as a <hi>Motive-Object</hi>; and we may do it on our knees: Is this an idolatrous worshipping of our Meat? I have many a time seen a miserable Beggar, when one hath given him Money or Meat, fall down on his knees, and take it, saying, <hi>I thank God and you</hi>; Did this make the giver his Idol? How sad is the case of ignorant young Christians, whose Consciences must be rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or cheated by such Sophistry, because their wits be not ripe enough to find out the deceit?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another Argument: <hi>That is not unlawful which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us in general to choose and do, and so alloweth in the Particulars: But such are the Twenty Things before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>God commandeth us to do all <hi>things in Love, and Concord, and Order, to edification.</hi> This must needs reach to the undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined circumstances. We cannot worship God publickly at all, but it must be in <hi>some words,</hi> in some <hi>gestures,</hi> in some <hi>time,</hi> in some <hi>place</hi>; nor profess our Faith, and Covenant-consent, but by <hi>some sign</hi>: and so of the rest. If you choose <hi>no one,</hi> when God hath tied us to none, but bid us <hi>choose to edification,</hi> we break his General Law. If you can prove that we <hi>choose amiss,</hi> the Fault will be, not that we choose, but that we choose not better.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59354:45"/>III. That is not unlawful which Christ and his Apostles did before us without blame, and belongeth also unto us. But such is the use of such Modes and Circumstances of God's instituted worship, which are left variable, and free to occasional choice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Christ did, I shall speak more anon. <hi>Paul</hi> hath his [<hi>Not the Lord, but I</hi>]; signifying, that the thing was not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. He judgeth circumstantial differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces such as should not break communion, when yet they that kept days, or kept them not; and they that did eat, or not eat, did it <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> And did he bid them not <hi>judg each other for idolatry?</hi> or say, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. That Idolaters were <hi>acceptable to God, or approved of men?</hi> or <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. or bid them <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Idolaters, as Christ received us</hi>? He regulateth their Church-Meetings, <hi>How many</hi> shall speak at a Meeting, and by what course and order; and that women shall be vailed, and not men; and that they salute each other with an holy Kiss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not by a <hi>Law</hi> that setleth the <hi>Particulars,</hi> but by the General Law of doing all in <hi>order, and to edification</hi>; and pleadeth not <hi>Institution,</hi> but the <hi>Custom of the Churches,</hi> which is alterable, as the signification of such acts are. And St. <hi>Iames</hi> will have the <hi>Elders anoint the sick with Oyl for recovery,</hi> which yet bindeth not us. The Papists use this as an <hi>Institution,</hi> as they do <hi>imposition of hands</hi> in Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They say in <hi>Ordination, Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>breathe</hi> on the Person: They <hi>wash the feet of one another</hi> in imitation of Christ: And yet these men condemn them in this, as superstitious, for imitating Christ and his Apostles, and Scripture-Examples, and cry down Popery, and at the same time call us Idolaters, for going beyond Scripture-institution. The same I say of their <hi>keeping Lent, in imitation</hi> of Christ's forty days fast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it Idolatry both to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and not to follow Scripture-Examples?</p>
                  <p>To all the rest I add one Instance more: <hi>Swearing</hi> by appeal to God, is a most solemn act of worship: but the sign of taking an Oath, is left free to convenient choice. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did it by <hi>putting his hand under his thigh:</hi> Was this a common Law, or Institution? Others did it otherwise: We do it by laying our hand <hi>on the Book,</hi> and <hi>kissing it.</hi> These are neither sinful additions, or Idolatry. The Memorial of God's Works, and Mens Covenants, were kept, sometime by pitching Stones, sometime by Pillars, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by set days (as the Feast of <hi>Purim</hi>), sometime by laying up the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59354:46"/>
Ensigns (as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And all these lawful, and no Ido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">IV. Lastly, I will unveil these mens Doctrine of Separation, and then judg whether it be the Doctrine of Christ, which is a Law of Love, and Union, and Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Wisdom from above, which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </gap>t is false, that all such Secondary Medal Worship, is unlawful, which is not instituted by a fixing Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is deceit not to distinguish these different things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The charge of [<hi>false Worship</hi>] unexplained, is meer deceit: 1. Worship is so far [<hi>false</hi>], as it is contrary to the Rule. Every Sermon, Prayer or Sacrament which we administer, hath faultiness and sin, and is so far [<hi>false Worship</hi>]. 2. But Worship offered God on pretence that he instituted it when he did not, or that Man hath authority to command the like, is yet worse <hi>false Worship.</hi> 3. And the worship of <hi>false Gods</hi> or <hi>Idols,</hi> is yet worse than that, and abhorred of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His making all <hi>faulty circumstances,</hi> such as he nameth, to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> because <hi>false,</hi> as he calls it, is yet more sinful, and of mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous importance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So is it to make the Churches <hi>Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ls Temples,</hi> where they do kneel at the Sacrament, and use the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So is it to feign falsly, that God calleth men to come out from such, and be separate, because he calleth them out of <hi>Babylon</hi>; falsly adding to the Laws of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By his Doctrine he maketh Christ an Idolater (which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with horror): For he 1. used Circumstances not instituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or by himself: He preached on a Mountain, in a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not commanded: He commended <hi>Mary</hi> for anointing him, washing his Feet with Tears, wiping them with her Hair, not instituted in particular: He commended the <hi>Publican</hi> for smiting on his breast, standing far off, not looking to Heaven, without particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: His Custom was to go to the Synagogue-worship: He from his childhood performed Temple-Duties and Service: He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lepers cleansed to go to the Priests, and offer their due, and his Disciples to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet 1. The High Priests were not of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s line, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Institution. 2. They bought the Office of <hi>Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> 3. They had it not for life, according to institution. 4. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59354:46"/>
Worship, Discipline</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> were heinously corrupted, so that the Hearers were to beware of the Leaven of their Doctrine, and not to imitate their lives. 4. They were bitter enemies of Christ, and Persecutors: yet Christ never bid his Disciples to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from any thing but their errors; but saith, <hi>They shall cast you out of the synagogues.</hi> And doubtless Christ committed no sin; nor can we be so holy as he.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He condemneth <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church of old, that used such things that were not instituted in Worship, as is before mentioned in swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. He maketh the Apostles Idolatrous that used the like.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He maketh the Primitive Churches Idolatrous, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to approve it. For they used such uninstituted things: yea, the <hi>Romans</hi> were guilty of differences in God's Service, and despising and judging each other for them; The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Carnal in making Parties and Divisions, they defrauded each other, and went to Law before <hi>Heathens.</hi> They had Fornicators, Judaizing envious Slanderers of <hi>Paul,</hi> Heretical deniers of the Resurrection; such as eat in Idols Temples, or of their Sacrifices: Were drunk at, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament. The <hi>Galatians</hi> are yet sharplier charged: Almost all the Seven Churches <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. and 3. had <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> or <hi>Iezabels</hi> Doctrine, which God hated: and no Christian is called to separate from the Communion of any one of all these; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to amend, and live in Unity, without division.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He condemneth as Idolaters all the Churches on Earth, for Six Hundred, if not One Thousand Years after the Apostles; not One Church Christian, or Heretick (as far as any History tells us that I have found) did ever deny such things, as he calls False Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or Idolatry. They all went further than our Parish Churches do. At Baptism they used the White Garment, tasting Milk and Honey, Chrisme or anointing the Forehead, Crossing; they ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely Standing, and not Kneeling, every Lords Day, all as significant Ceremonies: No one Church or Person is said to scruple these; I think they did not well: but God rejected not their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. He maketh all, or near all the Churches on Earth, Idolaters, at this day: All on Earth, save the <hi>Protestants,</hi> are far grosser in their Liturgies and Ceremonies than the <hi>English</hi>: Of the <hi>

                  <p n="14">14. I humbly propose it to consideration, Whether by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (which he seeth not, nor owneth) he do not deny Christ, and all the Gospel, and work of mans redemption: I challenge him to name me one Church on Earth for many hundred years after the Apostles, that had not that which he calls false Worship and Idolatry: Suppose this were but in a few Ages, as the second, third, or fourth Century: Then a Temple of Idols, and Company of Idolaters, is no true Church: And if at any time there was no Church there was no Head of the Church: No Kingdom, no King: No Wife, no Husband, that is no <hi>Christ.</hi> How much more, if he make all, or near all the Church Idolaters to this day, and himself with the rest?</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If it be a heinious sin to bear false Witness against a Neighbour, or to slander one man, what is it to slander and back-bite all the Church on Earth, and Christ himself?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Is it not a work of Satan to destroy Love, and to render al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Christians odious? And doth not he do so, that calleth them Idolaters? Is not this Preaching men into the hatred of each other? Do we owe no Love to any Christians, but such as is due to Idolaters? Is not the fruit of the Spirit otherwise described?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Doth he not deny that Communion of the Saints, which is an Article of the Creed? and tempt weak Christians into sinful Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Divisions, Slanders, Judgings, Murmurings, Envies, which are the fruits of the flesh?</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Doth not this directly destroy the Church by Dissolution? When there is none to be owned or joyned with, that hath not somewhat which he calleth false worship. And is not separating the Materials, destroying the house?</p>

Doth he not directly rush into the Sin which he condemneth adding to God's Laws, and saying he forbids what he forbids not? yea, fathering on him Laws more rigorous than the Jewish, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning Christ's Church as Idolators and false Worshippers?</p>
                  <p n="20">20.

For when men read and hear others confidently rage against Truth and Duty, by rash presumptuous ignorance, they judge of all our dissent by this: And while many run into this Guilt, it seems to justify their Afflicters: And it tempteth weak Persons to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for sinful separation as evil do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To see those whose Senses are not exercised to discern things that differ, misled by the words and reverence of men, to swallow some Sins as excellent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and fly from things Lawful; yea, oft from great Duties, as odious Sins, and suffer rejoycingly for sinning against God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all that sin not as they do; yea, even all, or almost all the Churches on Earth; yea, and calling them Idolaters for being wiser and better than they, who alas, do in all things shew themselves to be ignorant Babes, and who speak evil of that which they understand not. And then to see others revile, and hate, and ruin these mistaking Christians by a far more dangerous mistake; as if Religious fear of Sin, were an unsufferable thing, and such were intollerable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and Conscience were a disgraceful thing; and as if themselves and all Mankind were not liable to worser Errors, than to take some lawful things for Sin, when they see unlawful things stand near them, or among them.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">§ 1. HAving lately read six or seven Casuists, that perswaded Men to Communion with the Parish Churches; I found in them many sober discourses, worthy to be read by those that are inclined to a faulty alienation; and I perswaded some such to read them, as being obliged to hear what both sides can say, if they will escape partiality and error. Though I find very few such Writers that seem to be acquainted with the true case of Non-Conformists, but much stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it, while they disswade men from it. But some of them I found are not content to perswade men to Communion with their Party, to which they find it advantageous to appropriate the name of <hi>The Church of</hi> England, (unjustly) unless they also perswade them from Communion with all others in the land that be not of their Mind and Party. And they conclude,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If it be lawful to hear and Communicate with us once, it is lawful to do it constantly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And if it be lawful to Communicate with us, it is unlawful to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the Non-conformists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">§ 2. One would think, this task should signifie gross Schism in these men, as well as in other Sects, that say, We are the only true Church, and it's unlawful to Communicate with any but us: So did the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and most Sects of old; and every Sect usually that got uppermost by the Emperors countenance, called themselves the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and their Communion the Catholick and only lawful Communion: So did the <hi>Arians,</hi> and so did the <hi>Acacians,</hi> and <hi>Semi-arians</hi>; and so did the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians</hi> a little while, and the <hi>Eutychians</hi> long; and so did the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites,</hi> and the <hi>Phantasiasts,</hi> and the Image-adorers, and such like. And so do the <hi>Papists</hi>; and some say, That some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have come to that; but I have not met with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">§ 3. But though little Sects for this use some appearance of Scripture-reason (as the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that say, The unbaptized are no Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but you are all unbaptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet there are few <hi>big Sects,</hi> but <hi>worldly advantage,</hi> and <hi>cheating Words and Names,</hi> are the strength of their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59354:49"/>
Cause, by which they do more than by any sober shew of reason. The assumed names [of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Ancient</hi>] and the Names of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schisma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And such use the gross Schismatical parts do make of the names of [<hi>The Church of En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="3">§ 3. Among all the Casuists, I found none abound with this sort of Logick, so much as the <hi>Resolver of three Cases about Church-Communion</hi>] which when I had read, I am so much against Separation, that I thought meet to joyn with the rest of the Casuists, who unite against Schism, so far as to disswade Men from this Man's (and <hi>Mr.</hi> Dodwells) extraordnary Schismatical Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">§ 4. But when I had written a just Confutation of him, hearing by fame who he is, I thought it my duty before I publisht it, to see the Book which he wrote against Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and Me; because he may perhaps be there more intelligible; (for I had never before seen it, and would not seek it, because I would not tempt my self to a work which I have so little pleasure in, as is the confutation of such men). But when I had read it, I found the Author a great deal sounder in his opinions than in his words, and than he was represented to me to be: There is a great deal that's good and worthy the reading in his Book, when he doth but keep off from his Schismatical cause. He handsomely openeth some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals, and so fairly alloweth forbearance of others in Doctrinal differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that were he as Catholick and equal in his opinion about Government, and that which he calleth <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> he would be against Schism a Catholick indeed. He doth fairly disclaim even Archbishop <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s concession to the Papists: And he handsomely confuteth Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and maintaineth the validity of Sacraments, and the duty of our Communion with the foreign Churches that have no Bishops, and justifieth the Church of <hi>England</hi> that hath still owned Communion with them: He hath proved the no necessity of continued Successive ordination by Bishops: He hath defended the Independency of <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches in point of Government; and that one Church hath not proper Governing Power over another, but only an obligation to Communion, of which more anon.</p>
                  <p n="5">§ 5. But I must say, That though he hath a smooth and handsom Stile for an Orator; either He, or I, (which of us I am no fit Judge) is so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59354:49"/>
wofully defective in Logick, and Politicks, that of these Subjects one of us is utterly unfit for a strict dispute, not knowing the usual Sense of ordinary terms, nor explaining them aright, nor seeming to know what a true Definition is; nor proceeding in any Scholar-like method: But that little explication of Terms which he giveth, is usually near the end of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ook, when a confused dispute before, hath tended but to seduce: which ever of us it is, that is in the fault, it's a great wrong to the Reader: And if it be he, I find no likelihood that any should cure him but himself, or some one that he hath a very high opinion of: For when his mistakes are discovered, the substance of his Answer, is a haughty ignorant scorn at the discovery. Had he happily learnt to <hi>Explain, Define,</hi> and <hi>Distinguish,</hi> and <hi>Methodize,</hi> when he was young enough to submit to his Tutor, it had been well for him: But it being now to be learnt, when he is a Doctor, and such a Doctor, <hi>Scorning and ignorant Wrangling</hi> will take the place of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Learning.</p>
                  <p n="6">§ 6. This I must tell the Reader, That the Man speaketh so much worse than he seemeth (by after Contradictions) to think, and hath so little Skill in exact expressing the matter, or his mind, that I can scarce ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with any confidence to know his meaning: For when he hath said worst, and is confuted, he comes over it again, and scorneth us for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding him, and tells us, that he meant as we do: So that it is his <hi>Words</hi> that I only undertake to confute, and not his meaning, till I am better able to say, that I know it. Nor would I think it a work beseeming me, to write a Book to tell the World, how unskilful this man is in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligibly and aptly, if I did not find that others are seduced, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his words in the usual sence of such, not knowing that he meaneth not as he speaketh: So far as he meaneth well, I think I am his Friend, in perswading people to be of his mind, and to believe what he thinks, and not what he saith. And if he hold on his way, and fall not out with the Truth for my sake, I am in hope that the effect also of this Survey will be, that in the next he will renounce all his Errors, save the terms, and will say, that he meant as I did: And then, if he do rail and scorn at me only as misunderstanding him, I can bear it.</p>
                  <p n="7">§ 7. Nor should I think it a Duty (in my condition), to save Readers from his <hi>real errors,</hi> were it not that they notoriously tend to perswade the Land to think of Thousands of the faithfullest Christians that I know, as damnable intollerable Schismaticks, guilty of the sin that will damn them, as soon as Adultery and Murder; and consequently to call Men to hate them as such, and to proceed in silencing, ruining and imprisoning them; which is to tell all them that do so, that they do well; which if it should prove otherwise, who can express the greatness of his sin against the Souls of one party, and the Lives, Estate, and Ministry of the other?</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 35, 36. While he over and over repeated the confused words of [<hi>One Communion</hi>], which must excuse us from Schism, as dangerous as Murder; and we that live among Men that use to distinguish <hi>Union</hi> from <hi>Communion</hi>; and know that <hi>Communion,</hi> yea, and <hi>Union</hi> too, hath a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of degrees, and our desire was, that he would but explain in what he fixt it, that we might understand his accusation; he tells us, that he <hi>did not place this Communion in any transient Acts, but in a fixed permanent state.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But 1. Taking the Bishops for true authorised Pastors, and the Church for a true Church, are transient acts. Believing in Christ, and repenting of sin, are transient acts, <hi>quoad objectum,</hi> tho <hi>immanent quoad subjectum &amp; effectum.</hi> Baptism, and Profession of Christianity, and of love and obedience to others, are transient, both <hi>quoad objectum &amp; effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</hi> Coming to Church, communicating, obeying Bishops, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Schismaticks, are transient in both respects. You see, that by [<hi>Catholick Communion</hi>] the Doctor meaneth none of all these.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What meaneth he then [<hi>a fixed permanent state</hi>]? But 1. Which Predicament can you conjecture that word [<hi>state</hi>] is in? It's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly applied to <hi>Relation, Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Scite and Place.</hi> These latter I am confident he meaneth not. If he mean <hi>Quality,</hi> it is <hi>Disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Supposing this his meaning, 2.

<q>[I conclude, it's sufficient to let you understand what the Ancients meant by Christian-Communion, which in a large Notion signifies the Christian Church or Society, which is called Communion, from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which all the Members of it had with each other. The plain and obvious sense is, All the Churches of the World are but one Church or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have the same right, and the same obligation on them to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with each other; for the sake of which, Christian Churches are instituted, as the members of a particular Church are].</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Such <hi>large Notions</hi> may be sufficient to you, but they signifie little more than <hi>noise</hi> to me. Here we are told, that by [<hi>Communion</hi>] he meaneth [<hi>the Church</hi>]: And so when we read of [<hi>Communion with the Church</hi>], it meaneth [<hi>the Church with the Church</hi>]; and [<hi>Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>] are Two Synonimal words, and signifie [<hi>Church, Church</hi>]. And in the Creed (<hi>the Catholick Church and Communion of Saints</hi>] is a Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Church is called [<hi>Communion</hi>] from [<hi>Communication</hi>]: And is <hi>Communication</hi> no transient act, but a <hi>fixed state</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the plain sense be, That <hi>all Churches in the World are one Church</hi> (as parts in the whole), who differs from you in that? We are all then of one Catholick Communion, and shall believe that all true Christians are of one Church, till the Excommunicators better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But have [<hi>all the same right and obligation to communicate with each other</hi>]? 1. All do actually communicate with each other, 1. In their Union with, and Relation to our Saviour and Head. 2. And in having one holy Spirit. 3. Being the adopted children of one God. 4. Being of that one body formally related to Christ. 5. Believing in the same God and Father, Saviour and holy Spirit. And 6. Consenting to the same Baptismal Covenant. 7. Having the same hope of everlasting life. These are the Instances of Christian Union and Communion, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. And 8. They have also Communion in the same common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, Pardon and Justification, and right to life. 9. And besides all this, when they may be had, they have Communion in the same <hi>species</hi> of necessary worship; the use of the same Gospel, and Sacred Scriptures, and Creed, of the same sort of Eucharistical Sacrament, and Prayer, and Praise and Thanksgiving, in all parts of absolute necessity, and holy Assemblies to that end, consisting of several Pastors with their Flocks. 10. Yea, and all true Christians love one another as such, and live in sincere (tho imperfect) obedience to the same holy Laws of Christ. In all this all Christians have Communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59354:51"/>2. And all have <hi>right</hi> to such measures of <hi>Local Communion,</hi> where they come, as they are in a more immediate capacity of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And all are <hi>obliged</hi> to exercise so much <hi>Mental and Local Communion</hi> as is necessary to edification, and to the exercise of Christian love and peace, besides what is forementioned.</p>
                  <p>But yet, 1. All Churches on Earth are separate by distance, as to Local Communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No Two Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Men on Earth, are perfectly united as to <hi>Mental C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. There are very many just causes of diversifying Local Communion in the same City, Diocess or other Precincts; and of diversifying indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Pastoral Relation, and single (proper) Church-Communion. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Languages is a cause that no man can deny. The excessive Magnitude of a Church (that is, the Multitude of Persons) is another. Suppose that I were first and alone made Pastor of a Church in <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Quinsay,</hi> and I am not able to do the work of a Pastor for a Thousand Souls; I get the help of Three or Four Presbyters and Deacons; and we all are utterly unable to do the Pastoral work for Four Thousand; may Four Thousand, or Forty Thousand more claim of me the performance of the Pastoral Office? Am I bound to undertake Tenfold more than I am able to perform? Then Men may not only enslave me, but damn me at their pleasure, and pretend their right to Communion with me. If you say I am bound to multiply Presbyters in the same Church to suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: I answer, 1. What if I can neither have Men nor Maintenance? 2. What if I think that when the Multitude is so great that I cannot know them, nor they ever speak with me, or know one another any more than Men of several Countreys, that I ought not to undertake a personal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of them, but perswade them to associate in Churches capable of such oversight? It's no breach of Charity for one School-Master or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician to refuse a personal Relation, as School-Master to Five Hundred Schools, or Physician to all the City, or Five Hundred Hospitals (tho he have <hi>Apothecaries</hi> or others under him). No Man hath <hi>right</hi> to more of my labour than I am able to perform. If I be a Bishop, and bound to hear and try the Causes of all that ought to come under Church Censure in a whole Diocess, and am certain that I am unable to do this to One of an Hundred, who can claim a right to that or more?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But out of this his Doctrine, I gather, That if all the Christian World have <hi>rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

terms, because they will not break the Custom of their several Countries, and communicate with me in doubted unnecessary things, I wrong all the Christian World, and am to them a Schismatick: Much more if I presume to Excommunicate every Stranger that cometh into my Precincts, and herein differs from me, as you do us: and most of all if I impose many sinful terms of Communion on him.</p>
                  <p>All Christians are bound to hold Communion in Christianity, and in all things necessary to the common Communion of them all; and to extend this also to as many Integrals as they can reach: But there are Multitudes of things in which they are not bound to have Communion; much less as necessary to salvation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The whole World is one great Kingdom of God, as verily as the Church is the Church of Christ: And yet we Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists think that every Man in it (no, nor every Saint) hath not right to be King of <hi>England,</hi> nor a Judg in our Courts, nor Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> nor so much as a Freeman in any City.

Your odd supposition of the World being one Family, either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth one Husband to all the Wives in the World, and one Father to all the Children in the World; or else that all distinct Husbands, Wives, Children and Servants, are in this one Family. In the first supposition I may suppose that you take him to be more than a Man that can be an Husband to all the Women, and a Father to all the Children on Earth: And therefore if his Wisdom be equal to such a greatness, he must be no Fool. And if so, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if you suppose many Husbands and Fathers, our Opinion is, that Husbands and Wives should not be common, nor Parents and Children. Nay, which way ever you take, that Childrens Food, Rayment and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should not be common: Nor could any come from <hi>India,</hi> and claim

a Lordship or Lands in <hi>England,</hi> as a Member of the Family. Fathers distribute unequally, as their Will and Wisdom, and their Childrens fitness, are diversifying Causes. Even in a Colledg one cannot claim anothers Chamber, Books, Cloaths or Food. One would think by your scourge for Non-Conformists, that you were no Leveller, nor against fatherly justice, and inequality of right and distribution. Even they that come to your Church, cannot so much as claim equal right in Seats.</p>
                  <p>And verily if all the World that will come to you, may claim equal Pastoral oversight from you, or any Bishop, your equality must be like his to the Beggars, that gave nothing to any, that he might serve them all alike.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. I should now again answer his question <hi>de re: What makes all these Churches one</hi>? But he stops me with a profession that he will not be to me intelligible, and complaineth that I am unintelligible to him: So that we seem <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or Men of strange Languages in disputing with one another: And it would be no edifying work for any to hear, <hi>e. g.</hi> a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> and a <hi>Spaniard</hi> dispute in their several Tongues, not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another.</p>
                  <p>When I distinguisht of [<hi>unifying the Church, and uniting a single Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to it</hi>], he tells me, That he
<q>[supposeth the particular Churches formed, and particular Christians united to them, and only enquireth how they are one Church], <hi>and saith, my</hi> distinction <hi>is to</hi> prevent understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(which his confusion promoteth).</hi>
                     </q>
And when I distinguish <hi>between Union in essential parts, and in integral parts, and in accidents</hi> (without which distinction, no true satisfaction can be given to the Querist), he saith, [<hi>He perceiveth that we shall never come to the business: for he did not enquire wherein the Essence of a Church consists, or what degrees of Communion are more or less necessary to its being, — but how a thousand Churches become one Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Which words are to me as unintelligible as any Nonsence. Doth any thing make it <hi>One Church</hi> but that which maketh it <hi>A Church?</hi> Doth not that which maketh it <hi>eus existens,</hi> make it <hi>Unum?</hi> Doth not the word [<hi>Church</hi>] name its <hi>Essence</hi>? If he ask me, how the <hi>parts of Man come to make One Man?</hi> Who would think but he meant either <hi>One Man essential,</hi> or else improperly, <hi>One entire Man</hi>? And what Answer would any give but this? If your [<hi>how</hi>] mean <hi>what was the efficient cause, it's God and the Generators:</hi> If you mean, [<hi>what are the constitutive causes</hi>]? They are Soul and Body <hi>united,</hi> that <hi>make a Man in Essence</hi>; and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating parts united, that make him an <hi>entire Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O! but saith our Doctor, I ask not <hi>wherein the Essence of the Church consists? Ans.</hi> Then you ask not what maketh it One in <hi>constitution</hi>: What then do you mean, unless it be the <hi>efficient cause,</hi> which no Man would think you meant that read the rest of your Book? For my part, I despair of knowing what you mean, till you have better learned to speak.</p>
                  <p>But this seemeth to imply, that we are agreed of the <hi>constitutive</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the <hi>One Catholick Church</hi>; and our disagreement were of the <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> If that be it, I'le tell you what maketh the Church <hi>One</hi> effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: 1. God maketh Man to be Man, and so capable matter. 2. God gave Christ to be the Mediator and Head. 3. God made (by Christ)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59354:54"/>
the Covenant of Grace, by which, as by a Law and Gift, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Conditions of Church-Relation and Benefits, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Man's belief and consent, and professeth his own acceptance of such consenters. 4. His Ministers and Word perswade Men to believe and consent. 5. His Spirit efficiently causeth Men to believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. 6. At that time God's conditional grant becometh actual, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them actually a right and relation to Christ and his Benefits. 7. Thereupon Christ's Ministers solemnize this Covenant, declaring God's acceptance; and by Baptism, investing the person in the visible possession of his relation to Christ and all his Members, the person professing his believing, which maketh it a mutual Covenant (the Parent doing it for Infants).</p>
                  <p>These Seven Acts go to make up the total efficient Cause of the Churches Essence and Unity, and each Members Union therein. And if you exclude any one of them, you will be a false Teacher. Is there any room here for a Controversie among Christians? The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, the Covenant and Law, the Consenter, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Baptism, all make up the efficient Cause of the Churches Essence. And that which maketh it <hi>a Church,</hi> maketh it <hi>One Church</hi>: As that which maketh it an <hi>House,</hi> a <hi>Ship,</hi> a <hi>Family,</hi> a <hi>School,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it thereby <hi>One House, One Ship, One Family,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>eus &amp; unun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertuntur.</hi>

                  <p n="17">§ 17. But tho his Question [<hi>How</hi>] (that ambiguous Syllable), en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not of the Churches Essence (and of what, who knows?) yet <hi>p.</hi> 43. he ventures to enquire of it, upon my words, [<hi>it is only essential to the Church, that there be an organized Body of Pastors and People united to Christ, the Head</hi>], saith he, [<hi>Here I agree with Mr.</hi> B. <hi>if he would add One Body; for that is the thing in dispute, Whether Christ have one or a thousand bodies</hi>].</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I pray you remember this happy agreement, that we agree of the Churches Essence. But is not [<hi>A Body</hi>] the Singular Number? If I say, that a man is <hi>corpus organicum,</hi> and a <hi>rational soul united,</hi> do I need to put in [<hi>One Body,</hi> or <hi>One Soul</hi>], while <hi>unum</hi> is <hi>entis inseparabilis affectio?</hi> Good Doctor, why must not <hi>Verum</hi> and <hi>Bonum</hi> be named with every <hi>eus</hi> in a definition, as well as <hi>Unum?</hi> Can it be a <hi>Body,</hi> and not <hi>One Body?</hi> O! what a Jest will School-boys make of us for such dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the pretended disagreement is much worse asserted. Is that the Controversie, <hi>Whether Christ have One Body, or a Thousand</hi>? Would you make men believe that we <hi>deny</hi> the Unity of the Universal Church? If you would, prove it, or blush. 2. Do you your self deny the being of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of particular Churches, which are parts of the Universal? When
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59354:54"/>
you have seemed long to do it, you come again and confess such Churches, and condemn us as separating from them. 3. Is the Controversie whether these single Churches, <hi>de nomine,</hi> may be called so <hi>many Bodies of Christ</hi>? 1. Name the men that so call them, and prove it, or confess your self a false Accuser. 2. If they did, an <hi>unfit Name</hi> is not an error, <hi>de re.</hi> I never heard man so speak. We say, that the word [<hi>Church</hi>] used for the [<hi>Universal</hi>] and the [<hi>Particular</hi>], is not <hi>univocally</hi> used, but <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically, expenuriâ nominum.</hi> As oft the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>part</hi> have one Name. We say, that as an hundred Cities and Counties may make one Kingdom, and were they all equivocally called Republicks, or Kingdoms, it would be no change in the Doctrine: All the Christian World <hi>call the universal</hi> and the <hi>particulars</hi> by the name of [<hi>Church</hi>]. And yet, if to help us out of the Equivocation, you will invent a better Name, and get men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it (not reprehending the Scripture-use), we will hearken to you. But as One Kingdom is individuate by One King, and yet subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Societies may have subordinate individuating Heads; so is it here. And it's grosly unfit to say <hi>Christ hath many Bodies,</hi> tho he have many <hi>Churches in one</hi>; as the King hath many Cities, but one Kingdom here.</p>
                  <p>But he adds, [<hi>If but One, how do all the Christians in the World make up that one Body</hi>]?</p>
                  <p>[<hi>How</hi>] must not be explained: If by [<hi>how</hi>] he meant [<hi>by what efficiency</hi>], I have told you: If it mean by what <hi>constitutive</hi> Causes, it is [<hi>by Form and Matter united</hi>]: If it be any <hi>Mode</hi> that you mean, vouchsafe to tell us what.</p>

<q>[In this definition Christ only is the supreme constitutive <hi>summa potestas,</hi> or regent part.

I answer, Nothing in <hi>Adam,</hi> nothing in <hi>Israel</hi>; and so nothing in the Church can be the cause of Nothing: No Man, no Nation, no Church speak Nothing: Not to make another, is nothing; but the words are a meer Negation: And Nothing hath no Cause. What is the Cause that there is not another Sun? Why, Nothing hath no Cause: But if we must give any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, it must be only by calling the Negation of a Cause by the Name of a Cause, and saying, that the Cause why there is but one Sun (that we know of), and one Church Universal, is because God made no more.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It's easie to suppose, that the cause of these Words was a want of somewhat both in your Head and Heart, that should have been there. 1. Is this any Confutation of my Philosophy? Could not a Quaker have talkt against it at as reasonable Rates as these? 2. Do you not think, that every understanding Reader doth know, that both the term [<hi>Head and Soul</hi>] here are Metaphors, as spoken of Christ? Both of them signifie the <hi>form of the Society,</hi> because the Head is the seat of the Soul in its <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Regent</hi> Acts; the King is called the <hi>Head</hi> of his Kingdom, that is, He is <hi>forma Regni</hi> (for the <hi>Politick forms</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> is their forms of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>) And so as the Church is a <hi>Politick Society, Christ</hi> is the <hi>form</hi> of it: But it is nobler than all meer humane Policies, and his Headship is Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiated by the three parts of his Office in One, as he is Prophet, Priest, and King; and as the principle of Knowledge, Love, and Practice; and his Church is together, Dominion, <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a Society of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or Family. And the Head, which is the seat of the Soul, as operative by Intellection, Sense, and Motion, most aptly representeth all this in Christ.</p>
                  <p>But while the Head-part of the Body is this Seat, the Soul is in it the operator: And Christ as Man is part of the Church, in and by whom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59354:56"/>
his Divine nature performeth the operations: And as the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>form of the Man, Christ</hi> is the <hi>form</hi> of his <hi>Church, quae dat esse &amp; nomen.</hi> And that the Holy Ghost illuminateth, and quickneth, and comforteth, is so far from being against this, that it is the chief proof of it. For the Spirit proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and is the Spirit of Christ, sent by him; and what he doth herein, Christ doth by him: <hi>Opera trinitatis ad extra sunt in-divisa.</hi> Who would have thought that a Christian durst deny Christ to be <hi>forma Ecclesiae,</hi> as the Soul is of a Man, and the King of a Kingdom?—Doth the Man give you the least proof, but his vain word, that Christ cannot be both as a <hi>Head,</hi> and a <hi>Soul</hi> (that is, <hi>forma informans</hi>) to his Church, — or that <hi>Christ</hi> is not the Soul, because the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is? — But <hi>I</hi> think neither is called by the name of a <hi>Soul</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                  <p>But Reader, my Heart grieveth to think, that so great a number should be caried by such men as this, to the same Love-killing opinions, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I'le put a case to you.</p>
                  <p>A Leveller that would have got down the Universities, undertook that his Parrot should Learn Philosophy, as well as Scholars, and should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute with any of them all. He taught the Parrot only two words before Noon every day [<hi>It's true, Sir,</hi>] and [<hi>I understand you,</hi>] and to say two more every day afternoon, <hi>viz. [You lie Sir,]</hi> and [<hi>away you Rogue.</hi>] When he had learnt them perfectly, he inviteth a Tutor to read Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to his Parrot. He reads in the morning a Lecture of the Principles of Man, and the Parrot oft saith, [<hi>I understand you,</hi>] and [<hi>I'ts true, Sir,</hi>] The Hearers admiring it, are invited to dispute with the Parrot in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: Multitudes come, and the Respondent maintained that Man hath a Reasonable Soul, and next, that Parrots have none such: The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot oft answered [<hi>You lie Sir,</hi>] and at last [<hi>Away you Rogue:</hi>] If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany gave the Parrot the better, and concluded for Brutes against Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, did they more deserve pity or indignation?</p>
                  <p>Once more: God made <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body before he breathed into it the Breath of Life: If this Body had not its form, it was not a Body; nor a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, without the proper form of such: That which hath no form, is no being.

                  <p>But lest the Doctor when he understands me, should think, that I have hereby served his Notion of <hi>Communion</hi>; I must add that it is not either the <hi>placing</hi> or the <hi>being</hi> of all the parts of a humane Body, that is this form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l <hi>Organization,</hi> but only of the Essential parts: It may be a humane Body without a Finger, or Hand, or Foot, or Arm, or Leg; and what great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59354:58"/>
diversity of parts are found within men, and diversity of place, and shape, you may see in <hi>Skenkius</hi> his Observation, as well as in <hi>Paraeus, Hildanus, Hollerius,</hi> and multitudes more that afforded him his instances. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Heart, a Brain, a Stomach, a Liver, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it cannot be a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body organized. And without a Gospel Ministry to guide the Flocks, it is not a compleat organized Body of Christ, though <hi>in fieri,</hi> it was an <hi>Embrio</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>But I must again warn the Reader, not to argue too far from Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. In a natural Body God hath fixed all the parts by a constant Law of generation, except in Monsters. But in political Bodies, the difference is much: Civil politicks <hi>quoad formas specificas,</hi> are humane Creatures; and men may alter them. The Church is a <hi>Divine politie; God</hi> hath fixed its <hi>essentials:</hi> But he hath left many of its <hi>Accidents</hi> to the choice of Man, who may alter them as Edification requireth. And again, I say, that Catholick Union in the <hi>Essentials</hi> only, is necessary to the Being of the Church; and in the <hi>Integrals,</hi> to its Integrity; and in the needful common Accidents, to its <hi>Comeliness</hi>; and in other <hi>Accidents</hi> its unnecessary and impossible. God makes the Man, but the Tailor makes his Cloathes; and the Country, and Usage, and Parents, may diversifie Colour and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Metropolitans and Patriarchs, and <hi>Diocesian</hi> Churches, as containing multitudes of Churches, without Bishops, and their Chancellors, Officials, Commissaries, Arch-Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are humane Creatures, as the Episcopal Protestants usually confess: And Liturgies are various, as Languages; and Ceremonies are like our Periwigs: Some think it lawful to wear Womens Hair, and some think it unlawful, though the fashion: But I remember none yet, that have taken all for Rebels, or Out-laws, that wear not Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs, or are not of the same Habit, Language, or Complexion; nor any that for these send men to Prison, nor that think it a wise way to unity.</p>
                  <p n="23">§ 23. p. 46. He comes after with an [<hi>If I mean</hi>] to conjecture what I mean and think; <hi>it fits his present case</hi> well; why then doth he quarrel with it? But what is his case,

And (Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors not using the Sword to compel any to Communion, nor enabling the Bishops to do it) this course was needful, and did great Service to the Church, as long as the Majority of the Clergy kept sound: But when worldly Baits drew worldly men into the Bishops seats, this turned clean the other way; and <hi>Arians,</hi> and every Sect that by power could get upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, called themselves the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and persecuted the rest as Schismaticks. In this case the Orthodox durst not plead Majority: but 1. They fled to the Scriptures to try which was the sound part. 2. And they appealed to the <hi>Nicene</hi> and first Councils when the Church was sound: But the Second Council (at <hi>Const.</hi>) began a breach; the Third (at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) made it wider, and was rejected by a great party: The Fourth (at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) made it yet wider, and was utterly disowned by the soundest part: The Fifth (at <hi>Calcedon,</hi> call'd the Fourth) made it yet wider, and rent the Church almost into equal parts: And the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Councils went on till they set up Images and Popery, and tore all to pieces.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I conclude, that uniting on the Decrees of General Councils, as such, is no necessary nor sure way of Catholick Communion. But while godly Pastors use Synods really for Love and Peace, and the Churches welfare, it is the duty of all the People <hi>finis gratia,</hi> and in obedience to their proper agreeing Pastors, to keep such bonds of Peace. But a failing therein is not an unchurching crime, tho a fault.</p>

                     <hi>VIII.</hi> If Councils of Bishops will arrogate a Legislative power over all the Church, or over those that are not of their Flocks, it is part of our duty to Christ, and means of Concord, to disown their Usurpation.</p>

                     <hi>XI.</hi> Bishops and Pastors in the same Kingdom may well be used to try what Pastors are fit for their Communion: But (as I said before) were we bound to disown the Communion of all Forreign Pastors, the validity of whose right to their places we have not just notice of, our Task would be impossible, or our Communion narrow.</p>
                  <p>And if forreign Bishops will become so pragmatical, as to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Judges of other Kingdoms, which party of Competitors are the truly called Pastors, when they cannot try them, or will take the words of one party against the other, because they are uppermost, it is just to disregard their Judgment, tho they do it on pretence of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                     <hi>XII.</hi> If men will turn a voluntary consultation for concord, into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Law, tho they call it but Communion, the Church should not own their Usurpation: As the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> are bound to do the best they can to promote by their concord the interest of Christ, and may well hold Diets or Meetings for that end; yet no man calls that Diet a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor hath the <hi>Major</hi> Vote a power to bind the <hi>Minor</hi> to consent, when the reason of the thing doth not bind them. So is it in the concord of forreign Churches: All are bound to agree in what Christ commandeth: But in circumstantial determinations, no man is bound further than the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the thing requireth: <hi>Communion</hi> here is not <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet you will think your self wise enough to stir up men against us for our ignorance, while you are raging confident. Are you resolved to read no Logick that's already written? One would have thought it should have pleased one that pleads for Unity: As it is no Proposition, but made so by the Copula, uniting the terms as Subject and Predicate, and the Union maketh one the Predicate; so it is no <hi>Man</hi> and no <hi>Church</hi> by the bare existence of Soul and Body, or of Christ and Believers, without the uniting of both together, that so the Soul may become <hi>in actu,</hi> the <hi>forma hominis,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>forma Ecclesiae.

Granting that there is no Universal Government but Christ, he's again at it, that there is somewhat more than Organization, and all the Essentials of Christianity and Union with Christ, to make the Church One: and thereupon feigneth me to say, [<hi>That which maketh this Body to become a Church, is no union among themselves</hi>]; and leaveth out the rest of the Sentence, [<hi>but their common union with Christ:</hi>] As if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Union with Christ were not an <hi>Union among themselves.</hi> If I have not made this plain enough, That 1. the Church hath the Unity of the parts to make it a capable Body or Matter. 2. That it hath a consequent Union and Communion after it is a Church. 3. But that it is only the Union of adapted Matter and Form, that makes it essentially the Church of Christ in the proper political sence, then I despair of making it intelligible, that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma dat esse &amp; nomen:</hi> And if that which maketh it [<hi>the Church</hi>] do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make it <hi>hoc unum,</hi> then <hi>eus &amp; unum non convertuntur,</hi> and <hi>unum</hi> must have a distinct cause from <hi>eus.</hi>

                  <p>And what's the reason that all this while you will not name that thing else, that makes the Church one? Do it if you can.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> What base thoughts hath this man of Christianity? Is it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Union to have all one Faith, one Hope, one Baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and so one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one body of such, and all the Twelve parts of Union and Communion before named? 2. Were it not worth the labour for this man to tell us what the more near and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Union is which he hath a mind to set up? <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I tell you of a more excellent way,</hi> when he speaks of the Union of Love, even Love to God and our Saviour first, and to all his Members as united in him. Out of all this man's books I cannot find what his nearer Union is, unless it be to unite in such as he; that is, in obedience to their Wills; and so Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them be this high Communion: He saith over and over the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>word, Catholick Communion</hi>; but what he placeth it in, let him find that can.</p>
                  <p n="28">§ 28. He saith,
<q>[This is a pretty easie way of determining Controversies, to out-face all the authority of Scripture and Antiquity by a dogmatical as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, without offering the least Reason, or shadow of Reason to confirm it.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Could a man have spoken more untruly that had studied it? 1. While he tells us, that by Communion he means <hi>Union</hi>; did I ever deny it? No, nor ever met with a Christian that denied it. 2. Yea, I said more than he, That besides <hi>Union,</hi> some Communion in transient acts is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he placeth not his Communion in. Is not this an hardened Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter? Who can doubt but Union and Communion is necessary to one Church? But the doubt is, wherein it doth consist? whether in Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59354:61"/>
Integrals or Accidents? and what these be? We are far more for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Union and Communion than you. We are for Communion with all true Christians, even those that you represent odious, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ruin; and you are for Communion with a Sect that will honour you and obey your will. We know that to have one God, and Christ, and Holy Spirit, one Faith and Hope of Heaven, one Baptism, and a true Love to one another, and to be all under one Law and Covenant of Christ, and in our several Assemblies to read the same Scripture, use the same Sacraments, and the same Rule of Prayer (the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi>) and Praise; this is a most excellent Catholick Communion. We believe that true Christian Unity is the <hi>Unity of the Spirit</hi>; that is, mental in Faith, Hope and Love; but that it must be held, exercised and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> Eph. 4 3. And therefore if any Christian take it for a sin to joyn with us in the circumstances of Worship, if we can, we'l alter them to satisfie them: If we cannot, we will gladly allow them to worship God together in their own circumstances, and there we will love and pray for one another: We will not cut men off from Christ or the Catholick Church, and damn them for not swearing or saying, that they will obey us, and that there is nothing sinful in any of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Liturgies, Forms or Ceremonies. Our Union is in greater matters common to all Christians, and not in wearing the same fashions, and reading the same forms, and obeying the usurpers of the power of the Keys that are Lay-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for having <hi>obligation</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to Communion with all other Churches (which is all that I can gather he placeth it in, save obeying the same Bishops and Canons), we make no doubt of such right to be used in due order: And therefore we condemn all Church Tyrants that deny men their right: And we do not believe that our right is in the power of Prelates to take from us, unless we forfeit it, and cast it away: And we grant <hi>obligation</hi> to due Communion, as well as right; and therefore will be no such <hi>Separatists</hi> as you are, that refuse Communion with Dissenters in their Churches; yea, condemn all that do but call them Churches: And seeing no man is <hi>obliged</hi> to sin, we disown their crime that will not let men preach nor communicate, unless they will make a solemn Covenant to sin.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Communion that he seems to aim at, is to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> the same persons in every Church that are <hi>received</hi> in or <hi>rejected</hi> by any <hi>one.</hi> We are for as much of this as is needful to the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of the Church: But we do not believe that all the Christian World is bound to take all the godly persons for excommunicate, who shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated here according to the 5<hi>th,</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> &amp;c. Canons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; nor to silence all Ministers that you silence.

When we were newly silenced, 1662. some great men were imployed to affirm, That if we would go and preach to the <hi>Americans</hi> it was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work, and they would bear our charges: I told them, that our lives would be spent e're we could learn their Languages, as fit to preach to them. But it seems if we had gone, Catholick Communion would have silenced us there too, and have obliged the <hi>Americans,</hi> if we converted them, to reject us.</p>
                  <p>What if Bishops excommunicate men for not paying the <hi>Civilians</hi> their Fees, or for not repenting of a truth, or silence us for not assenting and consenting to all in their book? must all the World reject us in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them? It's an heinous crime for any one man to draw a Nation to sin with him; but much more to engage all the Christian World to sin with him; yea, and that on pretence of Catholick Communion. Christ saith (by his Spirit in his Apostle), <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive, and receive one another as Christ received us.</hi> If Bishops silence and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate even them that ate strong in the Faith, must all the World dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey Christ to obey them?</p>
                  <p>If you grant that, <hi>clave errante,</hi> they bind not, must we take their bare words, that <hi>claves non errant?</hi> or must we become Tryers and Judges of all the World that they will judg?</p>
                  <p>And how shall all Churches receive the same that some receive, when you know not whom you receive your selves? Are all the score thousands that are in some of your great Parishes, in your Church? Must all the World take all the <hi>Sadduces, Hobbists, Infidels</hi> and <hi>Damners</hi> that dwell in your Parishes into their Communion? No, nor all that come to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, when the Priest knows not who they be, and never saw them before? Do you use to write Testimonial Letters for every one of your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, when he travelleth into other Parishes or Diocesses? Any man (save a Nonconformist) that had rather take the Sacrament than lie in Goal, is admitted (unless some rare Minister stop a notorious scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous man, till the Court absolve him). If you make a Prison of your Church, and say to all men, [<hi>Chuse this or Newgate,</hi> &amp;c.] must all the World receive such, because they chuse the Church-Prison rather than the other?</p>
                  <p>And if we cannot possibly know which of our Neighbours be of your Church, and which not, in the same Parish (<hi>e. g. Martins, Giles,</hi> &amp;c.) how shall we know who hath right to Communion all the World over? You must needs cast us on believing the Bishops words, when as, 1. They use not to give the World such notice. 2. If they did, we know not forreign Bishops credibility (in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.) they most separate from one another.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> So do we, with these Suppositions, 1. That no man observeth all Christ's Laws and Institutions, without sin; but true Christians profess and practice the observation of them sincerely, so far as they know them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those that you damn and persecute, profess to do this to the best of their understanding, and say, it is for doing it that you revile and ruin them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59354:64"/>3. We suppose, that when Christ's Laws and Man's interfere, Christ's are to be obeyed against Man's.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And we take not the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be cut off from Christ's Church; if it should be proved, that they [<hi>observe not all the Laws and Institutions of Christ</hi>]: In this you preach Separation too blindly. There are some Laws and Institutions of so low a Nature, that Error and Offence against them, cuts not Men off from the Church.</p>
                  <p>But what is his other Notion of [<hi>a Christian Church</hi>]? Why,
<q>It's that which contains the Conventicles of Hereticks and Schismaticks, which are a middle thing between the true Catholick Church and the World of Infidels, as Rebels in a Kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the effect of Confusion: When such men are got into a Labyrinth, they go the further the worse. The Truth of the case is this. <hi>The Church</hi> is usually likened to a Corn Field, that hath, 1. Corn: 2. the Straw and Chaff that feeds and covers it: 3. Stricken Ears, in whole or in part: 4. Weeds: All is but one <hi>Corn Field,</hi> so deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from the Corn: But the Straw and unsound Ears are Integral Parts and Acciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s: But the Weeds are no part at all, but noxious Adjuncts.</p>
                  <p>So, 1. True Believers and Heart-Covenanters, are the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>famosiore &amp; propriâ significatione analogati,</hi> to whom the denomination of the Church is ordinarily given in the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Verbal profession</hi> and <hi>covenanting,</hi> is common to the sound and unsound, as the Straw and Chaff to the Grain and Ears. It constituteth the Church as <hi>visible matter,</hi> as it is supposed to serve and contain the Grain</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Ears totally and visibly smitten, are but equivocally parts; that is, the persons whose profession or notorious practice containeth a renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their Baptismal Covenant or Christianity, are but equivocally called Christians and Church-Members.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those that deny some Article of Faith consequentially, nororiously and ignorantly thinking their Opinion consistent with all the Essentials which they practically profess, are not thereby cut off from the Church; but they having made their Title litigious, may be suspended from some Communion till it be tryed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All good Christians are sinners, and have errors; and if any judg them Hereticks and Schismaticks, for such, they are still in the Church of Christ. The word [<hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Schismatick</hi>] are now become what the speaker please. He is a true <hi>Heretick</hi> that separateth from something essential to (Faith, Love, or Obedience to Christ), and from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59354:64"/>
Church for that, or thereby. Persecutors separate from Christian Love and Communion.</p>
                  <p>So that here is but one Catholick Church; and some called by men He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schismaticks, are true Members: but all that notoriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any Essentials, are no Members of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rebels</hi> is a word that may signifie such as <hi>cast off the Soveraign</hi>: By which, renouncing subjection, they renounce being Members of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and are as an Army of invading Enemies, who are in the Land, but not of the Kingdom. But if any will call those Rebels that do but break a penal local Law, or that are disobedient to a Constable, a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or a Master; this proveth them not to be no part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>But he <hi>numbreth the excommunicate with those that are cut off from Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, upon these Suppositions following: 1. That they be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate not only for sin, but for such sin by which they first cut off themselves from Christ, the Excommunicator only declaring it by his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: else Excommunicators will be worse than Devils, if they damn men, or cut them off from Christ, who do not first cut off and damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it be not only proved an heinous sin in it self, but that they are proved after due instruction and patient warning, to be so <hi>impenitent</hi> in it, by wilful ignorance, or obstinacy against Knowledg, as will not stand with sincere Faith and Obedience to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it's no cutting off a man's self from Christ, to say, that there is somewhat sinful in your Church Government, Liturgy or Ceremonies, or to be afraid to assent and consent to all imposed, or to take an Oath never to endeavour any reforming-alteration of Church Government; nor will it prove a renouncing Christ, to separate from a Usurper, or a false Teacher, or run out of <hi>Dunstans</hi> Church (as they did) for fear it should fall on their heads. If therefore any will cut men off from Christ for any such thing, or for observing the 20<hi>th</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or for the fashion of his Cloke, or for not paying the Court his Fees, they either condemn themselves instead of others, or do much worse than the Devil, that can damn none such.</p>
                  <p>It's Two to One but this Doctor that here damns the excommunicate without distinction, will next say, he meant well, tho he said ill, and that he supposed the <hi>Excommunication just.</hi> The best is, it's no great matter what he meaneth, while he is none of our Judg, except as to himself and the seduced.</p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59354:65"/>1. And I add, That we will suppose the Excommunicator to be no Usurper, but a justly called Pastor, and not a proud ignorant Obtruder, nor a Stranger that cannot try the Cause, nor is called to try it.

                  <p>Then supposing men have no Love that communicate not on his terms, nor love the Peace and Unity of the Church, unless they joyn in such Principles as his, that would destroy it; he tells us truly, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is only the Gift of Christ, as merited by him; and therefore can be had only on his terms; and that is, only in Communion with his Church, and by his Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And what Christ's Terms are, he hath told us, Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.</hi> John 3.16. <hi>Whoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> &amp;c. The Whole Gospel is a Charter of salvation to all that have <hi>true Faith, Hope, Love, and Holiness.</hi> And all such are in the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as ordinarily doth the Scripture tell us, that the <hi>preaching of the Gospel is the means of faith and holiness,</hi> by which God <hi>saveth them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>; and that <hi>by the hearing of faith preached, the spirit is given,</hi> Gal. 3.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 10.14, 17. John 5.24. Acts 18.8. Acts 10.44. <hi>The holy ghost fell on all them that heard the word,</hi> before they were baptized, even the miraculous gift of the Spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13, 21. and 11.28. Christ himself <hi>preached,</hi> but did not <hi>baptize:</hi> He sent forth his Disciples to convert men by <hi>preaching,</hi> Matth. 10.7. and 11.1. Mark 1.38. and 3.14. Luke 4.18, 19, 43. and 9.2, 60. Acts 5.42. and 10.42. and 8.5, 25, 35, 40. and 9.20. 1 Tim. 3.16. 1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel.</hi> John 15.3. <hi>Ye are clean through the word,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>There is no mention in Scripture of any one that was converted and made a Believer by Baptism or the Lord's Supper. The Adult were all to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> before they were baptized; and God promised them forgiveness thereupon: He never bid men baptize Infidels, nor graceless men. Baptism was but the publick solemnizing of the Covenant, which they consented to before, and the solemn investing them in that relation to which they were before entered: And entring them by Baptism, stated

them in the Universal Church, before ever they were setled under any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pastor in a particular Church, as the case of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Acts 8. shews.</p>
                  <p>But that which I call his <hi>Allay,</hi> is, that he copiously tells us, that [<hi>Heaven is a supernatural state of happiness, and not the natural reward of an eartly creature,</hi> p. 92, 93. <hi>It is but an earthly happiness that Nature was made for, and was promised to</hi> Adam <hi>in Paradise; an immortal life on Earth. An immortal life after death cannot be the natural Reward. Innocent flesh is flesh: Were it not for Heaven, man were not bound to lay any restraint on himself, nor suppress sensual inclinations, nor deny them proper and natural satisfactions. As far as we know, to live always in this world and body, was the Original state of mankind, without any expectations of a more divine and spiritual life,</hi> p. 98. Briefly, p. 272. <hi>The Divine Spirit is the principle of Immortality in us, which first giveth life to our souls, and will at last raise our bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> His Opinion in this, is not without the consent of some very learned and good men: And if he had held only, that <hi>immortality</hi> is proper to the <hi>spiritual,</hi> so far as it is <hi>immortal blessedness,</hi> who would contradict him? But seeing it is the undistinguisht <hi>immortality of the Soul that he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of,</hi> I shall in this, with submission, declare my Dissent and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p n="35">§ 35.1. I confess that, as I said, it is an Allay to his damning Sentence of thousands of God's faithful Servants: For it seems by [<hi>Damnation</hi>] he meaneth but <hi>Death,</hi> and the loss of Heaven, in which the Soul is <hi>dead</hi> as well as the Body; and so he judgeth us not to any other Hell. But then all the Infidels, Atheists, Murderers, Perjured, Adulterers and Drunkards, find the like kindness from him (if it will prove such). It seems all their Souls are mortal, and die as Beasts: And so the fear of Hell, or any pain after Death, is dismist by him to all the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I believe not this, because God is the righteous Governor of the World, and ruleth by means suited to the end: And we find, that the fear of a future positive punishment, is so natural to the Conscience of man, that the World is mostly governed by it: And God ruleth not man by meer deceit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that even the fear of Hell is not sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain (no, not professed Christians and Preachers) from Perjury, Persecution, Sensuality, Worldliness and Wickedness: What a case then would the World be in, were they delivered from those fears? Men would be worse than Toads, Adders, or mad Dogs to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59354:67"/>4. The Philosophers, yea, most (and almost all) the Infidel and Pagan World to this day, were convinced of the Immortality of the Soul: So that even the Lord <hi>Herbert, de verit.</hi> numbereth it with the <hi>Notices</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <p n="5">5. I have in divers books given, I think, satisfactory proof of the Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, not now to be repeated, both Natural, and from Revelation: And if he preach the contrary, I crave his patience with those that scruple taking him for their Pastor.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But (as <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iantius</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> plead against the <hi>Platonists</hi> for the Souls Mortality by Nature) I do confess that there is nothing in Nature that will prove that God <hi>cannot</hi> annihilate it, as he can do any Angel; nor that it is immortal without depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce on God, nor that will prove infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly that God will annihilare no Soul: But all that we pretend to prove by Nature is, 1. That there is nothing in the Nature of the Soul that hath a tendency to annihilation or dissolution of it. 2. That God, who maketh all things suitable to their use, seemeth to intimate, that he will not dissolve or annihilate it, by making it of such a durable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 3. And his Government affords us yet stronger moral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As God made <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul of an immortal Nature, so sin changed not his Essence, but his Quality and Relation. And tho it made him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the dissolution of his humanity or composition, and liable to pain, it did not turn him into an Animal of another <hi>species,</hi> nor acquit him from all future suffering. God having made his Soul naturally <hi>durable</hi> or <hi>immortal,</hi> man's merits were but to determine whether it should be <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal happiness</hi> or <hi>immortal misery.</hi> God was not bound to change man's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to shorten his suffering, because man vitiated it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If one should preach, that Christ came to make Humane Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal that were all <hi>naturally mortal,</hi> it would make Faith so hard a Work, as would greatly hinder the conversion of the Infidels. It would be an hard thing to believe that Christ maketh Saints of another <hi>species</hi> from all other men, as men are from Brutes: And if ones Soul be <hi>naturally mortal,</hi> and others, by the <hi>Spirit, immortal,</hi> it would seem a specifick difference: And Philosophers and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who can say so much for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, would despise Christians as less Orthodox than they.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I have elsewhere proved, that the <hi>Iews</hi> held the Souls immortality, except the <hi>Sadduces</hi>: He that said, <hi>Good Master, what shall I do to inherit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59354:67"/>10. It seems by the History of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that if man had not sinned, he should have been so translated: For God had said, <hi>Increase and multiply</hi>; and the Earth would not have held all Humane Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Christ expresly saith, There shall be a <hi>Resurrection to condemnation,</hi> John 5. and that the wicked <hi>shall go to everlasting punishment,</hi> Matth. 25. and that <hi>their worm never dieth, nor their fire is quenched,</hi> &amp;c. But if the Soul be not immortal, there can be no <hi>Resurrection:</hi> It will not be the same man, but another new made: And shall a <hi>new soul</hi> suffer for <hi>anothers</hi> sin? <hi>Luke</hi> 16. in the case of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> tells us Christ's mind of this.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Yet I confess that the <hi>Resurrection of the Body</hi> was not promised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, nor yet plainly threatned, but seemeth to be the common effect of Redemption in its first instance, as it was for all Mankind; <hi>viz.</hi> That man being <hi>filius mortis,</hi> Christ would first, as a common Saviour, <hi>restore his Nature,</hi> and then set him in the way of Tryal for its happiness or misery; as God at first made his <hi>Nature,</hi> and then tryed him accordingly. But it seems had there been no Saviour, the body should have continued dead (being but the meer instrument of the sinning soul), and the immortal soul be immortally unhappy.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Therefore in this, if the Doctor mean not better than he speaks, but thinks indeed that the <hi>Spirit</hi> only is the <hi>Principle of the Souls immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> I differ from him, but not with contempt, acknowledging that these things are weighty, and of difficulty: But I am loath to be less Orthodox than Heathens and Infidels, or than the vain conceited <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who as <hi>Buxtorfe</hi> and others tell us, do hold that good <hi>Israelites</hi> go to Heaven, and bad <hi>Israelites</hi> to Hell, and all others die like Beasts. Did he so hold of good and bad Christians, it were too gross (or of those that are called by the Gospel, and some believe and some refuse). The Papists most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hold, That unbaptized Infants are in some such neutral state, shut out of Heaven, but under no positive pain. But if the Doctor preach so of the Adult and all, tho he seem to abate of his severity to the Dissenters, he will do no service to the Church.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Terms <hi>Reedeeming, Restauration,</hi> and other such in Scripture, intimate, that Christ did restore Man to the state he fell from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adding more mercy to it: And therefore that his Soul was immortal, and he <hi>in via,</hi> and not <hi>in patria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I believe not what he adds of man's being not obliged to deny Sensuality, were it not for Heaven: 1. He thinks <hi>Adam</hi> was made but for Earth: And yet God bound him Not to eat of that Fruit which his eye, appetite and fancy led him to desire. Doth he not here directly condemn God's Law, and justifie <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin? 2. Were there no Heaven for us,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59354:68"/>
man were bound to rule his Appetite and Sense by Reason: And the <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> and his own, would oblige him by Reason to restrain Sensuality, as to Women, Wine, Meat, desire of our Neighbours Estate, Anger that would kill others in revenge. 3. And I think God doth not bind us now to take the forbearance of such comforts as further us in Holiness, Thankfulness, and other Duties, to be any necessary way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="36">§ 36. <hi>Page</hi> 122, 123. To prove his sort of Catholick Unity, he is not content with <hi>Episcopatus Unus est</hi>; but he <hi>asserteth, That all the Bishops of the Church are but one Bishop, invested with the same Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>Episcopacy</hi> may be said to be One, as it is <hi>One in specie,</hi> and <hi>for one remote End and Object</hi>; as Justiceship in <hi>England</hi> may be called One: But that all <hi>Bishops should be but one Bishop,</hi> is strange (Tho by impropriety of speech, almost any thing may be said). No doubt but the Name [<hi>Bishop</hi>] signifieth in common speech, the <hi>Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>]: Either he meaneth, that the <hi>Subjects</hi> are one, or the <hi>Relation.</hi> While he abhorreth the distinguishing of the equivocal [<hi>Unity</hi>], we must take him to speak in <hi>sinsu famosiore &amp; usitato:</hi> 1. They that have divers nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical constitutive parts of men (matter and form), are divers Bishops, as Subjects of the Relation: But so have <hi>e. g.</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>London</hi>: They have divers Souls and Bodies.</p>
                  <p>They that may depose and curse each other, are not the same Bishop: But so did <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and his Adversaries, and hundreds more. If they are <hi>One subjectively,</hi> the <hi>Virtues and Vices</hi> of ones are anothers, and the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may take one man to Prison for anothers Debt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They cannot be <hi>One numerically</hi> in the <hi>Relation</hi> of Bishop: For the <hi>Relation</hi> is <hi>Accidens quod sequitur subjectum</hi>: The same numerical Accident cannot possibly be in two distinct Subjects: For it perisheth if it cease to be in its Subject. One man's <hi>Colour, Virtue, Learning,</hi> &amp;c. cannot numerically be the Accident of another: So that <hi>all Bishops being one Bishop,</hi> is just like the rest of this man's Doctrine. I believe one may be <hi>good</hi> and another <hi>bad,</hi> one <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> and another <hi>damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can the man mean by it, if he could speak his mind? Sure nothing but that their Office is of the <hi>same species,</hi> and they bound to use it in their several places, as from <hi>one Christ,</hi> under <hi>one Law of his,</hi> with the greatest <hi>Love and Concord</hi> they can, and for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of one Universal Church</hi>: Can he mean more, without gross Error?

                  <p n="38">§ 38. ['<hi>No Bishops are absolutely independent, but are obliged to preserve the Unity of the Episcopacy—Those Churches must be independent which have an independent Power and Government, as all must have that have inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Governours or Bishops; and independent Churches can never make one Body, and one Catholick Communion, because they are not Members of each other.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. No Two Churches on Earth of the same <hi>species (Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>Parochial,</hi> &amp;c.) are <hi>members of each other,</hi> but all of the <hi>Universal</hi> or <hi>National,</hi> of which they are <hi>parts</hi>; no more than your fingers or eyes are members of each other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reader, pardon me, that in the beginning I commended him, as being for <hi>Diocesan Independency</hi> in <hi>Power.</hi> These words make me again uncertain what he's for. Plain <hi>English</hi> would distinguish <hi>dependance of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on Rulers in a Polity,</hi> and <hi>dependance of Equals by Concord in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>: These are plain words. He after saith, that <hi>Diocesans have no proper Governors Ecclesiastick over them,</hi> or to that sence: But here he saith, <hi>they are not independent in Power and Government:</hi> Yet the man saith so little in any determinate sence, that I know not whether by [<hi>dependance in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>], he mean [<hi>a political dependance on superior Governors</hi>], or [<hi>a political Union of many persons to make one superior governing power</hi> (like a Senate), or a <hi>meer voluntary concord of many Governors that are Equals,</hi> like that of <hi>many School-Masters</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> whose Concord maketh them not <hi>One Polity,</hi> but <hi>One Community.</hi> The former sence some words of his do fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but elsewhere he so much denieth them, that I hope it is but the <hi>last</hi> that he meaneth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if this be his sence, What independent (whom he so much damneth) doth not acknowledg a <hi>dependance</hi> in <hi>Community,</hi> on all true Christians (and in <hi>Polity on Christ</hi>)? Doth not every Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that all true <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> depend on the <hi>Whole,</hi> as <hi>Parts,</hi> and on each other, as Fellow-Members, obliged to live on the same Christ, in the same Love and Communion in Essentials, and in as many Integrals of Religion as they can reach to?

                  <p n="2">2. To force an <hi>Unbeliever</hi> to Lie, by saying he Believeth, is a Sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An Infidel must not be Baptized till he profess with seeming Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Willingness that he Believeth in God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and will Vow and Devote himself to Him: Therefore to force the unwilling to be Baptized, is a Sacrilegious Prophanation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To be Baptized, is to be solemnly invested in a visible State of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Pardon, Adoption, and Right to Christ and Life Eternal, by a Ministerial Delivery of such Right as in the Name of Christ. But no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Person hath any Right to these unvaluable Gifts: Therefore no unwilling Person should be forced to receive the said Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ's Tryal and Description of the <hi>Willing,</hi> is, Whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to accept of his Grace, forsaking all worldly interest that stands

against it: <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27, to the end. Therefore to Baptize all that are forced to it by the Sword, and had rather be Baptized, and say they Believe, than lose all they have, and lie in Gaol, is to Preach another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in part</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Persons Baptized in infancy, have no right to Communion in the Lord's Supper, till they profess their personal Faith and Consent to the Baptismal Covenant: And the Unbaptized are not to be forced to Communicate: The Lords Supper redelivering all the same great unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Gifts to the Receivers which were delivered in Baptism; the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. The ancient Churches for many hundred years, were so far from forcing any to <hi>Baptism</hi> or <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> or thinking that they should be forced, that they admitted none that did not earnestly desire it: And if the Baptized by Impenitency, or Apostacy, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>long withdrawing from Communion, did shew themselves again uncapable by unwillingness, they Declaratively cast them out.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that the Excommunicate, as such, should be laid up in Prison, and undone, to force them again to be <hi>Willing</hi> to be Christians, or to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, hath the same Reasons against it, as against doing it at the first; and to take them for <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Capable</hi> of Absolution, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had rather say, they <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> than lye in Gaol, is to pervert Christ's Gospel and Sacraments, and confound the Church: And the ancient Churches would have abhorred the motion of such a thing.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But it is just and meet, that Princes make a difference between Christian and Infidel Subjects; and between those that live Willingly in Communion of the Church, and those that refuse it: And that a Christian Kingdom should give those Powers and Immunities to willing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which they give not to Infidels, and the justly Excommunicate; especially in matters relating to Government, Legislative and Judiciary, and especially about Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="10">10. But Christianity being necessary to our Salvation; and it being the Christian Magistrates Duty to do his best for the Salvation of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Knowledge being the means of Consent, and Teaching and Learning the means of Knowledge; it is the Duty of such Magistrates to provide suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59354:76"/>
The ancient Churches had their previous Instructions for such, who were yet dismissed before the Communion Exercises, proper to the faithful.</p>
                  <p n="3">§ 3. <hi>II.</hi> To the second case I Answer; 1. There is nothing in this World that Man can do without all inconveniencies, or which may not be turned to some occasion of Evil. On one side, 1. It is most desirable that all Kingdoms were wholly Christians, and the Princes be Defenders and Promoters of Religion, and the Church and Kingdom be materially the same; and the Civil Government used Holily, according to God's Laws, to holy ends. 2. And it is desirable accordingly, that the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all Christian,</hi> be divided into fit parts for Christian Conversation and Communion, such as our Parishes are, and that all be of the Church who are of the Parish, and the Civil State sanctified, and the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, grow up as Body and Soul into one. And that all in the Parish be of one mind, and of one Church; and that there be no just cause given for any to separate from the rest; nor any do it without cause. 3. And it is <hi>desirable</hi> that all these Parish-Churches in a Kingdom living under one civil Government, do by the means of Senior Pastors and Synods, hold such Correspondence as is necessary to their common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Strength.</p>
                  <p>These things being <hi>Desirable,</hi> it is no wonder if good Governours <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> them; and that ignorant men Plead for all such Concomitants, Subordinates and Consequents, as do <hi>suppose</hi> them. When as in <hi>Fact</hi> the case being <hi>quite otherwise,</hi> to administer matters on a false supposition of the <hi>matter of Fact</hi>; as if <hi>that were,</hi> which <hi>is not</hi>; is but like the Men of <hi>Gothams</hi> striving and fighting which way they should drive their Sheep, and where they should pasture them, when they had none.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Kingdom is so wholly Christian as not to have many (alas, how many!) uncapable of Church-Communion. 2. Yet it is a matter of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be endeavoured, that the Country be divided into Parishes; and that they have an Ecclesiastick as well as a Civil Relation: That is, That each of these Parishes have a stated Teacher (or many) for the Catechumens, who are uncapable of Communion: And that the <hi>same Men</hi> be the <hi>Pastors</hi> of all in that <hi>Parish who consent</hi>; and have the Temples and Tythes by the Magistrates Countenance and Consent: And this great advantage of Publick Countenance and Maintenance, will no doubt prevail with the main Body of Christians in that Parish, if the men be desirable or tollerable, to chuse them rather than others, to avoid discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59354:77"/>
and the maintaining of others: As all in the Hospital will be for the established Physician, who dare trust him with their Lives.</p>
                  <p>But if this should be carried further, to bind all persons to an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute acceptance of such Parish Priests to be their only Pastors (under the Bishops) who are put upon them, the mischiefs would be intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Then all must accept of Papists Priests only in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Bavaria, Austria,</hi> &amp;c and of bare Readers in <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>covy.</hi> 2. Or else all Subjects are made Judges of the qualification of their Kings, whether they are Orthoodox enough to chuse them Pastors, while they are not allowed to judge what Pastor to trust. 3. And then every ignorant, <hi>malignant, or prophane Man,</hi> who by inheritance or purchase hath got <hi>Advowsons</hi> or <hi>Presentations,</hi> hath got an advantage greatly to hinder the Salvation of all the Parish: And if Money may buy Souls for so much probability of Damnation, no wonder if the god of this World imploy many rich Merchants to purchase Advowsons. For how ordinarily God worketh according to the suitableness of means, Scripture and full Experience prove. If the Blind lead the Blind, both fall into the Ditch. 4. And this is quite contrary to the Ordination and bounty of our Lord, who gave men gifts for the Edification of his Church; and our Salvation, if we may not use the publick Pastoral help of any, better than many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons will chuse. I would fly from that Kingdom as from a Bondage where I may use no Physician, no Tutor, no Food, but what is chosen for me by any one that can purchase such a chusing-power. And my Soul is more to me than my Body, and less in the Power of Man. And it is not the talk of a Magisterial Ranter that shall perswade me to be indifferent what Teacher I use, as if God would work by all alike.</p>
                  <p n="4">§ 4. 2. On the other side, 1. It is of absolute necessity that every man consent before another man can do the work of a Pastor for his Soul: And God in Nature and Scripture hath ordained, that he who must be saved or damned according to the Ministers success, should be the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser or refuser of that which so unspeakably concerneth him; and not have his salvation more in anothers power than his own, if he be at Age, and in his Wits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And yet this may be run into Extreams; and these are not easily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. 1. Infants (that is, all short of an Understanding, chusing Age) and Ideots and Mad-men, are half Brutes <hi>in act,</hi> and to be governed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by force, so far as they are uncapable of Reason. But these are not capable of the Church-Communion of the Adult. Yea, not only Children, but all Subjects who are not Communicants, may be forced to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59354:77"/>
hear and learn as Catechumens, as is said: And they must not pretend a power to chuse their Teachers, to excuse them from all Learning: But if they say, that they can learn better of another than the Parish-Minister; if they are able, they may remove to another Parish: If not, they must give proof that they live as Learners under some Teacher who is capable to instruct them, approved or tolerated by Authority, where Rulers own the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And if Communicants will be at the charge of maintaining a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor whom they can better trust their Souls with, than him whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron chuseth for them, the Orthodox or tolerating Magistrate must see that he be not an Heretick, that doth more hurt than good; and must keep them under the Laws of Loyalty and Peace, and see that they sow not Sedition, and revile not others under pretence of worshipping God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And no men should, without necessity, lose the advantages of a publick Ministry which the most consent to, and which hath the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates countenance and maintenance; because gathering singular Churches within Parish-bounds, seems some accusation of the Parish-Minister or Church; and such Churches are oft tempted to Envy and Censoriousness, and are usually envied and censured by others: And Unity is much of our strength and beauty. But in case of necessity it may be done.</p>
                  <p n="5">§ 5. In short: 1. A good Ruler chusing a worthy Teacher for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, will thereby do much to draw all the sober to consent to him as their Pastor.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bad Rulers and Patrons chusing ignorant, unskilful, furious, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or scandalous Teachers, will drive those that love their souls, to chuse better for themselves, whatever it cost them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where the Ministry and Churches are so vitiated in publick, that their Communion is unlawful, there God's worship must be kept up only in other voluntary Churches.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where publick Ministers or Worship are not utterly intolerable, but greatly insufficient for the preservation of Religion and good of Souls, by Disability, or unsound Doctrine, or Vice; there the chief preservation of Religion must be in Voluntary Churches; but so, that the Parochial be no further disowned than there is cause.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where the publick Ministry and Worship are sound, but impose some unnecessary doubtful things, as conditions of Communion, in justice they bind themselves thereby to allow Voluntary Churches to such as take these terms to be sin.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59354:78"/>6. When the Ministry, and Church-Worship, and State, are sound, and the conditions lawful, and weakness maketh conscionable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians think otherwise, there private Churches must be tolerated, but as Hospitals for the sick, under the care of the Magistrate, keeping peace.</p>
                  <p>The strife in <hi>England</hi> at this day, is chiefly about the choice of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, in which good people will never be indifferent: And few that I have known, refuse audience and honour to able, godly, profitable Preachers that differ from them. We are not at all of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">§ 6. III. As to the Third Case, [For what Reasons I, and such other join in Worship and Communion with Parish-Churches? And whether our practice be a <hi>sin</hi> or a <hi>duty,</hi> or a <hi>thing indifferent</hi>?] For answer, I. I shall shew what I am not pleading for. II. What it is that I hold and plead for, or defend. III. What are the Reasons of my practice. IV. Why it is that I now give out my Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="7">§ 7. I. For the First, 1. I am far from perswading any one to commit the least sin on pretence of Concord or Communion with any Church on earth. Their damnation is just, who say, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come.</hi> Sin may seem to serve us for a Job, but it will be bitter in the latter end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would not have any to stretch their Consciences for Worldly Interest, to believe that Sin is no Sin, or that they may do it because it is a little one. It is no little one to him that does it wilfully for Worldly Ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If an honest Christian mistake an indifferent thing to be a Sin, I would have him do his best to get a truer apprehension: But if he cannot, I would not have him do the thing: For he that can do that which he thinks a sin, tho by mistake, can as easily commit a real sin: And it is a real sin to him: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatever is not of faith, is sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>But is such a man a martyr, or rewardable, who suffereth for his error?</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> He is rewardable as he suffereth for fearing to disobey God, and for that which is formally obedience, tho materially it was a mistaken thing. If you had a Servant who mistook your command, but died in the performance of that mistake, you would commend his fidelity: And if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that mistook you, did what you bid him by that mistake, but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously for hire, crossed what he thought you meant, you would take him for a perfidious knave.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>But must a man then do all that he taketh to be a duty, or avoid all which he taketh for a sin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> A culpable erring judgment entangleth a man in sin, whether he follow it or not: And there is no possibility of avoiding the sin, but by using God's helps till his judgment be set right. For Conscience is not the <hi>Maker</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>Discerner</hi> of it: And the Law-maker changeth not his Law, because men change their thoughts of it. But while men are under a self-made necessity of sinning, the lesser sin and the greater may be distinguished, <hi>e. g.</hi> If you mis-judg it unlawful to keep a <hi>Saints day</hi> holy, to eat Flesh on <hi>Fridays,</hi> to use a Cross as a sign of Christianity, it is a greater sin to do these, than to omit them: But if you judg it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to pray, or hear God's Word, or worship him, or to feed your self or children, your error is the aggravation, and no extenuation of the sin. And if you think it a duty to keep a Fast once a week, to wear a course garment, or to do any indifferent thing, it's a greater sin to omit them, than to do them: But if you take it to be a duty to lie, slander, steal, be drunk, murder, persecute, it aggravateth the sin, that both mind and practice are defiled with it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I perswade no one to own the Ministry of an uncapable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <hi>viz.</hi> one utterly Insufficient, Heretical, or Malignant, who doth more harm than good. The Conformists own this Rule, while they silence so many, and tell men, that those that have not Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Diocesans, are not to be communicated with, or owned as Ministers. Both sides then confess, that <hi>uncapable</hi> persons are not to be owned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I perswade none to be indifferent in the matters which concern their souls, as <hi>whom</hi> they hear or chuse to be their Pastor, nor in what manner they worship God, nor to prefer any person or mode, which (all things considered) is worse before better; nor to deny themselves the great help of a learned, skilful, godly, faithful Pastor, to teach them publickly, and counsel them privately, when they may have such, meerly because it is forbidden them by men, and the Patron hath chosen them another, who hath no such qualifications.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59354:79"/>6. I am perswading none that are under the government of their Parents or Masters, to disobey them in the choice of the Pastor whom they shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily attend, as long as they perswade them to a safer choice than the Patron hath made for them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p n="9">9. I perswade none to make light of any Church-corruptions, nor to forbear endeavouring by lawful means, in their place and calling, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; much less to swear or promise it, were that any where requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or to renounce any Oath as not obliging them to any thing which God had made their duty.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I perswade none to the sinful fear of man, or to abate Christian fortitude, constancy and patience in a good Cause, nor to be over-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Flesh, or make too great a matter of their suffering. Alas! what are Worms, that in the way to the Grave they should be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than God? Poverty and Prisons may be as safe and near a way to Heaven, as Wealth and Liberty. None of all these are the things that I am for.</p>
                  <p n="8">§ 8. II. That you may know the Reasons of my own practice, I shall next tell you, <hi>what it is that my judgment is for:</hi> which leads me to it.</p>
                  <p>And 1. I think all persons are visible Christians who are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and profess their continued consent to the Baptismal Covenant, and are not proved to have renounced or forsaken it by Word or Deed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I think, that the Pastor is by Office made the Church-Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the persons Profession be understanding, serious, and credible, or not: and whether he be proved to forsake it. And if the man dissemble, or the Pastor judge falsly, it's their Sin and not mine, if I contribute not to it by omitting any Monitory duty of my own; nor is it lawful for me to usurp the Pastors judging power: Nor am I bound to know (my self) the Case and Lives of all in the Church that I joyn with; much less, where I occasionally or seldom come.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59354:79"/>3. I think, that a tollerable man, though unduly chosen, yet after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and consented to by the Parish Communicants, is a true Pastor, supposing his own Consent: And that he and they are a true Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I hold that Christ commanded his Apostles to endeavour [<hi>to Disciple to him all Nations,</hi> and <hi>Baptize,</hi> and <hi>Teach them,</hi>] Mat. 28.19, 20. And that we should pray and endeavour that the Kingdoms of the World may become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ. And that all Christian Kings are bound to do their best, to make all their Subjects the Subjects of Christ, more than the Jewish Kings were bound to promote the <hi>Iews</hi> Religion: And that Christian Kingdoms are much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and desirable than Christian Churches in an Heathen Kingdom: And that the Civil State and Interest should be sanctified and made religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more than a Shell or Body to the Religious State, as the Kernel or the Soul: And so they should be as far coherent and commensurable, as can be procured: Yet not so as to corrupt the religious state on that pretence, by crookening it to any carnal interest. The Body formeth not the Soul, nor is it to be cut meet to the Cloathes, nor the Foot fitted to the Shooe. I intreat those that be not sensible of the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>National Christianity,</hi> to read a little Book, called, <hi>The whole Duty of Nations</hi> (written by a Conforming Minister, who is much more Honourable by his Extraordinary Worth, than his Great Estate and Birth), which will bear down dissent by a stream of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In order to the promoting of this National Concord in Religion, I have still resolved to conform to all the National Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about Religion, which corrupt it not, nor command any sinful thing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Tho I renounce all Forreign Jurisdiction, Monarchical or Aristocratical, and usurpation of an Universal Government over all the Christian World (which hath no civil or religious Universal Lawgiver or Judg but Christ, neither Monarch nor Senate being capable of it), yet I much more value the concord of the Universal Church, than of one Nation: And do more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor doing any thing which is a sinful separation, or discord from the Church Universal: And I take the unchurching of the Univer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. All Christians must be known to be Christ's Disciples by loving one another as themselves: And love judgeth no evil till constrained.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Therefore I will separate from no Christian or Church without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, no further than they separate from Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59354:80"/>9. I do not separate from a Church meerly because I meet not with them: else I should separate from all the World, save the place where I am present: But I avoid these several degrees of sinful separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Accounting true Churches and Ministers to be none such (as the Papists do by all that have not an uninterrupted succession of Diocesan Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination).</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Accounting the Ministry, and Worship, and Government so bad, as makes Communion with the Church <hi>unlawful,</hi> if it be not so.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doing that needlesly which hath the scandalous appearing signification of such a judgment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I know many of the Parish-Ministers to be men of very laudable abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and conversations, and to have the consent of the most of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants of the Parish.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I am past doubt, that so much of the Liturgie as is used every Lords Day, as the common Worship, is so far sound as to the matter of it, that it hath no more <hi>material</hi> faultiness than is too often in extemporate Church-praying: And that the disorder and faultiness in the <hi>Manner,</hi> is no greater than is used also by many in <hi>free prayer,</hi> with whom we all think it lawful to joyn. And that prejudice maketh it seem to many much more faulty than it is: The greatest dislike is of the <hi>Responses</hi> by the <hi>People,</hi> and the shortness of the Prayers, both which were used in the Ancient Churches, when no sound Christians scrupled it, much less separated for it. Christ approved of the short Prayer of the <hi>Publican, [God be merciful to me a sinner].</hi> Repetitions, and the Peoples Acclamations and Responses, were used in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, as is evident in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and in many Psalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We all allow the Peoples speaking, even as much as the Minister in singing Psalms: And the Congregation would murmur if the People should be but Hearers while the Minister singeth alone. Of old their sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was like our <hi>saying,</hi> and not in Rithmes, like ours. Will any pretend to prove that it's lawful for the <hi>People</hi> to sing <hi>God's Praise,</hi> and not to <hi>say it?</hi> But they that dislike it, may be silent.</p>
                  <p>As to the Objection, that <hi>it's unlawful to use imposed forms</hi>; I have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it so fully in my <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every Ministers Prayer is a Form to the People, and imposed on them to joyn in putting it up to God. 2. And that its lawful for a Child to use a Form imposed by Parents; therefore not simply evil. 3. And that we all allow imposed Forms of Catechizing, and of singing Prayers and Praise to God: And that he that said, <hi>Speak to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs,</hi> never meant that they must not be premeditated. 4. And many men sin by needless <hi>impositions,</hi> when the <hi>use</hi> of the thing imposed is no sin, but a duty.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. I therefore take it to be my duty, as a private Hearer, 1. When I am where there is a tolerable Minister, and no other Church but the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, to joyn in Worship and Communion with them constantly. 2. As a Minister on whom the Conditions in the Laws are put, to refuse some of those Conditions. 3. As an <hi>Hearer</hi> where the <hi>Minister is utterly intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to do nothing which seemeth an owning him as a Minister. 4. In a place where the Parochial Ministry is the best, but a private Minister and Church is peaceable and sound, I will go ordinarily to the Parish-Church, but sometime to the weaker, if my forbearance would seem a disowning of their Communion; yea, tho it were to one that is against Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism by mistake. 5. In a place where the privater Minister and Worship is most spiritual, powerful and profitable, I would go ordinarily thither, if I may: But sometimes to a tolerable Parish-Minister and Communion, in case my not going seem to signifie that I separate from their Communion, as utterly unlawful. And if I be a Preacher in a privater Church, I will sometimes get another to supply my place, and go to the Parish-Church, if else my forbearance would seem to signifie that I judg it unlawful. 6. I therefore take the same thing here to be lawful to one, and a fault in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a duty to another. Those that have far better Helps and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (all things considered), should not ordinarily prefer worse: And when the case differs not much, the Will of a Parent, an Husband, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or a Magistrate, should sway much: And where it is a duty to noted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to go to the Parish-Church sometime, because else it will signifie that they think it unlawful, an hundred Children, Servants, Wives, poor people, who are not noted or mist, and their absence is no scandal, are not bound to go at all, while they have much better Helps and Communion elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Having told you my Judgment, of which in my Two forementioned Books I have given a fuller account: I shall next add the reason of my Practice, both to satisfie those that censure me, and those that crave my help for their information; but not making my self a Judg of them that differ.</p>

                     <head>The Reasons of my Practice in Parochial-Communion.</head>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. III. But here I am in the same streight as when I gave an account of my Nonconformity: When upon many years urgency I did but tell men what the sins were which I thought I should commit if I conformed, some said, that I made the Conformists a Faction of unconscionable perjured Villains: And if I now tell the Reasons why I joyn in the Parish-Churches, some will say, that these Reasons accuse them that do not, of the guilt of Schism and sinful suffering. But he that will perform no duty which none will be offended at, shall scarce do any in the World. My Reasons then are these:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>I.</hi> I do it much for my own Edification: And who can prove my Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unlawful? There is so sound judicious preaching in my Parish-Church where I now go, that I take it to be my considerable loss when sickness keepeth me away. And who can bind me to my loss? If a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger give now and then a peevish ignorant flirt at such as differ from him (as those called <hi>Arminians,</hi> and some others use to do), I am not so thin-skin'd as thereby to smart; nor so foolish as to raise a stir by talking against it, which by taking no notice, will go out like a Squib, which the City-Engines need not be fetcht to quench. Ignorant Preachers must have some forbearance in their Self-conceitedness and petulent Temerity, of what Sect or Faction soever they be, <hi>Conformists</hi> or <hi>Nonconformists.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> I do it much to go as far in National Concord in Religion, as possibly I can, and for the avoiding all that makes against it. The foresaid Book, [<hi>The whole Duty of Nations</hi>] will convince any impartial capable Reader, of what great Duty and Advantage National Countenance and Concord is to the interest of Religion. And though it bring in multitudes of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, God makes some use for the Church of such: I would ask the Dissenters but two Questions; 1. Would you not wish the prosperity of the Church your Selves; and that all Power and Laws promoted Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true Reformation? No doubt you wish it: And would not that bring in multitudes of Hypocrites? They are like Vermin and Flies, who swarm most in the warmest Seasons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If all the Hypocrites in the World should renounce Christianity, and leave none to profess it but the sincere, would not those few be left as a wonder, and a prey? O what a blow would it be to Religion in the World! Will you root out not only the Tares, but the Straw and Chaff, on pretence to save the Corn?</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59354:81"/>
                        <hi>III.</hi> I do it to keep up Brotherly Love amongst us, which certainly censorious accusations of one another doth destroy: When you fly from them, you seem to accuse them as men uncapable of your Christian Communion; and this seemeth hatred or contempt. And as sure as Fire causeth Fire, and Water quencheth it; Love causeth Love, and Hatred destroyeth it, and causeth hatred. And Christian Love is no small Duty.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> I do it very much to avoid the scandal of seeming to judge Parish Communion an unlawful thing, and seeming to separate from them on that account. That they err who judge it so unlawful, I am satisfyed: And that scandal is a great Sin, the second Commandment, and Christ's dreadful threatning of the scandalous, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s abhorrence of it, satisfies me. The second Commandment forbids Corporal Scandalous seeming to be Idolaters (what ever the Heart be:) And I must not seem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church ot sinfully censure, what ever be in my Thoughts. I know it is no such Scandal, that I go not here to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, to the <hi>French</hi> Church, or the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church. For no man hath any reason to interpret it to signifie, that I separate from their Communion as unlawful: But there is great reason to interpret my total avoiding the Parish Churches, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that I judge it unlawful to Communicate with them, as is evident in these Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are divers Nonconforming Separatists, who have lately written to prove it unlawful.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Multitudes suffer much upon the publick accusations because they will not Communicate with them; who tell the people, that they take it to be Sin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I, and Others, are censured by such, as Sinners for doing it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Parochial Churches, are the settled National order.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Laws command our joining with them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Magistrates accuse and prosecute the refusers.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Parish Ministers are offended at our refusal, and accuse it as sinful separation, and so interpret it.</p>
                     <p>All this set together, maketh, it past all denial, that after all this, to avoid all Parish Communion, is by our Actions to say, that we judge it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whatever is in our Hearts: Had we all these calls to go sometimes to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Church (supposing that we understood them) and would not go, it were a scandalous signification, that we judge it sinful. And one may Lie by Deeds as well as by Words.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>V.</hi> I take it to be a great Sin to bear false Witness against my Neighbour, and wrongfully accuse a single person: But much greater so to accuse a Church, and much more nine thousand Churches: But to say by my action that their worship of God is so sinful, that it is unlawful to join with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59354:82"/>
them; is, as I think, so to accuse them. I dare not say so of an <hi>Anabaptists</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <hi>VI.</hi> I much more dread to separate from almost all Christ's Church on Earth. For if Christ have no Church, he is no Head, King, or Saviour of it. And to say, that he accepteth not of their Worship, is to say, that he presenteth it not to God, as their <hi>intercessor.</hi> The Article of our Believing the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Article. If there be no such <hi>Body,</hi> I can be no <hi>Member</hi> of it. And this seemeth a renouncing of my part in the Prayers of almost all the Church, when I take them to be intollerably sinful, and not accepted by God: Whereas I take it to be my great Duty, to put up no one Prayer to God, but in mental Communion with all the Church on Earth: that is, As a Member of that Society. And I would not take all the Riches of the World for my part in the Love, Prayers and Communion of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church. If I cut off my self from the <hi>Body,</hi> I cut off my self from the <hi>Head,</hi> and am a withered <hi>Branch:</hi> to be united and baptized into <hi>Christ,</hi> and to the <hi>Church,</hi> are two effects of one action; and so would it be to <hi>separate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I take it for such a Crime against Christ to say, that almost all his Church is <hi>not His,</hi> but <hi>Satans</hi>; as it would be against the <hi>King</hi> to say, that almost all his Kingdoms are <hi>none of his</hi> but <hi>his Enemies.</hi> I may say, that the <hi>Irish,</hi> the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> or <hi>Orcades,</hi> are the most ignorant barbarous part of his Dominions; but not that they are <hi>none.</hi> And a slander of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Christian World, is a very great one.</p>
                     <p>But to separate from our Parrish Churches upon a Cause that is <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>almost all the Christian World,</hi> is <hi>Virtually</hi> and <hi>Interpretatively</hi> to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from almost all. And to separate because of the faultiness of the Liturgy, the Ministry (in many) or the people, is to separate on a cause common to almost all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The recorded Liturgies of the several Sects of Christians in the World (in the <hi>Biblioth. Patrum,</hi> and elsewhere) shew it evidently, that they are all far faultier than ours. All the <hi>Abassines, Coptics, Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Nestorians, Melchites, Maronites,</hi> the <hi>Armenians, Georgians, Circas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Meugrelians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> have Liturgies far worse than ours: Let them that doubt of it, go to the <hi>Greek</hi>-Church in <hi>Sohoe</hi>-Fields. The <hi>Nestorian</hi> Liturgy is one of the soundest and best that I find recorded (which intimateth that they are not so bad as some make them.)

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I separate from none of them further than they separate from Christ. I mentally separate from the Sin that is in their Worship, and as far as I can in my own: And I locally separate from the Papists, and all such as e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">
                        <hi>VII.</hi> I am afraid of tempting men to Infidelity and Apostacy from Christ. I know his Flock is little. But if you perswade men, that there are none on Earth whom he owneth as his Church, or accepteth their Worship, or that may be joined with, who are as faulty as our Parish-Churches; it will reduce them all to so small a Compass, as being next to none; people will easily go one step further, and deny all. To say, that the King was only King of <hi>Windsor,</hi> or <hi>Brentford,</hi> would be but a little from saying, that he is no King. Men will hardly believe, that really the Son of God did all the Wonders mentioned in the Gospel, to gather an accepted Church no bigger than the few that are better than all that Worship him according to our Liturgy. I doubt this is laying a stumbling block.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <hi>VIII.</hi> I take my self bound to disown that principle of many, who think their presence maketh them guilty of all that is faulty in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Ministration: For this dissolveth all Worshipping Churches on Earth without exception. We are sure there is none that offer God a blameless Service. We must then join with none at all: Specially with those who Worship without a Liturgick Form: For we never know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, but that they may say somewhat that is amiss. But in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we foreknow, that imperfect men will do all things imperfectly and faultily. And by this we must give over Praying or Worshipping in private also, being all sure to do it with sinful imperfections. But to omit it will be greater Sin.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> I am afraid of deceiving the Servants of Christ, and tempting them into Error, and into disaffection toward their Brethren, by making them believe, that it is unlawful to Hear, or Communicate in the Parish-Churches. If we constantly refuse such Communion when we are called to it so importunately, the people can think no less, than that we judge it to be a Sin. And so we shall be the Authors of their Error; I find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that it is so: Though many Ministers who go not to the Parish-Churches tell them, [<hi>We take it not for a thing unlawful, but are kept away our selves by our constant preaching, as the Conformists are kept from hearing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59354:83"/>
one another:</hi>] Yet this is not understood by many, but by their constant avoiding it, they judge them to think otherwise: And it is my Office to save them from Error and Deceit, and not to deceive them.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <hi>X.</hi> I find it necessary by practice, as well as by words, to confute those who would make the World believe, that the Non-Conformists affright men from the Parish-Churches, by making them believe that to be there is sinful; lest they should loose them from their dependance on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Far be it from us to have any such design as to keep up any interest of our own, against the interest of the Church, and of Mens Souls, and by Selfishness and Deceit to draw the people into Error and Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness: It's Christ and not our Selves that we Preach.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <hi>XI.</hi> I am not willing to be guilty of the peoples suffering as Recusants. I would encourage them to patient suffering for their Duty; but not draw them into a sinful Omission of Duty to their penal suffering. I said before, that a Man may be accepted of God for a <hi>Well-meant Action,</hi> when the <hi>Matter</hi> of it is <hi>culpable</hi> by mistake. But I that dare not Cheat or Rob men of their Money, or entice them unjustly into suretiship; dare not use the name of God and Religion knowingly, to entice many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred honest Christians to suffer for the Omission of a Duty to God and Man.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <hi>XII.</hi> I am resolved, that I will not wilfully be guilty of hardening any in Persecution, or in sinful afflicting conscionable Christians on pretence of Laws, or Concord. And I am sure, that when they see that sufferers are deceived, and suffer for omitting a publick Duty; it is the likest way in the World, to quiet their Consciences, who afflict them, when they can say, <hi>We punish them for their faults</hi>; they that understand not the difference of faults, are like to justifie themselves as doing well. Yea, if any shall persecute Godly Men for doing their Duty, or refusing to Sin; if they find them guilty but of one Fault or Error, it will make them think, that the rest is like it; and that shall serve to justifie their persecuting Truth and Duty. And if it be so terrible to cause the stumbling of one little one, shall we cause the stumbling of any into so damning a Sin as Persecution?</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>You are like to encourage men to persecution, when by your practice you intimate, that it is their duty to come to the Parish-Church, and so that they suffer for their sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I have shewed, that the same thing may be one man's duty which is not anothers: It is a <hi>French-man</hi>'s duty here to go to the <hi>French-Church,</hi> but it is not mine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What will you make of the Magistrates then? Do you think, that they take any Subject to be without Sin? Or, that they are so inhumane and worse than Heathens, as to think, that all that have any Sin, should be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59354:83"/>
silenced, or forbidden to Worship God, or punished if they forbear not? It's a Sin to sleep at Church, or to give nothing, or too little there at Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for the Poor; and an hundred such. And are they so severe as to send Men to Gaol, or fine them for it? They make prophane Swearers pay but twelve pence an Oath (if any thing) and few suffer for wishing <hi>God to Damn them,</hi> or for being drunk, even at the time of Worship: And do you think, they will be so palpably partial, as to ruin honest Christians for praying without book?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And do you consider, what your Objection implyeth? Must I forbear that which my Conscience calleth my Duty, if another suffer for accounting it a Sin? What if some take baptizing Infants, or sanctifying the Lords day rather than the seventh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Sin, must I forbear these, lest I occasion their suffering?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I have tryed these twenty years, and though I went to the Parish-Church, none ever suffered the more by it: Yea, I have suffered more than most here, that were of the other mind. This therefore is but a Fiction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Did Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> forbear Writing for Parish-Communion, lest his party the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> suffer? Or did Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> forbear writing for Hearing the Parish Ministers, lest the refusers suffer? Or did they not both write for the Oath of Supremacy, though many <hi>Scots</hi> suffered for refusing it? Yea, and therefore wrote all this that their followers might not suffer by mistake?</p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <hi>XIII.</hi> I know that the main Cause of Church-Divisions, is seeking a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on false and sinful terms: And I know that the opinion, That Parish-Communion is unlawful, is an Error; and therefore unfit to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Union: And I see many would make it such a Condition. And false terms of Concord, are the great and certain means of Discord; for the wisest Christians will refuse them: And some Impose them by <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Censures,</hi> as others do by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Sword.</hi> And I will not countenance dividing terms.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>That is the chief fault of your Doctrine and Practice, That it will cause Divisions among us; when some will do as you do, and others cannot; and so our Congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. As I said, Do not some write against the Lawfulness of Parish-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? And some against Infant Baptism, and the Lords Day? And do not they divide by <hi>Writing against them?</hi> And did Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> forbear, as aforesaid, for fear of Division? If we are already divided in Judgment and Practice, sure giving each other an account of our reasons, is rather the way to heal us.</p>

Yea, not only all the Churches in the Eastern, Southern and Northern parts, and all in the West, save themselves, have Liturgies, or separate not from them. But even of the Non-conformists in <hi>England,</hi> those that of old, or of late have pleaded their Cause have taken the Liturgy for no sufficient cause of separation: Nay, even the old Separatists, called <hi>Brownists,</hi> denied not the lawfulness of forms of Prayer, nor refused to join with the Parish-Churches in our Liturgy sometimes; only they thought, that when Crossing, or such Ceremonies were used, they were bound to disown them. And shall men that separate from the Communion of almost all the Churches on Earth as unlawful, pretend that their way is the way of Unity; and that the contrary doth divide? Is our shunning Division from the Christian World, a dividing Practice? In <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> thought no man capable of Baptizing him, and so Baptized himself; and some others have done so since, thinking none fit for Communion, but the few that are their Flocks. Yet these that divided from all the World, cryed down <hi>Dividing</hi> from themselves. But were all divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that were against them? This is the saddest of all Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                        <hi>XIV.</hi> Yea, I am loth to do that which condemneth groundlesly the Reformers, the Martyrs, the Godly Conformists, the old Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, the later, and the <hi>Brownists</hi> themselves, as being all for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Communion.</p>

If we lose all the Parish-Churches, some other will have them. If Protestants have them not, Papists will: And the Parochial Religion will be the National and common Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The most will go thither, and attend those Ministers who have the publick Authority and Maintenance: Therefore it is most evident, that they who would keep up the Protestant Religion, must do their best to keep it up in the Parish-Churches: And they that would corrupt and undermine it there, or drive or draw it thence into meer private tolerated Churches, would drive it out of the Land as National and Extensive, and let in Popery to be the National Religion: And I doubt not the Papists will be the most zealous potent helpers of all them among us who cry down a <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; that is, the removing of the things which we account sinful, that we may live in concord (which it makes me shrug to think that ever a religious Protestant should be against, who himself counts that sin which we would have removed: As if they said, <hi>Reform none of your publick sins, unless you will reform as much as we judg sinful, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all that I have ever suffered from men, is but a Flea-biting to that which I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Diseases of my own Soul and Body: and yet I can love and forgive my self.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Compare these Two sorts together: How vast a number do the contrary minded censure?

                     <p>They accuse also all the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> since changed; and in a word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Christian World: And yet we can easily <hi>forgive them, and forbear them:</hi> And if they cannot bear <hi>with us,</hi> if we obey our Consciences, and give them the Reason of it; yea, if we had told them why we judg them to be

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Do, or must all men forbear giving a Reason of their Judgment and Practice to those that think them sinful? yea, or to confute the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of others, for fear of being censured? Will you censure us, and must not hear our Reasons? Are you so much worse than Lawyers, that can plead without breach of Charity? May not friendly debates beat out the truth to our mutual edification? No truths are so clear to us, before they are controverted, usually, as after. Reproach not the Nonconformists, as if they could not bear contradiction.</p>

But I confess, as the Books by which I drew off many <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> did increase Division from their Party, by ceasing the Divisions from the Church; so it may be here.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Experience confuteth this: I think most who hear me, do think it lawful, and oft go thither. 2. I have oft told them publickly, That I desire none of them to hear me, who do not need my help: If they have room, and sufficient helps in the Parish-Churches, I had rather they would not take up, with us, the room which others should have who truly need our help. If nothing bring them to me, but an Opinion, that it's sin to joyn with the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> I will do my best to drive them from me.

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Why cannot I be carnal, contentious, drink too much at the Sacrament, if I could have communicated with the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> that had such? Why did not Christ commit the Synagogue-sins, if he could communicate in the Synagogues? The persons who put this question, disgrace themselves by judging of things which they understand not.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Because I think I have an urgent cause to endeavour to save some from the guilt of <hi>Persecution</hi>: And if I note the mistakes of One side only, I shall be justly charged with partiality.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and such others, would make the World believe, that we defend that Separation which by word and practice we have long opposed: And we owe fuller satisfaction to them, and to such as they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I am much obliged to rectifie mens mistake of the Reason, why many Nonconforming Ministers here come not to the Parish Churches: Many were agreed to come, when the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act of Confinement coming out, prevented it: For to have appeared in the Churches, would have exposed them to Six months imprisonment for being in the City. And since then, the same Reason hindereth many, which keepeth Conformists from communicating with each other, even their own labours at home. But many do go to the Churches in publick, and I conjecture others hereafter will get their Places sometime supplied by others, that they may go: For most of my acquaintance hold it lawful, as far as I can judg.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I would stop them that censure, as sinners, unjustly, the late <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> the <hi>Common-Council, Iurors,</hi> and all the good Christians thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="6">6. I remember why Mr. <hi>Io. Ball</hi> wrote against Separation just when Reformation was intended: Many thought it unseasonable, but it proved otherwise by the sad effects which he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I cannot forget what this mistake hath wrought in <hi>England,</hi> from 1641. to 1660. which I will not further recite, but only say, That when there was neither Bishops, nor their Courts, nor Liturgy, nor Ceremonies imposed on them, separate Assemblies were as numerous, and as much and more pleaded for, than now, and managed with too much strife; and reconciling and Unity was much resisted by that side.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>REader, when the last sheet of the foregoing Paper was Printed, I received these Twelve Arguments, famed to be Dr. <hi>John Owen</hi>'s: Whether Fame truly or falsly father them, I know not: It is the Cause that I am concerned in. After Three and Twenty years practice since the Bishops return, I was by Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, called to give the Reasons of my Practice, which yet I had often done in part before. They said, That my communicating in the Parish-Churches, even when my self and others were maliciously persecuted by a sort of proud and worldly Clergy-men, did more harm than ever I did good: Tho I am bound with meekness to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ender them a Reason of my practice; I have found by experience, that neither side can bear the account which they call for. Some wise and good men will blame me for making our differences to be so much known, especially for remembring old miscarriages: I obey my Conscience: All these things are commonly known already; and we hear sharply of them from God and Man, because Men hear not our Repentance, but our Iustification: Had we conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st, God is faithful to forgive. Impenitence threatens our yet greater suffering. When we give glory to God, and take shame to our selves, our hopes will revive. Nothing bringeth so much scandal, and armeth Enemies against us, as owning sin, or hiding it. I durst no longer see Thousands of good Christians misguided into mistakes, and like to be ruined for them, and hereby hardening their Persecutors, rejoycing the Papists, who joyn with them in Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, reducing the Protestant Religion into corners, and giving it up as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to—we may know whom; censuring one another, and dividing on these mistakes, and fathering all this on God: I say, I durst not stand by in silence to see all this, no more than to see men drowning, or the City on fire, without endeavouring to save men. It is an exceeding great quiet to my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, under all the Confusions and Divisions that have befall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n us, that in <hi>1660,</hi> and <hi>1661.</hi> I plainly and earnestly foretold the King and Bishops of them, and did my best to have prevented them.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:59354:92"/>And the Author that I deal with, necessitateth me to recite the late fruits of Separation, in pulling down all Governments, casting out all the Ministers in <hi>Wales,</hi> and were near casting down those of <hi>England,</hi> with Tythes and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, persecuting and killing godly men, and fathering all on God, and now flying from the Bishops when they had opened them the door to return. He layeth his main Cause on the ill fruits of Liturgies (which indeed are rather the fruits of Pride and Malignity), and constraineth me to shew the fruits of Separation. I dare not bury that in silence which God so dreadfully disowned by their own diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lution, without any blood; and that when multitudes are running into the old error, by mistaking the Iudgment of the Nonconforming Ministers, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they took that for unlawful which they did not, and condemning all the excellent old Nonconformists and Conformists, and almost all the Churches on Earth.</p>
                  <p>Let wiser men deal wiselier: I use the best wisdom that I have.</p>
                  <p>It's true, that abundance of good people fear and distaste Communion in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy: What wonder, when such Reasonings as these Twelve Arguments (which how gross soever, poor people have not the skill to answer) perswade them it is false Worship, and heinous sin; and say others, Idolatry. They are conquered as the <hi>Mexicans</hi> were by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the frightful roaring of their Cannons; the Militia used, <hi>Acts 15.1, 2. [Ye cannot be saved];</hi> and as the Pope conquered Kings and Kingdoms, by threatning to keep them out of Heaven: Even as since men tell me, that they medicate their Wines with <hi>Arsenick</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> I am afraid to drink them, which before I feared not; so are honest souls affrightned from Liturgies and Communion. How much in them I dissent from my self, I have openly intimated to the World: But he that will joyn in no good that is mixt by men with faultiness and evil, must separate from all the World, and all from him: But how will he separate from himself? <hi>England</hi> in her Articles and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, professeth to cleave to Scripture-sufficiency, as being the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I go to joyn in this profest Religion: If the Speaker of any side add any unwarrantable passages by book, or without book, let him answer for them; I own them not: Did my presence own all that I hear, I would joyn with no man living. The Lord fit us for a wiser and more loving World.</p>

                  <p>The History of the Matter of Fact must be premised for the right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the Case; which is as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath commanded us to Preach, Pray, Praise him, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister his Sacraments and Discipline; and hath told us what Doctrine we must preach, what things we must pray and give thanks for, and what Sacraments and Discipline we must Administer: But he hath not told us, in what Words we must do these, nor in what Posture, nor in what particular Method, nor whether we must use oftest the same words, or various, nor whether they shall be before prepared, or spoken imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately without preparation of words, nor whether written or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; nor whether prepared and composed by our selves, or by others, with such like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God prescribed divers Forms of Prayer, Confession and Praise, to the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi> Law; and a Prophetical Song, which they were all to learn, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.</p>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59354:93"/>3. The Psalms were a chief part of the <hi>Iews</hi> Liturgie, in which there are many Forms of Prayer and Praise; some made by <hi>David,</hi> some by <hi>Asaph,</hi> some by others, and some in or after the Captivity, no one knoweth by whom. And those Psalms were not in Metre, and sung in Tunes like ours now, but lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his Disciples to pray, not only as to the Matter, but as to the Words; and so did Christ his Disciples at their Request, who had not then the after-pouring out of the Spirit (nay, knew not that Christ must die for Sin rise and reign in Heaven, &amp;c.) and he said, <hi>When ye pay, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> tho not tying them only to these words, yet giving them a Form of Words to be used as they had occasion, as well as a perfect Directory for Method.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ himself joyned with the <hi>Iews</hi> in Synagogues and Temple, when they used Forms, and so did the Apostles; and never blamed them for the use of such Forms.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Christ prescribed a Form of Words in Baptism, and in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Lords Supper, and used a Hymn in Form.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There are divers Forms of Prayer and Thanksgiving in the New Testament, in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. &amp; 2. and the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which its Lawful and Laudable to use.</p>

Christians in the primitive ages of the Church, were known to the Heathen by their constant use of such Hymns sung to Christ, and of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Churches from Christs time to this, had a Creed or Form of sound Words, or necessary Articles of Faith, which they used in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising and in Baptism, which were a great means to keep out Heresie; and Church-Tyranny and Heresie were the Introducers of all their Alterations.</p>

Yea, those few kept up no

usual Church Worship, except those of them that by connivence had small Chappels or peculiars. And of them most used much of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. All the Congregations of the Nonconformists in <hi>England,</hi> that I have heard (save one now broken) not counting such as Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have used, and do use, stinted, imposed forms of Worship to this day, and therefore judg it not unlawful, meerly as forms, or as imposed. 1. Parents teach their Children a form of words in Catechisms, in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in giving Thanks for their Meat; and impose these on them. 2 Ministers impose on the Assemblies, their own method and words in Prayer, which are a form to the people; yea, and a form which they know not, till they hear it, and have no time to examine it, while it floweth from the Speaker. And their Sermons are imposed forms of Doctrine; (sometimes written also, and read). 3. Few men that retain any Sobriety in Religion, are against the Creed, to be used as a form of Confession of Faith. 4. The Independents drew up at the <hi>Savor,</hi> about 1658 or 1659. a form of Confession of their Faith and Discipline. 5. They attempted (Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sid. Sampson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cheynell,</hi> and others), by appontment of a Committee of Parliament, to have drawn up a Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, to have been imposed for consent on all that should be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Land in Church-Worship: they are yet to be seen in Print. (But Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi> being chosen for one, and refusing, and I being by his consent substituted in his room, broke that attempt; finding that their Fundamentals were lamentably composed, and that Christianity was not an unknown thing, and that Baptism, the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue, were a far better Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals than theirs). 6. We all constantly use an English form of Translation of the Scripture, where all the <hi>English</hi> words, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Chapters and Verses, are mans invention, imposed on all. 7. We all use constantly forms of Confession, Prayer, Thanksgiving, and Praise in the singing of Psalms; where, when <hi>Davids</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> Psalms are used, the Translation, (or rather Paraphrase) the rhime or meters, and the tune, are humane and imposed: And the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists themselves make no question; but other Psalms, (such as that of <hi>Ambrose, &amp;c.</hi>) more suted to the State of the Gospel Church, may be fitly used, as <hi>Paul</hi> requireth, which must be composed by man, and imposed on the Churches, or never unanimously used. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of singing Psalms and Hymns, is the use of stinted imposed forms. 8. He that doth not celebrate Baptism, and the Lords Supper often in words of the same signification, shall corrupt those Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by his affectation of variety of words; the matter being the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59354:94"/>
same. 9. No man knoweth before-hand, whether a Minister hath studied and sore compsed his Prayer or Sermon, and yet all joyn with him. 10. Many affect to compose all their Prayer in Scrpture Sentences, which do but make up one form of many.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. When the King came in, the Ministers of <hi>London</hi> were invited to attempt a Concord with the Bishops, and they offered to joyn in the use of the Litugy, if it were corrected: And they offered Additional Forms, or a Reformed Liturgy, which they would have used.</p>
                  <p>I know it will be objected, That I plead in this but for my own works: But I answer, 1. The Exceptions and Emendations of the old Liturgy offered, was none of my work. 2. And the new one which I drew up by their appoinment, had their common review and consent.</p>
                  <p>It will be said, That these were not all the then Nonconformists: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, It was the main Body of the <hi>London</hi> Ministers; and it was as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as would meet about it, when they were desired to come to <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and after they Printed a Thanksgiving to the King for his Declaration; so that then they were not against all imposed Liturgies; so that the Imposition had no unmercifulness in it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The forreign Churches (in <hi>Holland, France, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.) are so much used to pray in the same form of words, that if they were put to do all <hi>ex tempore,</hi> it would be lamentably done by most, even far worse than it is.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. I have formerly told the world, That many of the most noted Nonconformists in <hi>London,</hi> met and concluded for communicating in the Parish-Churches, about 1664. And two things done by the Conformists stopt them: One was a storm then arising against those that could not do it, which they <hi>feared</hi> to seem to countenance by their compliance: And Plague and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="22">22.

And also as it is a Christian Kingdom under one King. 3. And as it is a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of many Churches to keep Concord in lawful Circumstantials as well as Integrals. In all these sences it is a lawful Association. 4. But if any Church go beyond these bounds, and on good pretences shall agree upon any error or evil, it is a mistake to hold, That all that incorporate with them in the Three foresaid lawful respects, do therefore confederate with them in their error.<note place="margin">IV. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> This is your Fourth Error.</p>
                  <p>I will give you a general Instance, and a particular one: 1. You cannot name me one combined company of Churches from the Apostles days till now, that had no error. You take Episcopacy to be an error in the very constitution: Name one Church from the 3<hi>d</hi> or 4<hi>th</hi> Century, for a thousand years, that was without it, either Catholicks or Hereticks, that were indeed a Church: And must Christians have forborn associating with any of them? Or might not own the good in their Associations, without owning the evil?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Independents</hi> gathered a Synod at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and there among their Doctrinals or Articles of Faith, laid down Two Points expresly contrary to Scripture: 1. That it is not Faith, but Christ's Righteousness that we are justified by, when as it is both; and the Scripture often saith the contrary. 2. That <hi>Christ's Righteousness imputed, is our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> Whereas the Scripture doth many hundred times name also our inherent and practical Righteousness. I asked some yet living, why they consented to these, and did not rather expound the Scripture than deny it? And they said, That it was Dr <hi>O</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doing. Now doth it follow, that every one that there con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ederated with you, owned these errors?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59354:96"/>The Churches of <hi>Helvetia</hi> are a very honourable part of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches: They are commonly such as we call <hi>Erastian,</hi> for no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline but the Magistrates: Are ail that confederate with them as Churches, guilty of this error?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I further distinguish between the many Parish-Churches, and the Diocesan, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as constituted of such Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Churches. The Old Nonconformists commonly owned the Parish-Churches (and the Church of <hi>England</hi> as made up of such), but not the Diocesan. This they openly professed. It is therefore another of your Mistakes, that owning the Parish-Churches and Worship, is an owning of the present Diocesan Constitution.</p>
                  <p>Also it is your Mistake to say, That Communion by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is the Symbol and Pledg of the foresaid Incorporation in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its present constitution:<note place="margin">V. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> It is only a part of the Communion commanded, but no such Symbol:<note place="margin">VI. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> For, 1. The Rulers openly declare, that they take multitudes to be none of their Church, who joyn in the Liturgy: And it is subscribing, declaring, and swearing Obedience, which is the Symbol: yea, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate many that come to the Liturgy-Service.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And many come to it who openly disown the Diocesan present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: So did, as I said, the Old Nonconformists, and many Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. that come over hither.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If one may joyn in Communion of Worship with a <hi>Presbyterian, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist</hi>-Church, without owning the Errors of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, then so one may with a Parish-Church: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You mistake when you say, It is so by the Law of the Land: You mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake again, when you say, it is so by the Canon: You mistake again, when you say, It is so in the common understanding of all. I formerly instanced in one of the sharpest Nonconformists, Old Mr. <hi>Humphrey Fen,</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> who would say aloud, <hi>Amen,</hi> to all the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> save that for the Bishops; by which all there knew his mind: Whether it were right or wrong,<note place="margin">VII, VIII, IX. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> I now determine not. So here are Three more of your Mistakes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You make all other reserves of our own, to be allowed neither by God or good men. Here are two more mistakes. 1. God maketh it our great duty to hold Communion with most,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>X.XI. Error.</hi>
                     </note> or almost all Churches on Earth with such reserves; that is, to own them in all that is good, and disown all their evil, tho their Laws command the owning of them; without this reserve I would not joyn with yours, or any Church on Earth, that is, If my Communion were an owning of all their faultiness.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59354:97"/>2. And it's an immodest Error to say, That none <hi>are good</hi> men, that in this are not of your mind. Is there any spotless Church on Earth? or must we renounce the Communion with them all, or reserve exception against their faults and misperformances?</p>

To do it with other reserves, is hypocrisie, and worse than the thing it self without them. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in the thing which he alloweth, <hi>Rom. 14 12.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p n="5">§ 5. THis is your twelfth mistake, and one that hath dreadful conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. 1. It contradicteth the express Profession of the Communicants, who openly tell the World, That they take not all in the Liturgy,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>XII. Error.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. It is most direful to your own separating followers, who by this are supposed to profess all your Worship to be [<hi>wholly agreeable to Gods Mind and Will</hi>]. And so the honest well-meaning people are made guilty of all the Errors which you put into your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is contrary to your own former Profession, That you could in charity communicate with Presbyterians, or Anabaptists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so you approved of all the Errors of their Worship.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It maketh it a down right Sin, to communicate with any Church on Earth: For all have their faults and errors, even in Worship; which you feign all that Communicate with them to justifie, as [<hi>wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Gods Will</hi>]. And to justifie Sin, and teach men so to do, and to father it on God, are sad Aggravations; such shall be called least in the Kingdom of God. By this rule you would have separated from every Church on Earth, that we have notice of for a thousand years, yea, and to this day; and is not that near separating from Christ? And when no man knoweth before you speak in prayer, what you will say, How shall any man that joyneth with you, koow but he may be guilty of your Sin at the next Sentence.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59354:97"/>5. It is a breach of the ninth Commandment, thus to charge all the Ancient Churches, and Reformers, and the Noncoformists, with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and worse than open sinning, who have all communicated on the contrary Supposition.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is no friendly act to the Church, to lay down such a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of perpetual Separation, and condemning each others Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and so to make the Communion and Concord of the Churches im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is Self-condemnation to judg the present Bishops Church-Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, for excommunicating good Christians according to the Canons, for profest dissent about their governing Offices, Liturgies, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and for imposing <hi>Assent and Consent to all things,</hi> &amp;c. and yet to go much further than they, by making it Sin against God, to Communicate where the Worship is not [<hi>wholly agreeable to Gods Will</hi>].

                  <p n="8">8. I only humbly ask, Whether this make not Christ, and all his Apostles Hypocrites, and worse than profest Sinners: Did Christ by his usual joyning in the Synagogue and Temple-Worship, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to go to the Priests, to hear the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that he took their Worship to be <hi>wholly agreeable to Gods Will?</hi> Or did the Apostles so, while they long joyned in the Synagogues with the <hi>Iews?</hi>

There is that, which is the corrupting of Gods own necessary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship-Ordinances, in so gross a manner, either outwardly in the <hi>Matter,</hi> or inwardly in the <hi>Mind</hi>; as that God will not own or accept the Worship and Worshippers. 2.

                        <hi>1. Argument,</hi> Religious Worship not divinely instituted and appointed, is false Worship, not accepted with God; but the Liturgical-worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is a Religious Worship, not divinely instituted and appointed, <hi>ergo,</hi> not accepted with God. The Proposition is confirmed by all the Divine Testimonies, wherein all such Worship is expresly condemned, see <hi>Deut. 4.2. Chap. 12.32. Prov. 30.6. Jer. 7.31. Isa. 29.13,</hi> &amp;c. That espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where the Lord Christ restrains all Worship to his own command, <hi>Matth. 28.20.</hi> It is answered to the minor Proposition, That the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgical-worship is of Christs appointment, as to the substantials of it, tho not as to its Accidentals; namely, Prayers and Praises; not unto its outward rites and form, which do not vitiate the whole.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p n="7">§ 7. TO your first Argument, I answer.</p>
                  <p>I have fully answered this to Mr. <hi>Ralphson,</hi> 1. As to the bare name, either you will call all acts done to signifie immediately the Souls honouring of God, by the name of Worship, or you will not; if not, then that which is no Worship, is no false Worship. If you will, then your Proposition is false; so that either your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor or Minor,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>XIII. Error.</hi>
                     </note> is another Error. For I take it for granted, that by Gods <hi>instituting,</hi> you mean not a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to man to institute it; such as, [<hi>let all be done to edification,</hi>] if you did, then your Minor is not true. <hi>Kneeling</hi> at Prayer rather than sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, putting off the Hat, using white Linnen and Silver plate at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, praising God by new Hymns, and in <hi>English</hi> Metre, and Tunes, and many such, are Worship in the secondary sence, and yet not imposed by any determining Divine Institution</p>
                  <p>Your wrong Exposition of all the Texts of Scripture, here cited by you, is more than one mistake. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. and 12.32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. forbid adding to Gods Worship,<note place="margin">XIV. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> which is broken by all that either say, that that is in Gods Word which is not there, (as you here do); or that devise any Woship-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances coordinate, or of the same sort with his own, as if they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59354:98"/>
But there is not a word forbidding subordinate secondary Acts of Worship, such as Kneeling, putting off the Hat, using written Notes in Preaching, or Forms of Singing, Praying, Catechising, laying the Hand on the Book, or putting it under the Thigh, or lifting it up in Swearing, the formal words of Vows, Oaths, Covenants, Confessions, Professions, and many such. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.31. condemneth them that offered their Children in Fire to Idols, because God never commanded such Cruelty and Idolatry. It is not true, that therefore we may not Kneel, or put off the Hat, or Preach, Pray, or Sing in an humane Form of words, till God determine it by Command. It was forbidden things which <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. are reproved, as being the Precepts of Men, or things feigned to be necessary Acts of Obedience to God, which were not so. But this you think your self doth not forbid your Form of Church-Covenant, nor your Books, Translation of Scripture, Hymns, written Sermons, because they are devised by Man; nor Childrens Forms of Prayer, for being commanded by Parents. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. It follows not, that because Christ bid the Apostles teach all, that he commanded therefore nothing else subordinate may be taught. He commanded not the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Form of the Creed, but only the Form of Baptism in three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; nor the Hymns and spiritual Songs in Form mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the Kiss of Peace, the Womens Vails, the Mens being uncovered, not wearing long Hair, the selling all and laying it down at the Apostles Feet, &amp;c.</p>

Then your Time, Place, Notes, Words, Tunes, Gestures, Covenant-Form, Catechism-Forms, &amp;c. are all parts of Gods Worship, for they belong to it: And then you must be separated from for adding them. But after this mistake, you say, [<hi>Outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> are <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>occasional,</hi> no <hi>accidental parts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi>]. Answ. Just now all <hi>Accidents</hi> were parts (or else <hi>Accidents belong not to it</hi>) And now [<hi>it hath no accidental parts</hi>] Certainly this is the truer; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that ever I heard of mere <hi>Accidents</hi> that were <hi>Parts.</hi> A mans Name, Relation, Trade, Cloathing, Age, House, &amp;c. belong to him, and are Accidents, but no <hi>parts</hi> of him: no nor his <hi>Hair,</hi> if it be a mere Accident. But do none of these <hi>duely belong</hi> to him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The word [<hi>Worship</hi>], as I said before, is Equivocal, as signifying only the <hi>Things made necessary to the honouring of God directly by Divine Command:</hi> or the <hi>subordinate Acts, Modes, Circumstances, left to Humane Choice.</hi> In the former sense, the Order, Words, and Forms in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and in all our usual Devotions, are Accidents, and not <hi>Parts.</hi> In the later sense, they are <hi>Parts</hi>: But whether this later sense of Worship be apt, is but a strife about a word.</p>
                  <p>But you say, they are <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>occasional. Ans.</hi> Dark words! 1. I think the Translations, Metre, Tunes, Notes, your Words and Method, Table, Cups, Cloth, Temples, &amp;c. are rather <hi>Artificial</hi> than <hi>Natural; Art</hi> and not <hi>Nature</hi> made them what they are. If you mean that <hi>Nature commandeth</hi> them, then God by the Law of Nature commandeth them: and what greater Authority can they have? But yet that is not so, <hi>Nature doth</hi> not determine us to this or that, but leave all to apt and prudent Choice. And so he doth as to the form or words of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>If by [<hi>Occasional</hi>] you mean such as must be mutably fitted to just Occasions; there is no doubt of it: And while the Occasion is constant, so may the Accidents.

But I suppose you mean [<hi>de specie</hi>], praying to the true God for good <hi>things needful.</hi> And so it is another Mistake, That this Prayer is not of Christ's <hi>Institution, because</hi> it is a part of <hi>Natural</hi> Worship. All is of Christ's institution which is part of his commanding Law: The Law of Nature is now Christ's <hi>Law,</hi> who by Redemption is become Lord of Nature, and of all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.2, 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22, &amp;c.

                  <p>And if you meant it but of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, you could never prove that our Martyrs and Confessors that made it, had so malignant an End.

They did it not to render useless the Spirits help, but 1. To be useful where such Abilities were wanting: It was the antecedent disability of Men that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned Liturgick Forms. 2. And it was to be a help subordinate to the Spirits help, to those that have it but in part; as Spectacles to dark Sights, and Sermon Notes to weak Memories. 3. They are really a great help to many, and therefore not made only to hinder them. When fitter and more sound and moving words are set before an unready Speaker, they help his affection more than his own shorter and unmeeter words would do; And his mind being not taken up with the study of words, is the freer to attend its affections. You must not measure all Mens Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Speech by your own. I can truly say, that Forms are oft a help to me: I find young and old Christians are more fit to use them than the middle-aged: For the young cannot at first pray well (at least before others) without them, till use hath taught them And the old have discretion to fit their Affections to sound words oft repeated. But the middle-aged, that have a greater Heat, and a lesser Light, are much more taken with their own sudden Effusions and Expressions.</p>

                  <p n="13">§. 13. 1. IT is a great Error to think, that the Gifts and Graces of the holy Spirit may not be exercised, if we use the same words, or if they be prescribed. The chief help of Gods Spirit, lieth in giving us a due esteem of the things prayed for, and a holy Desire after them, and a lively Faith and Hope that we shall obtain them, and a fixed Resolution to use all other means for them, and avoid all that would deprive us of them. And doubtless, he that hath these mental Dispositions, hath thereby a great help for his Expression of them; for out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh. But 1. It's well known, that Use and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, can enable an Hypocrite to pray as long, and in as good Words and earnest Tone, as a sincere Christian.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is easiest, needeth the least help: It is to me so much easier to speak my own thoughts in Prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a form of words; that never since I was twenty years old, did I ever learn and say without Book, the words of one Prayer, or one Sermon, since I Preacht; to have learnt a Prayer or Sermon without Book, would have cost me ten times and more, both time and labour, and fear of being out, than I ever used or could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>

If Parents teach Children necessarily to Pray in a prescribed form of words, without designing to defeat Christ or his Spirit, but to subserve them; how can you tell, but the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers of publick forms did mean as well, when they found few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons able to do so well without, and abundance of Hereticks ready to corrupt Gods Worship with their Errors? 4. Let it be soberly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, Whether mens long and hard Study for all the words which they write in Books, and for their Sermons, be done to defeat Christ and his Spirit, or to subserve them? And why the use of words studied by others, and weighed by us, before we utter them, should defeat the Spirit any more, than words premeditated by our selves? Or at least, is not the Spirit as much defeated in the People that joyn, who ever prepareth the words? For they do not themselves put them up by their gift of utterance. And its impossible when you speak, for the people to know whether those words were before studied, and whether by your self or by another, from whom you borrowed them. I have heard Mr. <hi>Ph.

                  <p>The Truth I have opened in my <hi>Christian Directory,</hi> that both ways are liable to great abuse, and all humane actions have their inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. The benefits of a sound Liturgy, are, 1. To keep out Heresie and ill words from publick worship. 2. To be a help to men of unready utterance. 3. That the people may know before-hand what they joyn in.</p>
                  <p>The inconveniences are, 1. The dulling of Affection in hearing still the same words. 2. The tempting of slothful worldly Candidates and Ministers to learn no other way of praying, when this will serve all their worldly turns. But I must add, That this followeth not the imposing of a Liturgy, but the exclusion of other Prayer, and taking up with this alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conveniences of praying from an habit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are, 1. A just variation, as Occasions vary. 2. Help to fresh Affection. 3. Forcing Ministers to get ability for utterance.</p>
                  <p>The inconveniences are, 1. That the people know not till the words are past, whether they may own them, and so hardly try all, and follow with just consent. 2. That abundance of young, raw, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59354:104"/>
men, do ordinarily disgrace Prayer by their unskilful methods and expressions. 3. That Hereticks and erroneous men have great opportunity to put their sins into their prayer, which yet the people should by joyning in, make their own, were they sound (which they are not bound to do by Sermons): And no man of understanding can chuse but suspect, that weak ignorant Ministers will be shewing their weakness in the highest Duties; and so must suspend their consent till late. 4. That less care will be taken in speaking to God, than in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Men, while most sober Ministers study their Sermons. 5. That when to avoid disgraceful words, and manner of praying, men must decree, that no such weak or unready men shall be Ministers, the number that can do it better, will be so small, as that most Churches on Earth must be so deprived of Ministers, and all publick Worship, if that take place. 6. That by this means young ignorant men, that by use can speak fluently and fervently in prayer, shall be followed by the people; when many great Divines, judicious and holy, that have not that readiness of utterance, shall be rejected, as having not the Spirit. 7. That as all mens bodies and minds be not in the like quickness and fitness at all times, but sometimes clouded by Fumes or Weakness; the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall be as mutable, uncertain and various as mens Tempers are.</p>
                  <p>All these on both sides are so great inconveniences, that tho both Formalists and Fanaticks have derided me for it, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said, and still say, That I believe that the best way to avoid both sorts of Evils is, To have meet set Forms, which shall be owned by the Church, as their professed desires, not being so long, as to take up too much time from freer Prayer, much less to forbid it; which <hi>Calvin</hi> wisely ordered for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>

                  <p>And now as you have Historically told us the ill Consequences of a Lturgy, I shall first tell you, It is a Mistake: None of these arise from a sound Liturgy, but from the using that alone, and not using also free Prayer with it: And next, I shall add some more of the History of Separation from Churches that have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, tho it be as displeasing to me, as it is necessary to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>I will pass by the Histories of <hi>Muncer</hi> and <hi>Munster,</hi> and of <hi>David George</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and of <hi>Henry Nicols,</hi> and the <hi>Familists,</hi> which were the Off-spring of Separation: And the sad Conflicts which they had against the sober Nonconformists; and their sad Divisions among themselves in <hi>Holland,</hi> and how many of them went further to <hi>Anabaptistry,</hi> and more; when <hi>Brown</hi> their Leader here, turned Conformist. It is only what I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59354:105"/>
have lived to see, that I briefly mention. When the Parliament began, 1640. there were few Separatists known comparatively in <hi>England:</hi> But when they were encouraged by hope of Success, they began to stir, and shew themselves, and two sorts fell in with them, and quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased them, that is, 1. The exasperated Sufferers. 2. Women, and weak young Men, who thought it a great honour in Religion, to go far enough from Persecutors, and formal or ungodly Ministers, not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Danger on the other Extream. Holy and Learned <hi>Iohn Ball</hi> foresaw the Danger, and wrote his Book, called, <hi>The Trial of Separation:</hi> and after, two more; one against <hi>Canne,</hi> and another against two <hi>New England</hi> Ministers. The Assembly being called, even sober and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Men that were for the old Conformity in case of Necessity, but not otherwise; Five of their number, differing from all the rest, save two more, wrote for <hi>Independency.</hi> This Controversie began the great Breach, while the Five Dissenters stood stifly for a <hi>Liberty, that Men might gather New Churches out of the Churches of the other Ministers, of as many as should come to them in all places, and should have all Church-Power in those separated Churches.</hi> The other did not what might have been done skilfully to heal the Breach, tho they did much. The two Parties drew others into the Division. Those called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were the more quiet, because they thought the Dissenters few. <hi>Independency</hi> might have been tolerated, but <hi>Separation</hi> was that which would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, when nothing was imposed in Doctrine or Worship, which the Dissenters excepted against. The Separaters finding themseves few, were the more industrious, especially to get Interest in Parliament and Army. In the Parliament, they could never get near the Major Vote; but they had some, whose Policy and Industry made up what was wanting in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: And by them, they got the Army new modell'd; all Parliament Men thence put out, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> put in Power, <hi>Second</hi> in Name, and <hi>First</hi> in Deed: He placed his Interest (as <hi>Constantine</hi> did, in owning the persecuted Christians, who had no other outward help but him) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himself to be for <hi>Liberty in Religion,</hi> and the Protector of all godly Men that suffered for Conscience-sake, or feared it, whereby the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that feared lest the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would Master them, came in to him, and he got enough to Head his Army (and great numbers also of Common Soldiers) who were for Separation; and being Men of other Parts and Interest, than those t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them told me, how they had discouraged all the Orthodox Ministers, save one or two, and were deserted by them, and turned Preachers themselves; they that had most Self Conceit, being the Speakers; and in a word, foretold me what Changes they would attempt, against King, Parliament, and Ministry, I went home, and told what I saw and heard, and being Invited by some of the soberest to the Army, I told an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Ministers my willingness to venture Life and Labour among them, to undeceive as many as I could. The Ministers consented to my going (Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simon King,</hi> yet living, were two of them); There <hi>Cromwell</hi> having notice of all before I came, gave me no opportunity to come near himself or the Chief in Power: But where I came, I did my best: For I found the Separatists half <hi>Arminians,</hi> and the other half contrary, <hi>Antinonians</hi>; agreeing to use their Power for the Changes that were after made. The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> they design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and bitterly reproached. The Book called, <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The godly able Ministers, were more scorned by them, than formerly I had heard among the Drunkards. What they did after this, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> felt. They cut off the King, they cast out Eleven Members from the Parliament: After that, they cast out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned the Major par, which was the House of Commons, and cast out all the House of Lords; then by these they made the People take an Engagement against the old Form of Government, To be true to the Commonwealth, as then Established, without a King and House of Lords: They ordered the Sequestring of all Ministers that would not Fast and Pray before, and give Thanks after, for their Victories in <hi>Scotland.</hi> They then pull'd down this Remnant of the Commons, and called themselves without the Peoples Choice, Two out of each County, and called them a Parliament. These put it to the Vote, Whether all the Parish-Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> should not be put down at once, and as credible Report went, it was carried against them but by three Voices. These gave up their Commissions to <hi>Cromwell.</hi> He now becomes the Defender of the Ministers: The Government is again Changed, and he made Protector, and Fundamental Laws made among themselves, by we know not whom; Parliament Lords made by him: Parliaments called, and broken at his pleasure. The Government of the Counties put into the Hands of Major Generals. After the Death of <hi>Oliver,</hi> his Son set up, and his Parliament first pull'd down (in which the Reverend Author, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It's true, that serious godliness all this while much increased in most parts of the Land: But how? It was mainly by the excellent preaching and living of that Ministry whom these Separatists vilified, such as the Assembly-men had been, and by a middle sort of Peace-makers, who engaged in no Sect, but would fain have healed all: For the effects of the separating party were these: 1. The Land was cast into division and confusion by them. 2. Ranters and Quakers sprung from them. 3. Their overthrow of Government brought a Reproach on Religion. 4. Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Churches of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> kept up a Religious War in many places. 5. All the Parish-Ministers in <hi>Wales</hi> were put down, and most of the Churches shut up, Itinerant Preachers being set up in their stead, lest the Parishes should be thought to be Churches. Perhaps you'l say, That these Itinerants were better than the old ignorant Ministers: But, 1. Their Number was so small, that there was commonly but one to Six or Eight Parishes: so that the People publickly worshipt God but once in Six or Eight weeks: And had not a Liturgy been better than nothing, or than to live like <hi>Atheists?</hi> 2. The most famous of the <hi>Itinerants</hi> were Mr. <hi>W. Cradocke</hi> and <hi>Vavasor Powel:</hi> I knew them both: The former was a most zealous man for practical godliness, with whom I conversed in my Youth, when in Mr. <hi>Rich. Simond</hi>'s School in <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> he was conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Bishops pursuit, by the Name of Mr. <hi>Williams:</hi> But how gross an <hi>Antinomian</hi> he turned after he had learned Separation, before he was Itenerant there, his Printed Sermons tell us, where he so earnestly perswadeth men not to question their Justification after Conversion, for any sin whatsoever they shall commit; and more such like: And his Printed Writings shew, that Mr. <hi>Erbury,</hi> of whom he learned Separation, fell so far, as that it's hard to discern that he was at all a Christian. And <hi>Vavasor Powel</hi> was an <hi>Antinomian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I crave a sober Answer to this, 1. Whether a Liturgy had not been better than no Worship for six days in seven? 2. Whether these Itinerants, that so dangerously erred in Doctrine, were not more sadly destitute of the help of the Spirit, than they that only wanted ability to utter sound words without a Form, or Books? And had not good forms been safer for that People, than the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Erbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, Vavasor Powel, Morgan Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Wrexham,</hi> (known also in Print). It grieved me to talk with one of these Itinerants in 1663, who came to me for Counsel: He had been an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> set up for an Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant over many Parishes; I examined him, and found that he had not any more learning than to read <hi>English,</hi> and was grosly Ignorant in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59354:106"/>
He was ordained for all that by a Bishop and conformed; I wondered how he past their Examination: He told me that they askt him no questions about his Learning or Knowledg, but only whether he would Conform, and so ordained him.</p>
                  <p>I have now opened some of the fruits of Separation in <hi>England,</hi> as you have done the supposed fruits of the Liturgies, but indeed of the exclusion of free Prayers. And judg now whether all the ill effects have come from one extream. The truth is, having impartially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the mischiefs of the Age in which I have lived, I have found that both the extreams have been the chief causes; and the Peacemakers both the most understanding, and the most innocent: And the nearer any of the several parties have come to them, the more innocent they have been. It is not meer Episcopacy or Liturgies, that have done the mischief; for such excellent men as <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar, Parker, Iewel, Grindal, Davenant, Usher,</hi> &amp;c. could use both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably: It's not meer Presbytery; for such as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Danaeus, Sadeel, Rivet, Chamier, Dallee, Blondel,</hi> have been excellent Lights in the Church: It is not meer <hi>Independency</hi>; for <hi>Ramus, Amesius, H. Iacob, Ier. Burroughs,</hi> and many others of that mind, have been excellent peaceable men. It is not mere <hi>Anabaptistry,</hi> for there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peaceable worthy men against Infant Baptism, (and some Bishops thought it not of Divine Institution); and when they were re-baptized, continued in Love and Communion with others. But it is <hi>Proud Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and want of Christian Love, causing <hi>Excommunicating, Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Separation</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> in some, and <hi>withdrawing censorious Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in others, who (neither <hi>party</hi>) understand the truth, nor ever loved their Neighbours as themselves, nor learnt to do as they would be done by. The worldly <hi>P R. IGs.</hi> and the unruly <hi>P R. IGs.</hi> by <hi>Persecution,</hi> and by <hi>causless Separation</hi> and <hi>Alienation,</hi> have done the hurt.</p>
                  <p>But I will tell the Bishops, that they should not be too angry with the Learned Author of these twelve Arguments: For I know not three men alive, whom they are more beholden to for their restitution, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the door, and sweeping the way, and melting down or pulveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing all that was like to have resisted them. I speak not of the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but of the <hi>Action</hi>; by which the Separatists cut down the banks, and when they had let in the Prelacy and Liturgy which they dislike, then write and talk against them.</p>
                  <p>I will add one Question to this unpleasant Section; If there be as few in all the Christian World; yea, among the reformed <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> out of our Kings Dominions, that can pray as well without a form, as with it, as we have great cause to believe; would he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59354:107"/>
have all these Nations dissolve all their Churches, and like Atheists cast off all publick Church-worship, till they have Ministers enough that have learnt to pray better without a Form or Liturgy than with it? If this be desired, I appeal to any that can difference Christianity from Heathenism, Whether Liturgies, or such a Separation from Liturgies, would do more hurt?</p>
                  <p>And I will add yet one question more, If there be not above two or three (or at last no) Church-assemblies in a County, which have Nonconforming Ministers, and opportunity to worship God as Churches; would you have all the rest of the Countries dissolve their Church-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, or forbear all, and live like Unbelievers? If so, I am a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist from such destructive Principles and Separations.</p>

I confute it, 1. You know not the hearts of all the World, and therefore cannot say, That this can arise from nothing else: Did you know <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that made the

                     <p>The end intended, is the Edification of the Church, in the Administration of all its holy Ordinances; this the Service-book is ordained and appointed by men for, or it hath no end or use at all; but the Lord Christ hath appointed other means for the attaining this end, as is expresly declared. He has given gifts unto men for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body, <hi>Ephes. 4.7, 8, 11, 12.</hi> that is, in all Gospel Administrations. But this means ordained by Christ, namely, the exercise of spiritual gifts in Gospel Administrations, unto the Edification of the Church, is excluded; yea, expresly prohibited in the Prescription of this Liturgical Worship.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p n="19">§. 19. TO the Major of your 5<hi>th.</hi> Argument, I answer, As to the former, No man is to comply by Approbation with any thing that excludeth any of Gods means; for <hi>instance,</hi> not with you that exclude the great duty of Catholick Communion. But we may so far comply with you and others, as to joyn with you in Gods Worship, tho you mix some evil. Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> at <hi>Barnet</hi> was fain many years to Preach to a people that excluded singing Psalms. He did what they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59354:109"/>
would bear, when he could not do what he would. He complied not by Approbation with exclusion, for he spake against it.</p>
                  <p>Are you sure that all your ways have tended to the Edification of the Church? Every weak Minister that preacheth or prayeth, when an abler might be had, hindereth the Edification of the Church. Is it a Sin therefore to hear any but the ablest?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which hindereth the Churches Edification by the Rulers fault, it may be the Peoples duty to obey for a greater good: For instance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t is less edifying to use our old singing Psalms, than a better Version: And yet for <hi>Concord,</hi> if the Ruler appoint them, the People must use them; because <hi>Concord</hi> with that imperfection, is better than to sing every one a several better Version, or divers at once: so a faulty Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of Scripture, a weak Sermon, an inconvenient hour and place, when Concord is necessary, and cannot be had in the more edifying circumstances, it must be had in the best way we can. If the <hi>Sheriff</hi> appoint an unfit time and place to meet to chuse Parliament-men; it's a duty to comply, rather than not to meet at all; every evil so far excludeth good: And yet we must not renounce Communion in all good, where men mix any evil, left we also give over all good our selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ giveth gifts to men now in the due use of means, and not by miracle: Therefore he giveth them in great diversity, and by hard Study, and long Time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>For the time they ought to have been teachers,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore a Novice must not be a Bishop; but an Elder, whence the Office had its name. All your pupils, people or Ministers, that had the Spirits gifts, had not your redundancy of Expression. And many can talk more fluently for falshood, than good men can for truth. I was never much troubled my self for want of words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press what I know; but I have ten thousand times more beg'd hard for more Knowledg, Faith, Love, and Hope, than ever I did for the gift of utterance; a full heart is earnest, fervent and ready.</p>

                     </note> unless you had meant that just at the use of the Litutgy, <hi>extemporate utterance is forbidden</hi>; but it is not so in the Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>And you should not confound things so different, as is the use of the Liturgy, and the forbidding of other prayers.</p>
                  <p>Nor yet the act of the <hi>Commander,</hi> and of the <hi>People.</hi> If Rulers should command Preaching, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to exclude the singing Psalms, that is their Sin, and not the Peoples, who must not (like pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Children at meat) refuse all, because they cannot have what they would.</p>

                     </note> It's not true, That the use of Gifts [<hi>is excludeded in all the solemn Worship of the Church</hi>]. As if Prayer, Praise, Thanksgiving, Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Explication of the Scripture, Reproof, Exhortation, Comfort, Direction, Benediction, were no part of the solemn Worship of the Church.

                  <p n="2">2. I said, It's of an ill aspect. For 1. If Preaching and Pulpit-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before and after, be none of the solemn Worship of the Churches, then all those Churches which seldom use any other, (saving a Psalm, which is a Liturgick form) have no solemn Worship at all. 2. But if it be otherwise, (as it is) then the Parish Churches so far excel most of you, that they have all that you have (Pulpit Prayer and Sermon, and sometimes a Chapter) and all the Common Prayer more. And is not that better than your nothing (except at Sacraments)? I know that the Nonconformists that I have converst with, are in judgment for more, (for reading the Psalms, Chapters, Creed, Lords Prayer, Decalogue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But I have come into so few of their Churches that do any more than the common Pulpit work, (sing a Psalm, Pray and Preach there) that I have in that respect preferred the Churches that do all that, and add all the Liturgy besides, more than you use.</p>

                  <p n="22">§ 22. TO your Reasons: 1. It's not the use of a Liturgy that hinders Reformation, but the abuse of it, and forbidding other ways of duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same I say of keeping men in ignorance: Use all other means, and the Liturgy with it, and it will keep none in ignorance. Some <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> Ministers who endeavoured to have practised my <hi>Reformed Pastor,</hi> in personal conference, told me, That there the common people go custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, almost every day in the week, to a Sermon, without Ceremonies or Liturgies (usually) with a <hi>Bible</hi> in their hands, and continue as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as those here that have no preaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I think it was not the esteem of a Liturgy that made Quakers and Separatists here, revile and scorn the best Ministry, I think, in all the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor was it the Liturgy that set up and warranted such ill-gifted Teachers as Mr. <hi>Erbury, Dell, Den, Paul Hobson, Chillington, Lilhurne, Prince, Wallwin, William Sedgwick,</hi> no, nor Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> who wrote for comfort, That <hi>Christ hath repented and believed for us; and we should no more question our Faith and Repentance, than we would question Christ.</hi> I pass by multitudes of Army-Preaching-Soldiers, such as those in Major <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Troop, in the same Regiment that I was with; against whom, one day in <hi>Amersham</hi>-Church, I was put to dispute from morning till near night, to save multitudes whom they drew every week to hear them, from their absurd Errors (and at last they turned Levellers, and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>

                  <p>It is not lawful to partake in persecution: but we must partake in much good, which bad men will abuse to persecution. An excellent forreign Church hath decreed to reject all Ministers that are not, 1.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Argument 7.</hi> That practice whereby we condemn the suffering Saints of the present Age, rendering them false Witnesses of God, and the only blamable cause of their own sufferings, is not to be approved: But such is this practice: And where this is done on a pretence of liberty, without any plea of necessary duty on our part, it is utterly unlawful.</q>
                  <p n="23">§ 23. TO your Seventh Argument: The <hi>Major</hi> meaneth, either Saints that suffer for <hi>well-doing,</hi> or for <hi>ill-doing.</hi> If the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> should be suffering-Saints, I would be none of those that they suffer by: But yet I would not be for <hi>Anabaptistry,</hi> for fear of condemning them as the cause of their own suffering: By that Rule I must own every error or sin that any Saint suffereth for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Truth bids me say more than I am willing, to confute this Error. I have heard Army-Officers say, That they believed abundance of the Ten Thousand <hi>Scots,</hi> killed at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> were godly men: And yet you were one that publickly, in Pulpit and Print, accused them, and did not justifie their cause for being Saints. Do you think none of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in <hi>England</hi> were Saints, that refused the Engagement, and were sequestred for that, and not keeping Fasts and Thanksgivings for Blood? Are you sure that <hi>Christopher Love</hi> (beheaded), was no Saint? Or did you therefore own their Causes?</p>
                  <p>To your <hi>Minor</hi>: It is a gross Mistake to say, That going to the Liturgy maketh the Refusers [<hi>the only blamable cause of their own sufferings</hi>]. What!<note place="margin">XXXVIII. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59354:111"/>
you one that acquit all their Prosecutors, if it be but proved, that the Refusers are mistaken? Who could have suspected this? What if <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Anabaptists,</hi> and such others err (as you believe they do)? If any would therefore silence, imprison, banish or hang them, dare you justifie it, and say, That the Dissenters are the only blamable cause of their own sufferings? Sure you consider not what you wrote: You thought not so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But are there no Saints that go to <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>? Why do not you distinguish Saints? I hope there are many times more Saints (and wiser), that separate not, than that do: And are not you as faulty for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They sin,</hi> as they for saying, <hi>You sin,</hi> if their cause be true? This soundeth as too much of a Sect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Truth is, Repentance is so hard a work, that I see both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams fly from it on a proud pretence of Constancy, and that they may not confess that they have erred. It was the grand Argument that bore down me and others, when we pleaded with some Bishops to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our Divisions by some alterations [<hi>Oh then it will be thought that we erred, and gave cause for old complaints</hi>]: And now we must none of us hold Communion with the Parish-Churches, lest some <hi>Saints</hi> that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, should be <hi>rendered False Witnesses of God,</hi> and <hi>blamable.</hi> But were not the old Nonconformists and Conformists, as <hi>real Saints</hi> as the old Separatists, and a Thousand for One? And do not you now make them all as False Witnesses? If really you have fathered any Love-killing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Error on God, repent of it, and do not justifie it, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought blamable. This is it that keepeth <hi>England</hi> in confusion, and threatneth worse: Neither of the Extreams that have caused our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are humbled, nor can endure a motion to repent; but Overturners justifie their former and their present love-destroying ways. The Lord give <hi>England</hi> Repentance unto Life: And the Lord help me to see all my Errors, and to repent the more, because I see that proud Nature is so much against it.</p>
                  <p>And you mistake, if you think that we plead only liberty for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. It is duty that we plead: but not duty to all persons, nor all times, as if <hi>the case of all were the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have not the happiness of Innocency: Repentance is next to it: When we confess our sins, we vindicate Christ and Religion, which are against them: When we justifie them, we falsly honour our selves, and lay all on Christ, as if he would justifie that which he abhorreth and died for. God will yet more shame us, if we will shame his Cause, instead of taking shame to our selves. Impenitence is more dangerous than any sin which we should repent of. Carnal Policy will be angry with me for mentioning the old faults which Adversaries sufficiently reproach us with.

(And I must say, that God in his time, will justifie the generality of the sober godly people of <hi>England,</hi> from the false Accusation of those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants and Papists, who charge them with all the Guilt of the Sins of a few Sectaries got into an Army, even the subversion of Church-Order, and Civil Power, when it could not be done, but by a Conquest and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of these Religious People first, both Parliaments, Ministers and their Flocks; in comparison of whom, the Army separatists were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable for number. They that would destroy thousands of faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as guilty of that which they opposed, till they were Conquered, and suffered for opposing, do but shew their own Iniquity) But yet God never taught men that way of Policy: Repentance, and not Impenitence, or Self-justification, is the way to take off mens reproach. God permits them to do it, because we do it not. To confess our own Sins, is no Extenuation of the wickedness of any Malignant Persecutors, or debaucht men. What they truly upbraid us with in malice, let us openly lament in serious penitence; and not stand to a sinful dividing Principle and Cause, lest the <hi>Saints be blamed,</hi> that have fathered it on God. This Learned Author hath done otherwise himself, and so hath the Party now opposed. He and I knew the Man who was Pastor to the Commanders of the Army, when they pull'd down and set up, and again pull'd down, till they had turned their Armed Bulwark into Atoms; and when he saw what they had done; said, [<hi>I wonder the people do not cast stones at us as we go along the streets</hi>]. Was not this a blaming of his Flock? He knew how oft the Addresses of the Separatists to the several suddenly erected Soveraignties, did change their minds, and cry <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus</hi> by their new Addresses for the old: And why may we not blame them that blamed themselves for Fathering their Mistakes on God?</p>

                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59354:112"/>§. 24. TO the Major of your Eighth Argument, I answer, 1. It is not true, when there is far greater Scandal by forbearing that Practice; but only when there is less on the other side.</p>
                  <p>To the Minor I answer, It is not true, That it is only Liberty that is pleaded for the Communion in question. It is great Duty that is pleaded:<note place="margin">XXXIX. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> 1. The Duty of Christian Union, and Concord, and Love, and Peace. 2. The Duty of obeying the Commands and Example of Christ and his Apostles. 3. The Duty of avoiding the Principles of Schism, and the condemning and false accusing the Church of Christ on earth. 4. The Duty of bearing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against the Principle (of the sinfulness of Communicating with a Church in Liturgies) which would make Christ in most Ages to be no King, as having no Kingdom or Church on earth. 5. The Duty of taking warning by the mischiefs of Causeless Separation, in Ages that hath so much smarted by it. 6. The Duty of seeking our own Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 7. The Duty of keeping thousands of Christians from ceasing all Publick Worship, where they can have no other, but in the Parish-Churches. 8 The Duty of keeping thousands of good people from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruined for mistakes and evil doing. 9. The Duty of obeying Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in Lawful things. 10. And the Duty of avoiding Scandal on the other side: Is all this nothing but pretence of Liberty?</p>
                  <p>As to the Scandal mentioned by you, No doubt, Adversaries will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you, whether you Communicate in the Parish Churches or not. But note, 1. That if any be guilty of such sin, as for outward Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to do any Evil, or any Good which they take to be Evil, these men deserve some Reproach. But, 1. If they before were in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which made it no Duty, and after by Gods providence are in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which make it a Duty, the Reproachers do but shew their ignorance or malice, whether they be Persecutors or Separatists, that so reproach them. 2. Or if men see the Error of their former Separation, they must not forbear Repentance and Amendment, for fear of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                  <p>There is so great a difference of Men and Cases, that it's gross sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to think that their Duties and Sins are the same in mutable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. It's a Sin to Preach or Pray, when we should be quenching a Fire, saving Mens Lives. Christians, as well as Pharisees, are yet to learn what that meaneth, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuse the guiltless. Some men have no possibility of any other Church-Worship, but in the Parish-Chuches. Some have no other, but what is worse. Some may have abler Teachers, but at the cost of Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ruine. It is not Lawful to lie in Prison merely for refusing to hear a weak Nonconformist, when you might hear an abler: And so it is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59354:112"/>
in the Case of Conformists; Else all were bound to a few men. Some have Liberry to hear fitter men, or at the least, more agreeable to them, without greater hurt than good (As the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> here have). Some are commanded by Husbands, Parents and Masters, to one Church, and some to another. Some have more able and godly Ministers in the Parish-Churches, and some have such as I would never own or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Ministry, by seeming to own them. Some can remove their Dwelling, and some cannot. Some had Liberty the last year, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have it this year, without more hurt than their benefit will compensate. In these Cases where God hath not at all tied us to a Book, or no Book, to this Church or to that; he that can truly tell which way he shall do, and get most good or hurt, may by that better know his Duty, than by these Arguments, or Mens Censures.</p>
                  <p>But, verily, my chief Reason for Communion in publick, is the very same which you bring against it: Even the avoiding of hainous Scandal. I have told the World, 1. That Scandal is not <hi>displeasing men, but laying before them a temptation to sin.</hi> 2. That if the <hi>Separatists</hi> be the best Christians, they are farthest out of the danger of Scandal: It is the worst that are easiliest tempted to Sin, and so whom we should be most fearful to scandalize. 3. And it's a greater Sin to scandalize many, than few. 4. And worse by scandal to tempt men to the mortal Sins of persecuting or scorning godly men, than merely to tempt them to some small mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, or to grieve them. 5. And to scandalize our Rulers, is worse than to scandalize Inferiors <hi>(Caeteris paribus).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I tell you, I the rather joyn in Publick, 1. Lest I should harden thousands in the Opinion, That we take that to be unlawful which is not, and that we are for sinful Separation, and that we separate from, and unchurch almost all Christs Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we are Enemies to Order, and Peace, and Concord, and that we are unruly enemies to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and giddy, ignorant, self-conceited people. 2. And so, lest we breed throughout the Land such a contempt of Conscience in Gods service, as they have of <hi>Quakers</hi>; and thousands by this should be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Reverence of serious Religion, and Youth should be educated to the like contempt, under these temptations. 3. And lest if any in Church-matters be guilty of sinful Extreams on the other side, (in Oaths, Professions, Ceremonies or Practices), we should harden them therein, by tempting them to think, that we have no worse against their way, than the Use of a Liturgy. 4. Lest the Conceit, that we are but a company of giddy Fanaticks, encourage any contentious Preachers to render us odious, and rail at us in the Pulpits, to their own shame, and the widening of our Breaches. 5. And lest the same Error should tempt any Bishops or Magistrates to think, they do God and their Church and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59354:113"/>
Countrey service, in silencing, imprisoning, reproaching and ruining Gods faithful Servants without cause, and bring the Land under Gods wrath by persecution. Are these no Scandals? or not greater than offending or displeasing the dissenting Separators? to say nothing of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning our Reproach in all the Foreign Churches which have a Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>If against all this, the displeasing your mistaken Flocks should prevail, then their weakness and error would constitute them our chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>

                  <p n="25">§ 25. TO your Ninth Argument, I answer, 1. O! confine not the <hi>New Creature</hi> to those of your Opinion. Do you think none of the Old Nonconformists or Conformists, none of the Reformed Churhes, and no Church on Earth for a Thousand years, had any of <hi>the New Creature?</hi> When you have affrighted People with telling them, it is heinous sin, and returning to <hi>Babylon</hi>; and also by long disuse, made a Liturgy uncouth to them, do not ascribe all their averseness to the <hi>New Creature,</hi> which is from prejudice and disuse. For my part, when God taught me first to pray, I had no averseness to a Form: When I heard it charg'd with sin, I began to be averse to it: When I had studied the case, I was cured of that aversness: but never reconciled to the forbidding of all other Prayer, nor to the faults of any Forms.</p>
                  <p>And who knoweth not, that Man's culpable Nature loveth Novelties, and are hardly kept in lively Affections under any thing that is very often said? A Book, or Sermon, tho never so good, affecteth us not so much after many times reading and hearing, as at the first: We must not lay this weakness on the <hi>New Creature,</hi> tho it should teach Imposers to suit the Remedy to the Disease, and give children such food as is not too displeasing to their Appetites.</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59354:113"/>And yet I find not the generality of Appetites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in your Flocks, is against the Forms of <hi>Psalms,</hi> being not prejudiced against them.</p>
                  <p>It is not true, that Liturgies are <hi>inconsistent with</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Spirit in Prayer: It is a Mistake also,<note place="margin">XL. <hi>Error.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>this Form of Worship rejecteth and excludeth the matter of Prayer,</hi> whenas the Visible Book tells all the contrary. Do all those words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press none of the <hi>Matter</hi> of Prayer? It is untrue, That it <hi>rejecteth and excludeth the Manner,</hi> as to the chief part: For the Lord's Prayer is a perfect Form for Matter, Order and Method: And the <hi>Psalms</hi> read and sung, are for Matter and Manner, neither evil nor excluded. And sure there is much of the rest laudable. If all Matter and Manner be rejected and excluded, then the Martyrs that used it, and all the Churches on Earth, almost, have no Church-Prayers.

                  <p n="4">4. Some Object, that the 5<hi>th,</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> and 8<hi>th,</hi> Canons, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated us already. Therefore we separate not, but they cast us out. <hi>Ans.</hi> Let them that are concerned in those Canons, defend them if they can, and justifie themselves, for it's past my skill. But we are not bound (tho excommunicate) to execute them on our selves: Let others do it, if it must be done.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>REader, Upon the review of what I have here written, I think meet to repeat the Occasion, and to say somewhat of the <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of this Writing: The last sheet of my <hi>Reasons for Communion</hi> being Printed, and the opposite <hi>Twelve Arguments</hi> suddenly sent me, as being in many hands, and such as would frustrate all that I had written, if they were not answered: For the sake of such as have not skill to see Truth from Error, and are led by Prejudice and Names, <hi>I</hi> durst not in Conscience let them pass unanswered, they being of such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tendency, and so exceeding erroneous and fallacious. But being put, by the stay of the Press, to do it suddenly, I see Reason to say more, lest I be misunderstood.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> which I write of, in its self and its consequents: 2. The <hi>Season</hi> of it: 3. The <hi>Manner,</hi> as to the <hi>Authors</hi> whom I gainsay and confute and the manner of confuting them: 4. My Reasons for the writing of this Confutation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am not writing against <hi>Episcopacy, Presbytery, Independency</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing:</hi> I am so far from judging any part of them to be men rejected by Christ, or to be cast out of the Church, or denied leave to worship God in their own Way, or persecuted for it, that I would do any lawful thing for their just Liberty: Yea, so far, that it is only the contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and endeavours by which they strive against, and condemn one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and call aloud to their followers (such I mean that are for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Separation) to avoid one another, as ever they would scape the guilt of Idolatry or wilful sin. And if I see one man in the streets beating all about him, I cannot keep peace without resisting his unpeaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I am not justifying all that is required to Conformity, nor all in the Liturgy: Let them do it, that can. Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> speaketh untruly when he talks of my change herein, and as if I went to the Parish-Churches for some worldly end. I have been at no Church since <hi>August</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:59354:116"/>
Twelvemonth, nor am ever more like to be, unless the Church come to my bed-side or my door. Is Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> so lately born, that he never saw nor heard of our joynt endeavour when the King came in, 1660. to have prevented these Confusions, by getting a Reformation of the Liturgy? at least, before he said he knew not what, of one whom he knoweth not, he should have enquired, whether I have not, to this day, since then, 1660. held constant Communion with good Ministers in the Parish-Churches.</p>
            <p>But with bad men, and well-meaning honest men, <hi>Satan</hi> doth most of his Work in the World by untruths and fallacies. Most that think they do God Service by speaking evil of me, falsly, believe and perswade one another, That I do write against them for not coming to the publick Churches; and that I am an Accuser and Plaintiff against them for this; and that hereby I animate men to afflict them, with many other such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</p>
            <p>Whereas I have written over, and over, and over, That I perswade no man either to or from a publick Church, till I know his Circumstances: And that I doubt not but it's one man's duty, and anothers sin. Were I under one intollerable for Ignorance, Heresie, or malignant Wickedness, who did more hurt than good, I would not seem to own him as a Minister, any more than <hi>Cyprian</hi> did <hi>Martiall</hi> and <hi>Basilides,</hi> or <hi>Martin Ithacius, Ida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and the like; or <hi>Gildas</hi> the Priests whom he describes, or the ancient Churches Heretical Bishops: Abundance of Circumstances make various the Cases of particular men.</p>
            <p>Yea, tho those Dividers renounce Communion with one another (while I blame them, and lament it), I renounce Communion with none of the Parties, no, tho they revile and hate me: Only, 1. I will not commit any known sin with them while I communicate with them in all things else, and own them as true Christians, tho faulty. 2. And I will not prefer <hi>worse</hi> before <hi>better,</hi> if I know it, tho I renounce nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It's ordinary for Two Women fighting and scolding in the streets, to turn both their railing against him that would quiet them. And I expect the like.</p>
            <p>The Cause that I write against, is this (Reader, understand it, or meddle not with what you understand not, 1. That <hi>God's Worship</hi> (saith D. <hi>O.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:116"/>2. That this Worship is Idolatry (say some), or so false and unlawful, say the rest, That it is a denying of Christ's Fidelity, and it is a going to Idols Temples; or at least, unlawful to joyn in Communion with such as use it. And therefore they perswade all, as they will avoid Idolatry, or false Worship and sin, to avoid Communion with such Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And suppose that they truly instance in many things amiss, in Order, Ceremony, Forms, Impositions, Defects; because these are sinful, he sinneth who communicateth with the Church which useth them, his presence signifying his approbation, specially if commanded to that end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And so <hi>Renunciation of Communion being the Excommunication</hi> which one Church hath power to inflict on another, the sum is, I write against the unjust Excommunicators of one another. Their Executions are divers, but their Principles and Spirits too like, tho few of them know, or will know what manner of Spirit they are of. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Schismaticks, like the uppermost Millstone, are the <hi>Active,</hi> and the nethermost the <hi>Passive</hi> part, between both which Truth and Peace is broken, and the Church pulverized. Both Parties have not power to burn the Excommunicate, or lay them in Goals, or defame them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out open controul: But the nethermost Party in this agrees, if not exceeds the other; That they renounce Communion with the whole Church on Earth for 1200, or 1300 years, and with almost all (Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants as well as others) now: Whereas the Pope was taken to be intollerably arrogant when he excommunicated and interdicted, but rarely a whole Kingdom, or one King; but not all the Church on Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the Pope and his Prelates excommunicate the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and such as they call but Schismaticks, and not Hereticks, with Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That they may yet possibly be saved Christians: But those that I confute, charging the whole Church on Earth, for 1200. years, with Idolatry, or false Worship, which God accepteth not, and none may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate therein, do thereby call all men to come out from among them, and be separate, and to hate them with that hatred which is due to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to afford them no other love than is due to Idolaters, or men that we must renounce Communion with.</p>
            <p>I write therefore but as a Defendant of Love, and Unity, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and the Communion of Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the Souls of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands young ignorant persons, that being justly afraid of sin, and Idolatry and Damnation, are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>frightned from Christian Love, and Unity, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, into the Wilderness of sinful Divisions and Confusions, by these false frightful Names.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:117"/>As I renounce all Canons that, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> exccommunicate men for being against humane unnecessary Formalities, Offices, yea, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: So do I for the same Reasons, renounce them that at one blow wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld cut off all Christ's Churches on Earth, or renounce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, if they have (but really or conceitedly) such Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Defects. Yea, I maintain (in the First Part), That such faulty se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arating from one another, is not a separation of them all from Christ, when they see not the Consequences of their own Errors; and man on Earth is in so great darkness, that we all swarm with multitudes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, if opposing all this, be not Peace-making, I know not what is: And if the Peace-makers be the Incendiaries for confuting the Excommunicators, and to be taken for the Enemies of Peace, for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satan's factious Peace breaking Peace, Christ was mistaken that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them blessed: And if the Zeal of the Sects which inclineth men to speak evil of such Peace makers, as Troublers of the Church, be the Wisdom from above, why did Christ call such the Children of God? O that men would often read over <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, and 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and <hi>Iames</hi> 3. with <hi>

            <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lain Consequents of the Cause which I confute, are these (which I charge on the ill Cause, and not on the honest ignorant men that see them not).</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is is unlawful to communicate with almost any Church on Earth. 2. That Christ having no Church for 1200. years, was no Head of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so no Christ. 3 That men must covenant to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey Rulers or Pastors, if they bid them kneel, be uncovered, or any of the oft named Accidents and manner of Worship: And Children must d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Extream is encourag'd, To charge all this falsly on the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, if we confute it not. 6. The Nonconformists, that 1660, 1661. attempted Concord by reforming the Liturgy, are made Idolaters, or their Communion unlawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. And whereas my Writing is judged unseasonable by some that own the Cause <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t never will be so seasonable as to be liable to no inconveniencies or great abuse, nor hath been this Three and Twenty years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is when the Universa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Non-Communion is maintained in Print by many, and more dangerously by an excellent man in Writing, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes by these drawn into the sin.</p>

            <p n="5">5. It is when the Papists assaults of us, and of honest Conformists, as Trimmers, maketh it necessary to unite and encourage all honest men, That we fall not all into Roman snares, and not to bid all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians forsake all such honest Parish-Ministers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is at a time, when thousands are in danger of being ruined for mistake, and thousands to be drawn from all Church-Worship, when they can have no other than in Parish Churches.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is, when we are in danger of transmitting this dividing Error to posterity, by suffering for it, as for the cause of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is when other Ministers do it not, and therefore some one must: And I that have no great impediment from friends, or outward temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but wait for my change, am fitter to bear the noise of Censures, than they that I hope may labour longer.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And if I do it, it must be now or never: For there is no work in the Grave and Darkness. But of all this, my <hi>Reasons</hi> say more</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of my writings, I doubt not but all that ever I wrote, are faulty: I am imperfect, and can do nothing perfectly: I herein suspect this (and all) my self: and which is worst, I have not skill enough on the longest consideration to avoid the faultiness: For I have a strong love to <hi>Truth,</hi> and hatred of <hi>Lying,</hi> and specially a love to <hi>historical Truth,</hi> and hatred to the <hi>deceiving of the World</hi> and Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And I have a <hi>diseased Impatience,</hi> (above any ordinary Tryal) to hear men rage and be confident in Error, and pour out words for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, with unconvincible Fallacy, and speak evil most zealously of that Truth, which they least understand.</p>
            <p>And in this Impatience, I am apt to fit my Confutations to the Cause, taking words to be false, that are not to be adapted to the Matter: But when I have done, the guilty, (yea and their favourers) cannot bear them, and the words fit not the hearer which fit the Matter, but the Disease is exasperated by the Medicine. But then I think what's needful to save those that are not yet infected, and to silence reproaching Enemies, tho the guilt be not cured.</p>
            <p>As to this writing, it grieved me to write a Defence against Mr. <hi>Ralph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in Prison, and more when I heard that he was dead: But I knew no
<pb facs="tcp:59354:118"/>
other means suitable against a printed Temptation, and Accusation, but a printed Antidote and Defence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> hath since printed a further Accusation, with the same charge of Idolatry and false Worship, against all the <hi>Manner</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not instituted, and gives no Answer to my Confutation of it in Mr. <hi>Ralphs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi>; and said so little, that I will not write for him, that cannot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confute him.</p>
            <p>The Twelve Arguments I understand, are likest to prevail most by the honour of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> name, more than by any strength that is in them: I was willing, as long as I could, to believe that they were not his; they being as fallacious and frivolous as any of the rest, and one Error managed with above forty Mistakes. But when his own Friends that have more of his on the same Subject, (chiding me for Answering them) professed that they are his, I thought on <hi>Pauls</hi> case, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed <hi>Peter,</hi> because he was to be blamed, lest his great Name should make the Separation the most prevalent, when <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>abas</hi> and others were carried away to Dissimulation, and seeming to approve it.</p>
            <p>It grieved me, I think, as much as any that blame me for it, to seem to confute so worthy a man, when he is dead, and cannot answer for himself: But I durst not let the writing of a dead man be so dangerous a trap for Souls, and silently see the mischief prosper, for fear of displeasing the mistakers.</p>
            <p>But let the Reader know, That it is so far from my design to wrong the Name of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> by this Defence; that I do openly declare, That except in this point of his Mistake, (and who mistaketh not in more than one? I doubt not but he was a Man of rare Parts and Worth: And tho in the Tryals of the late Distractions of this Land, I mention some of his Confessions; it is to tell you that I had reason to hope that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented for doing no more in his publick opportunities against the Spirit of Division, which dissolved us. And which of us need not repentance for our faults in those days of Tryal?</p>
            <p>Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in his Doctrinal writings in his later Years, he is much clearer than heretofore: And even, that Book of Communion with the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which he writeth against whom I here deal with in the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) is an excellent Treatise: And his great Volumes on the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>brews,</hi> do all shew his great and eminent Parts: it was his strange Error, if he thought that freedom from a Liturgy, would have made most or many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, like himself, as free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fluent, and copious of Expression. In the late time he had never been so long Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> so oft Vice chancellor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; so highly esteemed in the Army, and with the Persons then in Power, if his extraordinary Parts had not been known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:118"/>But, Reader, if this excellent man had one mistake (against all Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and for Separation from them) when yet he was of late years of more complying mildness, and sweetness, and peaceableness, than ever before, or than many others; and if you will use his Name and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for this one Error, Let me tell you, I am confident you will wrong Dr. <hi>O.</hi> by ignorant defending him: I doubt not but his Soul is now with Christ; and that tho Heaven have no Sorrow, it hath great Repentance: and that Dr. <hi>O.</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow more against the receiving of this his mistake, than I am: and by de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ending it, you far more displease him than me: There is there no Darkness, no Mistakes, no Separation of Christs Members from one another; no excommunicating or renouncing of Communion: They all repent that ever they did any thing against Christian Love and Unity, and received not one another as Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth us, and did not own Communion in all that was good, while they avoided the wilful consent to evil.</p>
            <p>Were D. <hi>O.</hi> now to speak to you, I am fully confident, it would be to this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho all believers must be holy, and avoid all known wilful Sin, they must not avoid one another, or their Communion in good, because of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent faults or imperfections; for Christ, who is most holy, receiveth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Worship that is faulty, (and false, if all faultiness be falsness) else none of us should be received. There is greatest goodness where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is greatest Love and Unity of Spirit maintained in the bond of Peace. O call not to God to deny you Mercy, by being unmerciful, nor to cast you all out, by casting off one another.</hi> O <hi>Separate not from all Christs Church on Earth, lest you separate from him, or displease him?

            <p n="2">2.

The Ministerial calling layeth strong Obligations on us to fidelity, <hi>sowing Pillows, and saying peace to sin, and daubing with untempered morter,</hi> are oft concluded with that Thunder-clap, <hi>Their blood will I require at thy hands:</hi> And I have been loath to desert the <hi>worst Malignants</hi> by despair, as <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine</hi>: And shall I forsake the <hi>Children</hi> as such, because they cry, and are angry with the Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she hinders them from calling one another Bastards, or beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, or forsaking the house, because of one anothers Presence? or is She the make-bate, because they cry for being parted in their frays?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thousands that hear the great Precepts of Love, and Pray to be forgiven as they forgive; are by such mistakes engaged in sinful despising, censuring, backbiting; yea, and rendering odious one another, and so live in ordinary sin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Charity to such Souls is more necessary than to the Body; and how dwelleth the Love of God in him that neglecteth it?</p>
            <p n="6">6. He that doth not what he can to save others yea, multitudes from sin, becometh a partaker in the guilt and danger.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He that openeth a Pit, must fill it; and he that seeth it covered with Leaves, and telleth not men of the danger, is guilty of the hurt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I must not cease Preaching, because men will misconstrue it: Therefore not Preaching by the Press, when I have a call.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I have long found, that multitudes of our conscionable hearers, are setled in belief, that their Teachers take Parish-Communion for Sin, because they practice it not, even when they are commanded, and threatned, and punished: By which they are silently misled, till necessity force us to tell them otherwise. And then they Censure them as unconscinable Temporizers, and so they do all godly men that communicate in publick.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I see how hard it is after, to undeceive all these.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Most of the Epistles of <hi>Paul, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iude, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> speak much and sharply against Church-dividers, and separaters.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant swore all that took it, against Schism, and prophaness, and all that's against sound Doctrine and Godliness.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Christ told us, A Kingdom divided against it self cannot stand.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I saw that it is a dreadful dishonouring God and Religion, to father on him our love-killing mistakes and sins: And that he will vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his honour on us, if we do it not our selves, by open and penitent confession of such faults.</p>
            <p n="15">15. We have long smarted under his Judgments already, and shew no publick Repentance, and are threatned with much more; which if God may judge, it's repentance that must prevent.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:59354:120"/>16. The common Convulsions, Silencing, and Calamities, which we have long felt, are notoriously the fruits of this same Spirit and Error, and both the parties which I here gainsay. And shall we lie four and twenty years in the Flames, and be afraid to cry [<hi>Fire</hi>] or call for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lest the Incendiaries on both sides be displeased?</p>
            <p n="17">17. God's dissolving their Power, and conquering Armies, without a drop of Blood, by their own Divisions, did so notoriously shew the Sin by the punishment, and shew Gods hand against it, as was a kind of Miracle of Providence, and maketh their Sin, that be not moved by it, too like to <hi>Pharoah's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. The main thing that moveth me, is, That thousands being too young to know those days and deeds, blind and malicious Enemies, without any shame, charge all the Crimes and Confusions of a party of men in Arms, upon all the Religious People of the Land, that be not in all other things of the Slanderers opinions; and have made mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes believe that it was all such that did the very thing which they opposed, and suffered for opposing: Yea, they would interpret some late Laws, as if they had such an accusing Sence. And shall we by silence, leave so many thousands under the guilt of such false Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to their own sin, and to others wrong, lest we blame the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p n="19">19. I find that this Error possesseth the minds of so many young Scholars, and some Ministers, as that they think of all Dissenters with so much scorn, as that it is the very thing which hath tempted them into the contrary extream.</p>
            <p n="20">20. I read and hear so many on this very Supposition, calling out <hi>for our destruction,</hi> and <hi>not to bear with us,</hi> or <hi>spare us</hi>; that our Rulers have great need of Gods Mercy to save them from the damning guilt of Persecution, to which such temptations would induce them, lest they take the Innocent for Guilty, and think that it's Service to God to ruin them.</p>
            <p n="21">21. I see that it is a most dangerous Scandal not to remove such a stumbling-block, which tempteth thousands to hate their Brethren, if not Piety it self; as if all the stir that we have made, were but against such things as <hi>Communion in the Liturgy</hi> with <hi>Parish Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. I see multitudes like, by mistakes, to <hi>suffer as evil doers,</hi> and be ruined for their Error; and by glorying in it, to disgrace the suffering of those that suffer for Truth and Duty.</p>
            <p n="23">23. I see many Servants and Children, tempted to disobey their Parents and Masters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that call them to publick Worship; and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to be divided by this mistake.</p>
            <p n="24">
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:120"/>24. I see how Atheism is at the door, if when all private Church-meetings are forcibly hindred, men be taught that all Church Worship must be forsaken. And in how great a part of the Land already must they have such, or none?</p>
            <p n="25">25. I know that to drive all godly people from the Parish-Churches, and to cast out sound Religion thence, is the way to let in— you know whom: And that it greatly serveth the interest of the Papists, to have the Parish Churches vilified, and us divided; besides the discouraging many godly Conforming Ministers.</p>
            <p n="26">26. I have said after and oft, That to separate from a Liturgy, as such, is virtually to separate from all Christs Church on Earth (that's known by History) for a thousand years and more. And at this day to separate from almost all, even the reform'd Churches: And to make Christ no King, if he had all that while no Kingdom: And to censure himself and his own practice.</p>
            <p n="27">27. I have shewed the wrong that was done the old Nonconformists by this party, and their full Testimony against it. Yea, and that the old Separatists were for much that these now do condemn.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I have observed, That the deepest Sufferers have been readiest to run into this exream, and therefore Passion to be suspected.</p>
            <p n="29">29. I see that the foreign Protestants are scandalized by a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the Dissenters here are against Communion in the Liturgy.</p>
            <p n="30">30. It greatly moveth me to see, That as Church-dividers by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, do tear <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> by making false terms of Communion by their Canons; so the Passive-dividers take a like way; that is, make false impossible Terms of Union and Communion; censuring all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with other Churches on such Terms, as they mistakingly think sinful; making men guilty of the faults of Worship, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. What is their Censure of us, and Anger, that we write our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but as much as to say, we must all Unite on their Terms, or be judged Dividers, and Corrupters? So that they are at the old game, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, 2. one part despising, and the other judging.</p>
            <p n="31">31. By the reason, That we may not write our reasons against them; it follows, That Magisterially they must not be gainsaid, tho they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake and mislead others (remedilesly).</p>
            <p n="32">32. The History of the Church sheweth, that the Separation opposed, is a cause that God never blest, but ended still in worse.</p>
            <p n="33">33. If the Principles that caused it, be not cured, a continual War against Love and Communion will be kept up from Age to Age.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Historical Truth is of great use to Posterity. And as God needeth not our Lie, his Cause feareth not Truth.</p>
            <p n="35">
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:121"/>35. God himself recordeth the faults of his Servants; and hath made Repentance necessary to Pardon: It's Impenitence that is impatient of Evidences and Conviction.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The History of our Faults and Confusions is published over and over by Adversaries; and it's impossible to conceal it. The <hi>Booksellers</hi> Shops, and their Talk and Sermons, abound with it. If a deaf man hear not this, must it not therefore be spoken? And when the generality of the innocent are falsly accused, it is the fittest season to confute the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</p>
            <p n="37">37. It cost me dear to attempt the preventing of such Confusions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Almost Two years Travel in that Army, in heat and cold, whither I went for no other end: It cost me the ruin of my Health, and after the wilful dissolution of all Power and Order, cast me into those Groans and Tears which I can never on Earth forget. And must I not after all that, disown the things which I opposed at so dear a rate?</p>
            <p n="38">38. If men of Name and Piety write that which tendeth to cast honest Souls not only into scruples, but into a way of opposition to Unity, Love and Order, to their own and the Churches detriment and danger, it is Cruelty not to try to help them: And what way is there, if we must not not give our Reasons against the snare and error?</p>
            <p n="39">39. To say, That it will but enrage them, and make them worse, is to be uncharitably censorious, as if they were so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, passionate and proud, as not to endure to be contradicted, nor to hear us give a Reason of our Judgment and Practice, and defend it against Error. I can bear it without alienation from them, in Respect and Love, if they say, That I am erroneous, or bad, or whatever they will censure me. If <hi>they</hi> cannot bear my true Confutation of Church-dissolving, and Love-destroying Principles and Errors, that proveth them not better than I in Judgment and Charity. If I yet please men, I am no longer the Servant of Christ. Carnal Policy in complying with sin, never was blest of God, tho for some Job it seemed to be needful. If a man going out of the World, may by silence betray the Truth, on pretence of despairing of success, even with godly men, and let <hi>Peter</hi> lead <hi>Barnabas</hi> into dissembling Separation, in reverence of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Name, then <hi>Paul</hi> was too blame; and who then shall ever own Truth or Duty, or try to save the Church from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if he must not do it till the mistaken do consent?

            <p n="2">2. And who shall do it? I confess I am liable to do this, and all amiss in <hi>Manner:</hi> But if others would do it, that wish it done, I would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. The Truth is, Again I say, I am willing to save many the cost of it, who are not so fit as I to bear it. I have cast my Reputation over-board long ago, with both Extreams: I am not like ever again to be considerably serviceable to the Church: I am Independent, and neither have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to get or lose, nor any Church these Three and Twenty years, with whom I should be solicitous to keep any Reputation for their good. The Dust, or the Souls in Heaven, feel not the Reproaches of men on Earth. How could I lay down my Life for <hi>TRUTH, LOVE</hi> and <hi>UNITY,</hi> if at so cheap a rate I would sell it, or desert it, and go away sorrowful? But many others of my mind, I hope, may live to serve God longer; and their peace with mistaken froward persons, may be needful to their desirable success. I do therefore voluntarily take the Thorn into my Foot, and let God do with my Reputation what he please.</p>

               </gap>eclaration, may be seen in the Printed Thansgiving: Of all that met, only Two refused to subscribe (Mr. <hi>Iackson</hi> and Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:59354:122"/>
               <hi>Crofton</hi>), lest the Subscription should seem an Approbation of so much of Prelacy as the Declaration stablished; and so be a breach of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: But they professed their gratitude without subscribing. Divers of them are yet living but most by far are dead.</p>
            <p>Were it not lest the Papists take advantage by it, to undermine and ruin Peace-makers, under the Name of <hi>Trimmers,</hi> I would name you many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces up and down in <hi>England,</hi> where all the people live in love and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as if there were no Convulsive Cruelty or Schisms in the Land; and this through the wise and conscionable behaviour of the Ministers; the publick Ministers, with the ejected Nonconformists, living in so great and open amity, as uniteth all the people: Those that desire Reformation, won by the good preaching and living of the publick Minister, and by his kindness, go all to hear him; and when at other hours they meet to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one another by praying, singing Psalms, repeating a Sermon, or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Book, he is far from hindring them.</p>
            <p>Let any man that hath the Spirit of Christ judg, whether this be not a better state of the Church, than for some to be railing men from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, with the charge of Idolatry, and making the rest odious; and for others to prophane the Pulpits, by preaching up slanders, and scorns, and serving Satan in Christ's Name, by making Religion seem Hypocrisie, and conscionable men pass for odious Rebels for fearing lest some points of Conformity be sin; and stirring up Rulers to use them accordingly, if they were so bad and miserable as to be perswaded by such to persecution: Which of these, think you, is the better and more desirable case?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But what would you do your self, if you were in</hi> Spain, <hi>or any other Land where there is no Church-worship but the Mass? Would you not forbear all? And will not the Papists use against you the same Arguments which you use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and say, That you separate from all the Church on Earth for</hi> 1000. <hi>years, and so from Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What the Papists <hi>will say,</hi> maketh not all <hi>true</hi> which they say: The Question is, Whether they say it truly?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's the trick of deceivers in dispute, to prove <hi>ab obscuriore,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Controversie into a darker Room, and to fish in troubled Waters. What if it were an hard Controversie, whether I must separate from Papists, from <hi>Bonner, Gardiner,</hi> &amp;c. doth it follow, that it is as hard, whether I must separate from <hi>Bradford, Ridley, Hooper,</hi> and all those Martyrs, and all the Protestant Churches? With whom then shall I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate?</p>
            <p n="3">3. I'le tell you what I would say, and do to such Papists: 1. I will prove their Objection false. And 1. that at this day all Papists in the World are but (as Bishop <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mhall</hi> estimates) about a fourth part of the Christian World. 2. And that it was not till the
<pb facs="tcp:59354:122"/>
days of our King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and their <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> that a General Council decreed the Idolatry of Transubstantiation. 3. That a great part of their own never consented to this, and that few of the people understood or believed it. 4. That even this Canon was made against great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Godly men, called <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who opposed them in this Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore I would resolve, I will have no Local Communion with any Church in the use of this, or any Idolatry, but will Worship God in private, if I can have no better; but if I can, I will. And I separate not by this, from the most of the Church, but from a Tyrannical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Sect or Schism: Yea, as to them, I hold mental Communion with them in Christianity, and in all that is good and sound, and renounce Communion with them in all that I know to be evil.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But what if a Protestant Church make any Sin a condition of their Communion, will you not separate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I have said so much of this in this Book, against the <hi>Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and <hi>Unreasonable Defender,</hi> as that I am ashamed that mens Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections make me guilty of so much repetition. 2. None such can make any Sin the Condition of my mental Communion: For if they joyn good and bad, and bid me do so, God forbids me, and requireth me to own the good, and disown the bad. If they use the bad them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and put not me to subscribe, or own it, I will joyn with them notwithstanding, in that which is good, and in due time and place, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the evils, <hi>e. g.</hi> I have oft heard well-meaning men Preach fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods against <hi>Calvanists,</hi> and others against <hi>Arminians</hi>; some against <hi>Presbytery,</hi> some against <hi>Independency,</hi> some against Infant-Baptism; and alas! how ordinarily do men drop their Errors, and put them into their Prayers; I will not for this separate from a Church that professeth to to take the Scripture for their rule. Let them answer for their own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if they bid me <hi>Subscribe,</hi> or <hi>Approve</hi> any one Falshood or Sin, I will deny it: If they forbid me Communion, I will continue it till they put me away by force. And then it is not I that separate from them, but it's they, by unjust casting me out, that are Schismatical; I'le still have mental Communion with them in Faith and Love, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any to separate from them as Idolaters, or make them worse than they are; but if I can, I will go to another Church (tho worse) that will receive me without imposing actual sin; but not draw others from them, who are not cast out for refusing sin, as I have been: And tho I will not justifie many Protestant Writers, who say, That we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated not from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they cast us out for not sinning; yet I doubt not but this must be our case with sound Churches, that would impose any Sin upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:123"/>But still, To <hi>prefer the best and</hi> (all things considered) <hi>most profitable,</hi> before the <hi>more faulty</hi> or <hi>imperfect,</hi> without renouncing Communion with them, or perswading all others from it, as Idolaters, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is that which I never called Schism, nor wrote against.</p>

            <head>To the unknown Author of a LETTER lately sent me.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Letter contained, <hi>1.</hi> Your friendly reprehensions of me, not only for my purpose to write against a MS. which you say was Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s, but for many other things; and your enumeration of those faults of mine. <hi>2.</hi> With a friendly motion, That I suspend my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till we fairly debate the Cause, upon some larger Papers of the Doctor's on that Subject which you offered to send me.</p>
            <p>I wrote you presently an Answer, but your Messenger never more called for it; by which I supposed that you changed your purpose: If yet you will send for it, I will send it you. The Breviate of it is this: <hi>1.</hi> I do not feignedly, but from my heart, accept your manner of Reproof: It is honest and friendly; and I am truly thankful to you for it: Tho I am thought to be too plain and sharp, I can bear twice as much as I use. It's foolish pride that maketh us grudg at a friendly, tho sharp reprehension.</p>
            <p>But your mis-information tells me the pitiful Case of most in the World: Your honest Reproofs are founded on abundance of untrue Conceits: There are about Twenty Untruths, through mistake, in matter of Fact, in your Letter: And how gross are many of them? As that I write not against Persecution, which I scarce over write a book that hath not much against it: and this book it self doth fully confute you: And that I oppose not, but encourage divers things; which I know not the man that hath said half so much against: And you carry it all along, as if I were your Accuser for not going to the publick Churches, when I am a meer Defendent against your Accusations, and plead the Cause of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, as not deserving an Excommunication; and of many poor
<pb facs="tcp:59354:123"/>
weak women, and young people, that would be drawn to renounce all Church-Worship in <hi>England,</hi> for fear of Idolatry, or a Curse from God.</p>
            <p>If you that have his offered MS's, and say, <hi>This which I answer is Dr. O's</hi>; were the man that made this MS. which I answer, so common, I think you did him a great deal of wrong: Tho in his Printed Books, especially that of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and for <hi>Peace</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. he owns the ill Principle which I now confute, <hi>against all publick Worship by Liturgy, and against man's power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any more than Christ hath done in the order and manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Church-Government</hi> (which also is to be seen in his <hi>Preface,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of his Original of Churches,</hi> and his <hi>Vindicatian of the Nonconformists</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c). Yet these Printed Books of his (especially his <hi>Original of Churches,</hi> &amp;c.) have so much sound and excellent matter, and so many healing peaceable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in them, as did hide this one great Mistake: so that I long purposely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore all contradiction of him in it (tho I plainly answered his Arguments in my <hi>Cure of Church-divisions</hi>), for fear lest I should occasion a more common of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive or hurtful notice of them. But when that one Error which was thus buried in abundance of sound matter, was by some of you, not only culled out, and made common in MS. by it self, but even in a writing, in which he goeth yet further towards Non-Communion with all the Churches almost on Earth, than ever he did in his Printed Books; and this to affright all others into the same Non-Communion; you could not sure imagine, that no Christian had so much love to the Church, to Souls, to Catholick Communion, to Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, as not to let such a Writing do its worst, without any Antid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. You could scarce have wrong'd the Doctor, or his Memory m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re: All his Enemies could not have done half so much against him, having no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to accuse him of, as you have unadvisedly given them. And if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> also you will lay your own Fault on others that love the Truth, and Church, and Souls, and Peace, better than this Manuscript, or its Reputation, you will but run further into Error.</p>
            <p>And can you possibly be ignorant how like you are to the other Extream, <hi>1.</hi> While you <hi>excommunicate far more</hi> than they do, even almost all the Body of Christ, as to External Communion: <hi>2.</hi> And are <hi>for silencing us as well as they:</hi> Why else may not I have leave to render a Reason of my Iudgment and Practice, to those that are offended at it? <hi>3.</hi> And as they would deprive Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of sound Doctrine, Instruction and Worship, for the Cause of the Opinions of their Faction, would not you discharge almost whole Counties from all Church-worship, where Forms are used, and your way is not tolerated?</p>
            <p>Had not the MS. been against all <hi>Forms of Liturgy,</hi> but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the real or supposed faults of the <hi>English one;</hi> and had it been only against <hi>owning</hi> the <hi>faults,</hi> and not against <hi>Communion in necessary Duty,</hi> I had not troubled you, by my Defence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:59354:124"/>II. I did much approve of your brotherly motion to debate the Case friendly, on the perusal of his larger Writings. And tho your Letter came to me a week after the Book was printed, the Bookseller said he had sold but two, and I purposed thankfully to accept your offer, and (tho to my cost) to have done my best to stop the rest, and recall those two: But not knowing you, nor how to send to you, I must suppose that you retract your Motions, your Messenger not calling for my answer, as we appointed.</p>
            <p>Remember, I beseech you, that the Dr. writeth for mental Communion in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> with all true Churches, tho he write against outward Local Communion with almost all: And I crave your perusal of the first and third parts of this Book, against the <hi>Resolver</hi> of <hi>three Cases, &amp;c.</hi> And if you find that all the Cases, in which I vindicate <hi>Local Separation</hi> to be no <hi>Schism,</hi> be not enough, bethink you what the Scripture meaneth by reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heresie, Schism, and Division; and whether there be any such Sins; and whether they that are so much for Scripture-sufficiency, as not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with a Mode, Order or Form of Words, which it prescribeth not, should set so light by it, as not to fear its many sharp Condemnations of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said sins, and its frequent and vehement Exhortations to Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, and to receive one another, as Christ received us, to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord pardon the faulty imperfections of our Services, which we must rather venture on, than a total Omission; and teach us to pardon one another.</hi>
