            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

any profit by the loane of money?</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may not expect a
positive answer either
way: Many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ere any thing can
be determined.</p>
                  <p>First, who is it that borrowes? A
poore neighbour that is constrained
out of neede? or a Merchant that


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47749:13"/>
takes up money for a freer trade? or
a rich man that layes it out upon su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
occasions?</p>
                  <p>If a poore man borrow out of
necessity, you may not expect any
profit for the loane: <hi>(Deuteronomy
15. 7, 8, 9.)</hi> To the poorest of all
we must give, and not lend: to the
next ranke of poore we must lend
freely: but if a man will borrow that
money (which you could improve)
for the enriching of himselfe; or out
of a wanton expence will be laying
out that which might be otherwise
usefull to you, for his meere pleasure,
the case is different; for God hath
not commanded you to love any
man more then your selfe; and there
can be no reason why you should vail
your owne just advantage to another
mans excesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon what termes doe
you lend? whether upon an absolute
compact for a set increment, (what


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47749:13"/>
ever become of the principall or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a friendly trust to a voluntary sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
according to the good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the summe lent? The
former is not safe, and where there
hath been an honest endeavour of a
just benefit disappointed either by
unavoidable casualty, or force, may
not be rigorously urged, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
oppression. The latter can bee
no other then lawfull: and with those
that are truly faithfull and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
the bond of gratitude is no
lesse strong then that of law and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if upon absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact;
is it upon a certainty, or an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture?
for where you are willing
to hazard the principall, there can be
no reason but you should expect to
take part of the advantage.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where the trade is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
certaine, there are yet farther
considerations to be had: to which


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47749:14"/>
shall make way by these undenyable
grounds.</p>
                  <p>That the value of moneys or other
commodities is arbitrable according
to the soveraigne authority and use
of severall Kingdomes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>That whatsoever commodity is
saleable, is capable of a profit in the
loane of it; as an horse, or an oxe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it may be sold, may be let
out for profit.</p>
                  <p>Money it selfe is not onely the
price of all commodities in all civill
Nations, but it is also, in some cases,
a trafiqueable commodity: the price
whereof rises, and falls in severall
countries upon occasion; and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
either profit or losse in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                  <p>There can be no doubt therefore
but that money thus considered, and
as it were turned merchandise, may be
bought and sold, and improved to a
just profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47749:14"/>
But the maine doubt is, whether
money meerely considered as the
price of all other commodities, may
be let forth for profit; and be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a warrantable increase. For
the resolving whereof be it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</p>
                  <p>That all usury, which is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
contract for the meere loane of
money, is unlawfull both by law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and positive, both divine and
humane.</p>
                  <p>Nature teacheth us that metals are
not a thing capable of a superfoeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that no man ought to set a price
on that which is not his owne time:
that the use of the stock once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is not the lenders, but the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers;
for the power, and right of
disposing the principall, is by contract
transferred for the time to the hands
of him that receives it; so as hee
that takes the interest by vertue of
such transaction, doth but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47749:15"/>
and legall fashion rob the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower.</p>
                  <p>How frequent the<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 22. 25. Levit. 25. 36, 37. Deut. 23. 19, 20. Nehem. 5. 7. Psal. 15. 5. Prov. 28. 8. Ezek. 18. 8.</note> Scripture is in
the prohibition of this practice, no
Christian can bee ignorant: And as
for humane lawes raised even from
the meere light of Nature amongst
Heathen Nations, how odious, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
interdicted usurary contracts,
have been in all times, it appeares suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
by the Records which wee
have of the Decrees of<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Alexand. ab Alexand. Gen. dierum l. 1. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Egypt,</hi> of
<hi>Athens,</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and not onely by
the restraint of the Twelve Tables,
and of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Vespasian;</hi> but
by the absolute forbiddance of many
popular statutes condemning this
usage: <hi>Tiberius</hi> himselfe, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
wicked enough, yet would
rather furnish the Bankes with his
owne stock, to bee freely let out for


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47749:15"/>
three yeeres to the Citizens, upon
onely security of the summe doubled
in the forfeiture, then he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
this griping &amp; oppressive trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action:
And how wise <hi>Cato</hi> drove out
all usurers out of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi>
freed all <hi>Asia</hi> from this pressure
of Interest, History hath sufficiently
recorded.</p>
                  <p>As for Lawes Ecclesiasticall, let it
be enough that a<note n="*" place="bottom">Concil. Viennens.</note> Councel hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
that to say usury is not a sinne,
is no better then heresie: and in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
times how liable the usurer
hath ever been to the highest censures
of the Church; and how excluded
from the favour of Christian buriall,
is more manifest then to need any
proofe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, however it is unlawfull
to covenant for a certaine profit for
the mere loane of money, yet there
may be, and are circumstances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47749:16"/>
to the loane, which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of some benefit to be lawfully
made by the lender for the use of his
money; and especially these two; the
losse that he sustaines, and the gaine
that he misses, by the want of the
summe lent: For what reason can
there be, that to pleasure another
man, I should hurt my selfe, that I
should enrich another by my owne
losse?</p>
                  <p>If then I shall incur a reall losse or
forfeiture by the delayed payment of
the summe lent; I may justly look fot
a satisfaction from the borrower; yea
if there be a true danger of losse to
me imminent, when the transaction
is made, nothing hinders but that I
may by compact make sure such a
summe as may be sufficient for my
indemnity; And if I see an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of an apparent profit that I
could make fairely by disbursing
of such a summe <hi>bona fide,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47749:16"/>
that hath a more gainefull bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in chace shall sue to me to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
my money out of my hand for
his owne greater advantage, there can
be no reason why in such a case I
should have more respect to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
then my owne; and why should I
not even upon pact, secure unto my
selfe such a moderate summe as may
be somewhat answerable to the gaine
which I doe willingly forgoe, for his
greater profit? Since it is a true
ground which <hi>Lessius</hi> (with other
Casuists) maintains against <hi>Sotus</hi> and
<hi>Durand,</hi> that even our hopes of an
evident commodity are valuable; and
that no lesse then the feares of our
losse.</p>
                  <p>Shortly, for the guidance of our
either caution, or liberty in matter of
borrowing, and lending, the onely
Cynosure is our <hi>Charity;</hi> for in all
humane and civill acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
it is a sure rule, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47749:17"/>
is not a violation of Charity
cannot be unlawfull, and whatsoever
is not agreeable to Charity can be no
other then sinfull: And as Charity
must be your rule, so your selfe must
be the rule of your Charity; Looke
what you could wish to be done to
you by others, doe but the same to
others, you cannot be guilty of the
breach of Charity: The maximes of
Traffique are almost infinite; onely
Charity (but ever inseparable from
Justice) must make the application of
them; That will teach you that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
increase by loane of money is not
usurary; and that those which are ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solutely
such, are damnable: that
will teach you to distinguish betwixt
the one improvement of loane, and
the other; and will tell you that if
you can finde out a way, whether by
loane, or sale, to advance your stock,
that may be free from all oppression,
and extortion; and beneficiall as


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47749:17"/>
well to others, as to your selfe, you
need not feare to walke in it with all
honest security: but in the meane
time take good heed that your heart
beguile you not in mis-applications;
for we are naturally too apt out of
our self-love to flatter our selves with
faire glozes of bad intentions; and
rather to draw the rule to us, then our
selves to the rule.</p>
                  <p>But whiles I give you this short so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
I must professe to lament the
common ignorance, or mistaking of
too many Christians, whose zeal just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cryes downe usury as a most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and abominable practice, but in
the meane time makes no bones of
actions no lesse biting, and oppressive:
they care not how high they sell any
of their commodities, at how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
rates they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et their grounds,
how they circumvent the buyer in
their bargaines, and thinke any price
just, any gaine lawfull that they can


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47749:18"/>
make in their markets: not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is neither lesse, nor lesse
odious usury in selling and letting,
then there is in lending: It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
in both that makes the sinne;
without which the kind or termes of
the transaction could not be guilty.
Surely it must needs be a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to think that the same God who
requires mercy and favour in lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will allow us to be cruell in sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
Rigour and excesse in both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
violates the law of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Justice, equally crosses the law
of Charity: Let those therefore that
make scruple of an usurious lending,
learne to make no lesse conscience of
a racking bargaine; otherwise their
partiall obedience will argue a grosse
hypocrisie; and they shall prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the worst kinde of what they
hate, usurers: For in the ordinary
loan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> usury, the borrower hath yet
time to boot for his money; but here


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47749:18"/>
the buyer payes downe an excessive
interest, without any consideration at
all, but the sellers cruelty. For the
fuller clearing of which point; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                  <p>The due price is that which cuts


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47749:19"/>
equally and indifferently betwixt the
buyer and seller; so as the seller may
receive a moderate gaine, and the
buyer a just penny-worth.</p>
                  <p>In those countries wherein there is
a price set by publique authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all marketable commodities, the
way of commerce is well expedited,
and it is soone and easily determined,
that it is meete men should be held
close to the rule.</p>
                  <p>But where all things are left to an
arbitrary transaction, there were no
living, if some limits were not set to
the sellers demands.</p>
                  <p>These limits must be the ordinary
received proportion of price current
in the severall countries wherein they
are sold; and the judgement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
wise, experienced and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
persons; and the well-stated
conscience of the seller.</p>
                  <p>If men shall wilfully run beyond
these bounds, taking advantage of


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47749:19"/>
the rarenesse of the commodity, the
paucity or the necessity of the buyers
to enhance the price to an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
height, they shall be guilty of the
breach of charity, and in making a
sinfull bargaine purchase a curse.</p>
                  <p>Not that a man is so strictly tyed
to any others valuation, as that hee
may not upon any occasion aske or
receive more then the common price;
or that if the market rise he is bound
to sit still: There may be just reason
upon a generall mortality of cattle to
set those beasts that remaine at an
higher rate, or upon a dearth of
graine, or other commodities, to
heighten the price; but in such cases
wee must bee so affected as that wee
grudge to our selves our owne gaine,
that wee bee not in the first file of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancers,
that wee strive to be the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in our valuation, and labour what
we may to bring downe the market;
alwaies putting our selves in our


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47749:20"/>
conceits into the buyers roome; and
bethinking how we would wish to be
dealt with, if we were in his cloathes.</p>
                  <p>It is lawfull for the seller in his
price to have regard not to his rents
and disbursements onely, but to his
labour, and cost, to his delay of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
to his loss in managing, to his
hazard or difficulty in conveyance;
but all these in such moderation, as
that he may be a just gainer by the
bargaine: not setting the dice upon
the buyer; not making too much
haste to be rich, by the secret spoiles
of an oppressed neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Those things whose end is onely
pleasure or ornament, as a Jewel, an
Hauke, or an Hound, can admit of
no certaine value; the owners affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must estimate it, and the buyers
desire must make up an illimited bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
but even in these, and all other
commodities that carry the face of
unnecessary, Conscience must be the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47749:20"/>
Clarke of the Market; and tell us
that we must so sell, as we could be
willing to buy. From all which it
followes,</p>
                  <p>That the common maxime current
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dom. Sot. de Justif. &amp; Jure l. 6. quaest. 2. Artic. 3. tradit hoc ut Axioma Jurisconsultorum.</note> in the shops of trade, that things are
so much worth as they can be sold
for; and those ordinary rules of
chapmen, that men who are masters
of their wares may heighten their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at pleasure, and get what they can
out of all commers; and what ever
they can get out of the simplicity,
or necessity of the buyers, is lawfull
prize, are damnably uncharitable and
unjust.</p>
                  <p>It were an happy thing, if as it is in
some other well ordered nations,
there were a certaine regulation of the
prices of all commodities by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
authority, the wisdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
knows how to rise and fall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47749:21"/>
to the necessity of the occasion;
so as the buyer might be secured
from injury, and the seller restrained
from a lawlesse oppression. But where
that cannot be had, it is fit that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Charity should so far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
mens actions, that every man
may not be carryed in matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
by the sway of his owne unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
will, and be free to carve for
himselfe as he lists of the buyers
purse: every man hath a bird in his
bosome that sings to him another
note.</p>
                  <p>A good conscience therefore will
tell you that if (taking advantage of
the ignorance or unskilfulnesse of the
buyer) you have made a prey of him
by drawing from him double the
worth of the commodity sold, you
are bound to make restitution to him
accordingly, and in a proportion so,
in all the considerable summes which
you shall have by your false protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47749:21"/>
and oathes, and plausible inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
wrought out from an abused
buyer; above that due price which
would make you a just and rightly
moderated gainer: For assure your
selfe, all that you willingly doe this
way is but a better-coloured picking
of purses; and what you thus get is
but stolne goods varnisht over with
the pretence of a calling, and will
prove at the last no other then gravel
in your throat.</p>

knowne to the buyer the faults of that
which he is about to sell?</head>
                  <p>IT is a question that was long since
disputed betwixt the Heathen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>

so decides it as that his judgement
may justly shame and condemne the
practice of too many Christians: For
a full answer, due consideration must
be had of divers circumstances.</p>
                  <p>First, what the nature and quality
of the fault is; whether it be sleight
and unimporting; or whether such
as may vitiate the thing sold, and
render it either unusefull or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the buyer: or againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fault be apparent, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:
both these doe justly vary the
case: sleight and harmeless faults may
bee concealed without injustice; main
and importing must be signified: if
apparent defects bee not discerned by
the buyer hee may thanke himselfe;
secret faults knowne onely to the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
(such as may be prejudiciall to
the buyer) ought not to be concealed,
or if they be concealed so, as that
the buyer payes for it as sound, and
perfect, binde the seller in conscience,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47749:22"/>
either to void the bargaine, or to give
just satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it would be considered,
whether the buyer before the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
be stricken, hath required of
the seller to signifie the faults of the
commodity to be sold, and out of a
reliance upon the sellers fidelity and
warrant, hath made up the match:
or whether in the confidence of his
owne skill, without moving any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
hee enter resolutely, <hi>(de bene
esse)</hi> upon the bargained commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
If the former, a double bond
lyes upon the seller to deale faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the buyer, and therefore to
let him know the true condition of
the thing exposed to sale, that so
either he may take off his hand; or if
he shall see that notwith standing that
defect it may serve his turne, he may
proportion the price accordingly:
otherwise he shall be guilty (besides
falshood and oppression) of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47749:23"/>
But if the buyer will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
rely upon his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as presuming to make a
gaine of that bargaine (which the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
out of conscience of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
sets (as hee ought) so much
lower as the defect may bee more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
to the buyer) will goe
through with the contract, and stand
to all hazards, I see no reason why
the seller may not receive the price
stipulated; but withall if the match
may carry danger in it to the buyer,
(as if the horse sold bee subject to a
perilous starting, or stumbling; the
house sold have a secret crack that
may threaten ruine; or the land sold
be lyable to a litigious claime which
may be timely avoyded) the seller is
bound in conscience (at least after the
bargaine) to intimate unto the buyer
these faulty qualities, that hee may
accordingly provide for the preven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of the mischiefe that may ensue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47749:23"/>
But if the seller shall use art to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the defects of his commodity,
that so he may deceive the buyer in
his judgement of the thing bargained
for, or shall mix faulty wares with
sound, that they may passe undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
he is more faulty then his
wares, and makes an ill bargaine for
his soule. In this, shortly, and in all
other cases that concerne trade, these
universall rules must take place. That
it is not lawfull for a Christian chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to thrive by fraud. That hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
may sell upon no other termes then
he could wish to buy. That his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
must be regulated by his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not his conscience by his profit.
That he is bound either to prevent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the buyers wrong; or if heedlesly
done, to satisfie it. That he ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
rather to affect to be honest, then
rich: And lastly, that as he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
of a community both civill and
Christian, he ought to be tender of


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47749:24"/>

of his owne.</p>

transferring of the right and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the time; in the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually;
but the substance both of
the matter and question is the same;
for in both there seemes to be a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of time: which whether in case
of mutuation, or sale, may justly be
suspected for unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47749:24"/>
For answer;</p>
                  <p>There are three stages of prices
acknowledged by all Casuists; the
highest, which they are wont to call
Rigorous; the meane, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
If these keep within due bounds,
though the highest be hard, yet it is
not unjust, and if the lowest be favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable,
yet it is not alwayes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>If then you shall proportion but a
just price to the time, and worth of
your bargaine, so as the present shall
passe for the easiest price, some short
time for the meane, and the longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
for the highest, I see not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
all things considered, you doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
                  <p>And certainly to debarre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of a moderate gaine for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of payment upon moneths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
were to destroy all trade of
merchandise: For not many buyers
are furnished with ready money to


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47749:25"/>
buy their wares, at the Port; nor
could the sellers make off their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
so seasonably, as to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for further traffique, if they must
necessarily be tyed to wait upon the
hopes of a pecuniary sale; and not
left to the common liberty of putting
them over to whole-sale men upon
trust; who upon a second trust distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
them to those, that vent them
by retaile, both for days agreed upon:
By which meanes the trade holds up,
and the common-wealth enjoyes the
benefit of a convenient and necessary
commerce.</p>
                  <p>A practice that is now so habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
amongst all nations into the
course of trade, that it cannot well
consist without it: So as nothing is
more ordinary in experience than that
those, who are able to pay downe
ready money for their wares, know
to expect a better pennyworth, then
those that runne upon trust: And


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47749:25"/>
there may be just reason for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
For the present money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
enables the seller to a further
improvement of his stock, which lyes
for the time dead in the hands that
take day for their payment.</p>
                  <p>So then, it is not mere time that
is here set to sale, which were odious
in any Christian to bargaine for; but
there are two incidents into this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
which may render it not unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable.
The one is the hazard of
the summe agreed upon: which too
often comes short in the payment:
whiles those subordinate chapmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose hand the grosse summe is
scattered, turne bankrupts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their trust; so as no small losse
is this way commonly sustained by
the confident seller; in which regard
we are wont to say justly, that One
bird in the hand is worth two in the
wood. The other is the cessation of
that gaine which the merchant might


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47749:26"/>
in the meane time have made of the
sum differred; which might in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
have beene greater then the
proportion of the raised price can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto; to which may be added
the foreseene probability of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the market in the intervall of
payment: the profit whereof is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by this meanes to the seller:
whose full engagement takes him off
perhaps from a resolution to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
those commodities in his own
hands, in expectation of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a more profitable utterance,
had not the forwardnesse of the buyer
importuned a prevention.</p>
                  <p>Upon these considerations, if they
be serious, and unfained; I see not
why you may not in a due and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
proportion, difference your
prices according to the delayes of
payment, without any oppression to
the buyer: Howbeit, if any man
pleaseth to be so free, as to take no


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47749:26"/>
notice of time, but to make future
dayes in his account present, I shall
commend his charity, though I dare
not presse his example as necessary.</p>
                  <p>The case is equally just on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the seller: who if he be either
driven by some emergent necessity;
or drawne by the opportunity of a
more gainfull bargaine, to call for his
money before his day, may justly be
required by the late buyer, to abate of
the returnable summe, in regard of
the prevention of the time covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
by reason of the inconvenience
or losse whereunto he is put upon the
suddaine revocation of that money,
which is not by agreement payable
till the expiration of the time prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But what quantity is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the one part, or defalked on the
other, is onely to be moderated by
Christian Charity, and that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
rule of doing what we would be

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47749:27"/>
for the common benefit and reliefe

ensuing necessity, he is so farre out of
the reach of censure, as that he well
deserves a statue with the Inscription
of Publique Benefactor; So as it is
not the meere act of Monopolizing
that makes the thing unlawfull, but
the ground and intention, and the
manner of carriage.</p>
                  <p>All Monopolies, as they are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
practised, are either such as are
allowed by Soveraigne authority, or
privately contrived by secret plot and
convention for a peculiar gaine to
some speciall persons. If the first, it
must be considered upon what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that priviledge is granted, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what termes; If both these be just,
the grant can be no other. For first,
it may not be denyed, that supreme
authority, whether of Princes or
States, hath power to grant such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
where they shall finde just


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47749:28"/>
cause; and secondly, that there may
be very just motives of granting them
to some capable and worthy persons;
I should be ashamed to imagine that
either of these should need any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse then, there is manifest
equity, that where there hath beene
some great merit, or charge, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the compassing of some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
worke for a common good, the
undertaker should be rewarded with
a patent for a secured profit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
As put case some well minded
Printer (as one of the <hi>Stephens)</hi> is
willing to be at an excessive charge
in the faire publication of a learned
and usefull worke for the benefit of
the present and following ages; it is
most just that he should from the
hands of Princes or States receive
a Priviledge for the sole impression;
that he may recover, with advantage,
the deep expence he hath beene at;


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47749:28"/>
Otherwise some Interloper may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
underhand fall upon the work at
a lower rate, and undoe the first edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
whose industry, care and cost
shall thus be recompenced with the
ruine of himselfe and his posterity; as
were too easie to instance.</p>
                  <p>If a man have by notable dexterity
of wit, and art; and much labour and
charge after many experiments, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the skill of making some rare
engine of excellent use for the service
of his Prince and Countrey, as some
singular water worke; or some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
instrument for the freeing of
navigable rivers from their sandy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
it is all the reason in the
world, that by the just bounty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he should be so far remunerated,
as that he alone may receive a patent
of enjoying a due profit of his owne
invention.</p>
                  <p>But how farre it may be lawfull
for a Prince, not onely to gratifie a


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47749:29"/>

of his owne devise, but with a profit
arising from the sole sale of marketa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

or limitation of those Govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments,
under which they are pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctised:
But with this, that where this
is done, there may be great care had
of a just price to be set upon the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modities
so restrained, that they be

The former, as when some covetous

be fetcht, as from the minde, so from

so much more sinfull, as it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
more of oppression. The latter,
when some brethren in evill conspire
to prevent the harvest, to buy up, or

to starve the market, and to hatch up

and that which cryes

                  <p>I cannot therefore but marvaile at

particular Justice, His reason: To
buy that corne (saith he) could not
be against justice, for he bought it at
the current price: Nor yet to sell it,
could be against justice, because he
was not tyed out of justice at that
time to bring it forth to sale: When
he might easily have considered, that
it is not the mere act of buying, or of
not selling, that in it selfe is accused
for unjust, but to buy, or not to sell,
with an intention, and issue of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
others, and undue enriching
themselves by a dearth. For what
can be more unjust then for a man to


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47749:30"/>
indevour to raise himself by the affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing
of others?</p>
                  <p>Neither can it serve his turne to say
by way of excuse, that the multitude
of buyers may be the cause of a
dearth, and yet without sin; since
they doe rather occasion, then cause a
scarcity; and are so farre from inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a dearth in making their market,
that they deprecate it, as their great
affliction.</p>
                  <p>And if, by his owne confession,
those, who either by force, or fraud
hinder the importation of corne, that
a dearth may continue, are guilty of
injustice, and are bound to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
both to the Commonwealth
in giving cause to raise the price; as
also to the Merchant, whom they
have hindered of his meet gaine;
how can those be liable to a lesse sin,
or punishment, that either buy up,
or wilfully keep in, their graine with
a purpose to begin, and hold on a


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47749:31"/>
dearth? and what lesse can it be then
force or fraud, that by their crafty
and cruell prevention the poor are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to want that sustenance,
whereby their life should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>

either by rescinding the match, or by
making amends for the injury: If the

If in the maine substance of the thing
sold, the bargaine is both by the very
law of nature, and in conscience,
void; yea indeed, not at all: as if
a man have sold you copper lace for
gold; or alchymie-plate for silver;
the reason is well given by<note n="*" place="bottom">Lessius l. 2. c. 17. dub. 5.</note> Casuists:
There is no bargaine without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and here is no consent at all,
whiles both parties pitch not upon
the same subject; the buyer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to himselfe gold and silver,
the seller obtrudes copper, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymie;
the one therefore not buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Canius,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Knight and Orator, and one
<hi>Pythius</hi> a Banker of <hi>Syracuse. Canius</hi>
comming upon occasion of pleading


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47749:32"/>
to the city of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> tooke a great
liking to the place; and setling there,
gave out that he had a great desire to
buy some one of those pleasant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
wherewith, it seemes, that city
abounded; that he might there re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>create
himself when he pleased, with
his friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pythius,</hi> a crafty merchant, hearing
of it, sends word to <hi>Canius,</hi> that hee
had a faire garden which he had no
minde to sell; but if he pleased to
make use of it for his solace, he might
command it as his owne; and withall
courteously invites <hi>Canius</hi> to suppe
with him there the day following: In
the meane time being a man by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his trade of exchange, very
gracious in the city, he calls the fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen
together, and desires them that
the next evening they would fish in
the streame before his garden, and
bring him, what they shall have
caught: <hi>Canius</hi> in due time comes


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47749:33"/>
according to the invitation, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
where there was delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made for him by <hi>Pythius;</hi> and
store of boates bringing in their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
draughts of fish, and casting
them downe at the feet of <hi>Pythius:
Canius</hi> askes the meaning of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Fishermen, and store of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
provision? <hi>Pythius</hi> tells him
this is the commodity and priviledge
of the place, if <hi>Syracuse</hi> yeeld any
fish, here it is caught, and here ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
<hi>Canius</hi> beleeving the report,
importunes his host to sell him the
ground: the owner after some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loathnesse, and squeamish relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at last yeelds to gratifie him
with the bargaine: The deare price
is payd downe with much eagernesse.
The new master of the place, in much
pride of his purchase, the next day
repaires early to his garden, invites
his friends to a friday feast; and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
no boat there, asks the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47749:33"/>
whether it were holiday with
the fishermen, that he saw none of
them there; No, said the good man,
none that I know; but none of the
trade use to fish here; and I much
marvailed at the strange confluence
of their boats here yesterday: The
Roman Orator was downe in the
mouth; finding himselfe thus cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the money-changer: but, for
ought I see, had his amends in his
hands; He meant, and desired to buy
the place, though without any such
accommodation; but over-bought
it upon the false pretence of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
commodity; the injury was
the sellers, the losse must be the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>But if such be the case, that you
are meerely drawne in by the fraud,
and would not have bought the
commodity at all, if you had not
beene induced by the deceit, and false
oathes and warrants of the seller, you


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47749:34"/>
have just reason, either, if you may,
to fall off from the bargaine; or, if
the matter be valuable, to require a
just satisfaction from the seller; who
is bound in conscience, either by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
the bargaine, or abatement
of price to make good your indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>In these matters of contract there
is great reason to distinguish betwixt
a willing deceit, and an involuntary
wrong; If a man shall fraudulently
sell an horse which he knowes secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and incurably diseased, to another
for sound; and that other, beleeving
the sellers deep protestation, shall
upon the same price, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> put
him off to me; I feel my selfe injured,
but whither shall I go for an amends?
I cannot challenge the immediate sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
for he deceived me not; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
challenge the deceiver, for he
dealt not with me; In humane lawes,
I am left remedilesse; but in the law of


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47749:34"/>
conscience, the first seller, who ought
to have born his own burthen of an
inevitable losse, is bound to transferre
by the hands that sold me that injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>Neither is it other of fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                  <p>You ask now, to whom you should

                  <p>To whom, but the owner? But he,
you say, is dead; That will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
you; he lives still in his heires;
It is memorable (though in a small
matter) which <hi>Seneca</hi> reports of a
Pythagorean Philosopher at <hi>Athens,</hi>
who having run upon the score for
his shooes at a shop there; hearing that
the shoomaker was dead, at first was

ever, the shoomaker lives still to thee,
though dead to others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
puts his money into the shop, as
supposing that both of them would
finde an owner. It is a rare case that
a man dyes, and leaves no body in
whom his right survives: But if there

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is dangerous, and cannot be

You must look upon this money, as
no more yours than a strangers; and
howsoever it be most true that every

man is nearest to himselfe, and hath
reason to wish to bee a sharer,
where the need is equall; yet it is fit
this should be done with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Your Pastor, and those other that

with the case; (if it be in a matter
meet to be notified) as a businesse of
debt or pecuniary ingagement, let
their wisdome proportion the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution;
But if it be in the case of some
secret crime, as of theft, or cozenage,
which you would keep as close as
your owne heart, the restitution must
be charged upon your conscience to
be made with so much more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
as you desire it more to be
concealed; Herein have a care of
your soule, what ever becomes of
your estate.</p>
                  <p>As for the time of restitution it is
easily determined, that it cannot


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47749:41"/>
well be too soone for the discharge of
your conscience, it may be too late
for the occasions of him to whom it
is due; Although it may fall out,
that it may prove more fit to deferre
for the good of both: wherein cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and justice must be called in as
arbitrators; The owner calls for his
money in a riotous humour to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend
it upon his unlawfull pleasure;
if your delay may prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
the forbearance is an act of
mercy: The owner calls for a sword
deposited with you, which you have
cause to suspect he meanes to make
use of, for some ill purpose; your
forbearing to restore it is so both cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and just, that your act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of it may make you accessary
to a murther. Whereto I may adde,
that in the choice of the time, you
may lawfully have some respect to
your selfe; for if the present restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be to your utter undoing,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47749:41"/>
which may be avoided by some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
delay, you have no reason to
shun anothers inconvenience by your
own inevitable ruine; in such case let
the creditor be acquainted with the
necessity, his offence deprecated; and
rather put your selfe upon the mercy
of a Chancery, then be guilty of your
owne overthrow.</p>
                  <p>But when the power is in your
hand, and the coast every way cleare,
let not another mans goods or mony
stick to their fingers; and thinke not
that your head can long lye easily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another mans pillow.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but you say the money or
goods mis-carried, either by robbery
or false trust, ere you could employ
them to any profit at all; This will
not excuse you; after they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your power, you are responsible
for them; What compassion this
may work in the good nature of the

must be left to his own brest;

But if it be a lawfull thing that you
have thus promised, and sworne;
though the promise were unlawfully
drawne from you by feare, I dare not
perswade you to violate it. It is true
that divers learned Casuists hold,
that a promise drawne from a man
by feare is void, or at least revokable
at pleasure; and so also the oath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
which followes the nature of
the act whereto it appends; chiefly
upon this ground; that both these
are done without consent, meere invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
acts, since nothing can be
so contrary to consent as force and
feare: But I dare not goe along with
them; for that I apprehend there is
not an absolute involuntarinesse in
this engagement, but a mixt one, such
as the<note n="*" place="bottom">Arist. Eth. l. 2. c. 2.</note> Philosopher determines in
the Mariner, that casts his goods o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
board to save his life; in it selfe,
he hath no will to doe it; but here


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47749:43"/>
and now upon this danger imminent,
he hath an halfe-will to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I build upon their owne
ground; There is the same reason,
they say, of force, and of fraud; now
that a promise and oath drawne from
us by fraud bindes strongly, we need
no other instance then that of <hi>Joshua</hi>
made to the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> there could
not be a greater fraud than lay hid in
the old shooes, thred-bare garments,
rent bottels, and mouldy provisions
of those borderers; who under the
pretence of a remote nation put
themselves under the interest and
protection of <hi>Israel: Josh. 9. 12, 13.</hi>
&amp;c. the guile soone proved apparent,
yet durst not <hi>Joshua,</hi> though he found
himselfe cheated into this covenant,
fall off from the league made with
them; which when, after many ages,
<hi>Saul</hi> out of politique ends went about
to have broken, we see how fearfully
it was avenged with a grievous


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47749:44"/>
plague of famine upon <hi>Israel,</hi> even in
<hi>Davids</hi> dayes, 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 1.</hi> who was
no way accessary to the oppression;
neither could be otherwise expiated
than by the bleeding of <hi>Saul</hi>'s bloody
house. When once we have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
God in the businesse, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
not to be punctuall in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
If therefore a bold thiefe,
taking you at an advantage, have set
his dagger to your brest, and with
big oathes threatned to stab you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you promise and sweare to give
him an hundred pounds to be left on
such a day in such a place for him, I
see not how (if you be able) you can
dispence with the performance; the
onely help is, (which is well suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by<note n="*" place="bottom">Lessius de Jure, &amp;c. l. 2. C. 42. dub. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Lessius)</hi> that nothing hinders
why you may not, when you have
done, call for it back againe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
extorted. And truly, we are
beholding to the Jesuite for so much


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47749:44"/>
of a reall equivocation; why should
you not thus right your selfe, since
you have onely tyed your selfe to a
mere payment of the summe? upon
staking it downe for him, you are
free. But if he have forc'd you to
promise, and swear not to make him
knowne, you are bound to be silent
in this act, concerning your selfe; but
withall, if you find that your silence
may be prejudiciall to the publique
good, for that you perceive the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
of the offender proceeds
(and is like so to doe) to the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
unto others, you ought,
though not to accuse him for the fact
done unto you; yet to give warning
to some in authority to have a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
eye upon so leud a person, for
the prevention of any further villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>But if it be in a businesse, whose
perill rests onely in your selfe, the
matter being lawfull to be done;


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47749:45"/>
your promise and oath (though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

performance, notwitstanding the

you are dismissed upon your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role,

is so strict and firme, that no private

we may adde, to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

we know. Where the true owner is
knowne, speedy restitution must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
otherwise the detention is in the

masterlesse, <hi>(adespota)</hi> and common;


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47749:46"/>
offering themselves to the next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
The onely difficulty is in
those things which have an unknown
owner: And certainly common
justice and honesty suggests to us, that
we may not seize on commodities
of this kinde, as absolutely our own;
the casualty of their mis-laying doth
not alter their propriety; they are
still his that lost them; though out of
his sight, yet not out of his right;
and even naturall Justice, would give
every man his owne. The Lawes
both Civill and Canon, and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
doe sufficiently guide our
practise in many particular cases of
this nature, and our Conscience must
lead us to follow them: If they be
quick commodities, as horses, sheep,
kine, and the like, (which we call
Waifes and Strayes) every one
knowes they are to be publiquely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
that upon search the owner
may be the surer to find them; and if


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47749:46"/>
he come not in, the sooner, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
cryed in severall markets, that
the noise of his own neglected goods
may come to his eare: and if, upon a
continuing silence, they be put into
the Custody of the Lord of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
(who is most likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible)
and he shall make use of
them, before his year and day be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
he shall not doe it without some
mark of distinction, that yet the true
owner may know, they are not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
by the present possessour, as his
owne, but lye open to the just claime
of their true master.</p>
                  <p>But if they be dead commodities,
as a jewell, a purse, or some ring of
price, or the like, the finder may not
presently smother up the propriety of
it in his owne cofer; his heart tells
him that the meer accident of his
finding it, cannot alienate the just
right of it from the true owner; he is
therefore bound in conscience, in an


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47749:47"/>
honest sincerity to use all good means
for the finding out of the right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary,
whether by secret inquiry,
or open publication: and if after due
inquisition, no claime shall be made
to it for the present, he shall reserve it
in his hand in expectation of a just
challenge: upon the assurance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(how late soever) he is bound to
restore it to the proper owner: who,
on the other side, shall faile in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of gratitude, if he returne not some
meet acknowlegement of that good
office, and fidelity: In all which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
carriages, we ought to be guided
by those respects, which we could
wish tendered to our selves in the like
occasions. Mean while, in all the time
of our custody, we are to looke upon
those commodities as strangers; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
account of such a potentiall
right onely in them, as we are ready
and desirous to resigne to the hands
that purchased and lost them. On


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47749:47"/>
the contrary, no words can expresse
the horrible cruelty and injustice that
is wont to be done in this kinde, not
onely on our shores, but in other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
also, upon the ship-wrecked
goods both of strangers, and our own
compatriots; whiles in stead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passioning
and relieving the losse, and
miseryes of our distressed bretheren,
every man is ready to run upon the
spoile, and, as if it were from some
plundered enemy, is eagerly busie in
carrying away what riches soever
come to hand, which they falsly, and
injuriously terme <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> when as
indeed it is no other than the Devils
booty. This practise can passe for no
other than a meere robbery, so much
more haynous, as the condition of
the mis-carried owner is more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
what a foule inhumanity is this,
to persecute him whom God hath
smitten; and upon no other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell

certainly where there is not law, there
can be no justice, whereof law is the

an established law, in matter of right

unjust; Take heed therefore lest that

These stoln waters may be sweet in

ignorantly buy those goods which
you afterward heare, and know, to

be anothers, the contract is on your

you from any guilt of consent; but

the safety of his owne soule, before
the life of another: As if nothing but
the feare of damnation could warrant
a man for his owne safeguard, as if
nothing but the danger of hell could
authorize an holy person to be his

were so cheap and worthlesse, that

Where was this consideration when
so many thousands of innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

them up instantly to their hell?</p>
                  <p>By this reason, a malefactor, if he

to bee remorslesse, may not feele the

to my owne indempnity.</p>
                  <p>The case is yet more difficult where
the attempt is not upon my person,

the lawes of God and man will allow

this resistance the Thief, or Burglayer
miscarry, his blood will be upon his

withall, however the Spanish and

are wont to passe faire interpretations
of the matter, I cannot but find it
deeply guilty also: for what is this
other, than a consent to sin by enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

and conscionable might be turned off
with a just contempt, without impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

the vaine fancies of idle sword-men:
or, if that will not be taken, the false
blurres that are cast upon a worthy
mans reputation by vulgar breath,
deserve no entertainment but scorne;
or lastly, other means lie open to both
parts for the proofe of a questioned
valour, which in a lawfull way the

walks not unprovided about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse

wicked and damnable; and though
both should come fairely off, yet the

not unwilling to fore-stall nature, and
to free themselves early of that which
might in time prove their burden:
Wherein they little know how highly


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47749:60"/>
they offend the Majesty of God
in destroying his potentiall creature,

lay upon their soules, whiles they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

                  <p>Your question supposes an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
and surely such it had need to
be, that may warrant the intention of
such an event.</p>
                  <p>For the deciding whereof, our
Casuists are wont to distinguish
double; both of the state of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and of the nature of the
receipt: In the former, they consider
of the Conception, either as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it receive life, or after that it is
animated: Before it receive life, they
are wont to determine, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were no lesse than mortall sin,
in a Physitian to prescribe a medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
receit to cause abortion, for the
hiding of a sinne, or any outward se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occasion; yet for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47749:60"/>
of the life of the mother, in an
extreme danger, (I say, before ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)
it might be lawfull: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life once received, it were an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sin to administer any such mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
remedy. The latter Casuists are
better advised; and justly hold that
to give any such expelling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
medicine, with a direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to work an abortment, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before or after animation) is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unlawfull, and highly sinfull:
And with them I cannot but concur
in opinion; For, after conception we
know that naturally followes anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is only the time that makes
the difference; which in this case is
not so considerable, as to take off a
sinne: That of<note n="*" place="bottom">Tertul. in Apol. c. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> comes

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47749:61"/>
to hinder that which would bee
born; <hi>Homo est qui futurus est;</hi> It is a
man that would be so, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ground we know that
in a further degree of remotenesse, a
voluntary selfe pollution hath ever
beene held to have so much guilt in it,
as that <hi>Angelus Politianus</hi> reports it
as the high praise of<note n="*" place="bottom">

that he would rather dye, than
yeild to it: how much more when
there is a further progresse made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the perfection of humane life?</p>
                  <p>And if you tell me that the life of
the mother might thus be preserved,
whereas otherwise both she and all
the possibilities of further conceptions
are utterly lost; I must answer you
with that sure and universall rule of
the Apostle, That <hi>wee may not doe
evill that good may come thereon,</hi>
Rom. 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47749:61"/>
The second consideration is of the
nature of the receit, and the intention
of the prescriber; There are prescripts
that may, in, and of themselves tend
towards cure, and may have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
such an effect; but yet being used
and applyed for the mothers remedy,
may prove the losse of the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being yet inanimate; these if they
be given with no other intention than
the preservation of the mothers life,
may bee capable of excuse; for that
the inconvenience (or mischief rather)
which followed upon the receits was
accidentall, and utterly against the
minde, and hopes of him that advised
them.</p>
                  <p>But if the conception bee once
formed, and animated, the question
will be so much more difficult, as the
proceedings of nature are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
Whereupon it is, that the
Septuagint in their Translation (as

                  <p>In this case of the conception ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
I find the Casuists much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
Whiles some more tender than
their fellowes, will not allow in the
utmost extremity of a dying mother,
a medicine that may be directly cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to be given her, if it should be
with any apparent danger of the
childe; in case that the child may be
probably drawne forth alive; which
they doe upon this false and bloudily
uncharitable ground,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vel. ut alii, <hi>Quorum animae certissimè in limbum descendunt siue Baptismo.</hi> Mart. Alphons. Viv. Explan. Bullae de abort.</note> that the child
dying without Baptisme, is liable to
eternall damnation, which wofull
danger therefore the mother ought


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47749:63"/>
to prevent, though with the certaine
hazard of her own life: but the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this judgement being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
(since to doome the children
of believing Parents inevitably to
hell for the want of that, which they
are not possibly capable to receive,
is too cruell and horrible) the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
must needes totter. These men
whiles they professe themselves too
carefull of the soule of the childe
(which yet may perhaps be safer than
their owne) seeme to bee somewhat
too hard-hearted to the body of the
mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Rodr. Sum. To. 1. c. 5. de Abort.</note> Others more probably hold, that
if the case be utterly desperate; and
it bee certaine that both mother and
childe must undoubtedly perish if
some speedy remedy be not had; it
may then be lawfull to make use of
such receits as may possibly give
some hopes to save the mother,


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47749:63"/>
though not without some perill of the
child.</p>
                  <p>But all this while, the intentions,
and indeavours must be no other than
preservatory; however it pleaseth
God to order the events: Shortly,
no man that purposely procureth an
abortion, as such, can wash his hands
from blood; No woman that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acts, or suffers it, (however the
secrecy may exempt her from the
danger of humane lawes) can thinke
to avoid those judgments of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God, which he hath charged
upon murderers.</p>
                  <p>I cannot here therefore forbeare to
give the world notice of the impious
indulgence of a late Pope in this kind;
<hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> who in our time sat in

effects of that liberty, which too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both secular and religious persons
tooke to themselves in this matter of
abortion; in a just detestation of that


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47749:64"/>
damnable practice, thought meet in
much fervour of spirit to set forth his
<hi>Bulla Cruciata;</hi> than which there was
never a more zealous piece published
to the world; wherein that Pope
pronounces all those, which have
any hand in the acting or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this wicked fact, of the eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of conceptions, whether ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
or inanimate, formed, or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
by potions, or medicaments,
or any other meanes whatsoever, to
have incurred both the crime and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

due execution to be done upon such

them, and sends them to hell, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

of the law of private conscience; how
farre that will allow a man to goe in

                  <p>And first of all; if such sentence

no man can doubt, but that hee may
most lawfully, by all just meanes,

and may for that purpose use
those helps of filing, or mining,
which conduce to this purpose: Their
ground is, that universall rule, and
instinct of selfe-preservation, which
is naturall to every creature; much
more eminent in man, who is furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with better faculties than the rest,
for the working of his own indemnity:
Whereto is added that main conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Aquinas;</hi> That no man is
bound to kill himselfe, but onely
doomed to suffer death; not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bound to doe that upon which
death will inevitably follow, which


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47749:66"/>
is to wait in prison for the stroak, if
he may avoid it; it is enough that he
patiently submits to what the law
forces upon him, though he doe not
cooperate to his owne destruction:
his sentence abridges him of power,
not of will to depart: Whereupon
they have gone so far, as to hold it
in point of conscience not unlawfull
for the friends of the imprisoned, to
conveigh unto him files, and cords,
or other instruments usefull for their
escape: But herein some better-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
Doctors have justly dissented
from them; as those, whose Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath not beene more favourable
to malefactors, than dangerous and
prejudiciall to the Common-wealth:
for how safe soever this might seeme
in lighter trespasses, yet if this might
be allowed, as in conscience lawfull
to be done to the rescue of murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
traytors, or such other flagitious
villains, what infinite mischiefe might


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47749:67"/>
it produce? and what were this other
than to invite men to be accessary to
those crimes, which the law in a due
way intends to punish? Certainly,
by how much a more laudable act of
Justice it is, to free the society of men
from such wicked miscreants, by so
much more sinfull and odious an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
it were, to use these sinister means
for their exemption from the due
course of Justice; But howsoever for
another man to yield such unlawfull
aide, is no better than a foule affront
of publique Justice, and enwrappes
the agent in a partnership of crime;
yet the law of nature puts this liberty
upon the restrained party himselfe,
both to wish and indeavour his owne
deliverance: Although not so; but
that if the prisoner have ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by solemne promise, and oath to
his keeper, not to depart out of his
custody; honesty must prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
nature; and he ought rather


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47749:67"/>
to dye, than violate that bond which
is stronger than his irons: Very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
have by their example taught
us this lesson; to regard our fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
more than our life: Thus it should
be, and is, with those that are truly
Christian and ingenuous, under what
ever capacity; but in the case of
gracelesse and felonious persons,
Goalers have reason to looke to their
bolts and locks; knowing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the old rule of wise <hi>Thales)</hi>
that he who hath not stuck at one vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
will easily swallow another;
perjury will easily downe with him,
that hath made no bones of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But where the case is entire, no man
can blame a captive if he would bee
free; and if hee may untie the knot
of a cord wherewith he was bound;
why may he not unriver, or grate an

much as hee is not bound to yeild,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47749:68"/>
or continue a consent to his owne du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
This charge lies upon the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

                  <p>AN Oath, as it is a sacred thing,
so it must bee no otherwise than
holily used; whether on the part of
the giver, or taker; and therefore may
neither be rashly uttered, nor unduly
tendered upon sleight, or unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

here with a promissory oath, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
whereof is for another inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
It is the assertory oath that is
now under our hand; which the great,
God by whom we sweare, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be an end of controversies;

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47749:69"/>
must needs be held most fitly decisive
the only scruples are wont to be made
in causes criminall.</p>
                  <p>1. Wherein surely we may lay this
undoubted ground, that no man is
to be proceeded against without an
accuser, and that accusation must be
made good by lawfull witnesses: A
Judge may not cast any man upon
the plea of his owne ey-sight: should
this liberry be granted, Innocence
might suffer, and Malice triumph:
Neither may any man be condemned
upon hear-say; which how common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false it is, daily experience suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evinceth.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, men are apt
enough to connive at each others wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse;
and every man is loath to be
an Informer, whether out of the envy
of the office, or out of the conscience
of his owne obnoxiousnesse.</p>
                  <p>And yet thirdly, it is requisite that
care should bee taken, and all due


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47749:70"/>
meanes used by authority, that the
world may not be over-run with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse;
but that vice may be found
out, repressed, punished.</p>
                  <p>There cannot, fourthly, be devised
a fairer, and more probable course
for the effecting hereof, than by the
discovery upon oaths of the Officers
and Jurors in Assizes, and Sessions;
and of Churchwardens, and Sidemen
in Visitations.</p>
                  <p>The ground of all presentments to,
or by these men must be either their
owne knowledge, or publique fame,
or an avowed information. Any of
these gives a lawful hint to the Judge,
whether Ecclesiasticall or Civill, to
take sull triall of the cause and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge is alwayes certain, but
fame is often a lyar; and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
idle rumour must not be straight
taken upon trust; the inconvenience
and injury whereof I have often


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47749:70"/>
seene; when some malicious person,
desiring to doe a despight to an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Neighbour, raises a causelesse
slander against him, whispers it to
some dis-affected Gossips, this flies
to the eare of an Apparitor; hee
straight runs to the Office, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
a publique fame; the honest
man is called into the Court; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is blurred in being but sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned;
and after all his trouble and
disgrace hath his amends in his own
hands.</p>
                  <p>The rule of some Casuists, that ten
tongues make a fame, is groundlesse
and insufficient; neither is the number
so much to be regarded as the quality
of the persons.</p>
                  <p>If a whole pack of debauched
companions shall conspire to staine
the good name of an innocent (as we
have too often knowne) it were a
shamefull injustice to allow them the
Authors of a fame: the more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47749:71"/>
Doctors have defined a publique
fame by the voice of the greater part
of that Community, wherein it is
spread, whether Towne, Parish, City:
and therein of those that are discreet,
honest, well-behaved. We are wont
to say, Where there is much smoake,
there is likely some fire: an universall
report from such mouthes therefore,
may well give occasion to a further
inquiry. If any mans zeale against
vice will make it a matter of instance,
the case is cleare, and the proceeding
unquestionable; But if it be matter of
meere office, the carriage of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
may bee liable to doubt; Herein
it is meet such course be taken, as that
neither a notorious evill may be smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
nor yet innocence injured:
To which purpose the most confident
reporter may be called upon (because
fame hath too many tongues to speak
at once) to lay forth the grounds of
that his whispered crimination; and


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47749:71"/>
if the Circumstances appeare preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and the Suspicions strong, I see
not why the Ecclesiasticall Judge (for
with him onely in this case I professe
to meddle) may not convent the
person accused, lay before him the
crime which is secretly charged upon
him; and either upon his ingenuous
confession, enjoyn him such satisfction
to the scandalized Corgregation
as may be most fit, or upon his deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
urge him to cleare himselfe by
lawfull witnesses, of the crime obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
Or why he may not, if hee see
further cause, appoint a discreet and
able prosecutor to follow the business
in a legall way; upon whom the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if he be found guiltless, may right
himselfe.</p>
                  <p>But all this while, I finde no just
place for an oath to be administred
to a man for his owne accusation;
which certainly, is altogether both
illegall and unreasonable; If a man


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47749:72"/>
will voluntarily offer to cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by an Oath, out of the assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his owne innocence, he may
be allowed to be heard, but this may
neither be pressed to be done, nor yet
conclusive, when it is done; for both
every man is apt to be partiall in his
owne case, and he that durst act a
foule sin will dare to face it. It was
ever therefore lawfull (even when Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Inquisitions were at the
highest) for a man to refuse answer
to such questions upon oath, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
which tended to his owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment;
as unjustly, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
proposed: and it was but a
young determination of<note n="*" place="bottom">Silvestr. V. Correct. Dom. Sot. l. 5. de Jure, q. 4 Less. de Judice l. 2. c. 29.</note>

when he was onely a Batchelour, in
the Generall Chapter at <hi>Paris,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
by all the ancient Graduates
there, that when the crime is notori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous,
and the authour unknowne, the

secret offender is bound upon his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
charge and command, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Even the Spanish Casuists, the
great favourers and abettors of the
Inquisition, teach that the Judge may
not of himselfe begin an inquiry, but
must be led by something which may
open a way to his search, and as it
were force him to his proceeding,
<hi>ex officio,</hi> as publique notice, infamie,
common suspicion, complaint; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the whole processe is void in
law; although herein some of them
goe too far in favour of their great
<hi>Diana,</hi> that where the crime is known,
and the author unknowne, the Judge
may in a generality inquire of him
that did it, and if he have any private
information (though without any
publique fame foregoing) he may in
some cases, raise a particular inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the party, and call him to
defend himselfe; which course cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly,


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47749:73"/>
gives too much advantage
to private malice; and opens too
much way to the wronging of Inno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cence.
The faire way of proceedings
in all Christian Judicatures, should
be, by Accuser, Witnesse, and Judge,
in distinct persons openly knowne;
the Accuser complaines, the Witnesse
evinceth, the Judge sentences: The
one may not be the other; much lesse
all three: Were that to be allowed,
who could be innocent?</p>
                  <p>When a witnesse then is called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a man to death, whom he himself
certainly knows to be innocent.</head>
                  <p>THe question hath undergone
much agitation; The streame of
all ancient Divines, and Casuists runs
upon the affirmative; their ground
is, that the Judge, as he is a publique
person, so in the seat of Judicature,
he must exercise a publique autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and therefore waving his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
knowledge and interest, must
sentence according to the allegations
and proofes brought before him;
since he is a Judge of the cause, not
of the law; whereof he is to be the
servant, not the master: There he
sits not to speake his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but to be the mouth of the
law, and the law commands him to


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47749:74"/>
judge according to the evidence; the
evidence therefore being cleare and
convictive, the doome can be no other
than condemnatory.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I can more marvell
at their judgement herein, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it; professing for the negative,
with some fewer and latter Authors,
upon these sure grounds.</p>
                  <p>It is an evident and undeniable law
of God which must be the rule of all
Judges; <hi>The innocent and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
slay thou not, Exod. 23. 7.</hi> This is
a Law neither to be avoided, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed
with: Accusations and false
witnesses cannot make a man other
than innocent; they may make him
to seeme so; in so much as those that
know not the cause exactly, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be mis-led to condemne him
in their judgments: But to the Judge,
whose eyes were witnesses of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
innocence, all the evidence in the
world cannot make him other than


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47749:74"/>
guiltlesse; so as that Judge shall be
guilty of blood, in slaying the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and righteous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the law of judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to allegations and proofs is a
good generall direction in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course of proceedings; but there
are cases wherein this law must vaile
to an higher, which is the law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
Woe be to that man who
shall tye himselfe so close to the letter
of the law, as to make shipwrack of
conscience; And that bird in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
will tell him, that if upon what
ever pretences, he shall willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
an innocent, he is no better
than a murtherer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is not the bare letter of
the law that wise men should stand
upon, but the drift and intention of
the law; of that, we may in some
sense say as the Apostle did of an
higher law, <hi>The letter killeth.</hi> Now
every reasonable man knowes that the


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47749:75"/>
intention of the law, is to save and
protect the innocent; to punish one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the guilty: The Judge therefore
shall be a perverter of law, if, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his knowledge, he shall follow
the letter against the intention, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
an Innocent.</p>
                  <p>Let no man now tell me, that it is
the law that condemnes the man, and
not the Judge; This excuse will not
serve before the Tribunall of heaven;
The law hath no tongue; It is the
Judge that is <hi>lex loquens;</hi> If he then
shall pronounce that sentence which
his owne heart tells him is unjust and
cruell, what is he but an officious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of injustice? But, indeed, what
law ever said, Thou shalt kill that man
whom thou knowest innocent, if false
witnesse will sweare him guilty? This
is but a false glosse set upon a true
text, to countenance a man in being
an instrument of evill.</p>
                  <p>What then is in this case to be


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47749:75"/>
done? Surely, as I durst not acquit
that Judge, who under what ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of law should cast away a known
Innocent, so I durst not advise against
plaine evidences and flat dispositions,
upon private knowledge, that man to
be openly pronounced guiltlesse; and
thereby discharged; for as the one is
a grosse violation of justice; so were
the other a publique affront to the
law; and of dangerous consequence
to the weale-publique: Certainly, it
could not but be extreamely unsafe,
that such a gappe should bee opened
to the liberty of judgement, that a
private brest should be opposed (with
an apparent prevalence) against pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
convictions: our Casuists have
beaten their braines to finde out some
such evasions as might save the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
from death, and the Judge from
blood-guiltinesse: Herein therefore
they advise the Judge to use some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
meanes to stop the accusation,


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47749:76"/>
or indictmenr; (a course that might
be as prejudiciall to justice, as a false

as in <hi>Susanna</hi>'s case, and by many
subtile interrogations of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to finde their variance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
If that prevaile not, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi>
goes so farre, as to determine it
meet (which how it might stand with
their law, he knowes, with ours it
would not) that the Judge should be
fore all the people give his oath, that
hee knowes the party guiltlesse; as
whom he himselfe saw at that very

wherein the fact is pretended to bee
done: Yea<note n="*" place="bottom">Dom. à Sot. de Jure, &amp;c. l. 5. qu. 4.</note>

be content (if it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

secretly be suffered to slip out of the

Others think it the best way, that the
Judge should put off the cause to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

Bench; and that himselfe
should (laying aside his scarlet) come
to the Bar, and as a witnesse avow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oath the innocence of the party,
and the falsity of the accusation: Or
lastly, if he should out of malice, or
some other sinister ends (as of the

by higher powers to passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

                  <p>In the main cause of life and death,

when the question is of matters civill,

at his flying off; in these where
in the businesse is but pecuniary, or
banishment, or losse of an office, he
holds it lawfull for the Judge, (after
he hath used all meanes to discover

prevailes not) to passe sentence upon

which himselfe knowes to be unjust.</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47749:77"/>

as the opinion;<note n="*" place="bottom">Less. de Jure, &amp;c. l 2. de Judice Dub. 10. <hi>Quia resp. habeat authoritatem disponendi, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> For, saith hee, the
Common-wealth hath authority to
dispose of the estates of the Subjects,
and to translate them from one man
to another, as may be found most
availing to the publique good; and
here there appeares just cause so to
doe, lest the forme of publique judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should be perverted, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great scandall to the people; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any way possible to help
this particular mans inconvenience
and losse; therefore the Common-wealth
may ordaine that in such a case
the Judge should follow the publique
forme of Judicature, though hereby
it falleth out that a guiltlesse man is
undone in his fortunes; and yet his
cause knowne to be good by him that
condemnes it. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>But what a loose point is this?


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47749:78"/>
why hath not a man as true propriety
in his estate as his life? or what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
hath the Common-wealth,
causelesly to take away a mans sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or inheritance (being that he is
the rightfull owner) more than a piece
of himselfe? When his patrimony
is setled upon him, and his in a due
course of law and undoubted right of
possession, what just power can claime
any such interest in it, as without any
ground of offence to dispossess him?
Or what necessity is there that the
forme of publique judgements should
be perverted, unlesse an honest defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
must be undone by false sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?
Or rather is not the forme of
publique judgement perverted, when
innocence suffers for the maintenance
of a formality? Or how is the Judge
other than a partner in the injury, if
for want of his seasonable interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a good cause is lost, and a false
plea prevailes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47749:78"/>
That therefore, which in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place he alledgeth, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
can have no reason to complaine
of the Judge, for as much as it is out
of his power to remedy the case, and
to passe other sentence than is chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth by the rule of Law; might
as well be alledged against him in the
plea of life and death, wherein he will
by no meanes allow the Judge this
liberty of an undue commendation;
neither is there any just pretence, why
an honest and well-minded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judge
should be so sparing in a case of life,
and so too prodigall in matter of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
                  <p>As for this third reason, that the
mis-judgement in case of a pecuniary
damage or banishment, may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
capable of being reversed, and
upon a new Traverse the cause may
be fercht about at further leisure;
whereas death once inflicted is past
all power of revocation; It may well


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47749:79"/>
inferre that therefore there should bee
so much more deliberation, and care
had in passing sentence upon capitall
matters, than civill, by how much
life is more prcious, and irrevocable,
than our worldly substance; but it
can never inferre that injustice should
bee tolerable in the one, not in the
other. Justice had wont to be painted
blind-fold, with a paire of scales in
her hand; wherefore else, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that he, who would judge aright,
must not look upon the issue or event,
but must weigh impartially the true
state of the cause in all the grounds,
and circumstances thereof, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
accordingly? To say then that
a Judge may passe a doome formally
legall, but materially unjust, because
the case upon a new suit may be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
were no other than to say, I may
lawfully wound a man, because I
know how to heale him againe.</p>
                  <p>Shortly therefore, whether it be in


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47749:79"/>
causes criminall, or civill, whether
concerning life or estate, let those
who sit in the seat of Judicature, as
they will answer it before the great
Judge of the World, resolve (what
event soever follow) to judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgement, not justifying the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
not condemning the innocent;
both which are equally abominable
in the sight of the Almighty.</p>

Saints on earth are the brethren of

                  <p>Accusation therefore is either volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
or urged upon you by the
charge of a superiour. Voluntary is
either such as you are moved unto
by the Conscience of some hainous
and notorious crime committed, or
to be committed by another, to the
great dishonour of God, or danger of
the common peace, whereto you are
privy: or such as whereunto you are
tyed by some former engagemeut of
vow, or oath: In the former kinde;


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47749:80"/>
a worthy Divine in our time travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the way, sees a leud man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

to the next Justice, accuses the

upon so reverend (though single) testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
found guilty.</p>
                  <p>Or, if in the case of a crime inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
you have secret, but sure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that a bloudy villaine hath
plotted a treason against the sacred
person of your Soveraigne, or a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your honest neighbour; which
hee resolves to execute; should you
keep this fire in your bosome, it might
justly burn you. Whether it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the discovery of some horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
crime done, or for the prevention
of some great mischief to be done, you
must either be an accuser, or an acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:47749:81"/>
The obligation to accuse is yet
stronger, where your former vow or
oath hath fore-ingaged you to a just
discovery; you have sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and defend his Majesty's royall
Person, State, Dignity; and to make
knowne those that wilfully impugne
it; if now, you shall keep the secret
counsels of such wicked designments,
as you shall know to be against any
of these, how can you escape to bee
involved in a treason, lined with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury?</p>
                  <p>These are accusations which your
conscience will fetch from you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked?
But if being called before
lawfull authority, you shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon oath, to testifie your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
even concerning offenders, of
an inferiour nature; you may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
your witnesse, though it amount
to no lesse than an Accusation. Yet
there are cases, wherein a Testimony
thus required, tending to an accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47749:81"/>
may be refused; As in case of
duty, and nearenesse of naturall, or

unjust for a man to be pressed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations,
or required to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatory
testimonies in the case of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or children, or the partner of
his bed: Or if a man out of remorse
of conscience shall disclose a secret sin
to you formerly done, in a desire to
receive counsaile, and comfort from
you; you ought rather to endure your
soule to be fetcht out of your body,
than that seeret to bee drawn out of
your lips: Or if the question be illegal,
as those that tend directly to your
own prejudice; or those which are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
concerning hidden offences, not
before notified by publique fame, or
any lawfull ground of injury, which
therefore the Judge hath no power to
ask; In these cases, if no more, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
of an accusation, though requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is no other than justifiable.</p>

But where neither the conscience of
the horridnesse of a crime done; nor
prevention of a crime intended, nor
duty of obedience to a lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
nor the bond of an inviolable
pre-ingagement, call you to the Bar;
It is not a more uncharitable, than

of the fact, yet to plead Not
guilty to the Indictment at the Barre:
for as much as he doth therein, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the sense both of the Judge,

that Truth; the finding out, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
whereof, lyes upon their further

pleading <hi>Not guilty,</hi> in effect as good

can make me: let Justice passe upon

construed is lawfull, and just; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
not the shuffling equivocations of
the offendor, but the upright verdict
of a legall Jury must carry the cause:
to which purpose, that which sounds
as a deniall in the accused, is nothing
else but a professed referring himselfe
to a juridicall triall of that fact, which
he is not bound to confesse.</p>
                  <p>But when the hand of God hath
once found out the man in his sin; and
he finds himselfe legally convinced of
his crime; it greatly behoves him (as

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47749:85"/>
than he was close, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in his plea: wherein as he shall
discharge his conscience to that great
and holy God, whom he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
so he shall thus tender some kind
of poore satisfaction to that Society
of men, whom hee hath scandalized

must first be tendered even to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
enemies, before any acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
shall be exercised; where this
which is the worst of all remedies,
proves needfull, if you ask how farre
it is lawfull to ingage; I must aske
you, (ere I can returne answer) first
of the justice of the quarrell: for
surely where the warre is knowne to
be unjust, the willing abettors of it
cannot wash their hands from blood:
To make a warre just (as our Casuists
rightly) there must bee a lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to raise it; a just ground
whereon to raise it; due formes and
conditions in the raising, managing,
and cessation of it: That no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lesse than supreame can wage a
warre, it is cleare in nature; for that
none other besides it can have power


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47749:87"/>
of life and death; which both must
lye at the publique stake in warre.</p>
                  <p>That none but a just and weighty
cause can be the ground of a warre,
every mans reason apprehends; for
how precious a blessing had that need
to bee, that is held worth the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with the price of so much bloud;
and how heavy a curse must that
needes bee, which can onely be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
or prevented by so grievous a
judgement as war?</p>
                  <p>That due termes and conditions
are requisite to bee offered ere warre
be undertaken; and observed in the
managing and ceasing of it, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self teacheth us; without which
men should run upon one another
with no lesse fury and disorder than
beasts; not staying for any capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but the first advantage; nor termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
their discord in any thing but
utter destruction.</p>
                  <p>Where all or any of these are wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting,


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47749:88"/>
the warre cannot be just: and
where it is known not to be such, woe
be to those hands that are willingly
active in prosecuting it.</p>
                  <p>Now the care of all these three
maine requisites must lie chiefly upon
that Power, which is entrusted by the
Almighty, with the over-ruling of
publique affaires: For the Subject, as
he is bound to an implicite reliance
upon the command of the supreame
power; so (unlesse it be in a case no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
apparent to be unjust) must
yeild a blind-fold obedience to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
going whither he is led, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he is bidden; But if the case
be such, as that his heart is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the injustice of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
and that he clearly finds that he
is charged to smite Innocence, and to
him, against God; I cannot blame
fight, if with <hi>Sauls</hi> footmen (when
they were commanded to fall upon
the Priests of the Lord) he withhold


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47749:88"/>
his hand, and craving pardon, shew
lesse readinesse to act, than to suffer.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, I must aske
you with what intentions you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
your selfe to the field; if it be
out of the conscience of maintaining
a just cause, if out of a loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to lawfull authority: I shall bid
you go on, and prosper: but if either
malice to the parties opposed, and
therein desire of revenge, or a base
covetousnesse of pay, or hope and
desire of plunder have put you into
armes; repent and withdraw: For
what can be more sordid or cruell,
than to be hired for dayes-wages to
shed innocent blood? Or what can
bee more horribly mischievous for
a Man, than to kill, that hee may
steale?</p>
                  <p>Upon your answer to these questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it will be easie for mee to returne
mine; In a just quarrell, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lawfully called, you may fight;


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47749:89"/>
warrantable authority hath put the
sword into your hand; you may use
it. But take heed that you use it with
that moderation, and with those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that are meet: Even an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
hand may offend in striking;
Magistrates themselves, if there be
revenge in their executions, doe no
other than murder: Far be it from
you to take pleasure in bloud; and to
enjoy another mans destruction: If
(especially in those warres that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine)
you shall mingle your teares
with the blood, which you are forced
to spill, it may well become Christian
fortitude.</p>
                  <p>Shortly; doe you enter into your
armes, imprest, or voluntary? If the
former, you have nothing but your
owne heart to looke unto for a fit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
That Power, whom you
justly obey, must answer for the
cause; If the latter, you have reason
diligently to examine all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47749:89"/>
points, of the power, of the cause,
of your intentions: as well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that in a warre it is no lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that both sides should be in
the right, than that in a contradiction
both parts should be true: Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your will makes it selfe the Judg
of all three; and (if any of them faile)
leaves you answerable for all miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
so as you had need to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inquisitive, in this case, upon
what grounds you goe; that so (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
may befall) a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may beare you out in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
difficulties, and saddest events
that are wont to attend upon warre.</p>

                  <p>For if a man may not kill another,

To will or attempt this is highly
injurious to that God, whose we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are; who hath committed our life
as a most precious thing to our trust,
for his use, more than our owne; and
will require from us an account of
our managing of it, and our parting
from it. It is a foule misprision in
those men, that make account of
themselves as their owne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they are the absolute Lords
of their life: Did they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
their owne being? had they
nothing but meere nature in them?
can they but acknowledge an higher
hand in their formation, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
What a wrong were it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the great Lord and giver of
life, to steale out of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his leave that placed us there?
But much more if Christians, they
know themselves, besides, dearly
paid for; and therefore not in their
own disposing, but in his that bought


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47749:91"/>
them. Secondly, most desperately
injurious to our selves, as incurring
thereby a certaine damnation (for
ought appeares to lookers on) for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
of those soules which have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
broken Gods more easie, and
temporary prison, to put themselves
upon the direfull prison of Satan to all
eternity.</p>
                  <p>Nature it selfe, though not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
with the knowledge, of the
estate of another world, found cause
to abhor this practice: However the
Stoicall Philosophers, and some high
Roman spirits following their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
have beene liberall of their
lives; the <hi>Thebans</hi> of old professed
detestation of this worst of prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
And the <hi>Athenians</hi> enacted
that the hand, which should be guilty
of such an act, should be cut off, and
kept unburied; And it was wisely
ordained by that Grecian Common-wealth,
when their Virgins (out of a


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47749:91"/>
peevish discontentment) were growne
into a selfe-killing humour, that the
bodies of such offenders should bee
dragged naked though the streets of
the City; the shame whereof stopped
the course of that mad resolution.</p>
                  <p>It is not the heaviest of crosses, or
the sharpest bodily anguish that can
warrant so foule an act. Well was it
turned off by <hi>Antisthenes</hi> of old,
when in the extremity of his paine he
cried out, Oh who will free me from
this torment! and <hi>Diognes</hi> reached
him a poynard, wherewith to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
himselfe: Nay, said hee, I
said, from my torment, not from my
life: as well knowing it neither safe,
nor easie, to part with our selves upon
such termes.</p>
                  <p>Farre, farre be it from us to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this ranke and file those worthy
Martyrs, which in the fervour of their
holy zeale have put themselves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to martyrdome; and have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47749:92"/>
prevented the lust and fury
of Tyrants, to keep their chastity, and
faith inviolable. I looke upon these
as more fit objects of wonder, than
either of censure, or imitation. For
these (whom wee may well match
with <hi>Sampson,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar)</hi> what
Gods spirit wrought in them, hee
knowes that gave it; Rules are they
by which we live, not examples.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, However wee may not
by any meanes directly act to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the thred of life; yet I cannot
but yeild with learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Less. de Jure l. 2. c. 9. dub. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Lessius,</hi> that
there may fall out cases, wherein a
man may (upon just cause) doe, or
forbeare something whereupon death
may indirectly ensue: Indirectly, I
say, not with an intention of such
issue: for it is not an universall charge
of God, that no man should upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occasion expose his life to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
danger; if so, there would be


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47749:92"/>
no warre, no traffique; but onely that
he should not causelesly hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
nor with a resolution of wilfull
miscarriage.</p>
                  <p>To those instances hee gives of a
souldier that must keep his station,
though it cost him life: of a prisoner
that may forbeare to flee out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
though the doores be open: of a
man condemn'd to dye by hunger,
in whose power it is to refuse a suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
offered: of a man that latches
the weapon in his owne body to save
his Prince: or of a friend, who when
but one loafe is left to preserve the
life of two, refraines from his part
and dyes first: or that suffers another
to take that planke in a shipwrack,
which himselfe might have prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
as trusting to the oares of his
armes: or that puts himselfe into an
infected house out of meer charity to
tend the sick, though hee know the
contagion deadly; or in a Sea-fight


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47749:93"/>
blows up the deck with gun-powder,
not without his own danger; or when
the house is on fire, casts himselfe out
at the window with an extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard:
To these, I say, may be added
many more; as the cutting off a limb
to stop the course of a Gangreene; to
make an adventure of a dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
in the body, to draw forth the
stone in the bladde; the taking of a
large dose of opiate pills, to ease a
mortall extremity; or lastly, when a
man is already seized on by death, the
receiving of some such powerfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
as may facilitate his passage
(the defect of which care and art, the
eminently-learned Lord<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Verulam</hi>

In these, and the like cases, a man
may lawfully doe these things which
may tend, in the event to his owne
death, though without an intention of
procuring it.</p>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:47749:93"/>
And unto this head must bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
those infinite examples of deadly
sufferings for good causes, willingly
embraced for conscience sake. The
seven Brethren in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
to by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Hebrewes,
Heb. 11. 35.)</hi> will and must rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the butchering of their owne
flesh, than the eating of Swines flesh,
in a willing affront of their Law: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
will rather dye than not pray.
<hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi>
will rather fall downe bound into the
fiery Fornace seven-fold heated, than
fall down before the golden Image.</p>
                  <p>And every right-disposed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
will rather welcome death than
yeild to a willing act of Idolatry, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
Witchcraft: If hereupon death
follow by the infliction of others, they
are sinfull agents, hee is an innocent
sufferer.</p>
                  <p>As for that scruple among our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists,
whether a man condemned to


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47749:94"/>
dye by poyson, may take the deadly
draught that is brought him; it is
such, as wise <hi>Socrates</hi> never made of
old, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> tendred
him his hemlock; and indeede it may
as well be disputed, whether a man
condemned to dye by the Axe, may
quietly lay downe his head upon the
Block; and not, but upon force,
yeild to that fatall stroke. A juster
scruple is, whether a man condemned
to a certaine and painefull death,
which hee cannot possibly eschew;
may make choice rather of a more
easie passage out of the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I marvell at the indulgence of
some Doctors, that would either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
or mince the matter. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I cannot blame that naturall
disposition in any creature, to shrinke
from pain, and to affect (what it may)
the shifting from extremity of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
yet for a Christian so to doe it,
as to draw a greater mischief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47749:94"/>
and an apparent danger to his
soule, it cannot justly beare any other
than a hard construction. For thus
to carve himselfe of Justice, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
to violate lawfull authority; and
whiles he would avoid a short pain, to
incur the shame and sin of a selfe-exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>
                  <p>But if in that way, wherein the
doome of death is passed, a man can
give himselfe ease, or speed of dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as when a Martyr being adjudg'd
to the fire, use the helpe of a bagge of
Gun-powder, to expedite his passage)
it cannot be any way judged unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
The sentence is obeyed, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is accordingly done; and, if the
patient have found a shorter way to
that end which is appointed him,
what offence can this be either to the
Law, or to the Judge?</p>

the boldnesse of those men, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing

of evill spirits by an imperious
way of command; having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her Exorcists a power of Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
to which the worst of Devils
must be subject; a power more easily
arrogated, than really exercised: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
this over-ruling authority was
eminently conspicuous, not onely in
the selected twelve, and the seventy
Disciples of Christ, who returned
from their Embassie with joy, <hi>(Luk.

to them through his name, but even in
their holy Successors of the Primitive
Church, whiles the miraculous gifts
of the holy Ghost were sensibly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of all diseases? to the treading on
serpents and scorpions? to the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and if they must needs acknowledge
these faculties above their reach, why
doe they presume to divide the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
from it selfe; arrogating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the power of the greatest
workes, whiles they are professedly
defective in the least? wherein surely,

                  <p>But what doe I trouble you with
these dreadfull incantations, whereof
the allowed bookes of Conjuration
are full? To these I may adde their
application of holy water, (wherein
they place not a little confidence)
which (saith <hi>Lessius)</hi> receives the
force from the prayers of the Church,
by the meanes whereof it comes to


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47749:101"/>
passe, that it is assisted with divine
power; which (as it were) rests upon
it, and joynes with it, to the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of all the infestations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
But faine would I learne where
the Church hath any warrant from
God to make any such suit; where
any overture of promise to have it
granted? what is their prayer with
out faith? and what is their faith
without a word? But I leave these
men (together with their Crosses,
and Ceremonies, and holy reliques,
wherein they put great trust in these
cases) to their better informed
thoughts. God open their eyes that
they may see their errors.</p>
                  <p>For us, what our demeanour should
be in case of the appearance, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation
of evill spirits, we cannot
desire a better patterne than S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
his example is our all-sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<hi>2 Cor. 12. 7, 8.</hi> who when
the messenger of Satan was sent to


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47749:101"/>
buffet him, fell presently to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and instantly besought God
thrice, that it might depart from
him. Lo he that could command e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
spirits out of the bodily possession
of others; when it comes to his own
turne to be buffeted by them, betakes
himselfe to his prayers to that God,
whose grace was sufficient for him:
<hi>Verse 9.</hi> To them must we still have
our recourse; if wee thus resist the
Devil he shall flee from us: <hi>Iam. 4. 7.</hi>
In the Primitive times, those that
could command, needed not to sue: &amp;
therefore fasting and prayers, was an
higher (as a more laborious) work (to
this purpose) in the Disciples, than
their imperative course of ejection;
but for us, we that have no power to
bid, must pray; Pray, not to those
ill guests that they would depart; not
to the blessed Virgin, or our Angel-Keeper
that they would gard us from
them, but to the great God of heaven,


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47749:102"/>
who commands them to their chains:
This is a sure and everlasting remedy,
this is the onely certaine way to
their foile, and our deliverance, and
victory.</p>

                  <p>IT is a question of exceeding great
use, and necessity, for certainly
many thousands of honest, and well-minded
Christians are in this kinde
drawne into the snares of Satan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily,

determining of it, these two grounds
must be laid; First, that there is a

direct and open, wherein Magicians
and Witches, upon wofull conditions


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47749:102"/>
and direfull ceremonies, enter into
a mutuall covenant with evill spirits:
The other, secret and indirect, where
in nothing is seen, or heard, or known
to be agreed upon; onely by a close

to be done, which is invisibly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded

                  <p>The second ground is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

be wrought either by good or evill
spirits: That it cannot bee supposed
that good Angels should bee at the
command of ignorant, or vicious
persons, of either sexe, to concurre
with them in superstitious acts, done
by meanes altogether in themselves
ineffectable and unwarrantable: and
therefore that the Devill hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
hand in these effects, which hee
marvailously brings about, for the
winning of credit with the world, and
for the obliging and engaging of his

upon the use and practise of such
meanes; which indeed cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed:

                  <p>2. That there may be hidden cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in nature for the producing of
such effects, which they know not;
neither can give any reason of their
operations, whereof yet we doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make use, without any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and why may not these be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
under the same head? which they
have used with no other but good
meaning, without the least intention
of reference to any malignant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
In answer whereto, I must tell
them, that their best plea is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which may abate the sinne, but
not excuse it: There are indeed, deep
secrets in nature, whose bottome we
cannot dive into, as those wonders
of the load-stone; a piece outwardly


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47749:106"/>
contemptible, yet of such force as
approacheth neare to a miracle: and
many other strange sympathies and
antipathies in severall creatures; in
which ranke may be set the bleeding
of the dead at the presence of the
murtherer: and some acts done for
the discovery of witchcraft both in
this, and our neighbor kingdome; But
withall, though there be secrets in
nature which we know not how she
works; yet we know there are works
which are well knowne, that she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe: how far her power can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
is not hard to determine: and
those effects which are beyond this,
(as in the forementioned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars)
we know whither to ascribe:
Let it be therefore the care and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christians to looke upon
what grounds they goe: whiles they
have God, and nature for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
they may walke safely; but
where these leave them, the way

                  <p>It is fit for every honest man to
seeme as he is; what do you howling
amongst Wolves, if you be not one?
Or what do you amongst the Cranes,
if you be a Stork: It was the charge
of <hi>Jehu,</hi> when he pretended that great

that there be here with you none of

you have a minde to keepe your selfe


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47749:109"/>
in a safe condition for your soule, let
me lay upon you the charge which
<hi>Moses</hi> enforced upon the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Israel</hi> in the case of <hi>Corah</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
<hi>Depart I pray you from the

of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all
their sins.</hi> Numb. 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>The latter I must answer affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:
If the Ordinances be holy,
why should you not take your part of
them?</p>
                  <p>It is an unjust nicenesse to abridge
your selfe of a blessing, for another
mans unworthinesse: Doubtless, there
ought to be a separation of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from the vile; the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the great sinne of those, whom in
duty it concernes to perform it; but
where this is not accordingly done,
shall I suffer for anothers offence?
my owne sinnes may justly keepe me
off from Gods Table; if another
mans may doe so too, I appropriate


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47749:109"/>
the guilt of his sin to my own wrong:
surely it argues but small appetite to
these heavenly viandes, if you can
be put off with a pretence of others
faults: Judge of the spirituall repast
by this earthly; were you throughly
hungry, would you refraine from
your meat because one of the guests
hath a paire of foule hands? that may
be a just eye-sore to you, but no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why you should forbeare whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
dishes: Carve you for your
selfe, and looke to your owne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
he feedes for himselfe, not for
you; sinne is the uncleannesse of the
soule, that cleaves closer to it, than
any outward nastinesse can to the
skin; to feed thus foule then is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
unwholesome, to himselfe, it can
be no hurt to you. But you are ready
to straine the comparison higher to
your owne advantage: say, that one
of the guests hath a plague-fore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon him, shall I then thinke it


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47749:110"/>
safe to sit at the Table with him?
now sin is of a pestilent nature, sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
its infection to others besides its
owne subject; therefore it is meet
we keepe aloofe from the danger of
his contagion: True, there are sinnes
of a contagious nature, apt to diffuse
their venome to others, (as there are
other some whose evill is intrinsecall
to the owner) but these infect by way
of evill counsails, or examples, or
familiar conversation, not by way of
a meere extemporary presence of the
person, by spreading of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
to those that are taken with
them; not by scattering abroad any
guilt to those that abhorr them. Well
did our Saviour know how deadly an
infection had seised on the soule of
<hi>Judas,</hi> yet he drives him not from his
board, lest his sinne should taint the
Disciples.</p>
                  <p>The spirit that writes to the seven
<hi>Asian</hi> Churches <hi>(Rev. 2. 20, 21, 22.)</hi>


                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:47749:110"/>
saw and professed to see the horrible
infection spread amongst the <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tirians</hi>
by the doctrine and wicked
practises of their <hi>Jesebell,</hi> yet all that
he enjoyns the godly party is to hold
their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Have no fellowship,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>with the unfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
(Eph. 5. 11.)</hi> Loe he would not
have us partake in evill: he doth not
forbid us to partake with an evil man
in good works.</p>
                  <p>However therefore we are to wish
and endeavour (in our places) that all
the Congregation may be holy; and
it is a comfortable thing to joyn with
those, that are truly conscionable, and
carefully observant of their wayes, in
the immediate services of our God:
yet where there is neglect in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,
and boldnesse in the intruders,
and thereupon, Gods sacred Table is
pestred with some unworthy Guests;
it is not for you, upon this ground,


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47749:111"/>
to deprive your selfe of the benefit of
Gods blessed Ordinances; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

they may be made; how farre they

they may be capable of release.</head>
                  <p>IT is a wrongfull imputation that
is cast upon us by the Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
that we abandone all vowes
under the Gospell: They well see
that we allow and professe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vow (as <hi>Lessius</hi> termes it) in
Baptisme; which yet both <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and he, with other of their con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sorts,
deny to be properly such: It is
true, that as infants make it by their


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47749:111"/>
proxies, there may seeme some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of the engagement as to
their persons; but if the party Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
be of mature age, the expresse
vow is made absolutely by, and for
himselfe. Besides this, we allow of
the renovation of all those holy
vowes, (relating to the first) which
may binde us to a more strict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our God, yet more, though
we doe not now allow the vowes of
things in their nature indiffernt, to
be parts of Gods worship, (as they
were formerly under the law) yet we
doe willingly approve of them, as
good helps and furtherances to us,
for the avoiding of such sinnes as we
are obnoxious unto; and for the
better forwarding of our holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the charge is of eternall use,
Psal. 76. 11. <hi>Vow unto God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it:</hi> Not that we are bound to
vow; that act is free and voluntary:


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47749:112"/>
but that when we have vowed, we
are straitly bound to performance:
It is with us for our vowes as it was
with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their
substance. Whiles it remained (saith
S. <hi>Peter)</hi> was it not thine own? <hi>(Acts
5. 4.)</hi> Hee needed not to sell it, he
needed not to give it; but if he will
give, he may not reserve: If he profess
to give all, it is death to save some;
he lies to the holy Ghost, that defalks
from that which he engaged himselfe
to bestow.</p>
                  <p>It mainly concernes us therefore to
looke carefully in the first place, to
what we vow, and to our intentions
in vowing, and to see that our vow
be not rash and unadvised, of things
either triviall, or unlawfull, or impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or out of our power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;
for every Vow is a Promise
made to God; and to promise unto
that great and holy God, that which
either we cannot, or ought not to doe,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47749:112"/>
what is it other than to mock and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
that Sacred Majesty, which will
not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his
name in vaine? It is the charge to
this purpose of wise <hi>Solomon, Be not
rash with thy mouth, and let not thine
heart be hasty to utter any thing before
God, for God is in heaven, and thou up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi>
Eccles. 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>Your vow therefore must be either
of things morally good, for the
quickening you in that duty which
you are bound to doe: or of things
indifferent in themselves, the refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or doing whereof, may tend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the restraint from sinne, or the
furtherance of your holy obedience:
As a man that findes his brains weak,
and his inclination too strong to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
liquor, bindes himselfe by a vow
to drinke no wine save onely at Gods
Table: or a man that findes himselfe
apt to be miscarryed by his appetite,


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47749:113"/>
confines himselfe by his vow to one
dish, or to one meale for the day: or
a man that findes himself given to the
pleasure of gaming, to the losse of his
time, and the weakning of his estate,
curbes himselfe by his vow never to
play for money: or a man that findes
his prayers weak, and his flesh rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
vowes to tame his unruly desires,
and to stir up his duller devotions by
fasting.</p>
                  <p>And as the matter of your vow
must be carefully regarded; so also
your intentions in vowing; for if you
vow to doe good to an ill end, your
thanke is lost, and danger of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
incurred: as if you vow to
give almes for vaine-glory, or osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
or, if God shall prosper your
usurious, or monopolizing project,
you will build an hospitall; your vow
is like to be so accepted, as the story
tells us, the prayers were, of that bold
<hi>Curtizan,</hi> who coming to the shrine


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47749:113"/>
of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of<note n="*" place="bottom">Bromiard. sum. praedict.</note> 
                     <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as that
traitour was stiled) devoutly beg'd,
that through the intercession of that
Saint, she might be graced with so
winning a beauty, that might allure
her paramours to a gainfull courting
of so pleasing a Mistresse, when sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
(as my author tells me) she was
stricken blinde: and certainely, so it
might well be; for if a supposed Saint
were invoked, it was God that was
highly provoked by the sinfull peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a shamelesse harlot: and it
was most just for him to revenge it;
and so we may well expect it shall be
with whosoever shall dare to make
use of his sacred name to their owne
wicked or unwarrantable purposes.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore our vowes must be
for their matter (as Casuists well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine)
<hi>De meliore bono,</hi> and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
holy and directed onely to
good; it plainly appeares that many


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47749:114"/>
idle purposes, promises, resolutions,
are wont to passe with men for vows,
which have no just claime to that
holy title: One sayes he vowes never
to be friends with such a one that
hath highly abused him; another,
that he will never come under the
roofe of such an unkinde neighbour:
one that he will drinke so many
healths to his honoured friend; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he will not give the wall or
the way to any passenger: one that he
will never weare suit but of such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
another that he will never cut his
haire till such an event; These, and
such like may be foolish, unjust, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
selfe engagements, but vowes
they are not, neither therefore do bind
the conscience, otherwise than as
<hi>Sampsons</hi> cords, and withes, which
he may break as a thred of tow, <hi>Iudg.
16. 9. 12.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for true vowes, certainly
they are so binding, that you shall sin


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47749:114"/>
hainously in not performing them:
It is not better than dishonesty to fail
in what we have promised to men;
but to disappoint God in our vowes,
is no lesse than sacriledge: That of
<hi>Solomons</hi> is weighty, Eccles. 5. 4, 5, 6.
<hi>When thou vowest a vow unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
not to pay it, for he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in fooles; pay that which thou hast
vowed: Better it is that thou shouldst
not vow, than that thou shouldst vow
and not pay it: Suffer not thy mouth
to cause thy flesh to sin, neither say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Angel that it was an errour;
wherefore should God be angry at thy
vow, and destroy the worke of thine
hands?</hi> If therefore a lawfull and just
vow have passed your lips, you may
not be false to God, and your selfe in
not keeping it.</p>
                  <p>But if it shall so fall out, that there
proves to be some maine inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or impossibility in the fulfilling
of this your solemne promise unto


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47749:115"/>
God, whether through the extreme
prejudice of your health, and life, or
the over-swaying difficulty of the
times what is to be done; surely as
under the law <hi>(Numb. 30. 3, 4, 5.)</hi> it
was left in the power of the parent to
over-rule the vow of the childe, so I
doubt not but under the Gospel, it
is left in the power of your spirituall
fathers, to order, or dispense with
the performance of those vowes,
which you would, but cannot well
fulfill: neither was it spoken in vaine,
nor in matter of sins onely, which our
Saviour in way of authorization, said
to his Apostles and their successours,
<hi>Whatsoever ye shall binde on earth, shall
be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Mat. 18. 18</hi> In this case therefore,
I should advise you to make your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
to your spirituall pastor, and
freely to lay open your condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and humbly to submit


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47749:115"/>
your selfe to his fatherly directions
in that course, which shall be found
best and sasest for your soule: Think
it not safe in a businesse of so high
nature to relye upon your owne
judgment, and to carve out your own
satisfaction; but regard carefully
what God hath said of old, <hi>The priests
lippes should keep knowledge: and they
should seeke the law at his mouth: for
he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.</hi>

mark where there is no true merit of
such a reproach?</p>
                  <p>It much imports us therefore to
know who may be deservedly thus
stigmatized by us: I have elsewhere
somewhat largely insisted on this
theme; whither I might spare some
lines to referre you; But, in short,
thus: To let passe the originall sense,
and divers acceptions of the word,
An heresie is no other than an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
errour against the foundation;
All truths are precious, but some
withall necessary; All errours are


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47749:116"/>
faulty, but some damnable; the nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse
of the error is according to
the worth of the truth impugned;
There are Theologicall verities fit for
us to know and believe; there are
Articles of Christian faith needfull
to be known and believed; There
are truths of meet and decent super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure,
without which the fabrick
may stand; there are truths of the
foundation so essentiall, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them it cannot stand: It is a
maime to the house if but a tile be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off from the roofe, but if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be razed, the building is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown:
this is the endeavour and act
of heresie.</p>
                  <p>But now the next question will be,
what doctrines they are which must
be accounted to be of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Our countrey-man <hi>Fisher</hi> the
Jesuite, and his Associates wil tell you
roundly, that all those things, which
are defined by the Church to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47749:117"/>
are<note n="*" place="bottom">Relat. of the third confer. p. 6.</note> fundamentall: A large
ground-work of faith: Doubtlesse
the Church hath defined all things
contained in the scripture, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
and theirs (which they call
Catholick) hath defined all those
Traditionall points, which they have
added to the Creed, upon the same
necessity of salvation to be believed;
now if all these be the foundation,
which is the building? what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
fabrick doe they make of
Christian Religion; all foundation,
no walls, no roofe? Surely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
without too much absurdity, be
denied, that there is great difference
of Truthes, some more important
than others; which could not be, if
all were alike fundamentall: If there
were not some speciall Truthes, the
beliefe whereof makes, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
a Christian, the Authors of
the Creede Apostolick (besides the


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47749:117"/>
other Symboles received anciently
by the Church) were much deceived
in their aime: He therefore that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
the holy Scriptures (which
must be a principle presupposed) to
be inspired by God; and as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
of the chiefe particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
professeth to believe and embrace
the Articles of the Christian faith, to
regulate his life by the law of Gods
commandements, and his devotion
by the rule of Christ prescribed; and
lastly to acknowledge and receive the
Sacraments expresly instituted by
Christ; doubtlesse this man is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
a Christian, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to hold the foundation; and
whosoever shall wilfully impugne
any of these, comes within the verge
of Heresie: wilfully, I say, for meere
error makes not an heretick; if out of
simplicity, or grosse ignorance, a man
shall take upon him to maintaine a
contradiction to a point of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47749:118"/>
ready to relent upon better light,
he may not be thus branded: evicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and contumacy must improve his
error to be hereticall. The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> therefore hath beene too cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly-liberall
of her censures this way,
having bestow'd this livery upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousand Christians whom God
hath owned for his Saints: and upon
some Churches more Orthodoxe
than her selfe, presuming upon a
power (which was never granted her
from heaven) to state new articles of
faith, and to excommunicate and
barre all that shall dare to gainsay her
oracles: Whereas the great Doctor
of the Gentiles hath told us from the
spirit of God, that there is but <hi>one
Lord, one faith, one baptisme;</hi> (Ephes.
4. 5.) and what faith is that? S. <hi>Jude</hi>
tells us: <hi>Iude 3. The faith that was
once delivered the Saints;</hi> so that as
well may they make more reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Baptisme, and multiplicities


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47749:118"/>
of Lords, as more faiths than one:
some explications there may be of
that one faith, made by the Church,
upon occasion of new-sprung errours,
but such, as must have their grounds
from fore-written truths, and such, as
may not extend to the condemnation
of them whom God hath left free:
new articles of faith they may not be,
nor binde farther than God hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
them.</p>
                  <p>Hereticks then they are, and onely
they, that pertinaciously raze the
foundation of the Christian faith;
what now must be done with them?
surely, first, if they cannot be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they must be avoided: It is the
charge of the beloved Disciple to the
elect Lady, 2 <hi>John</hi> v. 10. <hi>If any man
come unto you and bring not</hi> (that is,
by an ordinary Hebraisme, opposes)
<hi>this doctrine, receive him not into your
houses, neither bidde him God speede;</hi>
But the Apostle of the Gentiles goes


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47749:119"/>
yet higher; sor writing to <hi>Titus</hi> the

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, when wee compare the
charge with the person, we cannot
but finde that this rejection, is not a
meer negative act, of refraining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but a positive act of censure,
so as he, who had power to admonish,
had also power to reject in an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative,
or judicatory way: He sayes

                  <head type="sub">Whether the lawes of men doe binde the
Conscience, and how far we are tyed
to their obedience.</head>
                  <p>BOth these extreames of opinion
concerning this point, must needs
bring much mischiefe upon Church
and Kingdome: Those that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
hold such a power in humane
lawes make themselves slaves to men:


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47749:120"/>
Those that deny any binding power
in them, run loose into all licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
Know then that there is a vast
difference betwixt these two; To bind
the conscience in any act, and to bind
a man in conscience to do or omit an
act: Humane laws cannot do the first
of them; the latter they may, and must
doe: To binde the conscience is to
make it guilty of a sin in doing an act
forbidden, or omitting an act injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as in it selfe such: or making
that act in it selfe an acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God, which is commanded by
men: Thus humane lawes cannot
bind the conscience: It is God onely,
<hi>1 John 3. 21.</hi> who, as he is greater
than the Conscience, so hath power
to binde or loose it: <hi>Esay 31. 22.</hi> It
is he that is the onely Law giver to
the Conscience: <hi>Jam. 4. 12.</hi> Princes
and Churches may make lawes for
the outward man; but they can no
more binde the heart, than they can


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47749:121"/>
make it; In vain is that power, which
is not inabled with coertion, now
what coertion can any humane power
claim of the heart, which it can never
attain to know? the spirit of man
therefore is subject onely to the father
of spirits, who onely sees and searches
the secrets of it, and can both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and punish it.</p>
                  <p>Besides, well did penitent <hi>David</hi>
know what he said, when he cryed
out, <hi>Against thee onely have I sinned:</hi>
Psal. 51. he knew that sinne is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the law, and that none but
Gods law can make a sin: men may be
concerned, and injured in our actions,
but it is God who hath forbidden
these wrongs to men, that is sinned
against, in our acts of injustice and
uncharitablenesse: and who only can
inflict the spirituall (which is the
highest) revenge upon offenders.
The charge of the great Doctor of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to his <hi>Galatians,</hi> was


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47749:121"/>
                     <hi>Galat. 5. 1. Stand fast in the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made us free,
and be not intangled againe in the yoak
of bondage.</hi> What yoak of bondage
was this, but the law of Ceremonies?
What liberty was this, but a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from the bondage of that law?
And certainly if those ordinances,
which had God for their author, have
so little power to bind the conscience,
as that the yoake of their bondage
must be shaken off, as inconsistent
with Christian liberty; how much less
is it to be indured, that we should be
the servants of men, in being tyed up
to sin by their presumptuous impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p>The lawes of men therefore doe
not, ought not, cannot bind your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as of themselves; but, if they
be just, they binde you in conscience
to obedience: They are the words
of the Apostle to his Romans, <hi>Rom.
13. 5. Wherefore ye must needes be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47749:122"/>
not onely for wrath, but also for
conscience sake.</hi> However then their
particular constitution in themselves
put no speciall obligation upon us,
under paine of sinne, and damnation;
yet in a generall relation to that God,
who hath commanded us to obey
authority, their neglect or contempt
involves us in a guilt of sin: All power
is of God, that which the supreme
authority therefore enjoyns you, God
enjoyns you by it, the charge is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
his, though passing through the
hands of men.</p>
                  <p>How little is this regarded, in these
loose times, by those lawlesse persons,
whose practises acknowledge no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
but titular, no obedience
but arbitrary, to whom the strongest
laws are as weapons to the <hi>Leviathan,
who esteemes Iron as straw, and Brass as
rotten wood,</hi> Job 41. 27.</p>
                  <p>Surely had they not first cast off
their obedience to him that is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47749:122"/>
than the highest, they could not
without trembling heare that weighty
charge of the great God of Heaven,
Rom. 13. 1. <hi>Let every soule be subject
to the higher powers: For there is no
power but of God; and the powers that
be, are ordained of God:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13.
<hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance

should be convinced in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of that awe, and duty, which
they ow to Soveraignty, and know and

for God.</p>
                  <p>You see then how requisite it is,
that you walk in a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
that excessive power, which
flattering Casuists have beene wont
to give to Popes, Emperours, Kings,

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47749:123"/>
from us to draw this knot of our
obligation harder, &amp; closer then au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
it self intends it: What ever
Popes may doe for their Decrees,
certainly good Princes never meant
to lay such weight upon all their
lawes as to make every breach of
them (even in relation to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
given them by God) to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Their lawes are commonly shut
up with a sanction of the penalty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the violation: There is
an <hi>obedientia bursalis,</hi> (as, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>Gerson</hi> calls it,) an obedience, if
not of the person, yet of the purse;
which Princes are content to take up
withall: we have a world of sinnes
(God knowes) upon us in our hourly
transgressions of the royall lawes of
our maker; but woe were us, if wee
should have so many sins more, as
we break statutes: In penall lawes,
where scandall or contempt finde no


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47749:124"/>
place, humane authority is wont to
rest satisfied with the mulct paid,
when the duty is not performed.</p>
                  <p>Not that we may wilfully incur
the breach of a good law, because
our hands are upon our purse-strings
ready to stake the forfeiture; This
were utterly to frustrate the end of
good lawes, which doe therfore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a mulct that they may not bee
broken; and were highly injurious
to soveraign authority, as if it sought
for our money, not our obedience,
and cared more for gain then good
order; then which there cannot be a
more base imputation cast upon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
As then we are wont to
say in relation of our actions to the
lawes of God; that som things are
forbidden because they are sinfull,
and some things are sinfull because
they are forbidden, so it holds also
in the lawes of men; som things are
forbidden because they are justly


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47749:124"/>
offensive; and som other things are
only therfore offensive because they
are forbidden; in the former of these
we must yield our careful obedience
out of respect even to the duty
it self; in the latter, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the will of the law-giver; yet
so, as that if our own important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
shall enforce us to transgress
a penall law, without any affront of
authority or scandall to others, our
submission to the penalty frees us
from a sinfull disodedience.</p>

<hi>Thine</hi> hath ever embroyled the
world; so this particular concerning


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47749:125"/>

decry them as a judaicall law;
partly ceremoniall, partly judiciall;
and therfore either now unlawfull,
or at least neither obligatory, nor
convenient.</p>
                  <p>What is fit to be determined in a
businesse so over agitated; I shall shut
up in these ten propositions.</p>
                  <p>1. The maintenance of the legall
ministery allowed and appointed by
God was exceeding large and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall.</p>
                  <p>Besides all the tithes of corn, wine
oyle, herbs, herds, flocks; they had
forty eight cities set forth for them,
with the fields round about them, to
the extent of two thousand cubits
every way: they had the first fruits
of wine, oyle, wool, &amp;c. in a large


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47749:125"/>
proportion; he was held to be a man
of an evil eye that gave lesse then the
sixtith part: They had the first born
of cattle, sheep, beeves, goats; and
the price of the rest, upon redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
even the first-born of men must
ransom themselves at five shekels a
man; They had the oblations and
vowes of things dedicated to God:
They had the ample loaves (or
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ten hand breadths long, five broad, seven fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers high.</note> cakes rather) of shew-bread, and
no small share in meat-offerings, sin-offerings,
trespasse-offerings, heave-offerings,
shake-offerings; of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
eucharistical they had the brest
and shoulder; of other, the shoulder
and the two cheekes; yea the very
burnt offerings afforded them an
hide: Besides all these, all the males
were to appeare before the Lord
thrice a year; none were exempted
(as their Doctors tell us) but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47749:126"/>
deaf, dumb, idiots, blind, lame,
defiled, uncircumcised, old, sick, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and weak, not able to travel, and
no one of these which came up
might appeare empty-handed.</p>
                  <p>What do I offer to particularize?
there were no less then twenty four
gifts alotted to the Priests, expresly
in the law; the severals wherof who
so desires to see, may finde in the
learned and profitable Annotations
of master <hi>Ainsworth</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">H. Ainsworth <hi>in</hi> Lev. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. ex Maimonide</note>, out of <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We can have no reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that the same God who was so
bountifull in his provisions for the
legall ministery, should bear lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Evangelicall; which is
far more worthy and excellent then
the other; justly therfore doth S. <hi>Paul</hi>
argue from the maintenance of the
one, a meet proportion for the fit su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation
of the other, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:47749:126"/>
3. It is not fit for Gods ministers
to be too intent to matter of profit;
their main care must be the spiritual
proficiency of the soules of their
people; the secular thoughts of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
provisions must come in only
on the by; but howsoever they may
not be intangled in worldly affaires,
yet they ought in duty to cast so
much eye upon these earthly things
as may free them from neglect; It is
to <hi>Timothy</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, that it
any man provide not for his own, &amp;
especialy for those of his own house
he hath denied the faith, &amp; is worse
then an infidell. 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Under the law the tenth part
was precisely alotted by the owner
of all things, for the maintenance of
the sacred Tribe; and if the wise and
Holy God had not found that a meet
proportion for those that served at
his Altar; he had either pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
som other, or left it arbitrary; yea


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47749:127"/>
even before the law, <hi>Gen. 14. 20. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
(and in his loynes <hi>Levi</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
paid tithes to <hi>Melchisedec (Heb.
7. 4.)</hi> the priest of the most high
God; and whether it were by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or by some naturall instinct,
we find the very heathen nations,
after some great victory atchieved,
were wont to devote stil the tithe of
their spoiles to their Deities: so <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi>
when he had after a long siege

was their custome who were most

their increase to those Gods they

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:47749:127"/>
that hee therfore grew up to
so vast an estate, because he still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
the tithe of his fruits to <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:</hi>

they gathered their Frankincense,
none of it might be uttered till the
Priest had the tithe of it set forth for
him.</p>
                  <p>5. There can be no good reason
given, why we may not observe the
very same rate of proportion in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the maintenance of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
under the Gospell; and if these
rules and examples bee not binding,
(since Religion consisteth not now in
numbers at all; yet there is no cause
why Christian Kingdoms, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
may not settle their
choice upon the same number, and
quantity with both Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
                  <p>6. The nationall lawes of this
kingdom have set out the same pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portion


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47749:128"/>
of tenths for this purpose; If
therfore there were no other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
from the law of God or of the
Church, nor any precedents from
the practise of the rest of the world,
yet in obedience to our municipall
lawes, we are bound to lay forth the
tenth part of our increase to the
maintenance of Gods service; and
that tenth is as truly due to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
as the nine parts to the owner.</p>
                  <p>7. Since the tenth part is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the law both civill and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
dedicated to the service
of God; and in the meer intuition
thereof, is alotted to Gods ministers,
there can be no reason why it can be
claimed, or warantably received by
Lay persons, for their proper use &amp;
behoof; so as this practise of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,
which was first set on foot
by unjust and sacrilegious Buls from
<hi>Rome,</hi> is justly offensive both to God
and good men; as mis-deriving the


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47749:128"/>
well-meant devotions of charitable
and pious soules into a wrong chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.
Nothing is more plaine then
that tithes were given to the Church
and in it, to God; how therefore that
which is bequeath'd to God may be
alienated to secular hands, let the
possessors look?</p>
                  <p>8. Let men be tied to make good
the Apostles charge (since the legall
rate displeases) and it shall well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
those that wait upon Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
under the Gospel; The charge
of the Apostle of the Gentiles, is:
<hi>Let him that is taught in the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to him that teacheth, in all
good things, Gal. 6. 6.</hi> whereto hee
adds, <hi>ver. 7. Be not deceived, God is not
mocked.</hi> The charge is serious, and
binding: and the required commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nication
is universall; and that with
a grave Item of Gods strict observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of performance: we may not
think to put it off with <hi>Ambroses</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47749:129"/>
reading, of referring the <hi>all
good things</hi> to the teaching, (a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
sensibly weak, and misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;)
nothing is more evident then
that it hath relation to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating;
wherein (for ought I see)
God intends a larger bounty to the
Evangelicall ministery then to the
legall; where all is to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
what is excepted? All, not ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusive
of the owner; but imparted
by the owner; Let this bee really
done, there will bee no reason to
stand upon the Tenths.</p>
                  <p>9. But that this may be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, there is no law that requires
a meer arbitrarinesse in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators:
the duty of the teacher is
punctually set downe, and so well
known that the meanest of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can check him with his neglect:
and why should wee thinke the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
duty of the hearer fit to bee
left loose and voluntary: yet such


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47749:129"/>
an apprehension hath taken up the
hearts of too many Christians as if
the contributions to their ministers
were a matter of meer almes; which
as they need not to give, so they are
apt, upon easy displeasures, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid:
But these men must be put in
minde of the just word of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<hi>The laborer is worthy of his wages:</hi>
The ministery signifies a service; a
publique service at Gods Altar;
whereto the wages is no lesse due,
then the meat is to the mouth of him
that payes it; No man may more
freely speak of tithes then my selfe,
who receive none, nor ever shall do?
Know then ye proud ignorants, that
call your Ministers your almes-men,
and your selves their Benefactors,
that the same right you have to the
whole, they have to a part; God
and the same lawes that have feoffed
you in your estates, have allotted
them their due shares in them;


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47749:130"/>
which without wrong ye cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
It is not your charity but your
justice which they presse for their
owne: Neither think to check them
with the scornfull title of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
servants they are indeede, to
Gods Church, not to you; and if
they doe stoop to particular services
for the good of your souls, this is no
more disparagement to them, then it
is to the blessed Angels of God, to
be ministring spirits, <hi>Heb. 1. 14.</hi> sent
forth to minister for them who shall
be heires of salvation.</p>
                  <p>Shortly, it is the Apostles charge
ratified in heaven, that they which
labour in the word and doctrine
should be remunerated with double
honour; that is not formall of words
and complements, but real of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
which he laies weight upon
his <hi>Timothy</hi> to enioyn, 1. <hi>Tim. 5. 17.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. And surely how necessary it is
that we should bee at som certainty


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47749:130"/>
in this case, and not left to the meere
arbitrary will of the givers, it too
well apears in common experience;
which tell us how ordinary it is,
where ministers depend upon volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
benevolences, if they doe but
upon som just reproofe gall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a guilty hearer; or preach
som truth which dis-relishes the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
of a prepossessed auditor, how he
straight flies out; and not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
his own pay, but also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
the contributions of others:
so as the free-tongued teacher must
either live by ayre, or be forced to
change his pasture: It were easy to
instance, but charity bids mee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it is, that these sportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
preachers are faine to sooth up
their many masters, and are so gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the feare of a starving dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
that they dare not be free in
the reprehension of the daring sins of


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47749:131"/>
their uncertain benefactors; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charmed to speak either <hi>placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
or nothing. And if there were no
such danger in a faithfull and just
freedom, yet how easy is it to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that if even when the laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
men to pay their dues to their
ministers, they yet continue so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in their discharge of them:
how much lesse hope can there be,
that being left to their free choyce,
they would prove eyther liberall or
just in their voluntary contributions.</p>
                  <p>Howsoever therfore in that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
infancy of the Church, wherein
zealous Christians, out of a liberall
ingenuity were ready to lay downe
all their substance at the Apostles
feet, &amp; in the primitive times imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

times of the Church, it is more then
requisite, that fixed competencies of
allowance should by good lawes be
established upon them; which being
done by way of tithes in those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
wherein they obtaine, there is
just cause of thankfulnesse to God

of whose unjust usurpation, procured
but little thanks to their learned pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessors
of <hi>Complutum</hi> and <hi>Salamanca:</hi>
Your question relates to our owne
case; since many thousands of our
nation have transplanted themselves
into those regions, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
by barbarous owners: As
for those countries which were not
inhabited by any reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(as the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> or Summer-Islands;
which were only peopled
wih Hogs and Deer, and such like
bruite cattle) there can be no reason
why they should not fall to the first
occupant; but where the land hath a
known master the case must vary:


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47749:132"/>
For the decision whereof some
grounds are fit to be laid.</p>
                  <p>No nation under heaven but hath
som Religion or other, and worships
a God such as it is, although a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
much inferiour in very nature
to themselves; although the worst of
creatures, evil spirits; and that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein they were bred, through
an invincible ignorance of better,
they esteem good at least.</p>
                  <p>Dominion and propriety is not
founded in Religion, but in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and civill right; It is true that
the saints have in Christ, the Lord of
all things, a spiritual right in all crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures;
<hi>all things are yours,</hi> (saith the
Apostle) <hi>and you are Christs, and
Christ is Gods:</hi> but the spirituall right
gives a man no title at all to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
or civill possession here on
earth; yea Christ himselfe, though
both as God, and as Mediator, the
whole world were his, yet hee tells


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47749:133"/>
                     <hi>Pilate, My kingdom is not of this World;</hi>
neither did he (though the Lord Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount
of this whol earth) by virtu
of that transcendent soveraignty put
any man out of the possession of one
foot of ground which fell to him,
either by birth, or purchase; Neither
doth the want of that spirituall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
debar any man from a rightfull
claim and fruition of these earthly
inheritances.</p>
                  <p>The barbarous people were lords
of their owne; and have their Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores;
and orders, and formes of
government under which they peace<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ably
live, without the intermedling
with other nations.</p>
                  <p>Infidelity cannot forfeit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
to others; no more then
enmity professed by Jewes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

goods to the Crownes under which

people, have, or might have had
meanes sufficient to reclaime them
from their stubborn unbeleefe, but
these savages have never had the
least overture of any saving helps to
wards their conversion: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being as true owners of their
native inheritances, as Christians are
of theirs, they can no more be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

then Christians may be so for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced
by them: certainly, in the same
tearms wherein they stand to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
do also in their judgement,
Christians stand to them; and if it
would seem hard to us, that an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Pagans should (as hereto
fore it hath done) break in upon us,
and drive us out of our native posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
how could it seem less unjust
in us to them?</p>
                  <p>Their Idolatries, and sins against
nature are hainous and abhominable
and such as for which God of old


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47749:134"/>
condemned the seven nations to an
utter extirpation; But what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
have wee for their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Could we shew such a patent

                  <p>After much agitation it pleased
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to require the
judgement of<note n="†" place="bottom">Franc. a Victoria Relect. de Indis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Franciscus à Victoria,</hi>
the famous professor of Divinity at
<hi>Salamanca,</hi> concerning this so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affaire; which he hath published
with such wisdome and moderation,
as so great a businesse required; sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the question aright on both
sides; both shewing the insufficiency
of the received grounds of that Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
expedition, and directing to those


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47749:136"/>
just motives, &amp; rules of proceedings
herein, as might bee, in such a case,
justifiable; to which grave and solid
discourse of his, you may, if you
please, bee referred for further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Onwards, I shall draw forth some
few of such considerations from him
as may serve for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>First therefore it is lawfull for
Christians to travell into any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
under heaven, and as strangers,
to stay there, without any wrong
done to the natives; A thing allowed
by the law of nations derived from
the law of nature, by which law it is
every where held an inhuman thing
to offer ill measure to a stranger. It is
the argument that righteous <hi>Lot</hi> used
to the worst of Pagans, the <hi>Sodomits;
Only unto these men doe nothing, for
therefore are they come under the shadow
of my roof.</hi> Gen. 19. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:47749:136"/>
And if before the division of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the earth lay freely open to all
passengers without scruple, to travel
whither they pleased, surely, that par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tition
was never intended to warant
a restraint; And if nature have made
the Sea and all the in-lets of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
it were very injurious to abridg
any nation of the free use of so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
an element.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is lawfull for us to use
trafique with those Infidels, and to
interchange comodities with them,
and to abide upon their coasts for ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gotiation,
and to fish in their sea, and
to take part of those profits which
nature hath made common to all
comers, And if those Pagans shall
oppose us in so warrantable courses,
it will be meet for us to tender them
al fair satisfaction; perswading them
that we intend no harm or prejudice
to them in their persons, or estate;
but much good to both; labouring


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47749:137"/>
to win them by all courteous deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
But if they shall flie out, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all our kind indeavors,
into a violent opposition of us; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon us in a hostile manner, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to cut our throats in so unjust
a quarell, it is lawfull for us to stand
upon our defence, and to repell one
force with another; and to use all
convenient meanes for our security;
and if we cannot otherwise be safe,
to raise bulwarks or fortifications for
our own indemnity; and if we finde
our selves over-powred by impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Savages, to call for the aid and
assistance of our friends, and (if the
enmity continue and proceed) of our
Princes: since the just cause of war
is the propulsation of publique inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and such injury is as great as
barbarous.</p>
                  <p>But if not so much cruelty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as feare and suspicion of a
strange nation shal arm them against


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47749:137"/>
us; our care must bee so to manage
our own defence, as may be least of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fensive
to them; &amp; therfore we may
not take this occasion of killing their
persons, or sacking their townes, or
depopulating their countrys; for that
in this case they are no other then
innocent.</p>
                  <p>If after all gentle intreaties, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
usages, and harmlesse self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they shal persist in a malicious
hostility, &amp; can by no means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed
from their impetuous on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets;
there is now just cause not to
deale with them as innocents, but as
enemies: and therfore to proceede
against them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>But an higher and more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
title, that we may have to deale
with these barbarous Infidels, is, for
the propagation of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the promulgation of the
Gospel of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> amongst these
miserable savages: For which wee


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47749:138"/>
have good ground from the charge
of our Saviour: <hi>Goe preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to every creature; Mar. ult.</hi> and
he that was in bonds for the name of
the Lord Jesus, tels us, <hi>The word of
God is not bound;</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 9. not
bound, either in fetters; or within li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits:
Oh that wee could approve to
God, and our Consciences, that this
is our main motive and principall
drift in our western plantations; but
how little appearance there is of this
holy care and endeavour, the plaine
dealer upon knowledge hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
informed us; Although I now
heare of one industrious spirit that
hath both learned the language of
our new-Islanders, and printed some
part of the Scripture in it; and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up some of their Children in the
principles of Christianity: a service
highly acceptable to God, and no
lesse meritorious of men: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
then may be, must be preached


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47749:138"/>
to those heathens, (otherwise they
shall perpetually remaine out of the
estate of salvation) and all possible
meanes must be used for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
but herein I must have leave
to depart from <hi>Victoria,</hi> that he holds
it lawfull if the savages do not freely
permit (but goe about to hinder) the
preaching of the Gospell, to rayse
war against them; as if he would have
them cudgeled into Christianity:
surely this is not the way: It is for
Mahumetans to profess planting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by the sword; it is not for
Christians; It is a just clause therfore
that he puts in, that the slaughters
hereupon raised may rather prove
an hindrance to the conversion of the
savages, as indeed it fell out; the poor
Indians being by these bloody cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
brought into such a detestation
of their masters, the Castilians, that
they profest they would not goe to
heaven if any spanyards were there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:47749:139"/>
The way then to plant the Gospel
of Christ successefully among those
barbarous soules, must be only gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and plausible: first, by insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selves into them by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
familiarity, and winning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
by an holy and inoffensive
living with them; by working upon
them with the notable examples of
impartiall justice, strict piety, tender
mercy, compassion, chastity, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
&amp; all other Christian virtues;
and when they are thus won to a lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our persons and carriage, they
will be then wel capable of our holy
counsels; Then will the Christian
faith begin to relish with them; and
they shall now grow ambitious of
that happy condition, which they
admire in us: then shall they be glad
to take us into their bosoms: and
think themselves blessed in our soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and cohabitation: Lo this is the
true way of Christian conquests;


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47749:139"/>
wherein I know not whether shal be
the greater gainer, the victor or the
conquered; each of them shall blesse
other, and both shall be blessed by
the Almighty.</p>

heart of the penitent; there discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(upon an ingenious revelation of
the offender) both the nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and degree of the sinne; and the
truth, validity, and measure of his
repentance: The other whereby he
may in some sort either lock up the
soul under sin, or free it from sinne;
these keyes were never given him,
but with an intention that he should
make use of them upon just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The use that hee may and must
make of them is both generall, and
speciall: Generall; in publishing the


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47749:141"/>
will and pleasure of God signified in
his word, concerning sinners; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
forgivenesse of sins to the
humble penitent, and denouncing
judgement to the unbeleeving, and
obdured sinner: In which regard, he
is as the Herald of the Almighty,
proclaming war and just indignation
to the obstinate; and tendring terms
of pardon and peace to the relenting
and contrite soule: or rather, as the
Apostle stiles him, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20.</hi> Gods
Ambassador offering and suing for
the reconciliation of men to God;
and if that be refused, menacing just
vengeance to sinners.</p>
                  <p>Speciall, in a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this knowledge and power to
the soul of that sinner which makes
his addresse unto him: Wherein
must be inquired both what necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there is of this recourse, and what
aid and comfort it may bring to the
soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:47749:141"/>
Two cases there are wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is a necessity of applying
our selves to the judgement of our
spirituall guides; The first is in our
doubt of the nature and quality of
the fact; whether it be a sin, or no
sinne; for both many sinnes are so
gilded over with fair pretences and
colourable circumstances, that they
are not to be de cryed but by judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eyes; and some actions which
are of themselves indifferent, may by
a scrupulous conscience be mistaken
for hainous offences: Whither
should we goe in these doubts but
to our Counsaile learned in the
Lawes of God; of whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath said by his <hi>Prophet. The
Priests lips should keep knowledge; and
they should seeke the Law at his mouth;
for he is the messenger of the Lord of
Hosts.</hi> Mal. 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>The second is in the irresoluble
condition of our souls after a known


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47749:142"/>
sin committed; wherein the burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
conscience not being able to
give ease unto it self, seeks for aid to
the sacred hand of Gods Penetentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
here on earth, &amp; there may find it;
That is, that which <hi>Elihu,</hi> as upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
suggesteth unto <hi>Job,</hi> on
his dunghill: <hi>Job 33. 22. The soul of
the remorsed draweth near to the
grave, and his life to the destroyers:</hi>
ver. 23. <hi>But if there bee a messenger</hi> (of
God) <hi>with him, an interpreter, one of
a thousand, to shew unto man his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse,</hi>
(and the soundnesse of
his repentance) ver. 24. <hi>then is</hi> (God)
<hi>Gratious unto him, and saith, Deliver
him from going down into the pit; I
have found a ransome, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 26. <hi>Hee
shall pray unto God; and he will be favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto him; and hee shall see his face
with joy.</hi> In case of some dangerous
sicknesse of the body, wee trust not
our owne skill, nor some ignorant
quack-salvers, but seek to a learned


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47749:142"/>
and experienced Physitian for the
prescription of some sure remedies;
whereas, if it be but for a sore finger,
or a tooth-ach, we care only to make
use of our own receits: And so in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
quarels; if it be only som sleight
brabble, wee thinke to compose it
alone; but if it be som maine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
importing our free hold, wee are
glad to waite on the stairs of some
judicious Lawyer, and to fee him for
advice: How much more is it thus
in the perilous condition of our
soules; which as it is a part farre
more precious then its earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
so the diseases whereto it is
subject, are infinitely more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and deadly.</p>
                  <p>Is your heart therfore embroyled
within you, with the guilt of some
hainous sin? labour what you may
to make your peace with Heaven;
humble your self unto the dust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Majesty whom you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47749:143"/>
beat your guilty brest, water
your cheeks with your tears; &amp; cry
mightily to the father of mercies for
a gracious remission; but if after all
these penitent endevours you finde
your soule still unquiet; and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
apprehensive of a free and
full forgiveness; betake your selfe to
Gods faithfull agent for peace; run
to your ghostly Physitian, lay your
bosome open before him; flatter not
your own condition; let neither
feare nor shame stay his hand from
probing and searching the wound to
the bottome; and that being done,
make carefull use of such spirituall
applications as shall be by him admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to you: This, this is the way
to a perfect recovery, and fulness of
comfort.</p>
                  <p>But you easily grant that there
may be very wholsome use of the
ghostly counsell of your Minister in
the case of a troubled soule; but you


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47749:143"/>
doubt of the validity and power of
his absolution; concerning which it
was a just question of the Scribes in
the Gospell; <hi>Who can forgive sinnes
but God only?</hi> Mar. 2. 6. Our Saviour
therefore to prove that he had this
power, argues it from his divine
omnipotence; <hi>He only hath authority
to forgive sinnes,</hi> (ver. 7.) that can say
to the decrepit paralytick; <hi>Arise,
take up thy bed and walke;</hi> (ver. 9.)
none but a God can by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
effect this; he is therefore the
true God that may absolutely say,
<hi>Thy sins be forgiven thee,</hi> (ver. 10.) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
how can it be otherwise? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God only is our sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
against man only in the relation
that man hath to God; He only can
know the depth of the malignity of
sin, who only knowes the soule
wherein it is forged; He only who is
Lord of the Soule, the God of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
can punish the Soule for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47749:144"/>
Hee only that is infinite can
doome the sinfull soule to infinite
torments; He only therefore it must
be, that can release the guilty Soule
from sin and punishment, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
man, or Angell shall challenge
to himselfe this absolute power to
forgive sin let him be accursed,</p>
                  <p>Yet withall it must be yeelded,
that the blessed son of God spake
not those words of his last commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in vaine; <hi>Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sinnes ye retaine, they are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
John 20. 23. neither were they
spoken to the then present Apostles
only, but in them to all their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
successors to the end of the
world.</p>
                  <p>It cannot therfore but be granted,
that there is some kind of power left
in the hand of Christs ministers,
both to remit and retain sin: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this power given only to the


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47749:144"/>
Governors of the Church, in respect
of the censures to be inflicted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed
by them, but to all Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
ministers, in relation to the sins
of men: A power not soveraign and
absolute, but limited &amp; ministeriall,
for either quieting the conscience of
the penitent, or further aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the conscience of sin and terror
of judgement to the obstinate and
rebellious: Neither is this only by
way of a bare verball declaration,
(which might proceed from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lips) but in the way of an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and effectuall application, by
virtue of that delegate, or commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
authority which is by Christ
entrusted with them: For certainly,
our Saviour meant in these words to
conferre somwhat upon his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
more then the rest of the world
should be capable to receive, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
The absolution therefore of
an authorized person must needs be


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47749:145"/>
of greater force and efficacy then of
any private man, how learned or ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
soever; since it is grounded upon
the institution and commission of the
Sonne of God, from which all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and virtue is derived to all his
ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we may wel say,
that whatsoever is in this case, done
by Gods minister (the key not erring)
is ratified in heaven: It cannot ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but be a great comfort, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall
assurance to the penitent soule
to heare the messenger of God (after
a careful inquisition into his spiritual
estate and true fight of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
in the name of the Lord Jesus
pronouncing to him the full remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all his sinnes.</p>
                  <p>And if either the blessing or curse
of a father goe deeper with us, then
of any other whosoever; although
but proceeding from his own privat
affection, without any warrant from
above; how forcible shall we esteem


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47749:145"/>
the (not so much apprecatory, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory)
benedictions, of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Fathers, sent to us, out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
                  <p>Although therefore you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
through Gods goodnesse, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to such a measure of knowledg
and resolution, as to be able to give
your self satisfaction concerning the
state of your soul; yet it cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
out of an abundant caution to
take Gods minister along with you,
and making him of your spirituall
Counsaile, to unbosome your selfe
to him freely, for his fatherly advice
and concurrence: The neglect
whereof, through a kinde of eyther
strangenesse of mis-conceit, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not a little disadvantageous to
the soules of many good Christians.
The Romish Laity makes either O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

                  <head type="sub">Whither it bee lawfull for a man that is

for a laick person, to take upon him to

                  <p>MAny distinct considerations
had neede to make way to the
answere.</p>
                  <p>First, it is one thing for a man to
interpret Scripture, another thing to
take upon him the function of


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47749:146"/>
preaching the Gospell, which was
perhaps in your intention; this is far
more large then the other, every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that preacheth interpreteth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but every one that interprets
Scripture doth not preach. To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scripture is only to give the
sense of a Text; but to Preach is to
divide the Word aright; to apply it
to the Conscience of the hearer; and
in an authoritative way to reprove
sin, and denounce judgement against
sinners; to lay forth the sweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell to the faithfull
and penitent; for the performing
whereof there must be a commission
to Gods minister from him that
sends him; upon which the Apostle
hath pronounced a (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>Who
is suffiicient for these things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it must bee considered
in what nature, &amp; within what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the interpretation is; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the just degrees of callings must


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47749:147"/>
be herein duly observed; whether
in a publique way; as Pastors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
or in a private way, as
masters of families; whether in the
schooles, in a meere Grammaticall
way; or in the Church, in a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it must be considered, as
what the calling, so what the gifts
are of the interpreter: for surely;
meere interpretation doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the profession, but upon
the faculty of the undertaker; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be learned, or ignorant; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
skilfull in languages and arts
(which certainly must be required in
whosoever would put forth his hand
to so holy and great a work, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inexpert in both: where these
gifts of interpretation, and eminent
endowments of learning are found,
there can be no reason of restraining
them from an exercise so beneficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
edificatory to the Church of God:


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47749:147"/>
without which the truth of Christian
religion had wanted much both of
her vigour, and lustre in all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
How famously is it known that
<hi>Origen</hi> before his entring into holy
Orders, even at eighteene yeeres of
his age entred into that great worke
of his Catechisings: <hi>Act. 18. 24. 25.
Apollos</hi> the Alexandrian was an <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
man, and mighty in scriptures,
and taught diligently the things of the
Lord; yet knew nothing but the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of</hi> John, <hi>till</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scilla
took him to task, and <hi>more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
expounded to him the way of God;</hi>
and what happy use it pleased God
to make of laick hands, for both the
defence and propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
we need no other witnesse then
S. <hi>Jerome;</hi> who hath memoriz'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the primitive Christians,
<hi>Aristides, Agrippa, Hegesippus, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
Musanus, Modestinus,</hi> both the
<hi>Apollonii, Heraclius, Maximus,</hi> and


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47749:148"/>
many others, whom God raised up
amongst the learned laity of those
times, to Apologize for Christianity;
And in the last foregoing age, how
scarce removed out of our sight, are
<hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> both the Earles of
<hi>Mirandula, Capnio, Fagius,sof an instan Erasmus,
Faber,</hi> and the rest of those famous
way-makers to the succeeding resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the evangelicall truth: And
what a treasure in this kind had the
Church of God lost, if it should have
missed the learned annotations upon
the Scripture, derived to us from the
hands of <hi>Mercerus, Joseph Scaliger,
Drusius,</hi> both <hi>Causaubons, Tilenus, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Heinsius, Selden,</hi> and such other
expert philogists, never initiated into
sacred Orders?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, due and serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
must be had of the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it selfe; that it bee genuine and
orthodox: for there can be nothing
in the world more dangerous then to


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47749:148"/>
mis-construe God speaking to us in
his Word; and to affixe upon his
Divine Oracles a sense of our owne,
quite dissonant from the intention of
that spirit of Truth: Care therfore
must be taken that the intepretation
given, be every way conform to the
Analogy of faith, and fully accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to other Scripture; the neglect
wherof, through either ignorance or
misprision hath bred many foul and
perilous soloecismes in Divinity; To

In these and many more (for I
meant to give you but an assay) the
mistakes are important, and such as
make no small change in the Text;
which I have therefore produced
that I might let you see how easie it
is for a man that takes all things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trust to be abused by his creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and how unsafe it is much more
for an unexpert &amp; injudicious person
to meddle with the holy Oracles of
the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion then must be, that
however it may bee lawfull for the
eminently learned, either in schooles
or families (according as their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
may warrant them) to interpret
even difficult Scriptures, and to unty
the knots of a Text; yet since not
many are thus qualified, and those
that are so qualified, if they neglect
to follow the prescribed rules may
easily miscarry, to the great perill
both of their own souls, and others;


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47749:157"/>
I should therefore advise that this
may bee the act of but some few
choice persons, and of them, with all
possible caution; and that ordinary
Christians, if they have a desire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all fundamentall truths (which
are laid down openly and cleerly in
the sacred Word of God) to inform
themselves in those darker verities,
which lie hidden in more obscure
Scriptures, to have recourse to their
learned and faithfull Pastors; and
rather to rest in that light which
they shal receive from their well-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
instructions, then to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own (perhaps confident, but
much weaker) judgement.</p>

him from affamishing: wherein
certainly they are over-strait laced,

much stronger then the parents inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest

into the positive law of<note n="†" place="bottom">Num. 30. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> God, wee
shall find the child so wholly left to

that after the age of puberty,
those vows only are in the mercy of

to the government of the family, &amp;

And although those Casuists doe
sufficiently doat upon their Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery,
and the vows thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning;
yet they ascribe so much to
the bond of filial duty, as that they
teach, That a sonne which (his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
being in extreme need, and
wanting his help) enters into a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

(though professed) when hee might

of a sin against the fift Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

(1 Cor. 7. 36.) <hi>Neverthelesse he that
standeth stedfast in his heart, having
no necessity; but hath power over his
owne will, and hath so decreed in his
heart that he will keep his virgin, doth
well, &amp;c.</hi> (ver. 37.) Loe, the Apostle
supposeth it in the parents power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to keep his daughter a virgin, or
to dispose of her in marriage: she is
not her owne, either to hold, or give;
but must be altogether ordered by
the superior will of a parent: Not,
that any force is allowed either way
to be used towards the daughter;
whether to continue her in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
virginity, or to call her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her minde upon a dis-affected
match; No, that God who disposeth
all things sweetly, would have us


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47749:161"/>
doe so too; hee allowes parents to be
rulers of their children, but not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants:
what they doe therefore in
this kinde, must be more by councel
then command: and with more sway
of love then authority: thus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
wisely with the state of times
and the childs disposition and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of contayning, must the parent
either keep his virgin, or labour for
the provision of a meete consortship
Thus did the two great Patriarchs
of Gods ancient Church, <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Isaac,</hi> provide fit matches for
their holy seed; whiles the unholy
provided unfit matches for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Thus did their godly issue in
all generations take their parents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them in the choice of
meet yoke-fellowes, whiles the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
whether out of impetuous lust,
or stubborn disobedience, affect with
<hi>Esau, Gen. 28. 6, 7, 8.</hi> to be their owne
purveyors, to the great regret, and


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47749:161"/>
heart-breaking of their parents.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the latitude that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
gives of the liberty of marriage to al
Christians is, <hi>Tantum in Domino;
onely in the Lord, 1 Cor. 7. 39.</hi> Now
how can that marriage bee in the
Lord, which is against him? and
how can that bee other then against
the Lord; which is against the Lords
commandement? And what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
can be more express then
<hi>Honor thy father and thy mother Gal.
6. 1.</hi> And, <hi>Children obey your parents?
ver. 2.</hi> And what can bee more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the honour and obedience
due to Parents, then to neglect them
in the main business that concernes
our lives? And what businesse can
concern our life so much, as the
choice of a meet partner, with whom
we may comfortably weare out all
the dayes of our pilgrimage on
earth?</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse then, we may in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47749:162"/>
safely conclude, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unlawfull for a childe to
sleight his Parents consent in the
choice of his marriage; There may
be some particular cases incident
wherein perhaps this may without
sinne or blame be forborn; as when
the child either by general permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or former elocation shall be out
of the Parents disposing, or where
the parent is defective in his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals,
or where the child lives <hi>in
remotis,</hi> out of the compasse of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence;
or where the Parent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
averse from the true Religion
denies his consent to match with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but those of his own straine; or
shall upon other by-occasions wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
stand upon so unreasonable
terms, that neither friends nor autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity
can over-rule him: But where
these or the like preponderating ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
doe not intervene, the child
cannot without sin balk the Parents

consent to his choice in marriage.</p>
                  <p>But though such marriages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,

they are valid.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>I have heard too much of, &amp; once
saw a licentious Pamphlet thrown
abroad in these lawlesse times, in the
defence and encouragement of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces

needed not, but) to be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
given by the disliking hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to his displeasing and unquiet

that Marriage was instituted for the

therefore the match proves such, as
that the wife doth but pull downe a
side, and by her innate peevishnesse,
and either sullen, or pettish and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
disposition brings rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort

                  <p>Woe is me, To what a passe is the

I must seriously profess when
I first did cast my eye upon the front
of the book, I supposed some great
wit meant to try his skill in the main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenance
of this so wild, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

have run over som of those too wel-penned
pages, I found the Author
was in earnest, and meant seriously
to contribute this peece of good
councel in way of Reformation to
the wise and seasonable care of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors;
I cannot but blush for our age,
wherein so bold a motion hath been


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47749:164"/>
amongst others, admitted to the
light: what will all the Christian
Churches through the world, to

think of our wofull degeneration in

                  <p>Or how can they construe it other

hast dealt treacherously; Yet is she thy
companion, and the wife of thy covenant,
Mal. 2. 14, 15, 16.</hi> (Loe, the wife of
thy covenant, therefore too sure set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to bee turn'd off upon every
sleight occasion; what? was thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to take her for thy wife till

                     <hi>Therefore take heed to your spirit; and
let none deal treacherously against the
wife of his youth: For the Lord, the God
of Israel, saith, that he hateth putting
away; For one covereth violence with
his garment, saith the Lord of hosts:
Therefore take heed to your spirit that
you deal not treacherously.</hi> What is this
treachery which the Prophet cries
out against thus vehemently, thrice
over with a breath, but pretended
and unjust suggestions against a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wife, for her undue divorce?
and what is that violence, but the
injurious execution of those sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions?
upon which unsufficient
grounds the Lord professes to hate
putting away.</p>
                  <p>Yea how apparently contrary is
this practise to the very originall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of marriage it self? He that
made it in Paradise ordained thus:
<hi>Therefore shall a man leave his father
and his mother, and shall cleave unto his


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47749:166"/>
wife; and they two shall be one flesh, Gen.
2. 24.</hi> Loe, before ever there was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or mother, or son in the world,
God hath appointed that the bonds
betwixt husband and wife shall be
more strait and indissoluble then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the parent and child; and can
any man be so unreasonable as to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fend
it lawfull, upon some unkinde
usages, or thwartness of disposition,
for a parent to abandon and forsake
his child; or the son to cast off his
parent? much lesse therefore may it
be thus betwixt an husband &amp; wife:
<hi>They two are one flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Behold here
an union of Gods making: A mans

wives body is his: And will a man be
content to part easily with a peece of
himselfe? Or can we thinke that
God will indure an union made by
himself to be sleightly dissolved?
Or how is this bodily matrimony a
lively image of the spirituall marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47749:167"/>
betwixt Christ and his Church
(who hath said, <hi>I will betroth thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me for ever; Yea I will betroth thee
unto me in righteousnesse, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in loving kindenesse, and in
mercies, Hos. 2. 19.)</hi> if upon small oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
it may be subject to utter
dissolution? Yea, what speak I of
Divinity? Even modest Heathens
would hisse this Libertinisme off the
Stage: Amongst the rest, what a fool

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47749:168"/>
rather a turning aside, but in
our ordinary acception amounts to
no less then both. But what unjust
difference they make betwixt finall
separation and dissolution, we shall
finde in our next discourse: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that such separation may not
be made of man and wife (lawfully
joyned together) for heresie or mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>belief;
we need no other conviction
then that peremptory and clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of our Saviour which
we have formerly insisted on: For
though his words on the mount were
in a way of doctrinall assertion, yet
afterwards the same words were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him, in way of a satisfactory
answer to the Pharises question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
causes of divorce; professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolving that there could be no
allowable ground of such separation
except fornication. What words can
be more plain? It is but a shift to say
(as the Cardinall doth) that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47749:168"/>
here meant only to expresse
the proper cause of the separation of
married persons; which is the breach
of marriage faith: as having no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of those generall
grounds which reach to the just sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of all humane societies; such
as Heresie and Infidelitie; which are
enough to unglew all naturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
relations betwixt father and son,
master and servant, husband and
wife: For it is clear that neither que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
nor answer were bounded with
any particularities; The Pharisee
asks, <hi>Whether for every cause?</hi> Our
Saviour answers; <hi>For no cause but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;</hi>
And it is spoken beside the
book, that child or servant should or
may forsake parent or master in case
of heresie, or infidelity: S. <hi>Paul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
other Doctrine: <hi>Let as many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
as are under the yoke</hi> (of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage)
<hi>count their</hi> (infidell) <hi>masters wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all honor; 1 Tim. 6. 5.</hi> not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47749:169"/>
therefore of desertion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation:
And if the servants may
not shake off the bonds of duty;
much lesse may the son brake or file
off the bonds of nature; and as for
the matrimoniall knot, how too sure
it is to be loosed by infidelity it self,
let the Apostle speak; <hi>If any brother
hath a wife that beleeveth not, and she
be pleased to dwell with him, let him
not put her away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 12. <hi>And the
woman which hath an husband that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
not; and if he be pleased to dwell
with her, let her not leave him,</hi> ver. 13.
And if even Infidelity have not
power to dis-oblige the wife or hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
much less Heresie: In this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
case therefore to separate
from board and bed, is no better then
a presumptuous insolence; It is the
peremptory charge of Christ, <hi>What
God hath joyned together, let not man
put asunder, Mat. 19. 6.</hi> In all lawfull
marriages, it is God that joyns the


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47749:169"/>
hands and hearts of the Married.
How dare man then undoe the work
of God upon devises of his own?
Had the Lord ever said, If thy wife
be a wilfull mis-beleever, rid thy
hands of her; this separation were
just; but now that his charge is clean
contrary, what an impious sauciness
is it to dis-joyn those whom God
hath united?</p>
                  <p>As therefore, it is not in the power
of any third person, upon any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
pretence, violently to break
the sacred bond of Marriage; so nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
may the husband or wife en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thral
each other by a wilfull deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whether upon pretext of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or any secular occasion; In
which cause what is to be don must
come under a further disquisition;
Certainly it was never the intention
of the holy and wise God, by vertue
of that which was ordained for mans
comfort and remedy of sin, to binde


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47749:170"/>
him to a remedilesse misery; which
must necessarily fall out, if upon the
departure of an unbeleeving or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
yoke-fellow, the relict party
must be tyed up to a perpetuall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of either containing, (if he
can) or, if he can not, of burning;
The wise Doctor of the Gentiles
well fore-saw the dangerous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
that must needs hereupon
ensue, and hath given order for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
accordingly.</p>
                  <p>But if the unbeleeving depart, let
him depart; <hi>A brother or a sister is not
under bondage in such cases; but God hath
called us to peace, 1 Cor. 7. 15.</hi> Not, that
it is free for a man or woman so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
to carve him, or her self of

would follow upon such licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?)
but that after long and patient

these matrimoniall affairs) in
whose power it may be, either by

to bring back the offendor to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

as that it leaves a perpetuall bond
behind it, never to be dissolved till
death; So as those offenders, which
by just censure are separated from
the board and the bed, cannot yet be
freed from the bond of marriage:
upon this ground it is that they bar
the innocent party from the benefit
of a second marriage, as supposing
the obligation of the former still in
force. In the ordinary Bills of the
Jewish divorce, the repudiated wife
had full-scope given her of a second
choice; as the words ran:<note n="*" place="bottom">Maimon. Treat. of Divorce.</note> 
                     <hi>She was
to be free, and to have power over her
own soul; to goe away; to be married
to any man whom she would:</hi> They
were not more liberall, then our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
divorcers are niggardly: The
Jewish divorce being upon unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
cause, made their liberality


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47749:171"/>
so much more sinfull, as their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
was more unjust: for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
woman was still in right the
lawfull wife of that unrighteous hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that dismissed her; the Romish
doctrine makes their strait-handed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
so much more injurious, as the
cause of separation is more just.</p>
                  <p>Even this question also is expresly
determined by our Saviour in his
answer to the Pharisee: <hi>Whosoever
shall put away his wife, except it be for
fornication, and marrieth another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
adultery: Mat. 19.</hi> Lo then, he
that for so just a cause as fornication
putteth away his wife and marrieth
another, committeth not adultery:
the exception manifestly implies so
much, both in reason and common
use: neither indeed, are the words ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any other probable sense:
That which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would fasten
upon it, referring the exception to
the former clause, of dismission on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47749:172"/>
so as it might be lawfull to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
only for fornication, but not
to marry after divorce; cannot stand
without a supply of words of his
own, which God never alow'd him
to intersert; and besides utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies
the sense; casting such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
upon our Saviour, as he would
hate to own; for except that restraint
be refered to the marrying again, the
sense would run thus, <hi>whosoever puts
away his wife commits adultery;</hi> which
stands not with truth or reason: sith
it is not the dismission that is adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but the marryage of another:
It is therefore the plain drift of our
Saviour, to teach the Pharisee, that
the marriage of a second wife (after
dismission of a former, upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, except for fornication) is
no less then adultery: thereby enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that upon a just dismission for
fornication, a second marriage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be branded with adultery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:47749:172"/>
Neither will it serve his turne,
which he would borrow from St.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> that upon this negative of
our Saviours, we may not look to
build an affirmative of our own; for
though it be granted, that he, who
putting away his wife not for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp; marrieth another, sinneth;
yet it followes not that he who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
dismissed his wife for fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
marrieth another, sinneth not at
all: A sin it may be, though not an
adultery: For surely if it be a sinne;
it must be against a commandement;
and if against any commandement,
it must be against the seventh; and
what is the seventh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,
but <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery?</hi>
Besides, the Pharisees question <hi>[Is it
lawfull for a man to put away his wife
for every cause?]</hi> was not without a
plaine implication of liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another; which our Saviour well
knowing, gives a full answer as well


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47749:173"/>
to what he meant, as what hee said;
which had not been perfectly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
if he had only determined
that one part concerning dismission,
and not the other concerning marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
which clause if two other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
expresse not, yet it must bee
fetcht necessarily from the third;
since it is a sure &amp; irrefragable rule;
<hi>That all four Evangelists make up one
perfect Gospell,</hi> It is therefore a very
tottering and unsure ground which
our Rhemists build upon; as if the
Apostle meant to crosse his Lord
and master, when hee saith, <hi>The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which hath an husband is bound by
the Law to her husband, so long as hee
liveth, Rom. 7. 2.</hi> therfore only death
can dissolve the bond of marriage;
not divorce, not adultery, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
for adultery: For how plainly
doe the words carry their answer in
themselves:<note n="*" place="bottom">So also 1 Cor. 7. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>The woman</hi> (saith the


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47749:173"/>
Apostle) <hi>that hath an husband:</hi> but
the woman legally divorced for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
hath no husband: S. <hi>Paul</hi>
speakes of a true wife, not a divorced
harlot: hee had no occasion here to
look aside at matter of divorce, but
takes marriage as in its intire right;
rather desiring to urge (for cleering
the case of our obligation to the law)
that the husband being once dead,
the wife is free to marry again, then
to intimate the case of her incapacity
to marry till he be dead.</p>
                  <p>As for that bond therfore, which
is so much stood upon, if it be taken
without all relations to the duties of
bed and board; it is meerly Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall;
nothing but fantasie. There
are, or should bee Bonds of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Bonds of mutual respects, and
reciprocall duties betwixt man and
wife, and these must hold firme not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any locall separation;
neither time, nor place may so much


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47749:174"/>
as slacken, much lesse loose them:
but where a just divorce intervenes,
these bonds are chopt in peeces, and
no more are, then if they had never
beene: And if all relations cease in
death (as they doe, in whatsoever
kind) surely divorce, being (as it is)
no other then a legall death, doth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
cut off (as the hebrew term im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
all former obligations and
respects betwixt the partys so finaly
separated.</p>
                  <p>The adulterous wife therfore duly
divorced being thus dead in law as
to her husband, the husband stands
now as free as if he had never marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so as I know not why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
should not as well speake to him
as to any other; when he saith: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
to avoid fornication, let every
man have his own wife, 1 Cor. 7. 2.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it otherwise in the case of a
chaste wife after her separation from
an adulterous husband, <hi>Mar. 10. 12.</hi>


                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:47749:174"/>
In these rights God makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of sexes, both may lawfully
claim the same immunities: which
certainly should they be denied to ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
must needs draw on very great
inconveniences: For in how hard a
condition should the innocent party
be hereupon left? Either the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
or wife must bee forced to live
with an adultrous consort; or be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a perpetuall necessity of either
doing that (which perhaps they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>What remedy now can bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

                  <p>Continence, after such separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in case of ability so granted: for
surely this holy disposition is a gift;
and therefore is not had, where it is

These harshnesses have too much of
Tyranny in them to be incident to a

brother <hi>Laban:</hi> The circumstances
drew their full consent; all is agreed
upon betwixt parents; but when all
this is don, nothing is don till <hi>Rebecca</hi>

goe.</hi> ver. 58. Now the contract is
made up; till then, all the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

the intended Bride; and all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
things given to her mother, &amp;
brother, were but at the mercy of
the receivers; Neither ought it to be
other in all Christian espousals; the
free and cheerfull consent of parents

full and happy; Let not the Childe
dare to crosse his parents; let not the
Parent think to force the child; and
when an undue bargain is, through
the heat of passion, made up past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
let love and pity so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede

of some ancient and holy Fathers,

(besides five severall Councels) have

know that there are divers other no

then those which are expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
the rest being intended to

for it is easy for any reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that all the severalities of the

male; under which, if the like exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances

meant to be comprehended, females
should be lawlesse, and the lawe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
To marry then with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen-german

intimated in that inhibition:

                     <hi>Willet</hi> (a man much deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

these marriages to bee analogically
forbidden, in this catalogue of <hi>Moses</hi>
For, saith he, if the degrees of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be limited to the third or fourth
degree; as it is not lawfull for a man
to marry his wives daughters daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>(Levit. 18. 17.)</hi> why should not
the line of consanguinity hold to the

the sonne to marry his fathers bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

sonne? But that worthy Divine did
not heedfully observe the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt these instanced de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
for the one of these is an equal
line, the other in an unequal; the one
is a collaterall consanguinity, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is in a directly descending affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so as the husband should bee
grandfather in law to the wife, which


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47749:182"/>
in all reason were very unlawful, and
absurd; since in all those descending
degrees there is a kinde of reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
inequality betwixt the lower and
superiour, which abhorres from all
proportion of a match: whereas the
collateral equidistance of Cousens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german
from the stock whence both
descend, hath in it no such appearance
of inequality, Certainly then, no
analogy can draw these marriages
within the prohibition; whether the
neerenesse of approach to our flesh
be a just bar to them, must be further
considered.</p>

were but to wast time &amp; paper upon
so cleere a truth? As there was no
Christian Church which did not
carefully observe this sacred Rite: so
above all other the Roman hath
been at least curious enough in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for a strict and severe account of
their espousals: What voluminous
discourses? What a world of nice
questions have faln from the pens of
their Canonists and Casuists concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this subject? Certainly this is a
point of so much use and agitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, that were it not for the
quarels arising herefrom, it is to bee
feared their consistories would want
work, and their Advocates imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But to speake ingenuously,


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47749:191"/>
those of the Roman Clientele are
not more careful &amp; punctual in scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and observing the rules and
practise of their espousals, then ours
here are incurious of both: How
many have we heard to say, they wil
make no promise of themselves till
they come to the Church-dore? and
of those that doe contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
how weakly &amp; insufficiently
is it performed on many hands? so as
their act, if questioned, is no way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging;
nor such as upon the least
discontent, will indure a contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas there is a double
contract or espousall, the one of the
future; the other of the present: that
of the present, if it bee expressed in
ful termes, differs nothing from mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage
it self, save only in the publick
solemnization; which doubtlesse is a
ceremony so requisite, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it an horrible confusion must

                  <p>That of the future, is a mutuall
engagement of both parties, that
they will marry each other; which
is most properly an espousall-Contract;
giving both assurance to
each other of a mutuall consent to
a Matrimony that shall bee; and
yet withall some meet respiration of
a more full triall and inquiry into
each others condition: For which
purpose the wisdom of the Church
hath ordained that there should be a
solemne publication of that more

much question and inconvenience:
but in those which are of a mature

but singularly usefull &amp; beneficiall:
For neither is it meet that so great a

whom God hath called to that estate
yet there are places wherein it were
barbarous and piacular to defray it:
even, besides those places which are
destin'd to an holy use, the Jewes of

But what the limitation of this time

from the Advent to the Epiphany;
from Septuagesima Sunday to the

wont to be strictly kept; besides the

the liberty of the seasons for

Nativitie, and abridged some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

for their own gain, every Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack

Divines in our Church did not stick
to professe their great dislike of our
conforming herein to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to the scandal of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
Concerning both which, I
must say: that if either wee or they
doe put any holinesse in the time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
or any unholiness in the act
inhibited, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be excused from
superstition, Can any time be more
holy then Gods owne day? yet on


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47749:196"/>
that day wee doe commonly both
publish marriages, and celebrate
them. But if, as in some solemne
fasts, indicted by the Church for
some publique humiliation, we both
doe, and injoyne to abstaine from all
conjugall society; so in a desire the
more dovoutly to celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Gods infinite mercy to man
kinde in sending a Saviour into the

                  <p>But, to say as it is, as the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists

husbands and wives forget one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too soon: Scarce are their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts
fully cold, ere they are laying

moneths are enow for the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

this haste hath in it too much not im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modesty
only, but inhumanity: If
we look abroad into the world, wee
shall find not among Gods peculiar
people only, but even amongst the
very Heathens, a meet (and not nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly)
intermission betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
of the one husband, or wife, &amp;
the marriage of another: A whole

<hi>Rome</hi> (which holds matrimonie a

necessity of the Priests hand
in so holy an act; but for us, who
(though reverently esteeming that
sacred institution, yet) set it in a key
lower, it admits of too much questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whether we neede to stand upon
the terms of a Ministers agency in
the performance of that solemn acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on:
There are those in these wilde
times that have held it sufficiently
lawful for the parties having agreed
upon the bargain before friends and
witnesses, to betak themselves to bed


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47749:199"/>
others have thought this act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
the married persons in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
a fitter act for the Magistrate to
undertake. And certainely if there
were nothing in marriage but meere
nature, it could not bee amisse that
men and women should upon their
mutuall agreement couple them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together after the manner of
brute creatures; And if there were
nothing in mariage but meer civility
the Magistrate might be meet to be
imployed in this service: But now
that we Christians know matrimony
to be an holy institution of God him
selfe: which hee not only ordained,
but actually celebrated betwixt the
first Innocent payre; and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the propagation of an holy
seed, requires a speciall benediction;
how can we in reason think any man
meet for this office, but the man of
God, set over us in the Lord; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the blessings of heaven upon our


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47749:199"/>
heads? From hence therfore have
our wholsom lawes taken a just hint
to appropriate this service to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Minister only: so as what ever
private contract may bee transacted
in corners betwixt the parties affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to each other, yet the marriage
knot cannot be publiquely quit by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other hand then Gods Ministers.
And herein certainly wee have just
cause to bless the wisdom both of
the Church and State, which hath so
regulated these matrimoniall affairs;
as that they are not only orderly but
safely managed: For doubtless were
not this provision carefully made,
the world would bee quite over-run
with beastliness, and horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And in this point we may well
give the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her due, &amp;
acknowledge the wise care of her
Lateran and Tridentine Councells,
which have enacted so strict decrees
against clandestine Marriages, and


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47749:200"/>
have taken so severe a course for the
reforming of many foul disorders in
these matrimoniall proceedings; as
may be of good use for the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world: Had they done the like in
other cases, their light had not gone
out in a snuffe: As therfore it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
both decreed and observed
(not without excellent reason) in all
Christian Churches, that marriages
should be solemnized in the publick
Congregation of Gods people; so it
cannot but be requisite that it should
be done by him, who is ordained to
be the mouth of the Congregation
to God; &amp; the mouth of God to the
Congregatton; And, as under the
Law, the Priest was the man, who
must conveigh blessings from God
to his people; so under the Gospell
who can be so apt for this divine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as he that serves at the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
altar? And if all our marriages
must be (according to the Apostles


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:47749:200"/>
charge) made in the Lord, who is so
meet to pronounce Gods ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our marriages, as he who is the
profest Herald of the Almighty? As
it is therefore requisite (even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Roman Constitutions)
that hee who is betrusted with the
Cure of our soules, should besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
witnesses be both present &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

A fourth, is the indissoluble knot
of mariage with a former still survi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving
husband or wife; the force
whereof is such, as that it frustrates
and voideth any supervening matri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony
(except in the case specified
in the foregoing discourse of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce)
during the naturall life of the
consorts. Many unhappy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
cases have we met withall in
this kinde; neither doth it seldome
fall out, that the husband being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
reported for dead in the
warres, or in travell abroad; the wife
after some yeers stay, and diligent
inquisition, finding the rumor
strongly verified by credible testimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies,
and tendred oathes, begins to
listen to some earnest suitor; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
her self in a second marriage;
not long after which, her only true,
revived husband returnes, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
his right in that his lawfull
wife; pretending the mis-carri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge of


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47749:207"/>
letters and messages sent by him in
that forced absence. In this case what
is to be done? The woman hath cast
her self upon the danger of a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
law, except shee have expected
the time limited by statute; or if she
escape, one of the husbands is to seek
for a wife, whom both may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy:
Doubtless the second marriage
is by Ecclesiasticall authority to bee
pronounced, as it is, null; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
never had any true right to be:
and the first must be content to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
its own inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>A fifth, may be a violent enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the match: when a woman
is upon fear of pain, or death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to yeeld her self in marriage,
and is not perswaded, but affrighted
into the bonds of wedlock: surely
this is rather a rape then a matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and therefore, upon utter want of
consent, a nullity.</p>
                  <p>A sixt may be a preceding, irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47749:207"/>
impotency, or incapacity of
marriage duties; whether naturall,
or advantageous; whether by way
of perpetuall maleficiation, or casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty:
I say, preceding; for if any
such disability be subsequent to the
marriage, the nullity is avoided; But
if the persons find in themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
such remediless incapabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a marriage estate, they shall be
highly injurious to each other, and
shall fouly abuse the ordinance of
God, in their entring into such a
condition: for it is apparent, that
the main ends of marriage are herein
utterly frustrate; which were by
Gods appointment, the propagation
of mankinde, and the remedy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency;
neither of which being
attainable in such a defective estate
of body, justly is such a match pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a nullity.</p>
                  <p>But here I cannot but take occasion
to commend the modesty of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47749:208"/>
of our nation; amongst whom,
there are so rare examples of suits in
this kind, prosecuted in our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Consistories; it is not to be
doubted but there are many defects
of this nature to bee found every
where, yet scarce one in an age offers
to complain and call for redresse:
so as it seems they are willing to
smother all secret deficiencies, in a
bashfull silence; whereas those of
other warmer regions impatient of
the wrongs of their conjugall disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
fly out into open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
and fearelesly seeke for
those remedies which the lawes pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vided
in such cases will allow them.
Certainly the merit of this modest
temper is so much the greater, by
how much more it is concealed
from the world; and those of either
sexe that are content to bite in
their hidden grievances of this
kinde, are worthy of double


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47749:208"/>
honour from those Consorts, whose
injurious infirmities they both

wanting cases expresses it doubtfuly,
it will be cleare in the Latin; as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi>
and <hi>Pagnine,</hi> two great Masters


<pb n="388" facs="tcp:47749:212"/>
of the Hebrew in their <hi>Interlinear,</hi>
read it, <hi>Othniel filius Kenaz, fratris
Calebi; Othniel</hi> the sonne of <hi>Kenaz,</hi>
which <hi>Kenaz</hi> was <hi>Caleb's</hi> brother,
both the Hebrew &amp; Chaldee cleare
that sense: So the Septuagint, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel-Sa</hi>
also urges upon that place
<hi>Judg, 1. 13.</hi> expresly say that <hi>Kenaz</hi>
was the brother of <hi>Caleb,</hi> and not <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoniel;</hi>
wherein yet I cannot much
blame an unballanced judgement,
whiles I find the Septuagint contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to themselves: For in <hi>Josh. 15. 16</hi>
they say <hi>Othniel</hi> was <hi>Calebs</hi> younger
brother; In <hi>Judg. 3. 9.</hi> they say, <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naz</hi>
the father of <hi>Othniel</hi> was so; for
which there is no excuse, but the
large sense of a brother in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<hi>We are brethren,</hi> saith <hi>Abraham</hi>
to <hi>Lot,</hi> yet he was <hi>Lots</hi> uncle: so was
<hi>Kenaz</hi> a progenitor to <hi>Othniel;</hi> for
<hi>Caleb</hi> is stiled the son of <hi>Jephunneh</hi>
the <hi>Kenezite, Josh. 14. 14. &amp; Num. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:47749:212"/>
was the ancestor of <hi>Caleb;</hi> and one of
the same name was his brother, the
father of <hi>Othniel:</hi> what can be more
plain then 1 <hi>Chron. 4. 13. And the sons
of Kenaz, Othniel &amp; Seraiah;</hi> So as
if wee take this most strictly to the
letter; it implies nothing but the
marriage of two cozens german, <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niel</hi>
the son of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> and <hi>Achsah</hi> the
daughter of <hi>Caleb,</hi> brothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as <hi>Bucer</hi> upon the place, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton</hi>
in his Tract <hi>De Conjugio, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi>
and indeede, who otherwise?
And now by this time you see what
a poore ground this is to build upon;
rather, you see a castle, not built on
the sand, but in the ayre; meer mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit.</p>
                     <p>But, saith the Advocate, this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is no where directly forbidden
in the Law; I must tell him it is but a
meer shuffle to stand upon the terms
of a direct prohibition, when there is
one no lesse forceable &amp; convictive:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="390" facs="tcp:47749:213"/>
Two wayes may ought be effectu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally
forbidden in the law; Either in
plain expression of terms, or in clear
implication of sense; surely, that is
rather more in the law which it
means irrefragably, than what it ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bally
expresseth: now, however this
be not in the letter of the law, yet in
the sense it is: the same law that for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bids
the nephew to marry the aunt,
doth <hi>eadem operâ,</hi> forbid the uncle to
marry the neece; In regard as of
neerness, yea identity of blood, the
case is the same: however, som ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
may be conceived in respect
of government &amp; subjection. And if
upon som oeconomicall termes, it
be more unfit for a Nephew to mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
his Aunt, than for an Uncle to mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
his Neece, yet in regard of blood
and that bodily conjunction, which
God principally aymes at in this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hibition,
what difference can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bee conceived? Nature hath


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47749:213"/>
made no other distance betwixt the
Nephew and the Aunt, than bewixt
the Neece &amp; the Uncle: or if there
be any, they must be sharper eys than
mine that can discerne it: God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(me thinks) hath put this out of
doubt; the reason wherewith hee
backs his command is iresistible;
The Nephew shall not marry the
fathers sister; why so? <hi>For she is thy
fathers neer kinswoman, v. 12.</hi> Lo it is
the neerness of blood that makes this
match unlawfull, not respect of civil
inequality; Where the blood then is
equally neere, the marriage must be
equally unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>That rule of law which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>in prohibitoriis, quicquid non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibetur,
permittitur.</hi> What is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
is permitted, had neede of a
fair construction; Indeed, that which
is not forbidden either in words or in
necessary analogy &amp; implication of
sense, is supposed to be left at large,


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47749:214"/>
But what place hath this Axiome in
a case not less really forbidden than
the expressed? And if wee should
strictly follow the letter of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,
it would lead us into <hi>Sodome:</hi>
since there are marriages not specifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
which would be monstrously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous,
&amp; such as honesty would
blush to mention, as shall appeare in
the sequele.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there any more force in
that other, <hi>In poenalibus non fit exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi>
That penall lawes should not bee
stretcht further then their words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Certainly in som sense, I know
no law that is not penall: but why
this law, <hi>Thou shalt not marry thy Aunt
or Neece</hi> should be rather penal, than,
<hi>Thou shalt not commit adultry,</hi> I know
not; I am sure learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
these of the 18. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi>
equally morall: and <hi>Bucanus</hi> holds
them to be against the law of nature.</p>
                     <p>And if in humane laws this axiom


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:47749:214"/>
may challenge a place, yet in the roy
all laws of our Maker, where, under
one sin mentioned, all the species &amp;
appendances, and the whols claim of
that wickednesse is wont to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
doubtless it is utterly unsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
Neither is here any extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this prohibition beyond those
limits which God hath fixed in the
undoubted sense of his law. In the
seventh Commandement, nothing is
expressed but <hi>adultry,</hi> shall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
say neither <hi>fornication,</hi> nor <hi>pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
nor <hi>sodomie</hi> is there forbidden?
were not this to destroy that lawe,
which God makes to be spirituall,
and to open the flood gates to a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of licentiousnesse? surely, it is
easy to observe that Gods Spirit no
lesse meanes that which he pleaseth
to suppresse. The Psalmist sayes, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
comes neither from the East, nor
from the West, nor from the South, Psal.
75. 6.</hi> Shall we therefore say, Is is


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47749:215"/>
from the North? Is not that coast
equally excluded, though not expres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed?
It is too much boldness to hold
God too strictly to syllables, when
it is easie to determin what he meant
to imply: These rules then are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
Let me see now if the Advocat
can as easily shake off one or two
rules of law, which I shall return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in lieu of his. <hi>Is committit in
legem, &amp;c.</hi> Hee wrongs the law who
keeping close to the letter, strives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the intent and purpose of the
law: And that other not unlike, <hi>In
fraudem legis facit qui salvis verbis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
sententiam ejus circumvenit,</hi> If this
be not the case in hand, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
to know nothing.</p>
                     <p>From rules, let us look to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
It is directly maintained (hee
saith) by the Canonists and Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but what is it that is so main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?
Not this match (let no man
think so) but that proposition, <hi>viz:</hi>


                        <pb n="394" facs="tcp:47749:215"/>
that this match is no where directly
forbidden in Gods law, If wee take
it of express terms, no wise man ever
denied it; not Canonists &amp; Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
only, or those few named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
but all reasonable men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
in this truth; what needs a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some, where all agree? But if
we take it of the necessary &amp; cleare
sense of the law by just Analogy and
infallible implication, now, none of
the forecited, or any other orthodox
Authors will deny the certaine and
indubitable prohibition of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
How well the rest will speed,
judg by their fore-man, <hi>Tho: Aquinas</hi>
who expresly determines it a false
position, that those are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by God, who match within the
fourth degree, whereas this is in the
third; Not to say how stifly <hi>Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bard</hi>
urges the unlawfulness of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
to the very seventh degree,

none of all his cited Authors dare be
any other then professed enemies to
this match; no lesse, then the most

                     <p>As for <hi>Lyra,</hi> who is trailed in here,
and cited strongly in <hi>Othniels</hi> Case,
what shall I say? It grieves my soul
to see any well-minded Christian so
abused by mis-information: This au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor

&amp;c.</hi> Thou shalt not uncover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of thy Fathers sister, or thy
Mothers sister <hi>(&amp; eodem modo)</hi> and
in the same manner is forbidden the
marriage betwixt the brother, and
the daughter of the Aunt, for it is the
same degree, so <hi>Lyra:</hi> Nothing can
be more peremptory against this case


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:47749:216"/>
in favor of which he is alledged.</p>
                     <p>This would be the issue of all the
rest, if it were worth the while to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamin
them, in that, which yeelded,
nothing advanceth the cause of the
producer. They are all as professed
enemies to this match as my selfe;
only they deny an expresse mention
of this cause, which was never either
thought needfull, or intended to be
pleaded.</p>
                     <p>For the Protestant Divines which
are cited to give testimony to the
non-prohibition of this marriage, I
must cry shame upon those false
hands which have so palpably abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
both your friend &amp; the Authors:
Let me give but a taste of som, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon
Zanchius, Bucanus,</hi> who are
said to allow the match, by admiting
only the degrees mentioned to bee
prohibited; No place is instanced;
<hi>versatur in generalibus,</hi> You know the
word, but let your eyes be judges of


<pb n="398" facs="tcp:47749:217"/>
their opinion: <hi>Melancthon</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Sarah,</hi> in the second degree: <hi>Hoc gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du</hi>
(saith he) <hi>in linea inaequali &amp;c.</hi> In
this degree in an inequallline; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
are forbidden by Gods law,
because God doth universally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
a greater reverence to be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to a superior degree, then to an
equall: It is the very case in hand,
which <hi>Melancthon</hi> thus sentenceth:
For <hi>Zanchius,</hi> he citing the Text of
<hi>Levit. 18 13.</hi> Thou shalt not unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the nakednesse of thy Mothers
Sister; adds, <hi>ergo ne<expan>

&amp;c.</hi> Therfore no man (saith he) may
marry his Aunt, and that charge
which he gives concerning the Aunt
would God have to bee understood
also of the Uncle, which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
brother, or the Mothers bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiles he adds a reason of the
prohibition, For she is the neer kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of thy Father or Mother:


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47749:217"/>
Thus <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his book <hi>de Operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Dei.</hi> Lib. 4. <hi>de Sponsalibus,</hi> who
absolutely condemnes this marriage
as incestuous, and indispensable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bucanus,</hi> moving the case of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
marriage with <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rams</hi>
with <hi>Jochebed</hi> &amp;c. Leaves it in
doubt whether these men were (as
the times stood) particularly dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with by God, or whether they
sinned in thus marrying, even before
the law, against the law of nature, by
which he holds these matches utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prohibited; With what forehead
then could any Scholar obtrude
these fals allegations upon an honest
client, whether to draw his foot into
a snare, or to keep it there, under pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence
of favoring what they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
oppose.</p>
                     <p>As for the moderne Jewes, to
whom he stretches out his hand for
succour, it matters little what they
now teach or do; they are not more


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47749:218"/>
without God, then without honesty,
or credit; Their opinions are fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
their judgement frivolous, and
their practise not worth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or regard.</p>
                     <p>I rather descend to the resolution
of our owne Church; That our ever
honoured Mother hath passed her
condemnatory sentence upon this
marriage in her ratification of that
Orthodox and just Table of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
degrees, set forth by authority
under Archb. <hi>Parker,</hi> what doubt we
now? Do we acknowledg the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Voice of our dear and holy mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
the Church of England, and yet
question whether we should obey it?
Certainly in a case of Conscience, a
dutifull son (mee thinks should ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
hold fit to follow the sacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Church, then the
municipall Acts of the civill state. It
is an ill office of those that would set
Church and State, Canons and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes


<pb n="401" facs="tcp:47749:218"/>
together by the eares even in
these points wherin they are perfect
friends.</p>
                     <p>The statute of 32 of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. c.
38. intending to marre the Romish
market of gainfull dispensations, and
injurious prohibitions, professeth to
allow all marriages that are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by Gods law, such is this in
hand, prohibited, though not in the
Letter, yet in necessary inference and
interpretation. The Canon 99. of
1603. hath thus: No person shall
marry within the degrees prohibited
by the lawes of God, and expressed
in a Table set forth by authority, in
the yeer 1563. and all marriages so
made and contracted shal be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
incestuous and unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>What scruple can arise hence? here
is a perfect harmony betwixt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and Canon. It is a meer Cavill
(no better to take And for Or, as if
the meaning were, that all degrees,


<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47749:219"/>
whether prohibited by the lawe of
God, or expressed in that Table are
forbidden: This is a foule straine
both to Grammer and to the sence
and scope of the Canon, which
plainly intends to aver that all those
degrees prohibited in that table are
also forbidden by the laws of God.
A truth so certain, that if either self-love,
or love of gaine did not betray
the eye, it is a wonder how it should
abide a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>It is observable that neither sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
nor canon speak of an expresse
prohibition in Gods law, And the
Canon purposely distinguisheth the
termes prohibited by Gods law, and
expressed in the Table, as justly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there may be as strong a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hibition
in a sense implyed, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
expressed: Else, if our Lawes
(as is pretended) should give allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
(which God forbid) to any
marriages not expresly <hi>in terminis,</hi>


                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:47749:219"/>
forbidden; wee should have strange
and uncouth mixtures.</p>
                     <p>God by <hi>Moses</hi> expresly forbad the
uncovering the nakedness of Father
and Mother; hee expressed not the
nakednesse of Son and Daughter:
he expresly names the nakednesse of
the Fathers wife, he expresseth not
the nakednesse of the Mothers hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
He expresly names the naked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
of thy Sister, he expresseth not
the nakedness of thy Brother; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the nakednesse of thy Sons
Daughter, he expresseth not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of thy Daughters Son: He
expresseth the nakednesse of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wives Daughter, he expresseth
not the Mothers Husbands Sonne;
he expresseth the Fathers Sister, not
the Mothers Brother: He expresses
the Daughter in law, not the Son in
law. So as by this Rule, if it should
be carried only by meer verball ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
a woman might marry her


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:47749:220"/>
Son in law; the Nephew might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his great aunt, the neece her grea-uncle;
the Daughter might marry
her Mothers husbands Sonne; the
Grand-mother might marry her
Daughters son; the Daughter might
marry with her Mothers Husband;
Were these things to be allowed, the
world would be all <hi>Sodome:</hi> These
things therefore are of necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the law by a clere Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
no lesse then if they had beene
expressed.</p>
                     <p>But have there been, as hee saith,
precedents of this march? I am sory
to heare it; surely, the more the worse
and the more need to redresse it; the
addition of this, if neglected, would
help to strengthen an ill claim.</p>
                     <p>Cozens-german, he saith, have
beene allowed to marry; What is
that to the present case? The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is as much as betwixt a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
and an Uncle; The Uncle


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:47749:220"/>
hath too much of the Parents both
right, and blood, to challenge an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
claim with a Cozen.</p>
                     <p>In the shutting up, it pitties me to
see your worthy Friend driven to
this plea; and like a drowning man
to snatch at so small a twig: <hi>Being
done</hi> (he saith) <hi>it ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
Alas, the Canon is peremptory.
It is incestuous and unlawfull; what
plea is there for continuance? Speak
not therfore of either connivence or
dispensation; This match is only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a late, but much wished re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
on the Offenders part; and
a just diremption on the part of the
Judges.</p>

Divinity, there is no one that

qualification of the Persons, or the
emergency of actions and events. It
is the lawfulness of this match that
you inquire after, not the expedience
and I must shape my answer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>It hath been the wisdom and care
of our godly and prudent Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
to ordaine a Table of all the
prohibited degrees to be publiquely
hang'd up in all the severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                  <p>The question of the Expedience
would require another debate, doubt
less, in all cases of this nature, it must
needs be yeelded that it were more
meet and safe (since the world yeilds
so large a latitude of choice) to look
further off; a wise and good man will
not willingly trespasse against the
rules of just expedience: and will be
as carefull to consider what is fit to
be done, as what is lawfull; but that
comes not, at this time, within your
inquiry.</p>
                  <p>Whiles therfore I give my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

with the Relict of the wives bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
I doe no whit clash (as you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
with the judgement of <hi>Beza,</hi> and
Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> who professe their
dislike of such copulations: I shal as
readily cry them down for unmeet,


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:47749:222"/>
and inconvenient, as those, that
with too much boldnesse come over
neere to the Verge of a sinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
but for the not unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this match, I did upon the
first hearing give my affirmative an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
and the more I consider of it,
I am the more confirmed in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
                  <p>That universal rule mentioned by
you, as laid down by those two wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy
Authors, must indure a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Cujus non licet inire nuptias, ejus
nec conjugis licet;</hi> that there is the
same degree and force of relation of
a third person (in the case of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age)
to the husband and to the wife;
so as proximity of blood in the one,
should not be a greater bar then the
same proximity of alliance in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Otherwise, many more copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
will fall under censure, then
common practise will condescend
unto; and that ground of, <hi>uxor pars


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:47749:222"/>
quadam viri,</hi> The wife is as a part of
the husband, as it holds not in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
relation at all, so not in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall;
as might be too easily instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in divers particulars.</p>
                  <p>And if there were not som diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in these relations, those second
persons which are interessed in the
Husband or Wife, might not come
neer to the next in affinity to them;
For example, my Brother may not
marry my Sister, therefore by this
rule, he might not marry my Wives
Sister, and so it should bee unlawfull
for two Brothers to marry two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
then which nothing is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
or lesse obnoxious to disallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance.</p>
                  <p>That generall rule therefore, must
be restrained necessarily to the first
ranke of affinity; if we descend lower
it holds not. For further explanation,
our Civilians and Canonists are
wont to make two kinds or degrees


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:47749:223"/>
of Affinity, the one primary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
secondary; In the first is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
between the husband and the
Cozens of blood to his wife, or <hi>è co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;</hi>
which indeed is justly held no
lesse for a barr of marriage then his
own naturall consanguinity; for that
is an affinity contracted upon interest
of blood, by virtue of that entire u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between Man and Wife, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they both become one flesh; The
Secondary affinity is that wherein
there is another person added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
to that first kinde now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
the affinity arising only from
the interest of an affinity, formerly
contracted, not from consanguinity;
and this is not so binding as either to
hinder a marriage to be contracted,
or being contracted, to dissolve it.</p>
                  <p>In this rank are the brothers wife
and sisters husband; and therefore,
upon the decease of the brother and
sister, the husband of the sister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:47749:223"/>
and the wife of the deceased
brother may marry together, as Dr.
<hi>NicholausEverhardus</hi> out of <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
de Media Villa,</hi> and <note n="*" place="bottom">Consil, Matrimonial. Germanor. Consil. 5.</note>; Of this
kind is the marriage now questioned
which therfore doth not fall within
the compasse of the prohibition, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum

no bar to Matrimony; And with

in simplicity of heart be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt
two Persons ignorant of such

as that Children are borne in
that wedlock, ought to be made
known and prosecuted to a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
                  <p>IT is a question (as it may be put)
full of doubt and intricacy, Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
whereunto, and eminent in this
kind, was that case, which I had long
since from the relation of M. <hi>Perkins;</hi>
and since that, have met with it in
the report of two severall German
Authors.</p>
                  <p>The case thus: A Gentlewoman
of great note in those parts, being left
a Widow, had her son trained up in
her house; who now having passed
the age of his puberty, grew up as in
stature, so in wanton desires; earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:47749:224"/>
soliciting her Chamber-maid to
his lust; she had the grace not only
to repell his offers, but being weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his wicked importunity, to
complain to her Mistresse, of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
motions: The Mother out
of a purpose to repress this wild hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in her Son, bids the maid, in a
seeming yieldance to make appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the night following with him,
at which time shee would change
beds with the maid, &amp; schoole the
young man to purpose. This being
accordingly done, the Devil so farre
prevailed with the Mother, that in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
of chastising, she yeelded to the
lust of her Son, and by him concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Daughter: &amp; now finding her
self to grow big, for the hiding of
her shame, she retired secretly to a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mote
part of the country, where she
unknowne left the burden of her
wombe, and took order for all care
&amp; secrecy of education: After som


<pb n="390" facs="tcp:47749:225"/>
yeeres the Mother thinks fit to call
home her concealed issue, under the
pretence of a kinswoman, and gives
her such breeding in her house, as
might become the Child of a friend;
The maid grew up to such comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
both of person and behaviour,
that the Sonne, now grown a Man,
fell into passionate love with her, &amp;
in short, married her; little thinking
that hee was now matched with his
owne Daughter, he gotten by him of
his own Mother: They lived loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and comfortably together, and
had divers children betwixt them.
Only the Mother, who was alone
conscious of this monstrous copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
began to finde an hell in her
bosom; and in a deep remorse, made
the case, at last known to some
learned Divines of that time, who be
stowed many serious thoughts upon
so uncouth a businesse; and finally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon this determination. That


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47749:225"/>
all circumstances throughly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the penitent Mother should after
a sound humiliation secretly make
her peace with God, for so foul and
prodigious a sin; but that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the horrible incestuousness
of this match, should still and ever,
be concealed from the yong couple,
who thought of nothing but a faire
and honest legality in this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
                  <p>The decision of this point comes
somwhat home to yours; to spend
my opinion therefore in this case, I
find no reason, all things considered,
to vary from their judgment.</p>
                  <p>I say then, that the Mothers sinne
was not more hainous in yeilding to
so abominable an act of incest with
her Son, then in smothering the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
notice of it for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a worse incest with her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter;
for that first act of her incest was
transient, but this incest which was


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:47749:226"/>
occasioned by her silence was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
and derivable to her poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
She ought therfore, though to
her perpetuall shame, when she saw
an inclination in her Son, to so foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unnaturall a match, to have forestalled
it by a free confession, and to
have made him sensible of so odious
a procreation: Which not being
done, it must needs be said, that, as
the first act of the Sonne was a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
fornication, but an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
incest; so this incestuous copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Son with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was involuntary in them both;
and there cannot be an actuall sinne,
wherein there is not a consent of the
will.</p>
                  <p>On the one side, it is shamefull to
thinke that so grievous a sin should
passe without som exemplary cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
&amp; that so foule blood should be
propagated to succeeding ages, for
want of the timely intervention of


<pb n="417" facs="tcp:47749:226"/>
a vindicative authority; but on the
other side, it would be well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what miserable inconveniences,
yea mischiefs would follow upon so
late a discovery; First, all honest
hearts are put into a just; but unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
horror, to think that such a
flagitious wickedness could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
Then the Mother, who had
rinced her soule with a fountain of
teares, for so hatefull a miscarriage,
and reconciled her self to that God,
who was the only witness of her sin,
should bee so late exposed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
shame of that world, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>,
never was privy to her offence.</p>
                  <p>As for the yong couple thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously
conjoyn'd, how could they
choose, upon the too late notice of
their so deplorable condition, but
run mad for anguish of soule, and
weare out the rest of their dayes in
shame and sorrow: And for the
children born to them in so detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47749:227"/>
a wedlock, whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
beheld with complacence &amp;
comfort, as the sweet pledges of
their conjugall love, how must they
now needs look upon them, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
monuments of their ignominy;
and loath them as the most basely
begotten imps of a worse then besti
all copulation. And when riper age
should bring that unhappy of spring
forth into the world how should they
be every where pointed at, &amp; hooted
after as som strange aberrations of
nature; all which are avoyded by
this secrecy.</p>
                  <p>But if on the other side you shall
reply that this one evill is more, then
equivalent to all these; that in the
meane time, these parties live in a
continuall Incest, and traduce it to
following generations; I must put
you in minde to distinguish betwixt
the state of Incest, and the Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest;
It is true they live in a state of


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47749:227"/>
Incest, but, from the sin of Incest
they are excused by an ignorance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
invincible; an ignorance
both of the originall fact, &amp; of their
mutual relations; for it is to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed,
that had they had the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the natural interest of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp; daughter, they would with
much indignation have defied so
foul a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixture, which even bruite
creatures (if wee may beleeve histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
have by the instinct of nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominated,
&amp; upon after knowledg,
revenged.</p>
                  <p>And if any light of knowledge
had broken forth unto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of that condition wherein they
stood, then to have continued under
that state of Incest, but an houre, had
been damnably sinful; now all those
inevitable consequences of shame &amp;
horror must have been sleighted &amp;
forgotten, and must have shut up in
a sodain dissolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:47749:228"/>
But as there are many degrees of
Incest, and the sin is so much more,
or lesse haynous, as the parties are
neerer or more remote; I perceive
the case intimated by you, concerns
a lower ranke of incestuous copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
namely, an incest arising from
a mans carnall knowledge of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
too neere in blood unto her,
whom he afterwards marrieth; The
fact known only by one, who now
doubts whether he be not bound to
reveale it: And why not sooner,
when so faulty a match might have
been prevented? why so late, when
the remedy intended, would bee as
noxious as the disease? Why at all,
when there is no necessity or use of
the revelation? This question starts
another more universall, how farre
we may or ought to mak known the
secret sin of another? Doubtlesse to
prevent som enormous act, which
may follow upon our silence; or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:47749:228"/>
the urging of lawfull authority,
when we are called to give evidence
concerning a fact questioned; Or to
antevert some great danger to the
publique, to our selves, to our friend,
we may, &amp; must disclose our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of a closs wickedness; Or if the
act be so haynously flagitious, and
redounding to so high dishonour of
God, as that our Conscience tells us
shall participate of this sinne in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
it; our holy zeal shall herein
bear us out in a just accusation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this case, heede must be
taken, that our single crimination
may be so carried and made good by
circumstances, that it draw us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the perill of a slander; But, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these, I cannot see, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
of a secret sinne, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
any otherwise than an act of
Detraction; than which, nothing can
be more odious and prejudiciall to
humane society: Wee have learn'd


<pb n="398" facs="tcp:47749:229"/>
from <hi>Aquinas</hi> that there are eight
wayes of this hatefull practise;
whereof foure are direct; the raysing
of a false crime, the amplifying of a
true crime; the disclosing of a crime
secret, and the sinister construction
of anothers fact. To these I must
adde, that even where the act is such
as challengeth a revelation, the time
may bee unseasonable and past the
date. You know that the notice of
treason, if too long smothered,
drawes the concealer into danger:
and in this case, though there be no
perill in the silence, yet there may be
injury: Shortly, this sinne, if ever,
should have been so early made
known to the party concerned, as
might have prevented the making
up of a match secretly sinfull; and
have convinced the agent of a foule
illegality, whereof he was ignorant.
But now thus overlate, would break
out to an unprofitable vexation,


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47749:229"/>
since this crime which might justly
have hindred the marriage from be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
contracted, ought not to have
the force, after so long intermission
and successe of an intervenient wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
to dissolve it. The time was,
when the Minister in a solemne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conization,
called you either <hi>then to
speake,</hi> or <hi>for ever after to hold your
peace:</hi> had you then spoken it might
have been construed as zeale, now,
not to hold your peace, will bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
no better then malice.</p>
