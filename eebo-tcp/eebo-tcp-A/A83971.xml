            <title>Englands losse and lamentation, occasioned by the death of that Right Honourable, Robert Lord Brooke, Baron of Beauchamp-court, who was slaine at Lichfield the second day of March. 1642. Amplified, by some mournfull funerall expressions, from the authors feeling sense of so unvaluable a losse; complaining of the kingdomes stupidity, to awake a people slumbering in security, insensible of their insuing misery. Concluding with some consolations to his friends, and terror to his enemies popishly affected, and all malignants. By a loyall subject to the King, and a lover of the late Lord Brookes, and all his wel-wishers.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>NGLAND</hi> may juſtly, at this day lament, with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and ſay: <hi>How hath the Lord covered</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>the daughter of Zion, with a cloud in his anger? and caſt downe from Heaven to the Earth, the beauty of Iſrael? As if the Lord had purpoſed to deſtroy the wall of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion? He hath not withdrawn his hand from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he made the Rampart, and the wall, to lament: He hath deſtroyed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her barres: Her King and Princes are among the Gentiles: The Law is no more. Her Prophets find no viſion, The Elders ſit upon the ground and keep ſilence: they have caſt up duſt upon their heads and girded themſelves with ſackcloth.</hi> And for my ſelfe, mine eyes doe faile, with teares, my ſoule is troubled, becauſe of <hi>Englands</hi> miſeries. Her own ſword hath deſtroyed her Prophets, like a deſtroying Lion: her young men are ſlaine, her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins are defloured, famine is entering in upon her. When children and ſucklings, wil ſay, to their mothers where it bread? Where is drink? when they ſwoone as the wounded in the ſtreets, and powre their ſoules into their mothers boſome.</p>
            <p>O <hi>England,</hi> where is thy glory? Thy Freedome, Liberty, Lawers and Religion? ſhall thy freedome be loſt, and thy hereditary liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be taken from thee, thy juſt Lawes corrupted, and thy Religion adulterated, by Idolatry? and yet will you not ſee it? Shall thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits be deſtroyed, and thy honorable men ſlaine by the ſword; and thou not avenge it? Where is thy zeale to God? where is thy care, thy love, thy Juſtice, to poſterity? art not thou guilty of depriving thy children, of the bleſſing, which God hath by thy Fathers, given thee? wilt thou not maintaine thine owne inheritance, and the rights
<pb facs="tcp:125378:3"/>
of thy children? or wilt thou ſuffer thoſe worthyeſt to be deſtroyed, that loſe their lives in thy defence, and not avenge their bloud?</p>
            <p>Is there not a Prince, and a great man fallen in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> fallen by upholding thee? and not onely a Prince, and a great man, but a holy juſt, and righteous, great man: a Pillar of the Church a ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the State, That right Honorable <hi>Robert Lord Brooke;</hi> rightly to be honoured to laſting poſterities? He was honeſt, and juſt to all men: righteous in all his wayes, and religious in his whole life; learned in all arts: And able in all Sciences: Loyall to his King, faithfull to his Country: And valiant in his undertakings for the defence of both: to his end pittifull to his enemies, in his end happy to himſelfe. And by his end terror to his enemies; whoſe bloud will haſten vengeance upon the actors, and cauſes of ſuch cruelties.</p>

               <note place="margin">We cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count better of thoſe men then ſons of '<hi>Belial,</hi> and limbs of the devil: Who at the newes of this noblemans death, called their helliſh companions to the Taverns, and for joy drunke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves drunk, and in their drunkeneſſe ſpake ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; railing ſpeches againſt Him: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them.

            <p>O <hi>England</hi> conſider: What haſt thou loſt? But why doe I aske thee? thou knoweſt not thine owne loſſe; Thou art in thy ſtupidity: or in a ſlumber of carnall ſecurity, a fooliſh and undiſcerning Nation! Thou rejecteſt thy friends, and imbraceſt thine enemies; Thou loveſt pelfe, and ſlighteſt pearles, art at peace with thy deſtroyers, and makeſt War with thy preſervers.</p>
            <p>That haſt loſt a Noble refreſhing <hi>Brooke,</hi> an unvaluable friend, a pearle of great price, a <hi>Hector</hi> better then ever <hi>Troy</hi> injoyed: an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> more valiant then ever <hi>Greece</hi> poſſeſſed.

for ſuch a loſſe, a pillar of the Kingdome, a ſtaffe of the War, a peere of the Parliament, a Patriarch of his Country, a ſincere ſervant of God: and a loyall Subject to the King, and State? He, this pillar, this ſtaffe, this Peere, this Patriarch, Gode ſervant, the Kings Subject; He is ſlaine: ſlaine in the Kings and his Kingdomes cauſe, ſlaine treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, baſey, and cowardly, by an Enemy and Traytor to both.</p>
            <p>If <hi>David,</hi> a King, lamented over <hi>Abner</hi> (though he had beene his<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 33.</note> Enemy) how much more ſhould we lament over this our <hi>Abner?</hi> a friend alwayes, and to the death, as faithfull as <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> But how died this Noble <hi>Brooke,</hi> died he as a foole dieth! no; died he by the hands of his equall? no; died he in a battel by any valour of any Enemy? no; But how died he? As a man that falleth before wicked men, to fell our Noble <hi>Brooke:</hi> and all his friends weep, and lament for him.</p>
            <p>Weepe thou, his vertuous Lady, cry yee, pretty children, (his owne pictures) weepe al yee his Souldiers, mourne yee his ſervants, bewaile your loſſe all you his Friends, Tenants, Neighbours, and Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; And you poore people (weekly relieved by his bounty) weepe and houle, yea, lament whole <hi>England,</hi> becauſe he is not; Thou wilt know thy loſſe, by the want of him: (though thou prizedſt not thy gaine whileſt thou hadſt him,) but thou canſt not recover thy loſſe; I cannot but take up my lamentation for thee, as once the Prophet did<note place="margin">Lam. 2. 13. &amp;c.</note> for <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> by way of quaere, What ſhall I witneſſe of thee? what ſhall I equall to thee, that I may comfort thee? for thy breach is great like the Sea, who can heale it? Thou haſt beene deluded by thy Prophets: thy ſeers have ſeene falſe burdens, cauſes of thy miſery miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of thy King, and Princes: Thou art a deriſion to the Nations that have feared, and honoured thee. Thy idolatrous Enemies open<note place="margin">Eſay 57. 1. Lam. 2. 21.

Crowne: He died in Gods cauſe, and his workes are with him.</p>
            <p>His Ladies teares, his Childrens cries, his Souldiers weeping, his Servants mourning, his Friends bewailing, his Neighbours ſorrow, his Tenants griefe, and his Acquaintance moanings; The Poores complainings, and the Kingdomes lamentations, can adde nothing to his happineſſe; They may all expreſſe their owne unhappineſſe and irrecoverable loſſe.</p>
            <p>But thou <hi>Lichfield,</hi> the ſinke of iniquity, cage of uncleane and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits: ungodly, prophane, and moſt prodidiouſly wicked: chiefe inſtrument of the Kingdomes miſery! let the remembrance of thee be hatefull; and thy name blotted out from among the Townes of the Provinces. And let it not faile that ſome of thy inhabitants, be for ever viſited with ſome Diſeaſes; fall by the Sword, and want bread: <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 29</note>Hee whom thou haſt ſlaine, hath finiſhed his courſe, reſts from his labour, and his ſoule is for ever bleſſed; The cry of his bloud is gon to Heaven, to haſten vengeance upon thee, and his enemies.</p>
            <p>And you his friends, and Souldiers, be you humbled, who (it is likely) are not guiltleſſe of his death: you have too much deified his worth, and provoked God to take him from us: When good men are contemned, God taketh them away, that he may the ſooner deſtroy a Nation, or people, as <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot:</hi> And when good men are deified, (that is, rather looked upon as cauſes, then inſtruments) God alſo takes them away, becauſe his glory is by them eclipſed, in dlivering a Nation, or people; as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who died in the Mount; whoſe Sepulcher was never knowne to this day. And that victorious King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who in his life time foretold the ſame of himſelf: Therfore let every man looke to his owne heart, and finde out the ſinne that hath diſpleaſed God, and be humbled; and then be not diſcouraged by this Noble mans death, but rather get more courage, manfully to avenge his guiltleſſe blood, and God will aſſiſt you; The cauſe is Gods, himſelfe is engaged in it with you; put forth your ſtrength, uſe your weapons, make your beſt preparations, but truſt in nothing (neither men nor Armes) but in God, who is alone the God of battell, and Lord of Hoſts; he will ſupply you with an other <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> to goe before you, and will not faile you, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you. <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him; and if you ſeeke him, he will be found of you.</hi> You have double encouragement to go on with<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 6. 2 Chro. 15 2: Pſal. 20. 1.</note> confidence in this cauſe; you have Gods promiſe, and you have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his gracious preſence going with you in it: <hi>The Lord heare you in the day of your trouble, the God of Iacob defend you.</hi>

The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly, and reſerve the unjuſt to be puniſhed, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Gods promiſes of this nature are obvious in every booke of holy Scripture; yea God is delighted to deliver his people, when they truely ſeeke to him.

Sometime God doth it becauſe of particular failings in men; ſometimes to make way for the worke of ſome other part of his providence, as it was in the death of righteous <hi>Ionathan;</hi> or for the clearer manifeſtation of his own power and glory: yet ſuch men faile not of their part, in ſuch promiſes; but enjoy a greater good, and better promiſe, of which the other is but a ſhadow: and we have aſſurance, that <hi>all things worke together for the good of them</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When whole Kingdoms conſent to ſinne, and aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in wickedneſſe, then whole Kingdomes are deſtroyed; and when Churches ſet up Idolatry, and wholly forſake God, and adulterate Gods pure worſhip, God gives them over to be deſtroyed: for as God<note place="margin">Judg. 3. 7, 8.</note> promiſeth deliverance when Idolatry is thruſt out, by diſlike and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb facs="tcp:125378:5"/>
ſo he denounceth deſtruction and deſolation where wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Idolatry is authorized: So when religion conſiſts onely in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>form and outſide-worſhip, without the love, and power of it: (as now) then God brings a people into the fire of affliction, in which, without reformation they may be conſumed; but if ſuch a Kingdome, or ſuch a Church doe then humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeeke Gods face,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 7. 14</note> 
                  <hi>he will be mercifull to their ſinne, and will heale their Land.</hi> But the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body of this Kingdome have not aſſociated in wickedneſſe, nor is the worſhip of God, yet, wholly adulterated; but Idolatry op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that body, and many thouſands beſides in this Kingdome, againſt whom wicked men and I dolaters give counſell, and doe aſſociat themſelves to hinder the reformation they deſire. Therefore, (though not for our righteouſneſſe, but) for the wickedneſſe of thoſe men, we may, and ought, to reſt with confidence upon the promiſe of God for our deliverance if our humiliation be good, and our deſire of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on right.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for incouragement, take notice of the experiences of Gods gracious preſence, going with us in this Parliament, as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring them out of their Egyptian bondage; he hath by his own hand wrought great things by them, and for them: he hath been to them a pillar of a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, to guid, and to defend them: It was no ſmall part of providence to bring them together, and wonderfull in guiding, directing, providing, preferring, and defending of them; and no leſſe wonderfull in diſcovering, defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and blaſting the deſignes of their enemies.
