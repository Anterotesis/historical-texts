            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Most Gracious SOVERAIGN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOw unwilling I am that any thing of mine should be made <hi>publick,</hi> needs (as I conceive) no other proof but this, That I am now past my great <hi>Climacteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and this is the First time that ever I appear'd in <hi>Print:</hi> Neither would I have done so Now, unless Your Majesty's <hi>own immediate</hi> and <hi>express Command</hi> (which in all things not <hi>evidently</hi> forbidden by God, is alwayes to be <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>) had obliged me to do it.</p>
            <p>And truly I am somewhat the more willing to comply with this Obligation; because since the preaching of this Sermon I have been inform'd, that some Exceptions have been taken against it. As first in <hi>General,</hi> That I medled with matter of <hi>State,</hi> an argument Excentrick to my <hi>Profession,</hi> and Improper for the Pulpit. And secondly in <hi>Particular,</hi> That by Repeating and Reviving some passed miscarriages, I had trespassed against the <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for Answer to the <hi>Former</hi> of these Charges, I shall humbly offer it to Your Majesty's Consideration, Whether a Divine, even in the Pulpit, may not without exceeding the Compass of his Commission, endeavour (as much as in him lies)
<pb facs="tcp:97246:3"/>
to recommend to the Consciences, and to endear to the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Auditors, the <hi>legally establish'd</hi> Government both in Church and State; And what more effectual Motive is there to make men Conscionably and chearfully to submit to the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally established</hi> Government, then by making it to appear, That it is the <hi>best of Governments</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> and the <hi>best for them</hi> also, by putting them in mind of the miseries they have brought upon themselves by the Alteration of it, and of the unhappy trials they have made of <hi>all other forms</hi> of Government that <hi>differ from it;</hi> and consequently, how much they are obliged to be thankfull unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God for being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to it, and to be so much the more Obedient for the future to the Laws of it, for having heretofore so Foolishly, as well as Wickedly, Revolted from it. Now if this be no part of a Divines business, or if a Discourse of this Nature be Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Pulpit, why doth God himself in Scripture command us to <hi>put men in mind of these things,</hi> as he doth, <hi>Tit. 3.1. Rom. 13.1. 1. Pet. 2.13.</hi> and in many other places? Or why are there <hi>Homilies for Subjection,</hi> and <hi>against Rebellion,</hi> commanded by Soveraign Authority to be read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people? Or lastly, Why are we enjoyn'd by the very <hi>first Canon</hi> of our Church, to preach four times a year at least, upon this Argument, I mean, for the <hi>Asserting</hi> the Kings <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> and Soveraign Authority over all his Subjects? And consequently, for the condemning of all taking up of <hi>Arms against</hi> him, as likewise all pretences of Jurisdiction over him, or of Coordination with him, together with the Exercising of any Power Military, Civil, or Ecclesiastical, that is not derived from him; which being all of them evidently inconsistent with the Kings Supremacy and Soveraignty, the <hi>same Authority</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97246:3"/>
which enjoyns us to preach <hi>for</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> must needs allow us at least, to preach <hi>against</hi> the <hi>other.</hi> Which being as much, or more then I have done in This Sermon, I hope that neither Your Majesty, nor any other impartial Hearer or Reader of it will blame me, for not keeping within the verge of mine own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or for taking more liberty then ought to be made use of in the Pulpit; especially at <hi>such</hi> a <hi>time,</hi> and upon <hi>such</hi> an <hi>occasion,</hi> when after so long a series of several forms of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Usurpation, Monarchy (which seemed to have been Put to Death with Your Majesty's <hi>blessed Father</hi>) was again Revived by Your sacred Majesties Personal Inauguration in so solemn, so magnificent, and so glorious a manner, beginning with as loud shouts and Acclamations, as could be made here on Earth, and ending with much louder shouts and Acclamations even from Heaven it self; For they that take <hi>that voice</hi> of God for a sign of his being <hi>Displeased</hi> with the fore-going Action, would perhaps (if they had been then present) have taken the same voice of God for a sign of his being Displeased with <hi>Christs Baptism;</hi> for it was in <hi>Thunder</hi> that he spake, even <hi>then</hi> also.</p>
            <p>But whether I am Guilty of the First Charge, or no, in Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with things Improper for a Pulpit, which (if true) had been but an <hi>Indiscretion</hi> onely; I am very sure, I am not Guilty of the Second, I mean, of speaking any thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the <hi>Act of Indempnity;</hi> which had been an high <hi>Presumption</hi> in any man, and in <hi>me</hi> a sin against <hi>mine own Judgement and Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I humbly conceive, That <hi>whatsoever promise</hi> a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince makes unto his subjects (so the matter of it be not sinfull) he ought in <hi>Prudence,</hi> as well as in <hi>Conscience</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97246:4"/>
to <hi>perform</hi> it, yea though perhaps he must needs <hi>prejudice himself</hi> by it. Because a Soveraign Princes <hi>Word,</hi> being the best and highest <hi>Security</hi> he can give unto his Subjects, he were better suffer a very great Incovenience by <hi>keeping</hi> it, then weaken the <hi>publick Security,</hi> or hazard the losing of his <hi>Credit</hi> with his People by <hi>breaking</hi> it. Which Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made that wise and great Prince <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>fourth,</hi> Your Maj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sties <hi>Grandfather,</hi> so Religious an observer of his Word, that neither the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> nor any other of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that had formerly stood out against him, when they came to an Agreement with him, did ever desire or demand <hi>any other Caution</hi> for security of their Persons and Interests, but the <hi>Kings word onely.</hi> And therefore God forbid, that I, or any man else, should dare to suggest any thing unto Your Majesty, either publickly, or privately, in order to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of so <hi>Sacred a Bond,</hi> as the <hi>Word of a King</hi> is, and hath alwayes been esteemed to be.</p>
            <p>Especially, when the <hi>thing it self,</hi> which a King hath Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or given his Word for, is so <hi>Necessary</hi> in order to the <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of Himself, and of his Kingdome, as I believe an <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi> (at this time, and in this conjuncture of Affairs) to be: There being no other way (as <hi>I</hi> humbly conceive) after so General and Long a disturbance and confusion, to compose and quiet mens minds by Securing them from their Fears, or to beget a <hi>Mutual Confidence</hi> betwixt the Prince and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without which, it is Impossible either for the Prince or People ever to be Happy in one another.</p>
            <p>And therefore Your Majesty's Grandfather, whom I before named, did not onely <hi>pardon All</hi> his Subjects that came in to him (<hi>how much soever</hi> they had before offended him) but to
<pb facs="tcp:97246:4"/>
               <hi>secure</hi> them the better from their <hi>fears,</hi> and to oblige them the more to his service, he <hi>Honoured</hi> some of them with Titles of great Quality, and with Offices of great Trust and Importance; and I do not find, that <hi>any</hi> of them gave him Cause to <hi>repent</hi> of it. And I hope Your Majesty will find the same success that he had, in doing as He did; Or rather as God himself did; when he did not onely <hi>receive</hi> the Prodigal Child, but <hi>feasted</hi> him, and made as much of him, as if he had never given him cause to be displeased with him, though his Elder Brother repined at it.</p>
            <p>But then, as Your Majesty hath been pleased to remember and imitate, what that most Exemplary Prince, Your <hi>Grandfather,</hi> did; so it will well become those, whom Your Majesty hath so much obliged, to Remember and Consider, what the same Great and Wise King used often to say, namely, <hi>That though he would be always ready to make Peace with any of the Leaguers, yet he would never make Peace with the League.</hi> His meaning was, That though he would pardon <hi>any</hi> that had <hi>engaged</hi> against him, yet he would never endure that the <hi>Engagement</hi> it <hi>self</hi> should afterwards be own'd, or justified by any of his Subjects; This being in Effect not an Act of <hi>Indempnity</hi> for what they had done against him for the <hi>time past;</hi> but an Act of <hi>Allowance</hi> for what they should do against him for the <hi>future:</hi> And consequently, not so much a <hi>Pardon</hi> of sin, as an <hi>Invitation</hi> to sin.</p>
            <p>Whereas an Act of Indempnity, as it is meerly an Act of Grace and Favor in him that Grants it; so it supposeth both <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> of a fault in him that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he that truly Repents of a fault, will not be Angry when he is told of it, especially, when he is told of it by way of <hi>Caution</hi> against it, and not by way of <hi>upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97246:5"/>
him with it, or for it. And how can a Preacher be said to upbraid any man in particular, when he speaks against sin in General? and that in order to the <hi>humbling</hi> of <hi>all</hi> men before <hi>God,</hi> and not to the <hi>shaming</hi> of <hi>any</hi> man before <hi>men?</hi> Especially, when in clear and express Terms he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that it is <hi>not</hi> his <hi>meaning,</hi> to charge the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cause of Gods Judgments upon <hi>any one party,</hi> Order, or sect of men, and much less upon <hi>any one man</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but upon the <hi>whole Nation</hi> in general, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as well and as much upon himself, as upon any of those that heard him?</p>
            <p>And now, if this be not enough to clear me from having any Intention in any thing I said, to <hi>derogate</hi> from the <hi>Act of Indempnity,</hi> All that I have to say more is, That Your Majesty having Heard me, and Commanded me to Print what I then spoke, must either Absolve me, or Suffer with me. And having This Security, I confess, I do not much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what <hi>hath been,</hi> or <hi>can be</hi> said of</p>

            <p>For though it hath pleased God to suffer <hi>all</hi> that <hi>this</hi> great King and Wise Philosopher hath written of natural Speculation (<hi>from the Cedar to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope, and from the greatest of beasts and fishes, to the least of creeping things,</hi> 1 King. 4.33.) to be <hi>utterly

lost</hi>; as being a kind of knowledge that was more likely to puff up, then to edifie, and to make men by too much poreing upon the <hi>creature,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or neglect to look up to the <hi>Creator</hi>: Yet as for that practical kind of knowledge, whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>better</hi> as well as <hi>wiser</hi> (whether it concern us in relation unto <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Divinity</hi>; or in relation to <hi>our selves,</hi> as <hi>morality</hi>; or in those relations which <hi>one man</hi> hath unto <hi>another,</hi> as the <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomicks</hi>) in order to the making of us <hi>honest Men, good subjects, good neighbors,</hi> and <hi>good Christians,</hi> whatsoever I say was written by <hi>Solomon</hi> to any of these ends, is all of it, or most of it, or at least as much of it, as is sufficient for our use and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yet extant in the Books of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>; of which the First and the Last are almost wholly <hi>Theological</hi>: the Book of the <hi>Canticles</hi> being an <hi>Holy charm,</hi> as it were, to draw us unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and to make us in love with him, by an <hi>Allegorical,</hi> but most <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical</hi> discription of Christs Loveliness in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of the excellency of His Love unto us; And the other of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> being an <hi>holy Satyre</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the world and worldly things, written on purpose to wean us from them, by shewing us the vanity and vexation of them. But <hi>this</hi> book of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is a Divine Miscellany or mixture of Theological, Moral, Political and Oeconomical Aphorisms or Observations: and those not like
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97246:6"/>
               <hi>links</hi> of the same chain, having a natural depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance one upon another; but rather like Pearls upon the same string, which though they are all of them equally useful and precious in their several kinds, yet few of them have so necessary a conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with one another, but that we may take most of them asunder, and consider them apart by themselves, without any prejudice at all either to the Text or Context.</p>
            <p>And thus we are now to consider the words I have read unto you, which are an Aphorism, or Observation partly <hi>Political,</hi> and partly <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>; for as it observes <hi>many Princes</hi> in a Land to be a National Calamity, so it is <hi>Political</hi>; but as it observes, That Calamity to be a National Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a Judgement of <hi>God</hi> upon the Land, for the sins of the people of that Land, so it is <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as it observes, That by a <hi>man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge</hi> the state of a Land is prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, so it is <hi>Political</hi>; but as by a <hi>man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge,</hi> it means (as you shall see it does) a man that understands and knows what <hi>God</hi> would have him to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>does</hi> it, so it is <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological</hi>; and seems to be the Observation, not of <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> or of <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>Statesman</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> or of <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>Preacher</hi> also. And therefore as it deserves a much better Preacher then I am, to Discourse upon it:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97246:7"/>
so it may become the Greatest of Kings, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of Statesmen to Hearken to it. Neither can there be a more Seasonable Occasion then <hi>this</hi> for the consideration of it: and therefore, if it have not somewhat more then ordinary influence upon our affections for the present, and upon our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the future, it must be, and I am afraid it will be my want of skill and ability, either to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it clearly, or to apply it pertinently, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it powerfully; which I hope, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my infirmities, God will give me grace to do in some measure. Howsoever being by <hi>command</hi> of my <hi>Superiours</hi> to speak before a <hi>great King</hi> at <hi>such</hi> a solemn <hi>time,</hi> and upon <hi>such</hi> an extraordinary <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as <hi>This,</hi> I would not presume to do it, but in the <hi>words</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>King</hi> as was both the wisest of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the wisest of <hi>men,</hi> and that not of his own time onely, but of all that ever was before him, or ever shall be after him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he was most fit to prescribe to <hi>Princes,</hi> how they are to <hi>govern,</hi> and to <hi>Subjects</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how they are to <hi>obey</hi>; so was he most able to foresee and judge how and by what means a <hi>State</hi> and Kingdom might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>ruin'd</hi> or <hi>preserv'd,</hi> and the date thereof ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shortned or prolonged. For as the body Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, so the body Politick is either shorter or longer liv'd, according to the good or bad constitution of it, or according to the more or less skil or care of Him that governs it, or lastly, as there is more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97246:7"/>
or less of the fear of God in the Subjects of it. For though the constitution of a State be never so sound and healthful, and though He that sits at the Helm be never so skilful and careful, yet if the generality of the People be wicked and willful, God doth usually punish the madness and folly of such a People, with permitting them to be instruments of their own misery, by changing the <hi>best form</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under <hi>one lawful Hereditary Prince,</hi> into the <hi>worst</hi> kind of Tyranny, under <hi>many lawless V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers</hi> and <hi>Oppressors.</hi> For it is <hi>for the transgression of a land,</hi> saith the Wiseman in my Text, that <hi>the Princes thereof are many: But by a man of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge, shall the state thereof be prolonged.</hi> Where from the word [<hi>But</hi>] which stands in the middle of my Text, and divides the Latter Clause of it from the Former, we may collect that what <hi>follows</hi> this dividing Particle is to be understood in <hi>opposition</hi> to that which is <hi>before</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And therefore by a <hi>man of understanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as there must needs be meant a <hi>single person</hi> in opposition unto <hi>many</hi>: so the <hi>single person,</hi> that is here meant, must needs be a <hi>Prince,</hi> because he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd not to <hi>many</hi> simply and indefinitely; but to <hi>many Princes</hi>: And then from this <hi>Aphorisme,</hi> thus understood, we may conclude;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> or the government of a Nation or Land by <hi>many Princes,</hi> is a <hi>National Judgement,</hi> or a Great judgement of God upon a Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97246:8"/>2. That <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or the government of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by <hi>one Soveraign Prince onely,</hi> (especially if he be a Man of Understanding and knowledge,) is a great <hi>National blessing,</hi> or a great blessing of God upon a Nation.</p>
            <p>And as we have found the <hi>one</hi> of <hi>these</hi> Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be true by <hi>our own</hi> woful <hi>experience</hi> already; so I hope we shall find the <hi>other</hi> of them to be as true, by <hi>our own</hi> joyful <hi>experience</hi> hereafter. And that this Nation of ours, which was so neer perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Conduct of <hi>many,</hi> shall by <hi>one man of understanding and knowledge</hi> not onely be recovered from its former distempers and dangers for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, (as thanks be to <hi>God</hi> for it, it is in a great measure) but setled and established, and the state thereof prolonged (if it be not our own fault) for the future.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Passover,</hi> the greatest of the Jewish Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals, was not to be celebrated without eating of <hi>soure herbs,</hi> to put them in mind of their former slavery, and thereby to make them the more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sensible of their present liberty; so at <hi>this</hi> great Festival of ours, to make us relish the better our present Happiness, and to prepare us the better for our future Hopes, it will not be amiss to make a reflexion upon our past Sufferings, and the Causes of them, to the end that <hi>God</hi> being first justified in his <hi>late</hi> great <hi>judgements</hi> deservedly inflicted upon us, may afterwards be the more heartily magnified for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97246:8"/>
his <hi>present</hi> great <hi>mercies</hi> undeservedly vouchsafed unto us.</p>
            <p>We shall begin therefore with the former of these conclusions, namely,</p>
            <p>That <hi>plurality of Princes</hi> in a State is a <hi>great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon a Nation.</p>
            <p>Which may be proved, first <hi>à priore,</hi> from the <hi>cause</hi>; and secondly, <hi>à posteriore,</hi> from the <hi>effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And first for the proof of it <hi>à priore,</hi> or from the <hi>cause,</hi> we need go no further then my <hi>Text,</hi> which makes good this Conclusion in all the parts of it.</p>
            <p>For first, it proves it to be a <hi>judgement,</hi> because it is for <hi>transgression,</hi> or because transgression is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cause of it; from whence by the way we may observe likewise, That if <hi>plurality</hi> of Princes be for <hi>transgression,</hi> then if there had been <hi>no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi> there would <hi>not</hi> have been a government by <hi>plurality of Princes</hi>; and consequently, that such a government is originally neither from <hi>God,</hi> nor from <hi>Nature,</hi> nor from the Dictates of Right <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> but from <hi>sin,</hi> which is alwayes the Meritorious, and sometimes the Efficient cause of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it appears from the Text, that <hi>plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> is not onely a <hi>judgement</hi> because it is for <hi>transgression,</hi> but a <hi>National</hi> judgement, because it is for the Transgression of a <hi>Land,</hi> that is, of a <hi>Nation,</hi> or the Inhabitants of a Land, or because
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97246:9"/>
               <hi>national provocations</hi> are the Causes of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it may be proved from my Text like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that, as it is a national Judgement, so it is a <hi>great</hi> national judgement, or a <hi>great</hi> judgement of God upon a Nation, because it is not for any <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> or <hi>common</hi> national sin, but for the <hi>greatest</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation that a nation can be guilty of. For though <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the word in the Original which we translate <hi>transgression,</hi> do indeed signifie a transgression; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the greatest sin aswel as the least may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>transgression</hi>; yet the <hi>transgression</hi> which is here meant is <hi>such</hi> a transgression as <hi>transgresseth</hi> or <hi>exceeds all other</hi> transgressions; for it is <hi>prevarication,</hi> which is the literal, proper and most emphatical significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And <hi>prevarication</hi> (as the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians tell us) is a betraying of the cause and interest we would seem to maintain. As when <hi>Divines</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to guide men in the way that leadeth unto Heaven, do perswade them to do such things as will bring them unto Hell; or when <hi>Lawyers,</hi> whose office is to be guardians of liberty and property, do by false glosses upon the Law justifie or excuse those that invade, and oppress, and destroy both; or lastly, when <hi>any Man, Sect,</hi> or <hi>party</hi> of men, pretending to <hi>serve God,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> do indeed <hi>serve themselves</hi> and their own wicked designs <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> This is <hi>prevarication,</hi> and for <hi>such</hi> prevarication as <hi>this,</hi> doth God punish a Land (saith my Text) with <hi>many Princes</hi>; which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97246:9"/>
must therefore be one of the <hi>greatest National judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> because it is the punishment of one of the <hi>greatest National sins</hi>; for so is <hi>prevarication.</hi> And thus much briefly for the proof of my <hi>first Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on à priore,</hi> or from its <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the proof of it <hi>à posteriore,</hi> or from its <hi>effects.</hi> For as <hi>great national sins</hi> are the <hi>cause,</hi> so <hi>great national miseries</hi> are the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>many Princes</hi>; as will appear first from the consideration of <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> or of a government by <hi>plurality of Princes,</hi> in its <hi>own nature,</hi> or in the general: and, Secondly from the <hi>experience</hi> we our selves have had of it in our own Particular.</p>
            <p>And first, it is true in it self and in the general, That where there are <hi>many Princes</hi> in a Land, there the People must needs be exposed to <hi>many</hi> and <hi>great miseries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then by <hi>Princes</hi> we are not to understand such Princes as the hundred twenty seven were, that were feasted by <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> under <hi>whom</hi> they were the <hi>Governours</hi> of so many several <hi>Provinces,</hi> nor such Princes as are now in <hi>France, Poland, Naples</hi> and other <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> who are but Princes in <hi>name onely</hi>; and though some of them greater then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet all of them subject and subordinate to <hi>their own Soveraign</hi> princes. For of <hi>such</hi> princes there may and perhaps ought to be <hi>many,</hi> that is, more or fewer according to the Grandeur of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch they live under. And yet there may be <hi>too many</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97246:10"/>
even of <hi>this kind</hi> of princes also; as when the Sun of Soveraign Majesty, from whence they borrow and derive their light, is either Eclipsed by their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, (as it was in <hi>England</hi> in the time of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons wars) or clouded by their multitude; or when the Title and dignity it self is embased and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by admitting too many, and too mean persons to be pertakers of it. But of <hi>this</hi> the Soveraign prince is the <hi>onely</hi> and <hi>best judge,</hi> neither are these the princes my Text speaks of.</p>
            <p>For by <hi>many princes</hi> in my Text, are meant such as are, or take upon them to be <hi>Soveraigns</hi> in the <hi>same Land</hi> or State; and that <hi>not successively</hi>; for then, how could they be oppos'd to a <hi>single person,</hi> seeing in that sense they would <hi>all</hi> of them be but <hi>so many single</hi> persons succeeding one another? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I cannot see, why <hi>many</hi> princes in <hi>succession</hi> should be said to be a <hi>judgement</hi> or a punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God upon a nation for their sins; and therefore by <hi>many princes</hi> in my Text must needs be meant <hi>many pretending to soveraignty</hi> in the <hi>same countrey</hi> at the <hi>same time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may be either when the Country is <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned</hi> into many several Independent principalities, by setting up <hi>many</hi> petty Soveraignties instead of <hi>one,</hi> or when the <hi>Soveraign power</hi> over a whole Nation is <hi>shared</hi> and <hi>exercised</hi> by <hi>many</hi>; whether they be more, as in a Republick or Democracy; or fewer, as in a State or an Aristocracy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97246:10"/>And first for the former way of <hi>Polycracy,</hi> or having <hi>many</hi> Princes, by <hi>Cantoning</hi> the Countrey, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>several distinct bodies</hi> of the several <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>same body</hi> Politick, it is that which was attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> when they told <hi>Moses</hi> he <hi>took too much upon him,</hi> because <hi>he alone</hi> did govern in chief all the twelve Tribes of Israel. And you know what the issue of that attempt was, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the sudden death of almost fifteen thousand men, besides the swallowing up quick of some, and the burning alive of others of the Conspirators, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their wives and children, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto them; as you may read in the fifteenth Chapter of the Book of <hi>Numbers.</hi> The same was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attempted by <hi>Abner</hi> upon a <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>zeal</hi> for his Masters House, but indeed <hi>by dividing</hi> Israel from Judah, to govern Israel <hi>himself</hi>; as he did du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War betwixt the house of <hi>David</hi> and the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> which was a long and a bloody one, saith the Text; as such wars use to be, when a whole Nation is engaged to fight against it self, and to cut one anothers throats to gratifie the malice or ambition of a few. But that which was but <hi>attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted</hi> by <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> was shortly after <hi>effected</hi> by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who <hi>divided</hi> Israel from Judah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a War, which neither he nor his successors could ever see an end of; till Israel and Judah being weakned, and wasted, and consumed by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, became a prey to the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> who at length
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97246:11"/>
swallowed them up both. And thus (to say nothing of other Nations, which of old and of late have been <hi>thus Cantoned</hi>) our own Country of <hi>England,</hi> of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> became an <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> by setting up of seven several Soveraignties in the time of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which never left encroaching and warring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, till all of them were reduced again under one. By all which Instances it is evident enough, that there cannot be <hi>many Soveraign</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over <hi>several parts</hi> or provinces of the <hi>same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> without much effusion of blood in the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great oppression of the people for the maintaining of them. And consequently that the having of <hi>many Princes</hi> in <hi>this sense</hi> must needs be a great Judgement upon the people.</p>
            <p>And yet secondly it is as bad or worse for the people; when the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over the <hi>whole,</hi> which <hi>ought</hi> to be vested in <hi>one,</hi> is usurped and shared, and exercised by <hi>many</hi>; who, whether they be more, or fewer, do alwayes under a <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> assume unto themselves an Illegal, Arbitrary and tyrannical power, and that as really in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or <hi>Aristocracy</hi>; though not so grossly and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as in a <hi>popular State</hi> or a Democracy.</p>
            <p>For even in a <hi>Senate,</hi> (where <hi>many</hi> govern in <hi>chief</hi> with <hi>equal</hi> Authority) supposing them (as we must needs suppose them to be) men subject to the same passions, appetites, and infirmities as all men are, there will alwayes be jealousies, envyings, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97246:11"/>
emulations amongst them; and where there are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and emulations, and <hi>no superiour</hi> authority to check and <hi>over-rule</hi> them, there must needs be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and divisions also; and where there are facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and divisions among <hi>those</hi> that <hi>govern,</hi> there the <hi>government</hi> it <hi>self</hi> must needs be obnoxious to many dangers and difficulties, both in administration of Justice at home, and in defending themselves against enemies abroad; there being nothing more natural or more usual in <hi>such kind</hi> of States, then the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of the publick Interest to private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concernments; whilst every man is apt to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himself, and his own covetousness, ambition, or animosity, by becoming a pensioner to any other State that will give most for him; and to gratifie his own party at home, by thwarting and crossing and crying down whatsoever is said or done by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary faction, though the State it self be often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, and sometimes ruin'd by it. As we see it hapned in the State of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where <hi>Hanno</hi> and the rest of his faction, to comply with their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and Malice against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they forced that great Captain to quit <hi>Italy,</hi> and the prosecution of his Victories for want of supplies, though by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> they drew the <hi>Romanes</hi> into <hi>Africk,</hi> and saw <hi>Carthage</hi> and themselves made slaves to <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then they would endure <hi>Rome</hi> should be subdued by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> So powerful, and so mischievous are the passions of Covetousness, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,

Envy, Malice, and Revenge, where there is <hi>no Authority</hi> to prevent or restrain the dangerous malignity, and effects of them, as there is not, where the Soveraignty is <hi>equally shared</hi> amongst <hi>many.</hi> And yet though they differ in <hi>all things els,</hi> they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes agree in <hi>this,</hi> to enrich their own private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as much as they can, by drawing, not as much as is needful, or can be spared, but as much as is to be had, or can be extorted from their poor Subjects. And yet such is the simplicity, and folly of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people, that they could be content to beggar themselves and to become slaves indeed, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the empty name of a free State, or a free born People; as some of us would have done, and some of our neighbours have done, who are as arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed, and as heavily taxed, as the vassalls of the Grand Seignior himself: whereas if they were wise, they would consider, that supposing a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince were indeed a Tyrant, yet the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a <hi>State</hi> or Senate would be much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and insupportable then any <hi>one</hi> soveraign Prince can be; and that not onely because it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, and safer, and cheaper to satisfie the lust, the covetousness, the cruelty, or any other inordinate or immoderate passion of any <hi>one man,</hi> then of <hi>many</hi>

Whereunto may be added, that a Soveraign Prince knowing himself, and none but himself lyable both to the blame and shame of whatsoever is amiss in matter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as having no partner or sharer in it, upon whom for excusing himself, he may transferr the blame of it, he will alwayes have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of <hi>shame</hi> (if he have not the restraint of <hi>conscience</hi>) upon him; and consequently supposing he feared not <hi>God,</hi> nor what <hi>he</hi> could do unto him, yet he will care for <hi>men,</hi> and what <hi>they</hi> are likely to say of him. But where the Soveraignty is in <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and all of them for all things they do equally accountable in the <hi>general,</hi> none of them thinks himself accountable either to God or man, for any thing in his own <hi>particular</hi>; and therefore cares not how the one is provoked, or the other injured, as long as he thinks it is the <hi>State,</hi> and not <hi>he,</hi> that is to answer for it. And States, being bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out souls, have neither Conscience to awe them, nor shame to restrain them from doing any thing. So that it seems to be a judgement of God upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it hath <hi>many</hi> Princes at <hi>once</hi> even in this sense. I mean when the Nobility or some of the better sort of the people do share betwixt them the Soveraignty over all the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97246:13"/>And yet <hi>this</hi> is the best kind of Polycracy, or the best kind of Government under more Princes then one. Because it is better to be subject to <hi>fewer</hi> then to <hi>more,</hi> and to some of the best and noblest, as it is in a Senate of Aristocracy, then to a <hi>multitude</hi> of the worst and basest of the people, as it is in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, or that which is commonly called a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, which notwithstanding all its vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to freedome, Equity and Equality, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the <hi>worst</hi> of all kind of Government what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is most <hi>unnatural</hi>; for though it be monstrous enough for <hi>one body</hi> Politick to have <hi>more heads</hi> then one, yet it is much more monstrous and unnatural, when that which <hi>should</hi> be the body <hi>is</hi> the <hi>head,</hi> or when the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>head</hi> are but <hi>one confus'd,</hi> undistinguish'd <hi>mass</hi> or lump; there being in a popular State no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those that Govern, and those that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, unless it be this, that those that seem to govern, are indeed subjects; and those that seem to be governed, are indeed Soveraigns, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in a Common-wealth being <hi>servants</hi> and vassals unto the people, as being created by them, and accomptable to them, and consequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in danger and fear of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this kind of Government is most <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> so it is most <hi>unreasonable</hi>; for what can be more <hi>unreasonable</hi> then that the wisest, the justest,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97246:13"/>
the most valiant and most virtuous persons (which are alwayes the <hi>fewest</hi>) should be governed by such as are fools, or knaves, or cowards, or vitious and vile persons? which are alwayes the <hi>major</hi> part, and consequently must needs domineere and give Law to all the rest, where all things are carryed by <hi>plurality</hi> of voyces, as they are, where the <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign authority</hi> resides in the body of the <hi>People</hi>; which are most of them <hi>such,</hi> as were intended by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) to be <hi>servants,</hi> as being of low and servile dispositions, and such as have not wit enough to govern themselves, and much less to govern others.</p>
            <p>As <hi>this kind</hi> of Government is most <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> in its <hi>frame</hi> and constitution, so it is most <hi>insolent,</hi> injurious and <hi>tyrannical</hi> in its mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and <hi>administration.</hi> And that <hi>first</hi> in regard of the peoples <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>credulity,</hi> which makes them apt to be abused and deceived by false infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and misrepresentations of Things and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and apt to be perswaded by those that <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> them most, against those that <hi>counsel</hi> them best, mistaking their friends for their enemies, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for their friends; and from thence apt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie and exalt the one, and to disgrace and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in regard of their <hi>levity</hi> and inconstancy, which makes them rash and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate in their deliberations, sudden and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate in their Resolutions, and consequently Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97246:14"/>
and variable in their affections, and in their actions, <hi>crying up</hi> that to day, which they will <hi>cry down</hi> to morrow, and oftentimes condemning and executing as <hi>Traitors</hi> and Malefactors those whom they had a little before applauded and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as their <hi>Tutelary gods</hi> and saviours. Thirdly, in regard of their Fears <hi>and jealousies,</hi> which as weak men, so weak States are alwayes most subject unto. And these fears and jealousies make them suspect whatsoever is above their capacities for plots and conspiracies; and make them look jealously upon men that are eminent, as if because they may <hi>do harm,</hi> they cannot be <hi>innocent,</hi> so that the more wise, or virtuous, or valiant any man is in a <hi>popular State,</hi> or the more he hath deserved of his Countrey by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Heroical actions, the less safe he is, because when any man seems to excel and out-grow others, he presently becomes the fear and envie of all. And then whatsoever any of his enemies, or any mean or base companion will accuse him of, is greedily heard, and easily believed; and whatsoever can be said for him by himself or by his friends, doth but <hi>hasten</hi> his condemnation; because it is his <hi>merit</hi> that is his <hi>crime,</hi> and that which ought to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and honoured, is that which makes him to be feared and hated. Thus were <hi>Themistocles, Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> rewarded by the people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>; thus were <hi>Corialanus, Camillus and Scipio</hi> the African rewarded by the People of <hi>Rome</hi> after all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97246:14"/>
their meritorious services. And thus should <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (after he had added <hi>Gaul, Germany</hi> and <hi>Britta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire) have been rewarded by the same People of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he had not prevented it, by taking that power, they would have used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, away from them. And now consider I beseech you, whether there can be a <hi>worse form</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> then where either the State it self, or the worthiest and best deserving men in a State must needs be ruin'd; and where the State hath no other way, but by ingratitude and cruelty, to secure it self against the <hi>best</hi> of its own subjects; and when the <hi>best</hi> subjects, after they have done the <hi>best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> have no way, but by <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Parricide,</hi> to secure themselves, against their own Country. Whereunto may be added in the <hi>last</hi> place <hi>the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Common <hi>People</hi> in any State, and much more in a <hi>Popular</hi> State, where they are under no restraint, to be suddenly incensed and transported by the violence of their own <hi>Passions</hi> beyond all rules and bounds of Religion, of Reason, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, of common Honesty, nay of Humanity it self, to do the most absurd, extravagant and outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, without considering, or careing, or fearing what may be the issue of them.

pleased themselves, nor will ever suffer the people to be content with their <hi>present</hi> condition, but are alwayes either secretly whispering false fears and dangers into their heads, or openly complaining and inveighing against <hi>things</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> as prejudiciall to the publick good, till at length they so poyson, and enrage their foolish Auditors, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so difficult or dangerous, but they will attempt it, nor nothing so injurious or impious, that they will stick at it; neither is there any remedy for their Rage, or cure for their madness, till these <hi>Fiends</hi> that possess'd them, are cast out of them; which I am afraid will hardly be done by <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prayer onely.</hi> Such were <hi>Corath, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who stirred up the <hi>people</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; such was <hi>Sheba</hi> the son of <hi>Bichri,</hi> who blew a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and said, <hi>VVe have no part in</hi> David, <hi>neither have we any portion in the son of</hi> Jesse, <hi>Every man to his Tents O Israel</hi>: such were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> who made the <hi>people</hi> cry out, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him,</hi> meaning their <hi>King,</hi> and their Saviour, and to chuse <hi>Barabbas</hi> rather then <hi>Jesus.</hi> Such was <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-smith, who with one Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oration <hi>filled with uproar the whole City</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> To conclude, such were <hi>Cleon</hi> the <hi>Tanner</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> the <hi>Gracchi</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and many other seditious Orators in both those Common-wealths; And such are <hi>now</hi> adayes many of the Preachers amongst Christians: who are by so much the more wicked,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97246:15"/>
and execrable in themselves, and dangerously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to a State, then any of those Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were, by how much more damnable a sin it is to make use of <hi>Scripture</hi> then of <hi>Sophistry</hi> to wicked and ungodly ends, and by how much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is, for men to be misguided by their <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> then by their <hi>passions,</hi> the one being but a fit of <hi>frenzie,</hi> which will soon over, and the other being a <hi>settled</hi> and a <hi>sober madness</hi> which is hardly cured. And in this respect a <hi>popular</hi> State is much worse amongst <hi>Christians</hi> then ever it was or could be among <hi>Heathens.</hi> And yet even amongst Heathens, it was by the wisest of them accounted the <hi>worst</hi> of all Goverments, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> confess, though both of them were born and bred in a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar State, and were as able as any to judge of it.</p>
            <p>And yet the Evils I have hitherto spoken of, are but such as <hi>every popular</hi> State is subject unto, even when it is orderly and regular (I mean as orderly and regular as a Popular State can be) and that is when the body of the People governs it self by Lawes, and Civil Magistrates of its own making; but there is a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>popular</hi> Government, when a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> being got into Arms, Governs by the sword and military Officers of their own choosing, and this is a <hi>Stratocracy,</hi> or military kind of <hi>Democracy</hi>; which must needs be a much more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and insupportable yoak then the former; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause besides its being subject to all the evils and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97246:16"/>
inconveniences before spoken of, it is alwayes able to do all the mischiefs it hath a mind to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opposition in the doing of it, and without fear of being punished for it. And this is indeed <hi>to rule with a rod of iron,</hi> and <hi>break the people in pieces like a Potters vessel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now there is but <hi>one way more</hi> of having <hi>many Princes,</hi> or <hi>more Soveraigns</hi> then <hi>one</hi> in the same kingdome, and that is as dangerous and as inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Publick peace, as any of the former: namely, the setting up of <hi>two Scepters,</hi> two Lavv-givers, or tvvo Supream Judicatories, the one <hi>Civil,</hi> and the other <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> in one and the same State; vvhich <hi>two Supream Judicatories</hi> must needs have <hi>two Supream Judges</hi> vvithout subordination of the one to the other, and vvithout Appeal unto the one from the other; And consequently when they differ (as they must needs do often) about the rights and extent of their <hi>several</hi> Jurisdictions, the People will not know which of them to obey, being threatned by the <hi>material sword,</hi> if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the one, and with the <hi>spiritual sword,</hi> if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the <hi>other</hi>; so that <hi>such</hi> a State must needs be <hi>divided within</hi> and <hi>against it self</hi>; and then <hi>Christ</hi> himself will tell you it <hi>cannot stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it must needs be ill for the people in what sense soever they have <hi>many</hi> Princes; whether it be by <hi>Cantoning</hi> the Countrey into parts, or by sharing the Soveraignty of the whole, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97246:16"/>
               <hi>many,</hi> as in <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> or amongst <hi>all,</hi> as in a <hi>Democracy,</hi> or amongst the <hi>Sword-men</hi> onely, as in a <hi>Stratocracy</hi>; or lastly by dividing the <hi>soul</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> from the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> and by making two Soveraigns, one in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>Civil,</hi> and the other in causes <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> over the same subjects, whether the <hi>Conclave,</hi> or the <hi>Consistory</hi> be the Cause of it. In all which cases I say it is a <hi>Judgement</hi> of God upon a Nation to have <hi>more</hi> Princes then <hi>one,</hi> as I hope I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear both from the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all the Evidence can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this truth, either from Scripture or Reason, from the Cause, or the Effects of it, we would not <hi>believe</hi> it till we <hi>felt</hi> it. And therefore in the <hi>third</hi> place it hath pleased God, because we vvere like <hi>beasts without understanding,</hi> to teach us, as he doth Beasts, by our <hi>senses,</hi> and to visit us of late, as much or perhaps more then ever he did any nation vvith this very Judgement, I mean <hi>plurality</hi> of Princes in all its kinds and degrees, and vvith almost all the effects of it.</p>
            <p>For after vve had said in our hearts <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare super nos</hi>; I mean, assoon as vve had rejected that EXCELLENT PRINCE, who <hi>onely</hi> had right by all Lavves Humane and Divine to reign over us, presently many of our fellovv subjects took upon them to be our Princes, and to govern us arbitrarily at their ovvn pleasure, in order to their own avariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97246:17"/>
and ambitious ends. And that <hi>first</hi> in an <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical</hi> way, as a <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing could be done without consent of some of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry.</hi> But it was not long (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Royalty</hi> was gone,) but <hi>Nobility</hi> followed, and was excluded also. And <hi>then</hi> came in <hi>Democracy</hi> or the Government of the Common People by their own Representatives onely; which encreased the number of our Princes, and the vileness of our slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the meanness of our Masters. But these their own <hi>Mercenaries</hi> did quickly deprive of the power they had Usurped and Abused; And then came in <hi>Stratocracy</hi> or the Government by the Sword, and thereby we had as <hi>many Princes</hi> as there were <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaws</hi> or <hi>Major Generals,</hi> who perhaps, if they had out-liv'd their great <hi>Sultan,</hi> they would have <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd</hi> the Kingdome, and erected their several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces into so many several Principalities. But by this means the very <hi>name</hi> of Liberty and property, which were before pretended, were quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Onely there was <hi>liberty</hi> enough and too much, indeed a Lawless, boundless <hi>licence</hi> in matter of <hi>Religion</hi>; all wayes of worshipping God being allowed, but the true one; and all admitted to the Sacred Function, but such as were <hi>lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> unto it; In the mean time every <hi>Sect,</hi> had its <hi>head,</hi> and every one that was <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>Sect</hi> was <hi>Prince</hi> of a Party; so that we have <hi>seen</hi> what it is to have <hi>many Princes,</hi> nay we have <hi>felt</hi> it to be a

sore Judgement by the terrible effects of it; which did spread themselves over the face, and through the Veins, and into the Bowels of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; at once embracing, involving, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding all places, all persons, and all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, publick and private, high and low, sacred and prophane; For from the King in his Throne, to the Beggar in the dust, no thing, place, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son almost hath been without <hi>feeling</hi> some or other the terrible effects of <hi>this Judgement.</hi> How many have lost their Limbs, their Liberty, their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, their estates, their friends, and have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extream poverty, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? How many noble and Ancient <hi>Families</hi> have been ruin'd? How many goodly buildings and <hi>Churches</hi> (the glorious evidences and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Ancestors Piety and charity) have been prophaned and defaced? How many poor innocent persons of both sexes, all ages, and all conditions, have been either murther'd or banish'd, or, imprison'd or oppress'd with extortion of all kinds, and of all Degrees without possibility of help, or hope of remedy? Lastly, how many poor <hi>souls,</hi> for which <hi>Christ dyed,</hi> have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> Schism and Heresie, Uncharitableness and Cruelty, by the horrible <hi>abuse</hi> of <hi>Preaching, Praying, Fasting, Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and all other the sacred ordinances of God?</p>

Which as at first it was the <hi>effect</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> so it hath been ever since the <hi>cause</hi> of our <hi>Miseries.</hi> And as the Consideration of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> namely, that our having of many Princes was an effect of the sins of us all, or of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional sins, will make us instead of judging, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, upbraiding, and hating <hi>one another,</hi> to judge, condemn and abhorre <hi>our selves,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to <hi>justifie God</hi> in his <hi>Judgements</hi> upon us all; so the consideration of the <hi>later,</hi> namely, that the having of <hi>many Princes</hi> hath been the <hi>cause</hi> of all our late many and great <hi>miseries,</hi> will <hi>First Convince</hi> us of our former <hi>folly,</hi> in <hi>believing,</hi> so <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily</hi>

            </p>
            <p>ANd this was my <hi>second</hi> Conclusion, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from these words in my Text. <hi>But by a man of understanding and knowledge the State thereof shall be prolonged</hi>: where (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by a <hi>man of understanding</hi> and knowledge as there must needs be meant <hi>one single Person</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to those <hi>Many</hi> which the former Clause of My Text speaks of; so by <hi>That one single</hi> Person must needs be meant such an one as is a <hi>Prince, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince,</hi> because the <hi>man</hi> here spoken of is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97246:19"/>
opposed not to <hi>many simply</hi> and <hi>indefinitely,</hi> but to <hi>many Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>no private</hi> person, though a man of never so much understanding, and knowledge is able to prolong a State, because that is a work which requires not onely Wisdome and Prudence to conduct it, but <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> and authority to Perform it.</p>
            <p>And yet I will not deny, but that it may be sometimes in the power even of a <hi>private man</hi> to do much towards the recovery, and <hi>preservation,</hi> and consequently the <hi>prolonging</hi> of a State; as we read <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>Thebane</hi> did, when being but a Private man, he rescued his Country from the bondage of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>: The like did <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> a <hi>private</hi> man also, when he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Country of <hi>Athens</hi> from the Thirty <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi>: And so did <hi>Camillus,</hi> who was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Private</hi> but a <hi>Banished</hi> man, when he recovered <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need we Instances out of <hi>Foreign</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity? when we have a <hi>Modern</hi> example of our own (to the honour of our Nation be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) which equals, and exceeds all I have named, or can name, in deserving from his Prince and from his Country, by his Courage in attempting, his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in conducting, and his Felicity in effecting, that generous, glorious and Heroicall design, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath at once redeemed his Country both from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97246:20"/>
slavery and infamy, by restoring the King to His People, and the People to their King; and withall, hath purchased unto himself Honour without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, Greatness with Safety, and (which is the best reward of virtue in this world) a perpetual satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and complacency in himself, for having so nobly performed his duty. And this was indeed to be a <hi>man of understanding</hi>: Whereas <hi>others,</hi> who being <hi>private</hi> men, would needs be Princes, though they thought themselves men of <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> have proved themselves <hi>fools</hi>; their heads being lifted up indeed, but so as they little thought they would be, and themselves, after they had blazed and blustered for a while, going out like a snuff, and have left nothing but a stink behinde them.</p>
            <p>But to return to what we have in hand; though it be true (as I have said before) that <hi>any private</hi> man may do something (at least by his <hi>prayers</hi>) and some private men may do much towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and prolonging of a State, if they be men of <hi>understanding</hi> and knowledge, that is, if they understand and know how to serve their Countrey, by serving of their Prince, either in Peace by their Counsels, or in War by their Courages; yet it is the <hi>Prince himself,</hi> who understanding and knowing how to serve himself of several mens abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in their several professions, doth indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and prolong the State of his Countrey. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97246:20"/>
               <hi>such a Prince,</hi> say I, is the <hi>greatest blessing</hi> of God upon a Nation: because the state or flourishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Nation, saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is preserved and prolonged by Him.</p>
            <p>So that according to the judgement of <hi>Solomon,</hi> (that is) according to the judgement of the wisest Statesman that ever was, or will be in the world. In order to the prolonging of a State, there must,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be one Soveraign Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Soveraign</hi> Prince must be a <hi>man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and knowledge.</p>
            <p>And then 3ly He must so make use of <hi>that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and knowledge, as that his own and his peoples happiness may be procured, and preserved, and prolonged by him.</p>
            <p>And first, in order to the <hi>procuring</hi> and <hi>prolonging</hi> the happiness of a Nation, it must have <hi>one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> Prince (that is) the Government of it must be <hi>Monarchical</hi>: And of this there needs little more to be said for the proof of <hi>it,</hi> then what hath been said already for proof of my <hi>former</hi> conclusion, and what we our selves have felt already by the late tryal we have made of <hi>all other formes</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; together with the uneasiness we found under them, and the miseries we have drawn upon our selves by them; from whence we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtingly <hi>conclude,</hi> that at least, <hi>for us of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is no other form of Government but Monarchy, under which we ever were, or ever can be happy.</hi>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97246:21"/>Whether <hi>all other forms</hi> of Government be Always, and Absolutely Unlawful, I will not take upon me to determine; <hi>Stent aut cadant Domino suo,</hi> Let them stand or fall to their own master: But as Christ (when he was ask'd, whether it were lawful for a man to put away his wife) answer'd, <hi>A principio non fuit sic</hi>; so may I say of <hi>all other forms</hi> of Government except <hi>Monarchy, A Principio non fuit sic,</hi> from the <hi>beginning</hi> there was no such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: For as God made <hi>man</hi> upright at first, because he made him after his own Image; so he made the Government of <hi>mankind</hi> upright at first also, because he made it after the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>his own Government</hi>; which surely is <hi>Monarchical.</hi> And no doubt it was Gods <hi>intention,</hi> it should <hi>always</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to <hi>be so</hi>; because, as we find <hi>no example</hi> of any <hi>other Government</hi> of his <hi>approving,</hi> so we finde <hi>no rule</hi> of direction for <hi>any other</hi> Government; nor <hi>no precept</hi> of subjection to any other Government, of <hi>his</hi> prescribing: <hi>Those</hi> we are commanded to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to by <hi>Gods word,</hi> being either, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And indeed till the world was above 3000. years old, there was <hi>no other</hi> Government in it but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy only.</hi> For in <hi>Homers</hi> time all <hi>Greece</hi> had <hi>Kings,</hi> and they were the <hi>Graecians</hi> from whom the

               </gap>, <hi>Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> had their beginning. For the <hi>Greeks</hi> being men of subtle wits and unquiet spirits, finding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> to be a curb to their Ambition, they devised such forms of Government, wherein the <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> being not Confin'd unto <hi>one,</hi> but Shar'd amongst <hi>many,</hi> Every man might hope to have his turn and his part in it: From the <hi>Grecians</hi> by their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were these <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Innovations</hi> in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived to some few other Nations; but as they spread not farr, so they continued not long; for at the <hi>coming</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> there was nothing but <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the World; so that <hi>Monarchy</hi> as it was <hi>Instituted</hi> by God at the <hi>Creation,</hi> so it seems to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored</hi> by Christ at the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Mankind, and to be recommended both by the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> as the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>onely form</hi> of Government for all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And indeed <hi>nature</hi> it self doth seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, and that not onely because every <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of all <hi>Creatures</hi> whatsoever seems to have a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to <hi>some one</hi> of the <hi>same kind</hi>; but likewise because amongst <hi>men</hi> also, those that have no other Rule but the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> to live by, I mean, those of <hi>America,</hi> and other lately discovered Nations, as there be <hi>none</hi> of them without <hi>some</hi> Government, so <hi>none</hi> of them have <hi>any other</hi> form of Government, but <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Monarchy</hi> is more <hi>natural</hi> and more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> and consequently a <hi>better</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97246:22"/>
form of government then <hi>any other</hi>; so of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> that which is by <hi>Succession</hi> is much <hi>more natural</hi> and much <hi>more</hi> according to Divine <hi>Institution,</hi> then <hi>any other</hi> kind of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> I mean, then that which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> or by <hi>Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first it is <hi>better</hi> then <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Vsurpation</hi>; for as <hi>no man can take to himself the honour or office</hi> of a <hi>Priest</hi>; so much less can any man take to himself the <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>King</hi>; but he must have it from <hi>God himself,</hi> either by Gods own Immediate designation, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> had (for the <hi>Judges</hi> were <hi>Kings</hi>) and as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had; or by Gods Ordinary way of Dispensation, which was by <hi>succession</hi> of Children unto their Fathers: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which Method, as Families grew into Nations, so <hi>Paternal</hi> government grew into <hi>Regal,</hi> and consequently an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> as he hath no <hi>claim</hi> to <hi>Divine</hi> Institution, so he hath no <hi>title</hi> to Divine <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction</hi> or <hi>protection.</hi> And besides, because what is Gotten by the <hi>sword,</hi> must be Maintained by the <hi>sword,</hi> an <hi>Vsurper must</hi> be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> whether he will, or no. Lastly, a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Vsurpation</hi> is <hi>Res sine titulo,</hi> a Possession without a Title; which seldome lasts Long, or ends Well, for <hi>he that takes the sword shall perish by the sword,</hi> saith our Saviour. Mat. 26.52.</p>
            <p>Again, as <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Vsurpation</hi> is <hi>Res sine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo,</hi> so <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Election</hi> is <hi>titulus sine re,</hi> a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without the Thing; for <hi>Elective</hi> Kings are but <hi>Conditional</hi> Kings; and <hi>Conditional</hi> Kings are <hi>no</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:97246:22"/>
Kings. Besides, a <hi>King</hi> is to have the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which none, that have it not themselves, can give unto Him; And therefore, how He that is <hi>Elected</hi> by those that have <hi>not</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of Life and Death, comes to have the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and consequently how he comes to be a <hi>King,</hi> is, as I conceive, not easie to imagine. But supposing an <hi>Elective</hi> King, to be indeed <hi>a King</hi>; yet considering first, the Dangers and Inconveniences of <hi>Inter-reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num's</hi> or <hi>Cessations</hi> of Government betwixt the <hi>Death</hi> of one King and the <hi>Election</hi> of another; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Factiousness</hi> and <hi>partiality</hi> of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> together with the <hi>envie</hi> and <hi>emulation</hi> of the <hi>Competitors</hi>; Thirdly, the <hi>necessity</hi> of Him that is <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> to gratifie those that Chose him, with the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> of those that were against him; And lastly, considering that every <hi>Elective</hi> King hath a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>his own</hi>; divided from <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Publick,</hi> and consequently, that it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he will have more respect to the <hi>interest</hi> of his <hi>Family,</hi> wherein he is to be Succeeded by his Children, then to <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> wherein he may be Succeeded by a Stranger; Considering <hi>all these</hi> things, I say, we may well conclude, that <hi>as Monarchy is the best form of Government, so successive, hereditary Monarchy is the best form of Monarchy</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where there is an <hi>undoubted right,</hi> there is no Need of <hi>Tyranny</hi> to support it, as there is in an <hi>Vsurpation</hi>; and because, where the Princes and the

Publick Interest is the <hi>same</hi> (as it is in <hi>Hereditary Monarchy</hi>) there is no need of Defrauding the <hi>one,</hi> to Provide for the <hi>other,</hi> as there is in <hi>Elective</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>But yet even of <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchies one may be more desirable then another, as a <hi>Political</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a <hi>Despotical</hi>; for a <hi>Despotical</hi> Monarch governs his Subjects as a <hi>Master</hi> doth his <hi>Servants, arbitrarily</hi> according to his <hi>own will</hi> and pleasure, whether it be Right or Wrong; But a <hi>Political</hi> Monarch governs his Subjects as a <hi>Father</hi> doth his <hi>Children,</hi> by Equal and Just Lawes, made with their <hi>own consent</hi> to them, The <hi>former</hi> is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Muscovite</hi>; the <hi>later</hi> is, or ought to be the Government of <hi>all Christian Kings</hi>; I am sure it is of <hi>Ours</hi>; and therefore <hi>such a kind</hi> of Monarchy as <hi>Ours,</hi> is not onely the most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> but the most <hi>plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>popular</hi> Government of <hi>all others.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if the <hi>Supream</hi> Governour be so Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he ought to be, and that is (saith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) if he be <hi>a man of understanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, he would have him to be a <hi>Man</hi>; for <hi>Woe unto thee, O Land,</hi> (saith the same Wiseman) <hi>when thy</hi> King <hi>is a child,</hi> Ecclesiastes 10.16. <hi>But blessed art thou, O Land,</hi> (saith he in the very next words) <hi>when thy King is the son of Nobles</hi>; so that it seems <hi>Solomon</hi> would have <hi>his Prince,</hi> neither to

yet nothing can more become a Soveraign Prince, then to have it in his power to Captivate by his Looks and by his Words the hearts of his People at his pleasure, without being at any Charge at all for it.</p>
            <p>But if besides <hi>Comeliness</hi> and Gracefulness of shape; Courtesie, and Affability of Speech and behaviour, together with Gravity, and yet Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, and Benigness of Aspect, there be a Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Manliness in his Mind, and a promise of Long Life in the Healthfulness of his Constitution, I know not what is to be wished for more, but that he may have <hi>Mentem sanam in corpore sano,</hi> that the Beauty of his Mind may be answerable to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Body; as it will be, if he be a <hi>man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge,</hi> or such an one, as <hi>understands</hi> and knows how to make Himself and his People happy.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> he must be a <hi>man of Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi>: because, if a man have not some Measure of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> he is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>Knowledge</hi>; as we see Natural fools and Madmen are not. Again, though a man have <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> to such a Degree, as to make him Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of many things that are well worth the Knowing, yet if he have not <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>discretion</hi> to make <hi>use</hi> of <hi>that Knowledge,</hi> or if <hi>that Knowledge</hi> make him never a whit the <hi>wiser,</hi> it were as good for Himself, and the World
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97246:25"/>
too, that he <hi>knew nothing</hi>: For, though a man have Read never so many Books, and Seen never so many Countries, and Search'd never so many Languages, and Gone through never so many Arts and Sciences; yet if he be not <hi>naturally</hi> a <hi>man of judgement</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> he may be a <hi>Fool</hi> for <hi>all this</hi>; nay he may be a much more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Fool,</hi> then he would be otherwise; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his knowing so much makes him think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wise, when indeed he is not: and this is <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Fool,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Though you bray him in a Morter, yet will not his foolishness depart from him; Prov.</hi> 27.22. which makes good our <hi>English</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that <hi>the greatest Clerks, are not alwayes the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest men</hi>; or as it is more sharply express'd in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Dialect, <hi>an ounce of Mother wit is worth a pound of Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, because there may be a <hi>bad</hi> as well as a <hi>good use</hi> made of a mans natural understanding and of his knowledge too; therefore if a man have not such an understanding, as to make a right use of his wit and of his knowledge, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Own, and the Publick good, it were better for such a man and the world too, that he had no understanding nor knowledge at all; for <hi>these</hi> are the men, whose understanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Devil makes use of, as he doth of his own Serpentine subtilty for the disturbing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting, and confounding of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97246:25"/>
But the understanding my Text speaks of, <hi>preserves</hi> and <hi>prolongs States</hi> and Kingdomes. And therefore by a <hi>man of understanding</hi> in my Text, is meant one that may be truly so called; not in a Natural sense onely, but in a Moral and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological sense also; One that hath good <hi>Morals,</hi> as well as good <hi>Intellectuals</hi>; one that is not Bias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his own passions, nor swayed by the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of others; one that can, and doth conform his will and <hi>affections</hi> unto his <hi>reason,</hi> and his <hi>reason</hi> it self to <hi>Gods will</hi> revealed in his word; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his <hi>own reason</hi> may deceive him, but <hi>Gods word</hi> rightly understood (which is <hi>Gods Reason</hi>) cannot.</p>
            <p>To conclude, by a <hi>man of understanding</hi> in my Text, is meant one that hath an <hi>understanding heart,</hi> as well as an <hi>understanding head, Vir cordatus,</hi> as the old Latines called a wise man. And indeed generally through the whole Scripture, <hi>wisdome</hi> is ascribed to the heart, or seated in the heart; thereby implying, that <hi>True wisdome</hi> consisteth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>practice</hi> then <hi>speculation,</hi> and in <hi>doing</hi> our Duty, rather then in <hi>knowing</hi> of it; so that a man may be a very wise man in the sense of the world (as all crafty men are) though never so false and wicked, and a very fool in the sense of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which calls every <hi>good man</hi> a <hi>wiseman,</hi> and every <hi>wicked man a fool,</hi> according to that of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID, <hi>The fool hath said in his heart there is no God,</hi>

Psalm 14. and according to that of <hi>Job,</hi> To <hi>fear the Lord, That is wisdome, and to depart from Evil That is understanding.</hi> Job 28.28.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides,</hi> a Prince that hath not a sound and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Judgement of <hi>his own,</hi> though he have never so wise a <hi>Counsel,</hi> yet he can never be <hi>sure</hi> that he is well advised by them. Because the <hi>wisest</hi> and <hi>best</hi> men are but <hi>men,</hi> that is, such as may have an Eye to <hi>themselves,</hi> and their own particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, more then to the Publick: but the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Publick interest being alwayes the same,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97246:26"/>
if he be <hi>a man of understanding,</hi> he will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, whether the Counsel, that is given him, be in order to the Publick interest, or no; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, either admit it, or reject it.
And therefore the Question, <q>Whether it be better for the People to have a weak King and a wise Counsel, or a wise King and a weak Counsel, is very well decided by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> That of the Two, <hi>it is much better to have a wise King, and a weak Counsel</hi>;</q>
Though indeed, it be not to be imagined, but that a <hi>wise King</hi> will alwayes have a <hi>wise Counsel</hi>: for if he do not <hi>find</hi> them so, he will quickly make them so.
But that <hi>other Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <q>Whether a Prince ought to be <hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Religious indeed,</hi> or in <hi>appearance onely,</hi> is very ill decided, by the same <hi>Machiavel</hi>: as if it were <hi>necessary</hi> indeed for a Prince to <hi>appear virtuous</hi> and religious, but <hi>not necessary</hi> for him to <hi>be so</hi>;</q>
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no doubt if it be <hi>necessary</hi> for him to <hi>appear</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Religious, it must needs be much <hi>more necessary</hi> for him to <hi>be</hi> virtuous and Religious: For whatsoever advantages he may have upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by seeming so, the same and more hee may have by <hi>being so,</hi> besides the blessing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his People for <hi>his</hi> sake: but this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> perhaps did either not think of, or not care for.</p>
            <p>Besides, I cannot see how a Prince can be said to be a <hi>man of understanding,</hi> if he do not <hi>master</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:97246:27"/>
his <hi>passions</hi> by his <hi>reason,</hi> and if he do so he must needs be vertuous in Deed, and not in Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance onely; Neither do I see, how a Prince, especially a Christian Prince, that believes there is a Providence here, and a Judgement hereafter, can be a <hi>man of understanding,</hi> if he do not seek the Protection, and assistance of the One, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Secure himself from the danger of the Other; and if he do so, he must of necessity be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Deed, and not (as <hi>Machiavel</hi> would have him) onely seem to be so.</p>
            <p>But it is <hi>Solomons,</hi> not <hi>Machiavel's</hi> PRINCE we speak of; and therefore he must be a <hi>man of understanding,</hi> not in <hi>Machiavels</hi> sense (which is to be a man of Falshood and Dissimulation) but in <hi>Solomon's</hi> sense, which is to be a man of Virtue and Religion. And then He will be wise for the Present, and wise for the Future, wise for Himself, and wise for his People also.</p>
            <p>Especially if he be a man not of <hi>understanding</hi> only, but of <hi>knowledge</hi> also; And indeed if he be a man of Understanding, he will be a man of Knowledge; for he will Understand that his Understanding it self must be perfected by Knowledge. For though the Understanding be Naturally, Morally, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously never so well disposed; yet seeing of it self it is but a meer Capacity, it can inform the Soul of no more, then what it self is inform'd of by the senses,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97246:27"/>
because <hi>Nihil est in intellectu, quod non prius fuit in sensu</hi>; this kind of knowledge is neither <hi>Innate,</hi> nor <hi>infus'd,</hi> but <hi>acquir'd</hi>: so that as a man must have a <hi>good understanding</hi> to make him capable of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and to enable him to make a <hi>good use</hi> of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; so he must have knowledge likewise, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, improve and perfect his understanding. And therefore a SOVERAIGNE PRINCE, especially a great Monarch, who hath many millions of bodies and souls too, under his conduct; as he ought to have a clear, a sound, a solid and a <hi>capacious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; so ought that capacity to be filled, and beautified and adorned with the best, the choicest, the most necessary and most excellent notions, maxims and habits, that humane nature is capable of, or moral industry can attain unto. For, seeing no humane capacity is comprehensive enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in <hi>all things</hi>; therefore the most <hi>Excellent P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rsons</hi> will apply themselves to the knowledge of the most <hi>excellent things,</hi> that is, such as best become them, and such as most concern them. I remember I have read that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> finding his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> playing skilfully upon the Lute, <hi>Art thou not asham'd my Son</hi> (said he) <hi>to be so skilful a Musician</hi>? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by implying, that to lose their precious <hi>time</hi> in learning <hi>little</hi> and <hi>low arts</hi> doth not become <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, that all knowledge worthy of a <hi>Prince</hi> is reducible to these two heads, the Art and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97246:28"/>
Science of <hi>governing himself,</hi> and the Art and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Governing his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the governing of himself, he is to consider himself either as he is a <hi>man,</hi> and as he stands in relation to <hi>God</hi> only; or as he is a <hi>Prince,</hi> and stands in relation to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men</hi> also.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>First</hi> of these considerations, he is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest himself of all his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to look upon himself as made of the same <hi>Clay,</hi> and of the same <hi>brittle Constitution</hi> that other men are; that he came into the world as other men did, and must go out of the world as other men do; for though <hi>Princes</hi> are called GODS, <hi>yet they shall dye like men,</hi> saith one that was a Prince himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.7. and though they be accomptable <hi>to no</hi> Tribunal here, yet they are to be Judged hereafter, and Judged by One, who is no <hi>respecter of persons,</hi> and from whom <hi>no secrets can be hid.</hi> And for this reason a Prince is to consider how careful he is to be of <hi>Governing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> not according to that Licence, which his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the penalty of humane Laws may prompt him to, but according to that stricktness which the severity of the Divine justice doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him,
<q>For those that can be punished by none but God, shall be sure to be most severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, if because they can be punished by none but him, they presume the more to sin against him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97246:28"/>And therefore the best way for a Soveraigne Prince, who is <hi>not subject</hi> to the Judgement of Men, to secure himself from the Judgement of God, is to <hi>Judge himself,</hi> and to exercise his Kingly authority, First <hi>within</hi> and upon <hi>himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> by curbing, Restraining, and Regulating the inordinateness and immoderateness of his <hi>own passions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> by keeping a strict Guard and Watch over his <hi>own Senses,</hi> that his <hi>Eyes</hi> may not look after Vanity, nor his <hi>Ears</hi> hearken unto Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by carefully fortifying himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>all Temptations</hi>; especially <hi>such,</hi> as are most agreeable unto him, and therefore most likely to Prevail with him. Alwayes remembring, that <hi>Fortior est qui se, quam qui fortissima vincit Maenia,</hi> that Conquest is the glory of Princes, and that no Conquest is so glorious as that over a mans own Self;
<q>For he that hath once master'd himself, will afterwards find nothing too hard for him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>this</hi> Consideration is Common to <hi>Princes</hi> with <hi>other men</hi>;</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> he is to consider him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as he is a Prince, and as he stands in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his <hi>People</hi> and to <hi>God</hi> too; I mean, as he is <hi>Gods Representative</hi> unto the People, and to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the People in <hi>Gods stead.</hi> Now as in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Consideration he could not be <hi>too humble,</hi> so
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97246:29"/>
in <hi>this</hi> Consideration, he cannot be too Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesticall, nor too careful of keeping up the Dignity of his Quality, nor in exacting <hi>that Reverence</hi> which is due to Gods Vicegerent from the Greatest as well as from the meanest of his Subjects; For <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti eris aliis, quanti tibi fueris,</hi> is a Truth, which all men in authority, especially <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> ought to consider, and to behave themselves <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly</hi>; doing nothing <hi>unworthy</hi> of their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or that may <hi>lessen</hi> them in the Eyes of their People. For there be many things that are not onely excusable, but commendable in private men that are not so in <hi>Princes.</hi> And even of things that are lawfull in themselves, all are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all persons of all Conditions.
And here the Rule is, <q>That such things that are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our Inclination, are to give place to such things as best become our Condition,</q> especially when our condition is such as that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands besides our selves are concern'd in it.
It is a notable saying that of NEHEMIAH, <hi>Should such a man as I flee</hi>? Nehem. 6.11.

Again, Shall such a Man as I, that am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to govern others, shew my self so weak, as not to be able to govern my self, and mine own Passions? <hi>Lastly,</hi> Shall such a Man as I, that am to be an example to all other, carry my self so that others by my example may be the worse Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto God, and consequently the worse Subjects unto my self also? God forbid; For seeing how apt the People are to follow the <hi>example</hi> of their Prince, especially in that which is evil; Princes ought, for their Peoples sake as well as for their own, to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful how they behave themselves, especially in publick, where all mens eyes are upon them. But because the People, though they are apt enough to follow the ill, yet they are not so apt to follow the good example of their Princes; it is not enough for a Prince to be a <hi>good Man,</hi> and consequently to give a good example; but he must be a <hi>good Prince</hi>: that is, such a one as knows how to make his Subjects such as they should be, by the severity of his Lawes, if they will not be perswaded to be so by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Eli</hi> we know was a good Man, and so was our HENRY the <hi>sixth,</hi> but neither of them was a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97246:30"/>
good Prince, and therefore they were both of them unhappy in themselves, in their Families, and in their Subjects. So that a Prince is not onely to go before his People by way of example, but he is to make them follow him, by countenancing, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, employing, and rewarding those that are vertuous, pious, industrious, and men able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do God and Him service either in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi>; as likewise to discountenance, discourage, cashiere, and punish such as are vicious, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, especially Atheistical and profane persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are the Plague-sores of Courts and States, and such as ought to be abhorr'd by all men, especially by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who being <hi>Gods Vice-gerents,</hi> are above all other things to take care of Gods Honour and Worship, and consequently not to suffer those that openl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> either deny him or affront him, to live under their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and much less to receive any countenance or favour at all from them.</p>
            <p>By this means, <hi>one good Prince</hi> will do more good towards a publick <hi>Reformation</hi> both in Church and State, then never so many or never so <hi>good Preachers</hi> (without such a Prince) will do, or can do. As appears by the many Reformations that were made in the Kingdom and Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereas none at all were made in the Kingdome and Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>; the reason whereof was, not because there were not as good Preachers, and as great Prophets, but because there were not as good Kings in <hi>Israel</hi> as there were in <hi>Judah</hi>: For <hi>Israel</hi> had its <hi>Elijahs</hi> and

               <hi>Elisha's,</hi> the greatest of Prophets; but it had not its HEZEKIAH'S and JOSIAH'S, the most pious of Kings; and they are pious and good Kings that must make a pious and good People, by providing such subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Governours under themselves both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> I mean such <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> for the one, and such BISHOPS and <hi>Ministers</hi> for the other, as may give a good account of the great Trust which by God and the King is committed to their ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>So that in order to Governing well, a Prince must <hi>First</hi> be qualified for it, and <hi>Secondly</hi> he must mind it, and make it his business by applying himself to it.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Qualifie</hi> him for it, many things are necessary, especially these two: <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> how it works, and how it is wrought upon; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>particular Genius</hi> and Disposition of the <hi>People</hi> he is to govern.</p>
            <p>In order to the former, it is a great felicity when a <hi>Prince,</hi> before he begins to govern at <hi>home,</hi> hath <hi>seen</hi> much of the World <hi>abroad,</hi> especially those parts of the World with which he is likely to have most to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97246:31"/>
do; when he hath learn'd their Languages, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd their Manners, by conversing with them in their <hi>Camps,</hi> and in their <hi>Courts,</hi> and hath considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their <hi>Interests,</hi> both as they relate to his <hi>own,</hi> and to <hi>other</hi> Nations. This is a great advantage, I say, in order to his future Government, when a Prince hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to have such an <hi>Education.</hi> And hence it is that both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> (the one in his <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and the other in his <hi>Aeneas</hi>) meaning to give us the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern or <hi>Idea</hi> of a perfect Prince, they make them both to be <hi>long abroad</hi> amongst <hi>foreign</hi> Nations, before they settle at <hi>home</hi>; and so was our HENRY the <hi>seventh,</hi> one of our ablest Princes.</p>
            <p>Neither is it amiss for a <hi>Prince,</hi> in order to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of his <hi>future Government,</hi> to be for a time under a <hi>Cloud,</hi> and to be Hardned both in his Body and his Mind by suffering Affliction, and thereby to know his <hi>Friends</hi> from his <hi>Enemies,</hi> both at home and abroad; an important advantage, which no Prince that never was in Adversity, can have, or make use of. Besides, Princes that are bred up in that <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Affliction,</hi> are commonly much more prudent, and pat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, and wary, and thrifty, and more inclinable to Piety, to Charity, to Clemency, to Modesty, and Moderation in time of <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and to all other Moral and Religious Vertues, then they would be otherwise. And therefore we see that God thought fit to breed up the <hi>man after his own heart</hi> in this <hi>School of Affliction</hi>; and perhaps it was his breeding in this School that made him to be so: However, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97246:32"/>
that even after he <hi>was</hi> King, God would not admit him to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of his Kingly Power, till he had spent some years under this <hi>Discipline</hi>; which is the very case of our <hi>present</hi> SOVERAIGN, as well as it was <hi>Davids</hi>; and therefore I doubt not but God had the same Design in the breeding of them both; namely, to make them as <hi>Glorious afterwards</hi> by their <hi>Actions,</hi> as they had been <hi>formerly</hi> by their <hi>Sufferings</hi>: Neither do I doubt, but <hi>our David</hi> will do, as that <hi>other David</hi> tells us He did, <hi>He will rule us prudently with all his power.</hi> Psal. 78.71.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis</hi>; No one Princes <hi>own</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is sufficient to make him a Master of this Art: He must take in therefore the <hi>experience</hi> of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages,</hi> as well as of his <hi>own,</hi> and consequently he must spend some time in <hi>Books</hi> as well as in <hi>business</hi>; especially in <hi>Histories,</hi> whereby he shall be truly and impartially inform'd, how, and by what means some Princes in all Ages have made themselves <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> and others have made themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> and <hi>infamous</hi>: And (considering that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same Causes produce the same Effects) a wise Prince will <hi>imitate</hi> them in his <hi>Actions,</hi> to whom he desires to be most like in his <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More especially he ought to acquaint himself with the <hi>Histories</hi> of his <hi>own Nation,</hi> that he may not be a stranger at home, but may know the particular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and humour of his own People, and how he is to apply himself to them, to make himself honour'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and obeyed, and beloved by them; carefully obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97246:32"/>
which of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> were so, and which of them were not so, and what difference it was in their Actions, which produced that difference in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Affections, and in their own Fortunes·</p>
            <p>But of all <hi>other Books,</hi> let him <hi>especially</hi> acquaint himself with the BOOK <hi>of God</hi>; which <hi>David</hi> (though no Prince had less time to spare from Action) made his daily study, nay he studied it <hi>night and day,</hi> as himself tels us: And good reason had he to do so; for by reading <hi>this</hi> Book <hi>he came to have more understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then all his Teachers,</hi> as he tels us in one place;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.9</note> nay to have <hi>more wisdome then all the Ancients,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10</note> when he was yet Young, as he tels us in another place; and to be <hi>wiser then all his Enemies,</hi> (not excepting <hi>Achitophel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) as he tels us in a third place.<note place="margin">Vers. 9</note>
            </p>
            <p>But though all that is written in Gods Book was written for our <hi>Instruction,</hi> yet because all of it was not written for the Instruction of Kings, <hi>as</hi> they are Kings, I wish Kings would find leisure to read so much of it at least, as was written of <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>by Kings</hi>; I mean the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they will find the Best Direction they can have in point of <hi>Government</hi> by way of <hi>example</hi>; together with the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> wherein they will find the best Instruction that can be given them in order to the same end, by way of Precept and Counsel. Or if this be still too much, that they would but read <hi>once a week</hi> the <hi>Votum Davidis,</hi> that <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> (as I may so call it) I mean the 101. <hi>Psalm,</hi> which though it be but a very short one,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97246:33"/>
yet, as I conceive, what <hi>most concerns a King,</hi> in order to the governing of Himself, his Family, and his Kingdomes, is either expresly or virtually conteined in it.</p>
            <p>And now when a <hi>lawfull Hereditary</hi> Soveraign Prince is <hi>thus</hi> Qualified, when he is of as Ancient and as Royal an Extraction as any Prince can be (as having all the Royal Bloud of <hi>Europe</hi> concentred in his Veins) when he is Comely in his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erfected by the Knowledge of Men, Books, and Business; when a Prince, I say, Is <hi>thus Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and withal intends the Work he hath to do, by an actual application of his mind to it, and by a careful and constant prosecution of it, have we not reason to believe that such a Prince is mark'd out by the Divine Providence for some Great and Glorious Work, or other? And what can be a greater, or more glorious Work, then the setling and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of a great <hi>Empire,</hi> after it hath been so much, and so long shaken and shatter'd, as <hi>This</hi> of <hi>ours</hi> hath been? And what more Evident Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks can we have, that <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> but <hi>this is</hi> the Man mark'd out by Heaven for the effecting of this great and glorious work, then those, which the <hi>Star</hi> at his <hi>Birth</hi> did point to, and which we our selves have since seen come to pass with our own Eyes?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97246:33"/>
especially in the <hi>two</hi> most Memorable and most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Particulars; I mean, First, His almost <hi>miraculous Preservation</hi> from many and great <hi>Dangers,</hi> especially in, and after the Battel of <hi>Worcester</hi>; And Secondly, His as much if not <hi>more miraculous Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to his <hi>Crown,</hi> after his <hi>second Exile.</hi> The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of God indeed was visible in <hi>them both</hi>; but (as I think) more signally and more remarkably in the <hi>latter,</hi> then in the <hi>former</hi>; For many Princes perhaps have in as wonderful a manner escaped as great dangers; but was it ever heard of in the World before, that a King, after having been so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and after the Government it self of his Kingdome had been so often changed, and after a new generation of men, that knew not <hi>Joseph,</hi> was sprung up in it; Nay, that even when the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent men against him, and most irreconcileable men to him were in possession of the Present Power, and were Enacting a final Abjuration of him, that <hi>then,</hi> even <hi>then,</hi> I say, so beyond and above the hopes of his Friends, so contrary to the desires and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of his Enemies, and so much to the amazement of the whole World, he should be so solemnly Invited, so magnificently Conducted, so tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly Received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so joyfully and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acknowledged and Welcomed by all the Subjects; And all this, without <hi>blood,</hi> without <hi>blows,</hi> without <hi>bargain,</hi> and without any <hi>obligation</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at all to any <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> Prince or State for it? And is not this as much as if God should have said to us in plain

terms, <hi>Behold the Man</hi>; behold your <hi>King</hi>; Behold <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Sufferer,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi>; the Grand-Child of <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Wise</hi> on the one side, and of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> on the other, and Heir to the several Excellencies of them both: <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> that must build up the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and make up the breaches in <hi>Sion,</hi> by Restoring and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whatsoever is yet wanting, either in regard of our Civil concernments, or our Spiritual: <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> that must Cure all our Jealousies, Banish all our Fears, Confirm all our Hopes, and Settle all our Distractions? Lastly, <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> that was Design'd by the Divine Providence, that hath been Preserved by the Divine Power, that is Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Divine Wisdome, and Brought home again to us by the Divine Goodnesse and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to <hi>settle</hi> and <hi>prolong</hi> the <hi>State</hi> of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The State,</hi> I say; and that <hi>First,</hi> as it signifies the <hi>Government it self</hi> in the Essential and Legal Frame and Constitution of it; And <hi>Secondly,</hi> as it signifies the <hi>Outward splendour of that Government,</hi> arising from Peace, Plenty, Wealth, Strength, Security, Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and whatsoever other ingredients there are, to make a Nation happy.</p>
            <p>But first the <hi>State</hi> must be setled in the <hi>former</hi> of these Notions, as it signifies its Ancient Legal and Essential Constitution, before it can be setled in the latter; I mean, in its <hi>outward splendour</hi> and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

hitherto, hath been to no purpose, if we do not yet believe This Truth, if we are not yet grown so much <hi>wiser</hi> then we were, as to be convinc'd, That our <hi>Old Government,</hi> without any alteration at all in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of it, is <hi>best for us.</hi> And by the old Government, I mean the <hi>thing,</hi> as well as the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Monarchy</hi>; and that in <hi>all</hi> its parts, as well as in <hi>some</hi> of them; You cannot have the Old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Civil</hi> part of the State, if you have it not in the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>; neither can the King be <hi>supreme</hi> in <hi>one,</hi> unlesse he be <hi>supreme</hi> in <hi>both</hi>: For, where there are <hi>two Supremes,</hi> there can be <hi>no Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> Now we know, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is from <hi>God,</hi> and therefore we may know, that whatsoever is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Monarchy, or Inconsistent with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, is <hi>not from God,</hi> because Gods Ordinances cannot destroy or clash one against another. But Thanks be to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> for it, our Old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is already <hi>Restored</hi> in <hi>both</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> of it; and yet it cannot properly be said to be <hi>restored,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be <hi>setled,</hi> as it was before; and <hi>setled as it was before,</hi> I am afraid, it is <hi>not yet,</hi> I hope it <hi>will be</hi>; And when our Good Old Government Civil and Ecclesiastical is once setled; <hi>then,</hi> but not <hi>till then,</hi> we may expect, that the Ancient Splendour and Honour, together with the Peace, Prosperity and Security of the <hi>English Nation</hi> will be Restored and Setled also.
