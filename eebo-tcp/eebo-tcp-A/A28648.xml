            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The maſter of the ſhip having no evill intention, yet ſeeing a ſhip flee before ſhe was chaſed, could not but wonder what the matter ſhould be; and as the common Proverbe is, A flier muſt needs have a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower: he left off his own neceſſarie journie, and preſently hoyſing up all his ſails made after her, but ſhe going a great deal more ſwiftly than he, by reaſon that the ſhip had onely a ſide winde, and that not ſtrong enough nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was forc'd to ſend a ſwifter meſſenger after her: ſo diſcharging two Peeces from the chaſe, he had ſo good fortune that one took away a great peece of her ſterne, the other did break her orelap preſently. She af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a ſhrowd meſſage let down her Ancher and ſtaied ſtill. So the Maſter of the ſhip preſently ſent out his long boat for her well manned, and brought her up; being

asked from whence they came, and whither they were bound, anſwered that they came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were going for <hi>Spaine.</hi> Being askt by whoſe inſtigation they fled, ſhewed the Captain of the ſhip: The maſter asking him the reaſon why he had cauſed the Galley to flie two or three times, he would anſwer nothing, being as it ſeems ſworn to the Rebels to do their buſineſſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: But being threatned with the Rack if he would not confeſſe, at laſt he told that he had Letters from the Earl of <hi>Tyron,</hi> to the King and Peers of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the Maſter preſently deſired to ſee them, but he drawing them out of his pocket, would have thrown them into the Sea, had not they ſtruck againſt one of the ropes, and fallen back again into the ſhip, he thinking them irrecoverable if they fell into the Sea. When the ſhip was now under ſail, the Maſter taking them up, and reading them found this to be the ſuperſcription.
