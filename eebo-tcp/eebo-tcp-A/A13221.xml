         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

more private and premeditated conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and uttered in publicke, and <hi>extempore,</hi>
as it ſeemed. The firſt was at his Majeſties
firſt landing upon the coaſts of <hi>Germanie;</hi>
where ſo ſoone as ever he out of his long
boate ſet his foote upon the dry Land, he
thus by prayer and thankeſgiving, in Gods
Name tooke poſſeſſion of the Countrey;
himſelfe whileſt his men were landing, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a little aſide, and before them all, upon
his knees, uttering theſe words of devotion.
O moſt great God, that commaundeſt what
ever thou pleaſeſt both in heaven, and earth,
and in the ſurging Seas: what thankfulneſſe
am I now bound to render unto thee, for
that thou haſt preſerved me thus ſafely, in
all this ſo perilous a voyage? Againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
doe I from the very bottome of my
heart and ſoule, giue thankes unto thee:
and here I humbly beſeech thee, that ſeeing,
as thou very well knoweſt, I haue not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
this expedition for any private end
of mine owne, but onely for thine honours
ſake; and to be ſome comfort and aſſiſtance
unto thine afflicted Church: ſo (if ſo be the
time which thy ſelfe haſt appoynted, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
come) thou wouldſt now be pleaſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18676:20"/>
to favour and bleſſe me hereafter alſo: and
that, eſpecially, thou wouldſt ſend me a
fayre winde and a proſperous; that the
Army yet left behinde, which out of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people and Nations I haue gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I may with joyfull eyes ſhortly here
behold, and with a happie beginning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
with them the glory of thy holy name.
Amen.</p>
               <p>When his Counſellors and Commanders
then next his perſon, ſaw their devout King
thus on the bare ground upon his knees;
and heard with what a fervencie of ſpirit he
uttered theſe devotions; an inward comfort
and an holy joy they tooke at it, wrought
more with them than their enemies could
yet ever doe; that is, even forced, and preſſed
teares out of their manly eyes. This his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Majeſtie then perceiving, Forbeare to
weepe, ſayes he to them, but heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
your prayers with me: for the greater
the army of prayers is, the greater and more
aſſured ſhall the victory be. He that prayes
diligently, hath in part overthrowne the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
already, and already gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Thus having ſayd, he out of two hundred
long boates lands his men, then on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18676:21"/>
ſhoares ſide, and then ſends them to his
ſhippes to fetch more: and God ſo heard
him, and the winde ſo favoured him; that
according to his former prayers, his whole
Army very ſhortly, and very ſafely arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>I will not here compare this prayer of this
pious and victorious Prince, vnto that of the
great <hi>Ioſuah;</hi> at whoſe requeſt the Sunne
ſtood ſtill, as the winde here did at his: but
that you may ſee that God did indeed heare
the prayers of this King too; I will now
giue you a more eminent example of it. The
Papiſts, had one of theirs done it, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
haue cryed out, A miracle: and
well they might: for few ſuch they haue,
but I will onely thinke of it, as of a preſent
and a viſible bleſſing ſent from that great
God, to whom the windes and the Seas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.
And thus it was.</p>
               <p>The King a little after this, having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
upon <hi>Stetin;</hi> and his Army now readie
upon the ſhoare, and his boats readie upon
the River to imbarke them; the winde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
was contrary, and ſo had beene for
ſome dayes before. This the King obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
turning a little aſide, he before his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18676:21"/>
with bended knees, and hands lift up to
Heaven, uttered theſe words.</p>
               <p>O thou moſt juſt God! full well thou
knoweſt, that this enterpriſe I did not at
firſt undertake, out of any raſhneſſe, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
but for the glory of thy moſt holy
Name, and the defence of the truth of thy
Word: here, therefore, now call I vpon thy
Godhead, and moſt humbly doe I beſeech
thee; that with the ayre of thy favour, and
with a proſperous winde, thou wouldſt
vouchſafe to breath vpon this my vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Amen.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this prayer ended, but the
winde ſuddenly, as a man might ſay, chopt
about, and ſwel'd the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſayles with ſo
hard a gale, that the whole Fleete paſſing
the <hi>Swing,</hi> or arme of the <hi>Oder,</hi> was in two
houres ſpace runne full ſixe <hi>Germane</hi> myles
(twentie of ours perchance if not more) and
all on the ſudden, when they were little
looked for, came to an Anchor within an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> myle of <hi>Stetin,</hi> to the great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the beholders, and the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18676:22"/>
of the hopes and purpoſes of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts;</hi>
who had a deſigne within two
dayes after, to haue layd ſiege to the ſame
Towne, had not God thus miraculouſly
prevented them.</p>
               <p>And thus much, though I now giue you,
out of a <hi>Latine</hi> Copie; yet, to confeſſe the
truth, did I in the writing of my former
Booke, finde mentioned in one of the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

by a ſtrong and a ſudden Northerly winde,
ſtrangely advanced through the <hi>Oder,</hi> even

9. larger Squares; at eyther end of the Paper mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with the letter <hi>A.</hi> All which is called the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
or the Captaines ground, becauſe there the Colonell
lyes, whereas you ſee the word <hi>Coloneſt</hi> written: and the
Captaines in their ſeniority, as you ſee their Huts or Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
marked, each on the head of his owne Company.</p>
               <p>The number over the Colonels Hutt, ſhowes it to bee
48. foot broad; that is twice as broad as any of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
cabbins, which you ſee marked with 24. At eyther
end of this row of Squares, you ſee the number 30. mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
which ſhowes how many foot long, each of theſe
greater Huts is.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Diſcipline is, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to have but 8. Companies to a Regiment, ſo many
Huts you ſee on the top of the Quarter; 4. on each ſide of
the Colonels. And the reaſon of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo few men in a Regiment, as 1008. and ſo few men
in a Company, as 126. (thoſe 1008. men being devided
among 8. Captaines) is, that hee may both have the
more places of preferment, and the more Officers to
command his few men. An advantage which other
Generals have not: who admit 3000. perchance, into
a Regiment, and 200. 250. or 300. into a Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>The Rowes of leſſer Squares, marked on each ſide of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the paper with the letter <hi>B.</hi> are the Huts for the Soldiers
to lye in. Betweene the Front of which, and the Colonels
ground, you ſee a long voyd ſpace or diſtance; which is
20. foot wide, as you ſee it at each end marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:18676:49"/>
The vſe of it is, for the drawing vp of the Companies,
or of ſome of them, or for the meeting of Souldiers to
ſpeake with their Captaines: and for freſher ayre. This
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſpace is marked with <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Right vnder the Colonels Hutt you ſee another void
ſpace, as wide as the Colonels Hutt is, and as long as all
the Quarter for the Common ſoldiours is: marked with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  <hi>D.</hi> The vſe of it is, for the Officers of the Regiment, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called, the <hi>Officers of the Staffe.</hi> Such be the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaſters
of the Regiment, the 2. Regiment-Schults;
the Preachers, Clarke Surgeons; Prouoſt-Marſhals; Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Weble,
Stock-Knights, Drummer, Hangman, with
others: as is to be ſeene in the Kings Commiſſion for the
raiſing of a Regiment.</p>
               <p>Of the Quarters for the Common Soldiours, on eyther
ſide of this long void ſpace, theſe be the proportions. All
the little Squares, be Hutts or Cabins of wood. In the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> longer rowes, marked with the letter <hi>M.</hi> on the firſt
Hutt, are the Muſquettiers lodged; and in the ſhorter
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> rowes, marked with <hi>P.</hi> be the Pikemen lodged; one
row of Muſquettiers, and one row of Pikes, make up one
compleat Band, or Company of 126. Men. In the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
row, be 24. Huts; and in the Pikemens, but 18.
The reaſon of which, ſee in the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for a priuate Company. Each of theſe Hutts is 9. foot
Square, that is, 3. yards euery way: and whereas one
row of Muſquetiers, and one row of Pickes, belong to
one Company; theſe therefore are neerer ſet together
then the rowes of Pikes belonging to ſeuerall Companies
are; for the Pikes and Muſquetiers of the ſame Company,
are parted with a ſtreet, but 6. foote wide; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Pikes of ſeuerall companies is a ſtreet of 18.
foote wide: and betwixt the Muſquettiers of ſeuerall
Companies, a ſtreet of 12 foote wide. And ſo you ſee the
ſeuerall proportions marked. The length of the Row
of Pikes, is but 162. foote; as you ſee it marked betwixt
the 2. firſt Rowes of their Hutts: and the length of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18676:49"/>
Muſquettiers Row, is 216. foote; as is marked in the
Margent. Caſt, now, the diſtances of Bredth, and they
amount to 360. foot: and ſo broad is the whole Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Below all this, in the Reere or lower end of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you have avoyd ſpace of 14. foot of ground, running
all the bredth of the Quarter: ſerving againe for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of ayre, &amp;c. This is marked with <hi>E.</hi> And laſt of
all may you behold another allowance of ground, marked
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with the letter <hi>F.</hi> which is for the Marcketenters; that
is, the Market-holders, Chapmen, Victualers, and Sutlers
of the Regiment. Adde now, the diſtances of length toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they come to 300. foot: which is the length of the
whole Quarter, the allowance of ground for one entire
Regiment.</p>
               <p>But the chiefe point of the Diſcipline, is in the number &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the placing of the Huts, &amp; the men in them. Concerning
the number, know, that there be 3. men lodged in every Hutt,
aſwell Pikes as Musketiers: ſo that in the 24. Huts of Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of one Company, there be 72. men: and in the 18. Huts
of Pikemen of one Company, there bee but 54. men; which
numbers added together, come to 126; which is a compleat
Band or Company, in the Kings Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Theſe 72. Muskettiers, againe, be devided into 3. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralſhips:
and the 54. Pikemen alſo into 3. Corporalſhips.
Of Muskettiers, 4. Rotts or Files of marching men, goe to
one Corporalſhip: And of Pikemen, there goe but 3. Rotts
or Files, to a Corporalſhip. So that 24. Muskettiers, goe to
one Corporalſhip; and of Pikes 18. according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of eyther of their Cabbins. Whereas againe, the Kings
Diſcipline is, ever to march 6. deepe, or in File: therefore in
every 2. Huts, is there one Rot or File of men lodged, which
preſently know how to put themſelves into order. Thus hath
every Corporall of Muskettiers, 8. Hutts to looke vnto; and
every Corporall of Pikes, 6. Cabins under him. This certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and diſpoſing of the numbers, ſerves much for the private
Goverment.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>le for the reſiſting of the Enemy. Whereas you ſee two
Rowes of Pikes, and two Rowes of Musketiers ſtill together,
with their Cabbindooers opening inward one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this is the vſe of it. Suppoſe the Enemy (in the night

                  </gap>aire order of battell. The Pikes gone, then the two next
Rowes of Muskettiers ioyning together, march alſo out on
both ſides of their Pikes, where they are ready inſtantly to
flancke them. Thus one Squadron or halfe Regiment iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

halfe on the other, preſently draw themſelues vp into two
compleat <hi>Battaglias:</hi> who ſtill finde their Colonell and

the Enemy falls; before he can poſſibly (march he neuer ſo

where they all ſtand together, is vpon a thing like a payre of

that lyes in the Reere of the quarter by comming in firſt, ſets
downe his Pike inmoſt; and he that comes in laſt, leaues his

So that the Foreman, the Right-hand man, or the

riſe vp: and their Armes as ready as themſelues; So that if

obſerved by the Emperour, to be more then a weake and a

               <p>1 Their Reſolutions in the <hi>Dyet</hi> of <hi>Leypſich</hi> were, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to continue their loyalty &amp; obedience towards their Lord

with the King, till either he were ſtrong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
them, or the Emperour ſo weake, as not to annoy them:
neither of which they could yet diſcover. All the Summer

time were the 3. <hi>Imperiall</hi> Generalls <hi>Furſtenberg, Altringer,</hi>

of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> (the cheife Engine indeed of all the motion:)
they ſhall find him to haue beene the leſſe too blame, if they
conſider how ſtrongly he was by the other partie laid at: ſo
wrought hee was by another fineneſſe, that notwithſtanding
he had beene earneſtly enough ſollicited by the King, in time
to provide for himſelfe, by a ſeaſonable declaring on his ſide; had beene foretold, what would one day come of it: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the difficultie that was in it, for him to diſcover the
Toyle he was alreadie gotten into: it had ſeemed a diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
againſt all the civilities of Courtſhip, to haue vpon ſuch
termes, broken ſhort off with the Emperour. Flatterie and
Proteſtation (the two Court-Iuglers in ordinarie) had caſt
ſuch a miſt before the Dukes eyes, that it was not eaſie for
him to diſcover how the <hi>Leger-demain</hi> was conveyed againſt
him. The Emperours Ambaſſadour all this while reſident
with him, had much courted and ſmooth'd him vp, that his
Highneſſe ſervices and endeerments to the Emperour, were
too many ever to be forgotten. Flattered vp beſides he was
with that glorious ſtile, of being the Pillar of the Empire, and
the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Germanie.</hi> And as much plyed with warme
clothes by ſome of his owne Councell he was: who though
his ſervants, were yet the Penſioners of the houſe of <hi>Austria.</hi>
But for all this, could thoſe of other Nations by broad day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
diſcerne, that the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> was likely another
day to finde no other favour at the Emperours hands, then
what <hi>

of his owne, the Duke at length (by the light of his owne

Countrey now all on a flame about his eares.) came to haue
the ſight of: which with a juſt indignation he in ſome high
termes repreſented vnto the Emperors Ambaſſador, at his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
diſmiſſing him from his Court. Then could he diſcerne,
that the kiſſe which the Ambaſſador at parting offered to his
hand, was but a <hi>Iudas kiſſe,</hi> and ſo was he bold to call it.</p>
               <p>Then did he remember alſo, how little either his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

good peace, had hither to beene reſpected by the <hi>Catholikes:</hi>
and that a many of them had all this while beene of the Duke

perchance with applauſe too) this following paſſage, (and
that in publike Oration then made before him, by way of

For the <hi>Palatine</hi> his ſonne had the King of great <hi>Britaine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeded

               <p>This anſwere being cheerefully, and with much aſſurance

battle, or to make a longer warre of it. The votes were a
little devided at the firſt. The King (to trie what mettall
the Duke was made of) frames ſome reaſons to draw the
warre out into length: againſt which the Duke makes uſe
of theſe two Arguments.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Saxonies</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the Battle.</note> That it concerned himſelfe ſpeedily to fight, that hee
might free as ſoone as might be, his Subjects and Dominions
of the enemie.</p>
               <p>2. That it alſo as much concernd the King too: for that
the Countrey now halfe taken by the enemie, was not long
able to maintaine two ſuch armies.</p>
               <p>That the Duke ſourged to the battle, was not, I ſuppoſe,
becauſe his courage was more then the Kings; but becauſe
his neceſſities were more perſonall, and more preſſing. If he
ſought not, all were loſt; and if hee were overthrowne, all
were out loſt then: much more honourable beſides it was, to
dye for his Countrey, in the field, in a braue battle; then to
liue the Emperors <hi>Bandite</hi> or Almes-man for a while; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to die without an Epitaph, or haue that of a coward,
<hi>branded,</hi> rather then <hi>engraven</hi> upon his Tomb-ſtone. This
hanging off of the Kings, drew, no doubt, the Tyes ſomething
the ſtraighter, which he before had upon the Duke: enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him (perchance) into ſome new promiſes, and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obligations. Thus did the wiſe King finely ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be drawne into the hazard, chiefly upon the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the Duke: keeping to himſelfe the inward content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he found, to ſee <hi>Saxony</hi> now ſo forward; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the reaſon of warre withall,<note place="margin">The Battle agreed upon.</note> which privately cald up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to haſten the encounter, as much as it did <hi>Tilly</hi> to
deferre it: whom theſe of his owne ſide (now the battle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18676:56"/>
is loſt) condemne for fighting. Well the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> that
had beene thus forward in the adviſe, would alſo be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the enterpriſe: For I finde him the firſt man in the
field; which the King was willing to permit alſo: for beſides
that it was an honour to the Duke to be the forwardeſt in
fighting for his owne Countrey, the King who (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
is) knew well enough how to lead his men; though he
droue not the <hi>Saxons</hi> before him, yet was he the ſurer of them
by having them thus before him.</p>
               <p>Much about this time (as the report goes) did the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Tilly</hi> (out of the fatall bravary of a confident Souldier,
and the inevitableneſſe of his owne deſtinie) invite his owne
overthrow,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tilly</hi> invites the King to fight with him.</note> by a Trumpet ſent unto the King, with a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to this purpoſe: <hi>That as hee was a braue Cavalier, hee
ſhould come and giue him a Battle.</hi> This low terme of <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
the Kings heroicall ſpirit receiving with a juſt diſdaine,
(as it is ſayd) trampled upon the Letter, thus replying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
unto the Trumpet: <hi>What! doth your Generall thinke mee
worthy of no better a ſtyle then of a Cavalier? I am a King;
and tell him I ſhall well finde him out. Tilly</hi> vpon receit of this
meſſage, prepares his Army, as if to accept of a victory, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to fight much for it; and very welcome to his men,
was the tidings of a pitcht battle: ſo confident they were of
their owne ſtrength (which they counted invincible) and ſo
glad of the oportunity. What ſayth the Count of <hi>Pappen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heym,</hi>
(Field marſhall unto <hi>Tilly,</hi>) when he ſaw the blood
prodigiouſly dropping from the houſes at Hall, where hee
then was; muſt wee bleed? will the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> beare
us? that's impoſſible. Proclamation hereupon is through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Quarter of the Leaguer made, that vpon the hearing of
certaine warning peeces, every man ſhould repaire to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and to his order. Some of <hi>Tillyes</hi> Councell of warre
were of opinion, that having fortified their leaguer, it were
beſt to expect the <hi>Swedens</hi> falling on vpon it, as they had
done them at <hi>Sweds</hi> and <hi>Werben.</hi> But the moſt voices and
courages prevailed, that it were more honour to meete the

Vpon the fatall 7. of <hi>September</hi> therefore being <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday;</hi>
the Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> with full 44000. braue men, firſt
advances from his Leaguer into the field.<note place="margin">The place of the battell.</note> The place, was a

about a mile from the Towne of <hi>Leipſich.</hi> Part of <hi>Tillyes</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer
was neere vnto the common burying place without the

to be contradicted by <hi>Sleidan;</hi> who aſſignes the place of that

which they of the <hi>Germane</hi> Nation, affirme to be nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
vnto <hi>Hall:</hi> 18. or 20. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Leipſich.</hi> Vpon
this plaine aforeſaid, there is a riſing ground, a little hill and a
wood likewiſe towards the Weſt: whereabouts (with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<hi>Omen</hi>) the place of execution alſo is; as you may perceiue
deſcribed in the firſt Mappe. Here had <hi>Tilly</hi> (like a prudent
Generall that was carefull for all advantages) at firſt placed
himſelfe; the Hill, beſides that it ſerved him commodioſly
to plant his Canon vpon; was very eaſie withall for him to
deſcend: but very troubleſome on the other ſide, for the
<hi>Swedes</hi> to climbe vp vnto. The wood ſerved him, both to
hide his men in at firſt, and for a retreat afterwards for them,
if they ſhould be put vnto it. The watch word for his Army
was <hi>Sancta Maria;</hi> or as ſome <hi>High Dutch</hi> Relations ſay,
<hi>Mary the Mother of God.</hi> The token to know one another
by, was <hi>white ſtrings,</hi> or <hi>ribbands,</hi> about their armes and in
their helmets: as if they had beene <hi>Diademes,</hi> and that that
day would haue made them all Kings.</p>
               <p>The vnion being thus made, and the battell concluded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
betwixt the Kings Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

That ſame night had the King a ſtrange dreame,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Swedens</hi> dreame.</note> (a divine

he had his enemie <hi>Tilly</hi> faſt by the haire of the head, which

in the day of battell. The next morning (being the fatall

               </p>
               <p>And this was the Kings admirable order of Embatteling:
which you ſhall much the better pleaſe your ſelfe in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of; if you will take the paines but to looke for every
thing in the Mappe, as you goe along. A new kinde of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling
was this vnto <hi>Tilly,</hi> which as much helped to beate
him, as the valour of the men did, that fought in it. Every
part of it, conſiſted of ſeverall <hi>Maniples</hi> and ſmall <hi>Bodyes</hi> of
men: of which if any one were overthrowne, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much hurt done, as when one of <hi>Tillyes</hi> greater <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglions</hi>
were broken: and they might much eaſier, (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the nimbleneſſe of their motion, and the ſmall ſpace of

another. And if the thinneſſe of the <hi>Files</hi> (as being never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
ſix deepe) were not able (tis true) to beare off any
great ſhock or impreſſion; yet by bringing, by that meanes,
more hands to fight at once, then the enemies order poſſibly
could doe; they were able on the ſudden to doe the more
execution. Vpon the ſight of it in the Mappe, you will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

make this judgement: That one part ſo fences, ſo backs,
ſo flancks one another: is ſo readie to ſecond, to relieue one
another: ſo apt, eyther to ſend out ſuccours; or to receiue
into their hinder-wards or rancks, any of their former fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that ſhall happen to be over-layd: that the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
lookes like ſome impregnable Citie, with its Baſtiles, its
Towers, its Bulwarks, and ſeverall Retreates about it. So that
well may the men be killd; but very hardly ſhall the whole
order be rowted. And of this we haue experience in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
where there was not (that I can finde) any one Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the whole advantage of the wind from the King, (one poynt
whereof the King had with much adoe gained:) both Horſe
and Foote were ſo farre advanced before their fellowes, that
they were even parted from the reſt of their left wing. Theſe
having too raſhly engaged themſelues by the eares with the
Kings Horſe, found themſelues ſo galled by the Muskettiers,
with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Kings Horſe-troupes were lyned, (which they
there little looked for: by reaſon the Muskettiers being our-commanded
men could not at firſt be diſcerned, becauſe they
had no Colours with them) that they were quickly made
to get them further off. Traverſing thereupon their ground
about to the left hand; and thruſting in betwixt the Kings
right wing,<note place="margin">The D. of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> charges <hi>Bannier</hi> in the Reere of the right vving.</note> and the maine Battell; they there fell fowle vpon

ſome able troupes; which both vtterly ſeparated them from
the reſt of their fellowes, and cloaſed them in withall: ſo that
betwixt them and <hi>Bannier;</hi> they were (as the Baron of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenberg</hi>

but there their Horſes being ſhot vnder them, too it on foote
they goe with ſword and piſtoll. Both (to be briefe) are
there ſlaine; and both, (as their deſtinies directed it) fell
downe dead together, one vpon another: and <hi>Death,</hi> who
having beene at ſo many Duells, knowing himſelfe now able

               <p>The Earle of <hi>Furſtenberg</hi> having ſorely raked the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
and charged quite thorough them; was with his owne Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the left wing, which was then next before him, that he now
chanced vpon. There did Colonell <hi>Hall,</hi> a braue Gentleman

               <p>It ſeemes that <hi>Hall</hi> had followed <hi>Furſtenberg,</hi> even vnto

was ſeperated in this fight from the reſt of the Army; excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from the braue Cavalier Colonel <hi>Collenbach;</hi> with whom
(ſayth he) I was. Now <hi>Collenbachs</hi> place in the Battell, the

in which very place, <hi>Chaimaries</hi> ſets himſelfe, in a Mappe of
the Battell drawne by his owne hand; which came over with
his Letter. This enquirie helpes vs to know, whereabouts
the chiefe of the Encounter at that time was: wherein you
may ſatisfie your ſelfe, by looking into the Mappe. No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
were <hi>Furſtenbergs</hi> Foote defeated; but 7000. or 8000. of
thoſe <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> that had diſcomfited the <hi>Saxons;</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
vpon the place where the <hi>Saxons</hi> had beene lately
Marſhalled. The duſt and ſmoake were ſo great, that they
were vpon <hi>Collenbach</hi> ere he was aware: and yet as neere him
as they were, not being able to diſcerne their Colours; he
knew not whether they were friends or foes. The ſame
doubt poſſeſſes the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> alſo; who being ſo neere <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbach,</hi>
never offered ſo much as to charge him: imagining,
perchance, that he might be ſome of their owne maine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
which <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> had thereabouts of late defeated.
At laſt (ſayes <hi>Chaimaries</hi>) my minde gaue me that they were
enemies; yea I told <hi>Collenbach</hi> that they were not our men.
And by this time had the enemy diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18676:65"/>
Whether he miſunderſtood the meſſage, or what els ſhould

<hi>Lumsdell:</hi> who with the Lord <hi>Reayes</hi> men, and his owne,
helpt to make up <hi>Hebrons</hi> Brigade complete: the moſt of the

that were led by ſuch honourable perſonages. Something al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of what was here done by the <hi>Imperialiſts;</hi> we may learne
by the ſayd valiant Baron of <hi>Cronenbergs</hi> Letter. In foure
houres (ſayth <hi>Cronenberg</hi>) I charged the enemy foure times
with my Regiment: judge you whether we were not at hot
ſervice, in ſo much that I verily beleeved that I had defeated
my enemy, and that the victory was ours: I not knowing that
our left wing was ſo miſerably defeated. And this miſtake
was by reaſon of the great ſmoake; for we could not poſſibly
ſee aboue foure paces before vs. The enemy had poſſeſſed
themſelues of the place whereon our left wing was defeated:
I then went vp into the very face of them, even in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
where they brought many freſh Cornets of Horſe, and
ſome Regiments of foote to charge me. The whole Armie
doth know, yea and our Generall himſelfe will witneſſe it,
that but for me, our Generall had beene loſt: whom I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grievouſly hurt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tilly</hi> wounded and thought to be priſoner.</note> carryed ſafely off in deſpight of all the
enemies. There was a Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> that day ſerving on the
Emperours ſide, who behaved himſelfe like a Lyon: who
when all was loſt, came with our Generall, and two or three
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18676:66"/>
Horſemen onely in his company, into my Regiment, I being
then in full battell.</p>
               <p>Thus much writes the Baron of himſelfe, modeſtly: for
from other hands wee haue alſo received it, how that when
<hi>Rodolph Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tilly</hi> reſcued, and carryed out of the field.</note> had by his
valour and hardineſſe reſcued and fetcht off his Generall;
that the valiant <hi>Cronenberg</hi> carried them both out of the feild,
in the middeſt of his owne, now flying troupes.</p>
               <p>Thus by knowing of <hi>Cronenbergs</hi> place; we finde where
the Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> at this time was: and that it was Sir <hi>Iohn
Hebron</hi> that overthrew him. For this valour and faithfulneſſe
to their Generall, was the Baron <hi>Cronenberg</hi> much honored:
and the Duke afterwards entruſted with the keeping of the
key of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the Towne of <hi>Donawaert</hi> I meane: from
whence the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> did of late dayes beate him.</p>
               <p>The King having ſet on Sir <hi>Iohn Hebron</hi> vpon <hi>Tilly;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King with his right wing, charges thoſe in the Wood.</note> and
returned by this time to his owne Right wing; preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
forward with that towards the wood vpon the hill,
which <hi>Tilly</hi> had before appoynted for the Retreate of his
men: becauſe that hereabouts ſome Regiments had all this
while ſtayed, and others, that had beene rowted in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had hitherto reſorted; here to r'allee and conjoyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
together againe. To conjoyne themſelues together I
ſay: for whereas I finde foure of theſe Regiments now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
about the Wood, to be thoſe of <hi>Goies, Blanckhart, Cheſui,
Balderon</hi> and <hi>Diderichſteyn,</hi> (which laſt two made vp one
Regiment:) any man may by the numbers in the Mappe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that theſe foure were placed very farre aſunder in the
beginning of the Battell: even as farre as the numbers 8, 12,
15, and 19, are one from another. And this is an argument
of the great confuſion they had beene put vnto in the battell;
as others likewiſe had beene in the former fight, which <hi>Tillies</hi>
ſelfe had made: where <hi>Baumgartens</hi> Regiment which had
beene at firſt marſhalled neere the very end of the left wing,
at the number 4; was now conjoyned with <hi>Schomberg</hi> and
<hi>Cronenberg,</hi> whoſe firſt place was in the further end of the
right wing, at the numbers 26, and 27: and both theſe from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18676:67"/>
the ends of both wings, conjoyned with <hi>Tilly,</hi> in the <hi>middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
or <hi>mayn-battayle.</hi> But to the ſtory. The King now-in
perſon ſetting vpon theſe new revnited forces, with ſuch
courage and ſucceſſe charges in vpon them; that at the firſt
onſet cutting in peices thoſe troups that had the guard of the
Ordnance, and then turning the Canon vpon the reſidue: he
had the ſlaughter of a great many of them; and the rowting of
as many more. Yet all fled not: for the <hi>Goieſiſh, Blanckhartiſh,
Cheſuiſh,</hi> and <hi>Balderoniſh</hi> Regiments, before mentioned;
ſtood to their Armes brauely. Old Lads they were, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Souldiers too; ſuch as feared not an enemy with an
iron face, and that cared not for a halfepenny chop in their
owne fleſh. Theſe, to their great prayſe (as the Kings owne
deſcription of the Battell ſayes) made good the wood for a
long time againſt his Majeſtie, killd him a many of braue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.<note place="margin">&amp; overthrowes them.</note>
Nor would they budge a foote; for notwithſtanding
they were now deſperate and out of hope to be eyther ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or fetcht off, (all their Armie being by this time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
and they knwoing of it) yet did they fight it out
almoſt to the laſt man: a few of them onely (whom it had
beene pittie to haue killed) retrying themſelues when no
more could be done; vnder the benefit of a mixed Cloud, of
ſmoake, and duſt, and darkeneſſe. For by this time it was
neere vpon ſeaven a clocke at night: by which houre the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall</hi>
Army every where was altogether in diſorder, flight,
and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Thus after fiue houres hard fight,<note place="margin">The victory.</note> the victory fell vnto his
Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden:</hi> whoſe Horſemen ſo long continued the
chaſe; vntill the darkneſſe made it dangerous to purſue the
enemy any further. The <hi>Tillians</hi> fled every way; ſome to
<hi>Leipſich;</hi> others to <hi>Eilenburg,</hi> and the Townes thereabouts;
and others towards <hi>Hall:</hi> every man glad to hide his head
any where. The joyfull retreate being ſounded thereupon,
the Kings Armie, as Maiſters of the Feild, kept their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it; though but by lying vpon the bare ground, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the blew Skyes for that night. Conquerours, ſurely, had
beene worthy of a better harbourough; but the vniverſall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18676:67"/>
joy, ſuffered no man (but the wounded) to complaine of the
want of a featherbed.</p>
               <p>The next morning was the chace begunne againe;<note place="margin">The Chace.</note> when
the over-taken enemies, wanting eyther Leaders, or Armes,
or hearts; muſt ſuffer the Law of Armes to paſſe vpon them:
eyther to begge quarter, or endure the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>And this was the end of that formidable Armie of his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall</hi>
Majeſtie, and of the <hi>Catholike Leaguers;</hi> which for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
yeares together before the comming of the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> had given the Law vnto all <hi>Germany,</hi> had made the
name of <hi>Tilly</hi> ſo renowned. All the ill-gotten wealth, and
fore-gotten glory of it, was in poore fiue houres ſpace, (ſuch
is the fortune of the warres) now quite loſt and confounded.
This, I ſay, was the end of it. Nine or 10000. men, were left
dead in the field and chaſe; many thouſands ſorely wounded;
whereof ſome ſhortly after dyed, and others thereby vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made vnſerviceable: Diverſe were taken priſoners; and
6000. forſaking the ſide, tooke oath and pay, for the Kings
ſervice; not a few, beſides, running quite away, and never
more returning to their Colours.</p>
               <p>Thus of 44000. marching men, <hi>Tilly</hi> never came to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
16000. againe: perchance not ſo many; yea perhaps not
halfe ſo many of the ſelfe ſame men; at leaſtwiſe not halfe
ſo many of the Foote; who could not ſo faſt followe
their fleeing Generall, towards the <hi>Weſer.</hi> The King this
morning marching towards <hi>Leipſich;</hi> there ſeaſed vpon the
enemies whole ſtanding Camp. Here were found full 3000.
Wagons, with all their baggage, tents, and pavilions: a great
number of Cattle, Horſes, Oxen, Sheepe, Aſſes, Poultrie,
Bread, Wine, meate vpon the Spits, with other neceſſary
proviſions: much coſtly ſtuffe, with ſome gold and ſilver;
both in veſſell and readie money. There were many aboue
100. Enſignes and Cornets brought vnto the King, with 14.
great peices of halfe Curtoes, or Demicanon; and 16. ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
feild-peices, of 8. or 10. pound ball: ſome whereof had
the Armes of the Emperour vpon them; others of the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of <hi>Wallenſteyn,</hi> the <hi>Palſgraue,</hi> the Elector of
<hi>Brandenbnrg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:18676:68"/>
And thus haue we told you ſomething of what was done
in every part of the Battayle. The foure great Brigades of
Foote in the Van of the Kings mayn Battayle, were thought
too ſtrong to be medled withall; the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> therefore
never fell on there. Nor did any part of them, nor of their
after-troupes, (thoſe I meane, betwixt the Battayle and the
Reſerues of it) once moove: onely the King commaunded
ſome troupes to goe and ayde <hi>Hebron</hi> once. Nor did the
Count of <hi>Thurne</hi> ſtirre. Nor was the further end of <hi>Banniers</hi>
people medled withall; els the whole Armie was in action.</p>

more, the older Souldiers; and their Armie by themſelues
accounted Invincible. Nay, one diſadvantage the King had,
as great as poſſibly almoſt could be; which was, in ſight,
not onely a wonderfull encouragement to the enemy, but a
moſt mayne weakning of the one halfe of his Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and an evident diſheartning to the reſt: for ſeeing tis the
Eye that is firſt overcome in any battell, if the ſight of the
<hi>Saxons</hi> defeate would haue diſcouraged the <hi>Swedens;</hi> that
had given a ſore onſet to the victory. So that all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

The whole fault, he layd vpon the <hi>Crabats</hi> &amp; <hi>Imperiall</hi> horſe:
who after a few hard charges, cowardly ranne away, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that the Bullets had not peirced the fleſh, but made bruiſes

of the Barbers words. Very loath I am to leaue ſo baſe an
imputation vpon ſo honourable a Commaunder; as to
owe his life, all this while, vnto a deviliſh inchantment:
which is practiſed by none, but the reprobate raskalitie
of the Armie; ſuch as the meaneſt common Souldier
that reſpects his credite, but will ſcorne to keepe company

THANKES-GIVING
FOR THE VICTORY,
Appoynted in the Electorate

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat worke is well gone
thorough, which is begunne
with <hi>Prayer,</hi> and concluded
with <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> and ſo
is this <hi>Swediſh Diſcipline:</hi>
which even herin reſembles
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of this Princes actions.
This glorious Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo admirably thus atchieved; if not beyond the
hopes of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> yet ſurely cleane beſides the
feares or doubts of the <hi>Catholikes:</hi> who beſides the
confidence they had in their owne Forces, which
they eſteemed <hi>Invincible;</hi> had a <hi>Generall</hi> withall,
who amongſt the three Boaſts he was wont to make,
had this for one; <hi>That he never loſt Battayle.</hi> But now
hath he loſt both <hi>Game</hi> and <hi>Lurch</hi> too. Now hath he
loſt ſuch a Battell, as <hi>Leipſich</hi> hath fully made amends
for <hi>Prague; Saxony</hi> for <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And yet ſo farre
were our <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Warriours from aſcribing this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18676:73"/>
vnto their own ſtrength or ſwords; that they decreed
to haue the Thankes for all, publikely returned vnto
that <hi>Lord of Hoaſts;</hi> whom the King in anſwere to his
former Prayers, had now found ſo <hi>mightie in Battell.</hi>
No ſooner therefore were the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Conquerours
come together againe from purſuing of the fleeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
but they were ſummoned to a <hi>Bid-day,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
throughout all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Dominions, for a
publicke and ſolemne Thankeſgiving vnto GOD,
for this ſo glorious a Victory. And that the Forme
of it might not be left to every new-fangled inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that the <hi>Devotion</hi> might be <hi>doubled</hi> by the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformitie:</hi>
the Miniſters had this Forme of Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
preſcribed vnto them, to be in all their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
rehearſed out of the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>O Lord God, all-puiſſant and invincible; wee
here giue thankes vnto thee, for that by thine
<hi>Annoynted,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of <hi>Saxony;</hi> thou haſt wrought ſo great ſalvation
for thy people, and theſe Provinces: becauſe thy
mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>Thou O Lord God of <hi>Sabbaoth,</hi> foughteſt for thy
people: 'tis thou that deliveredſt vs from our cruell
enemies: becauſe thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>The enemy had threatned vs, that he would ruine
and lay waſte all our Countrey with fire; maſſacre
all the men with the ſword; and leade our yong men
and maydens into Captivitie. But thou, O God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
haſt with-held them; thou haſt put them
vnto flight; thou haſt defeated them with thine owne
Army: becauſe thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:18676:73"/>
Thou, Lord, haſt revenged thy people, becauſe
thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>From the very bottome of our hearts doe we giue
thee thankes, O Lord, we tell forth all thy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
workes: in thee doe we rejoyce, and prayſe thy
Name, O thou moſt High, for that thou haſt thus
repulſed our enemies. They are falne and periſhed in
thy ſight: thou, Lord, haſt pleaded our cauſe, and
thou haſt executed the Iudgement; that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
manifeſt thy ſelfe to be a juſt Iudge: becauſe thy
mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>Thou remembredſt vs, O faithfull God, that wee
were ſorely oppreſſed: becauſe thy mercy endureth
for ever.</p>
               <p>The waters had gone over our ſoules, but thou O
Lord God, gaveſt vs not over for a prey vnto the
teeth of the enemy: becauſe thy mercy endureth for
ever.</p>
               <p>Our ſoule is eſcaped, like a bird out of the ſnare
of the fowler; the ſnare is broken, and we are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
becauſe thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, wee here invoke, and from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bottome of our hearts we beſeech thee, O moſt
mercifull God; that with thy temporall and eternall
bleſſing thou wouldeſt reward, that faithfull agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo duely performed betweene his Majeſtie
the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Elector our Gracious
Lord: be preſent in time to come with them, and with
their Armyes: let thy right hand potently aſſiſt them:
grant a long life vnto them both, that their yeares
may endure for ever; that ſo they may ſit vpon the
Throne for ever together before thee: affoord thy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18676:74"/>
goodneſſe and faithfulneſſe vnto them, which may
preſerue them.</p>
               <p>Heape victories vpon them, O mercifull God;
and rowſe and lift vp thy ſelfe againſt the fury of our
enemies: refraine thou their malice; cauſe them to
fall into the pit which they haue digged for vs.</p>
               <p>Be mindfull of our bloud, O Lord; throw downe
the wicked headlong into hell; ſuffer not men to
haue the dominion over vs: manifeſt thy wonderfull
goodneſſe, O thou preſerver of them that truſt in
thee, againſt thoſe that are enemies vnto thy right
hand. Keepe vs as the apple of thine eye: protect vs
vnder the ſhadow of thy wings: even againſt the
wicked that deſtroy vs, againſt our enemies that on
every ſide lye in waite for vs. Ariſe, O Lord, and
ſcatter them yet more and more; deliver our liues
from the wicked, which is a ſword of thine. Turne,
moreover, our enemies vnto flight; ſcatter them like
the duſt, &amp; put them away like the clay in the ſtreets.
Remember, Lord, that the Enemies (the <hi>Pope</hi> and
his followers) doe reproach thee; and that the fooliſh
people ſpeake ill of thy Name.</p>
               <p>Revenge now thine owne honour, O Lord; why
ſhould thine and our enemies ſay, Where is now
their God? Ariſe vp, Lord, and overturne the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
Papacie:</hi> and maintaine, on the other ſide,
thine owne Word, which is the very joy of our
hearts. We verily, O Lord of <hi>Sabbaoth,</hi> are called
after thy Name; thou knoweſt that for thee alone
wee ſuffer perſecution. Deliver vs therefore out of
the hand of the wicked; and free vs from the power
of Tyrants: and the more they oppoſe vs, the vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18676:74"/>
let their vndertakings be. Be with vs, and ſtay
ſtill with vs; that thou mayſt helpe vs and deliver vs.
Bleſſe, O God of peace, this thy people: and grant
thy peace eſpecially, vnto this whole Electorate of
<hi>Saxony;</hi> thou haſt promiſed, O God, that thou wilt
giue peace vnto thy people. Let righteouſneſſe and
peace kiſſe each other. Grant vs a good peace: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
thoughts of peace vpon vs: procure thou and
preſerue a ſweet peace within our gates.</p>
               <p>And we on the other ſide will giue due thankes
vnto thee for the ſame: we will laud and prayſe thee
for it: in this world for a time, and in the next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all eternitie. Even thee, we ſay, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
and reigneſt one, true, highly to
be prayſed, and bleſſed GOD,
from this time forth and
for evermore, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Amen.</hi>
