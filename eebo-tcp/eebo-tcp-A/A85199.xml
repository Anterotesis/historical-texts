            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>AMongſt th' traine of Friends (good Sir) I bring</l>
               <l>Religious Anthems, but want breath to ſing.</l>
               <l>Infuſe my Muſe with ſome religious fire</l>
               <l>Of Thine, that I may blaze, and then expire.</l>
               <l>But rather doth it ſeem to blaze in wet,</l>
               <l>Then with an ardent heat, for <hi>Oldſworth</hi>'s ſet.</l>
               <l>Then who can hope to build for him a ſhrine,</l>
               <l>Or ſpeak him dead in Verſe? but in the Criſtalline</l>
               <l>Of every eye he is intomb'd, each teare</l>
               <l>Like ſtaved torches wait upon his bier.</l>
               <l>Then, what need I attend thy Reverend hearſe</l>
               <l>With <hi>Elegies,</hi> when eyes drop balme and verſe?</l>
               <l>But leaſt the heat of griefe be drown'd in wet,</l>

               <l>Then buſie grief, let's paſſe upon Parole</l>

               <l>What though his worth hath built his worth a Shrine?</l>
               <l>His worthineſſe may be interr'd in mine.</l>
               <l>Who knows not? but day nights a tapers light,</l>

               <l>Or <hi>Oldſworth</hi> lines, to ſhew he was divine,</l>
               <l>Let a skill'd Lapidary ope the tombe</l>

               <l>In golden quarryes, as if from thence rac'd.</l>
               <l>How can the world truly pen thee divine,</l>
               <l>When thy bright beames to us through crannies ſhine,</l>
               <l>As if thy graces could compriſed bee,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I love the Limner which can draw the man,</l>

               <l>Some of thy worth, ſweet Soul, let me impart,</l>

               <l>Selected Gemms all thy ſet graces were,</l>
               <l>Of grace and goodneſſe. O forbear, forbear.</l>
               <l>To promulgate! impiety 'twould be:</l>
               <l>That thou ſhouldſt dye, and none ask what was he?</l>
               <l>What tongue can anſwer give for ſuch a loſſe?</l>
               <l>But words would loſe themſelves in their own choyce.</l>
               <l>Wert thou a man morally good, or ſo,</l>
               <l>No other Elegy, but thy duſt ſhould ſhow:</l>
               <l>But every ſoul that knew thy gifts can tell,</l>
               <l>Channells muſt change, and the vaſt center reele</l>
               <l>Of every ſoul, where can they fixed be,</l>
               <l>Since doctrine and the Doctour both agree</l>
               <l>(I fear) to leave us. Oh may you here be found</l>
               <l>In every pulpit! though y'are under ground.</l>
               <l>And there my Fancy ſpies him, while I ſee</l>
               <l>Him drawn an Angel to Eternitie.</l>
               <l>How grave? How ſweet? How Roſe-like was each look</l>
               <l>Of his? as if his Saviour in his book</l>
               <l>H'ad met with face to face, and not by faith,</l>
               <l>The promiſe promiſ'd glorified he hath.</l>
               <l>Still more reviving life ſprang in each cheeke,</l>
               <l>Whilſt nearer to his text through's prayer he would breake,</l>
               <l>And when concluded his, he would rejoyce,</l>
               <l>And ſound his makers praiſe with cheerfull voice</l>
               <l>In Chriſts own prayer: that done, he would begin</l>
               <l>Again to chime his lips, not heard but ſeene,</l>
               <l>Then taking up his bible by the ſtrings,</l>
               <l>Hee'd turne the leaves as if hee'd ſpread Chriſts wings:</l>
               <l>Under which he, and thoſe that did beleive,</l>
               <l>The comforts there contained might receive</l>
               <l>A <hi>Paul,</hi> A <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> three,</l>
               <l>Zealouſly one, and ſo divine was hee.</l>
               <l>Emphatically would be preſſe a point,</l>
               <l>As if his ſenſes mov'd were out of joynt,</l>
               <l>Which in his hearers ſuch impreſſe did take,</l>
               <l>As if all ſenſes did their place forſake,</l>
               <l>And center in the eye. There every eare</l>
               <l>Was turn'd into the ſight, whilſt looks did heare.</l>
               <l>His lips had kiſſ'd the God of Love, for jarres</l>
               <l>Were ſweetly reconcil'd, though with his tears.</l>
               <l>Oh pious ſoule! melodious are thoſe pleaſures,</l>
               <l>Which are conſtrain'd with unconſtrained meaſures.</l>
               <l>His birth took part with wit, each age grac'd hee,</l>
               <l>As if his cradle had been his library.</l>
               <l>The Church (when preſent hee) lackt not a head,</l>
               <l>The State confeſt that he in Court was bred.</l>
               <l>A Paſtor, Citizen, dwelt amongſt many,</l>
               <l>Yet of their factions favour'd he not any.</l>
               <l>Free in diſcourſe, morall, as well divine:</l>
               <l>Who knew thy worth? muſt know all worth was thine.</l>
               <l>Not like ſun-dyalls, when the Sun is gone,</l>
               <l>Can ſhow no more of day, 's if day were done:</l>
               <l>But like the Diall of the day, the Sun</l>
               <l>That poſts through this, or that Meridian.</l>
               <l>Each Climate to his <hi>Genius</hi> was as fit,</l>
               <l>As if he had the univerſall wit;</l>
               <l>That call'd him to the Court, where every one,</l>

               <l>In all the ſolitudes of the deceaſed King,</l>

               <l>That's done already, no ſooner born again,</l>
               <l>But of four Kingdoms was he crown'd a King.</l>
               <l>A lane, yee holy Guard! ſince he is gone,</l>

               <l>Why moves this Bell? what means this doleſome knell?</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Oldſworth</hi> is dead, then faces turn about.</l>
               <l>Who could be confident of this? but goes,</l>
