            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Kingdoms Sickneſs, and its Cure, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to any perſon that is concern'd in the welfare of his Country, that there are now very ill ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms in the countenance thereof; and not many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons there are, who can ſay, that their private affairs receive not a malignant influence from the ill Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis and indiſpoſition of the whole Body Politick: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to give an account of this its malady, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the means of its redreſs and ſuccour; wherein I ſhall play the part of a bold Phyſician to a deſperate and Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, neither will I handle the matter as if I were to deal with a nice and tender Lady, conſulting her eaſe, and the delight of her Palate, more than the benefit of a firm &amp; laſting health, and therefore rejects the nauſeous Potion offer'd for her Cure: But I ſhall preſcribe, (if occaſion) a Vomit, both ſtrong and bitter, that will cauſe not only cauſe averſion in the taking, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the operation may put all parts into ſome perturbation, for the more effectual ſupport and comfort of them all: I ſhall not ſavour my Lancet, nor the Saw it ſelf if I find it neceſſary: To come to my deſign; The ſickneſs of the Nation appears evidently by thoſe ſymptoms that are upon it, an Atrophy, liſtleſneſs to Action, Paleneſs and fearfulneſs; I mean three things the main Indications of its weakneſs. 1. Want of Mony and Trade, the nouriſhment of a Commonwealth. 2. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the former; People are of low ſpirits, like Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Ruine, they are without thoſe lively and vigorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they were wont to have when full of Money. 3. Fear and apprehenſion of danger from a Forreign Enemy; Theſe are the principal ſymptoms of which we complain at this day. The laſt of theſe I ſhall not need to ſay much to; For if the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64616:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Purſes and Stomacks of Engliſh-men be fraighted with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cargo, it will have ſuch influence upon their Courage, as to make them reſolute, and bold enough in oppoſing any Forreign undertakings againſt them, It being an improvement of their natural Genius, it will rather puſh them upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive part; This our Neighbour Nations are aware of; A French-man having obſerved, that <hi>England</hi> is like a great Beaſt, that can no otherwiſe be killed, but by being it ſelf acceſſary and aſſiſtant to its own Ruine, or intangling it ſelf in the ſnare may be laid for it: Let us then endeavour to keep it alive, by applying good nouriſhment, by correcting the Humours, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Blood; and when it is healthfully ſettled upon a good Baſis, freed from malignant humours, we may venture it to ſhift in all other encounters and hazards. Our buſineſs then is, to help in the two firſt particulars, For by them alone the laſt is made ſecure: There have been many attempts made of late for the Redreſs of the Former eſpecially; but by dealing too lightly, fearing to ſearch to the bottom, they do but make things worſe, and to ſtop one hole make three; Prohibiting Iriſh Cattle, French Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I like not thoſe Phyſicians that apply themſelves to remove two or three particular ſymptoms, and leave the ſourſe and Cauſe of the Diſeaſe untouch'd; I ſhall therefore enquire into the very Springs and Original of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and endeavour to ſhew, that without a deeper ſearch and ſtronger application, no good is to be expected.</p>
            <p>The Tinker will tell us, that 'tis in vain to beſtow mending upon that Kettle whoſe bottom is grown thin with age and much uſe; and certainly there is ſomthing of the ſame nature in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Commonwealths, which in continuance of time, will require not emendation and alteration by parcels of new Laws, ſome whereof are made at one time, ſome another; ſome in one Century, ſome in many after; till at length they are multipli'd to ſuch a number that they becom to the Government like Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to a Tinkers Kettle; which after it will be patcht no longer,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64616:3"/>
fine, muſt have a new bottom; ſo alſo the Government muſt have a Reſtoration which is no longer capable of alteration and amendment in that part thereof which is weak and ill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The reaſon whereof may be caſt upon the prevailing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Time, which ſubjects all things to its Dominions, and nothing can be ſecure from its over-turning Influence; the ſtrongeſt Forts and Caſtles are batter'd down by it; Cities are metamorphos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d into a Cottage, and a Wilderneſs into a City; it removes Commerce, and Traffick, and Civility from one Country to another, and makes an Unwonted Village a well traded Port, and a Barbarous and Savage People nice and ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; And farther it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This alteration of mens inclinations and humours effected in proceſs of time, is the reaſon, that, though the Form and Manner of Government may continue perfectly and entirely the ſame, yet there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Parts and Members thereof, which re-iterated Laws and emendations cannot preſerve from being the disſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now as all Laws
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64616:4"/>
and Government deſigns the benefit of the People governed, that there be a Harmony and Agreement in all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo do they diligently avoid all things that may avert this harmony, and expel what is doſſonant thereto, and cauſes that diſagreement and uneaſineſs which fills mens minds to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their ſettlement, their amity, and conſequently their Traffick one with another; Nay, though the Laws eſtabliſht by antiquity are ſtill in Force for the preſervation and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch Government, yet they muſt be abrogated or changed according to the preſent Genius, Manners and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Men; for Laws are Arbitrary, and in circumſtantial things may be brought to our Manners; whereas our Members have ſomthing of natural neceſsity in them, and cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice and violence be brought to the Laws; I mean ſuch things as are free and in our choice, not ſuch as are of eternal neceſſity to be done or omitted; and likewiſe I mean the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſuch Laws as dis-agreeing with our preſent Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will bring no dammage in other reſpects to the Publick. Now in this caſe, in my apprehenſion it is a Soliciſme in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that Government being deſigned chiefly for the benefit of thoſe that live under it, yet that the Laws ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and agree with the inclinations of the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of another worn off and gone: And this ſeems to be the right of a prevailing temper, as of a Conquerour that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains anothers Country, not to be engaged to the former Laws he finds there, but to give them from himſelf. Thus when it was in faſhion, and the humour prevailed of making Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great, and rich, and honourable, Laws were directed and promulgated to this purpoſe: If the faſhion come again to contemn and ſlight them, and bring them down, the Laws ought to favour us in it, and not to ſuffer a diſcording note, to prejudice the harmony whereon the publick eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſettlement is founded. Having ſeen that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick dis-ſatisfaction may give occaſion to change ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of the Government; we muſt enquire how it may be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64616:4"/>
manifeſt, what muſt be done for the relief of it, and that we miſtake not the minds and deſires of people thus unſatisfyed; In a word, this may be known by the general reſentments of the moſt, or wiſeſt, or ſobereſt of the people; If theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree in one vote as it were, either tacitly or expreſsly, by plain teſtimony, or ſuch ſigns as are equivalent thereto, of a dislike of a Conſtitution in the Government, that is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part thereof, which ſerves to irritate them, and is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of oppreſsion, if it be proteſted againſt, and forſaken by moſt, contemned by others, and ſlighted by all, it may be ſaid to be the diſcording Note, and hurtful to the harmony of the publick repoſe and conſent. But perhaps this will not be a ſufficient Plea for its expulſion unleſs other things concur; In the mean time thus much we have got through the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mens inclinations, Laws muſt be remitted, and perhaps ſome leſs eſſential part of Government changed, or elſe there will be an unſatisfyedneſs and diſcraſy amongſt the People; or thus in time mens Inclinations are changed, and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government that are oppoſite thereto muſt be altered. If we look for examples of this, we may find in all Hiſtories infinite thereof; Thus the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſick and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for a King, and no means to ſatisfie them but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging this humour: This alſo may be obſerved in the Roman Government, and alſo in the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi>; in our age we may obſerve the like; <hi>France</hi> will allow no priviledge to the Pope-in-Secular Affairs and Revenues of the Clergy in that Dominion, though they ſtill own his Authority. The <hi>Netherlands</hi> could not ſwallow the Inquiſition, and <hi>Venice</hi> ſoon grew ſick of the ſubtile practiſes of the Jeſuites. Many might be heaped to this purpoſe. And thus much may ſerve for Apology, if we find that the ſtate of things do require ſome change in a leſs material part of Government, that it is no new thing, but ſuch as time does in every age produce.</p>
            <p>To proceed then, It may be demanded whether there be any ſuch thing amongſt us, That this unſatisfyed humour is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64616:5"/>
with us, may be known from converſe and ſociety of Men, and their mouths are filled with complaints of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the times, wiſhing for, and expecting ſome change of affairs that may give them ſome ſettlement and peace: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may be known whom it aims at, and what this burden is by the open proteſtation of the greateſt part of the Nation, by the careleſs and remiſs carriage of others, and by open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and deriſion of many, which is the preſent Eccleſiaſtical Government; This all the different ſorts and Opinions do proteſt againſt; This wiſe Men and Polititians do barely ſuffer and allow as far as their Intereſt is concernd with it, without any zeal for its continuance. The third are, the Wits and Atheiſts of the age who contemn and deride it: As that we may ſafely conclude it is the publick nuiſance and diſguſt of the Nation: and as an ill humour that is at enmity with the reſt of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in a body natural, is the occaſion of a perturbation, and that its actions are performed with leſs life and freedom than they were wont. So likewiſe this dis-agreeing part in the body Politick from the other parts, may be ſaid to be occaſion of its lowneſs of courage, and unwillingneſs to act in the matters which concern its welfare, as Trade, and the like. But if we look into the concerns of Trade, the life of our nation, and of the Body Politick, and to the Nation more attentively, we ſhall find that our condition is ſuch, that we are near loſt, unleſs we ſhall make this one part a Sacrifice to the preſervation of the whole; and we are not now ſo low in our own eſteem, or the eſteem of Forreigners, but by means thereof we may raiſe up our heads that lie in the duſt, and not only obtain a firm and laſting conſtitution of Health and Integrity, in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our wealth at home, but we may be enabled to make our ſelves great enough to offer ſome attempts abroad, to ſerve our ſelves our ſelves of the ſpoils of other Nations, and take our ſhare in the Ruines of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and once again retrieve our ſullied glories, and re-aſſume the Palms that were wont to be the Merits of our victorious Armies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64616:5"/>It being then thus with us, that moſt men complain of the badneſs of the times; The Labourer has no work, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man hath no price for his Corn whereby to pay his Rent; the Grazier gets little for his Wool, Cloth lies upon the hands of the Clothier, ſtrangers run away with our Fiſhing-trade, for want of Mony or willingneſs in our own Nation to encourage it at home; The power of <hi>France</hi> grows formidable, and Mony muſt be had to put us in a poſture of Defence; when yet the people are ſo dreined already, that they are ſcarce able to pay more. If we come to conſider the original of theſe evils, it can be no other then that our Money is taken away by the late Taxes; for Trade is then moſt full and redundant, and with it all things elſe, when Mony is equally (that is in moderate por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuitable to every mans condition) diſtributed throughout the whole Nation; when each particular man has ſufficient for his neceſſity, and the condition of his life and calling: for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being thus generally diſtributed, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

LONDON, eſpecially in the concerns thereof; ſo that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe things together, we may wonder we are not much lower and weaker than we ſeem to be at this time: Well may Landlords complain of the fall of Rents, and have their Lands thrown into their own hands, when by their own Acts they have taken away the means of Traffick, and thoſe materials that Men muſt work upon for their ſupport: For as in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body there is required nouriſhment to keep it in life and conſiſtency; and alſo this nouriſhment muſt have a Vehicle, which is the Blood, whereby it may be conveyed to all parts of the Body; Now if you take away this too often, and in too great quantities, no wonder if at laſt the Body grow weak, and unable to perform what otherwiſe might be required of it: When the Blood is perfectly diſtributed through all the parts, and permitted to take its free and natural Circulation; So it is in a Body Politick, Trade is its nouriſhment, maintains its life, and keeps it in heart, gives it a healthful Conſtitution, and preſerves it from ſinking by any weakneſs within, and enables it alſo to repel external violence; The Vehicle to convey this nouriſhment to all the parts for their relief, is Mony, the very Blood of the Body Politick, of which, the more we take from this Body, the nearer we do bring it to a Conſumption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to ſuſtain it ſelf. Farther, we muſt not imagine that the burden is made lighter when divided amongſt ſo many Intereſts, which as to privat concerns perhaps is not ſo much perceived at preſent, but as to the concerns of Trade, the whole Nation is but as one Man, and ſo much as you take there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>from, ſo much you take from Trade and the livelihood of the Nation; which in time will return with more weight upon particulars, as we find by experience in Rents, Wool, &amp;c. This being the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nation dreyned to this faintneſs and weakneſs as at this day, and ſtill there is occaſions for more Mony, and thoſe no light ones neither, ſuch as to put us in a poſture of Defence in caſe of any attempt from a Forreign Enemy, which our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances leave us not without cauſe to apprehend, alſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64616:6"/>
to take off the burden that lies upon the Kings Revenue; and further, if we can, to recover thoſe eruptions and devaſtations made upon our Trade and Livelihood, to ſet us upon our legs, that we may ſhew ſomthing of antient valour in times of ſuch action and enterprizes as are now on foot; But how ſhall this be done? to take more blood from the Publick, is to bring us down beyond hopes of Becovery, after ſo many plentiful evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. But ſome courſe muſt be taken, and which way ſhall we turn? ſhall we exenterate our own bowels, and ſacrifice our Lives and Livelihoods for our Liberties? ſhall we deſtroy our ſelves, that we may ſave our ſelves; and give away the ſupport of our lives for the defence of them; or to what purpoſe is it to defend them from outward violence, when they muſt thus ſink from within, though they ſhould be ſecured from without? Is it not better we caſt about, and ſee if there be not ſome other means of Relief? Can we not find an Ulcerated part in this Body, which being lopt off, that nouriſhment which it too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently draws to it ſelf, may by its ſeparation be diſtributed through the whole Maſs, for the ſupport of its weakneſs and indiſpoſition; To be ſhort, there cannot be any better means or other method to compleat our hapineſs, and to make amends for all our evils, than to take away the Lands of laizy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Clergy-men; there ſeems to be a fatal neceſſity upon us to do it, they being not only uſeleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Another part for the Improvement of Trade by Land, there may ſmall Stocks be derived into all parts of the Kingdom to ſet the poor on work; Likewiſe in divers parts that Work houſes may be built for the Improvement of our Manufactures in the manner of Hoſpitals, wherein the lame and blind, and all ſorts may have ſome imployment whereby to get their own livelihood; and alſo others may make ſome advantages by their labours. Likewiſe other Houſes may be built for the Benefit and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Mineral Trade, whither may be ſent to works of Induſtry, ſuch whom we now too ſeverely deliver to death upon ſmall offences; All theſe Methods will not diminiſh the revenue, but increaſe it; For if well managed, it will return into their hands again perhaps double; As ſuppoſe Ffty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound a year be allowed, and well managed in theſe uſes, this Mony lies not dead, as in Hoſpitals or ſuch Foundations, but will perhaps return Fourſcore thouſand pound again, or more, for the benefit of the publick, and yet the Nation is advantaged as much as that Fifty thouſand pounds comes to, and perhaps more than if it were given without any return: So that beſides the Commodities of our Country well improv'd,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64616:7"/>
and every man has work and dealings enough; there will be an ample foundation for Banks of Piety, for encouragements to advance Trade, as to ſend Men into Forrein Countreys up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Publick Charges, for the advancement of Trade; to learn skill in Manufactures, to improve Commerce; alſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sallaries and Rewards for ſuch as have deſerved well of the Commonwealth by uſeful Inventions, Fighting for its Defence <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence alſo Allowance may be given to decayed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſuch whoſe Eſtates are incumbred by Debts; and more by Intereſt may hence be relieved: Out of this the neceſſities of the KING may often be ſupply'd without burden to His Subjects; and it will be as an eternal Cement to unite the hearts of the King and his Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now it being ſo, that Epiſcopal Govrnment expelled, ſuch Bleſſings follow as are like the Glories of the Morning Sun to Midnight darkneſs; Is it not to be wiſhed, that the King and Parliament having laid ſuch continued burdens upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, would conſult their own Honour and Reputation, and tranſmit their Names and Memory to Poſterity with ſome ſweet odours of Praiſe and Bleſſing; that they would once in ſo many Eſſays do ſomthing which may prove the Univerſal Benefit of the Civil State, and of Religion, which may make their Fame Glorious and Renowned to the preſent and future Generations, and may bring a bleſſing from Heaven to proſper and eſtabliſh all other their undertakings. What though our Anceſtors eys were blinded to give the beſt of the Kingdom to Clergy-men, and to confirm them by Laws; Yet ſince our eyes are open, to diſcover the Cheats and folly thereof, we ſhould commit a greater folly than they, if we in ſo great neceſſity ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to enjoy what was ſo exorbitantly given, or rather what was gotten by Fraud and Collvſion; Have not we the ſame power to nullify Laws made againſt the Common good, as they had to eſtabliſh the ſame; And have we not yet more Reaſon, ſince they granted them through Colluſion and deceit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every day diſcovers to us, that there is no ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now though it were enough to ſay, that the Supreme Law did require this, even the ſafety of the Kingdom being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it; There being a neceſſity that all Government be directed according to the courſe and exigency of the preſent circumſtances and conditions in which they live to whom the mannagement of affairs is committed, or elſe it loſeth its end, and is not eſtabliſhed for the preſervation of the Subject, his peace and ſettlement, but by a kind of Solaeciſm in Politicks, for the preſervation of that which is no more, even a worn off generation gone to their Fathers. Yet I ſhall add farther, that

there ir Right and Equity enough in the thing; For 1ſt. They obtained their Lands by Colluſion and Fraud. <hi>2ly.</hi> They mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſo as to be the Inſtruments of oppreſſion and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to all Mankind, and to this Commonwealth in particular; which is Treaſon enough in a ſound ſenſe, if not directly, yet interpretatively: As for the Imputation of Sacriledge we ſhall ſee more hereafter. But the Colluſion and deceit will appear plainly, if we conſider, that theſe Lands and Priviledges were granted in ſuch an age and time of Darkneſs, when nothing of the Scripture, or of the Truth was known, and leſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion practiſed; Men pretended then a great deal of Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64616:9"/>
invention of Purgatory, whereby they would make up their Markets; For their Prayers were of no Force to deliver Men from thence, unleſs they were well paid in hand before they begun to work: Alſo Confeſſion, and Extreme Unction were none of their meaneſt Engines to cheat the world; For by virtue of theſe being near the Beds of departing Souls, they made ſucceſsful uſe of the opportunity, either to Forge Wills and Donations, or elſe by aggravating their ſins, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purgatory, get from them what men in deſpair, (and no more capable of enjoyments in this world, and therefore prone enough to throw them away, (eſpecially where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared hopes of a return in another) were willing to part with. Add to this, that having locked up the pure Truth in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known language, and few Bibles alſo to be got by reaſon of the unlearnedneſs of the age; All their Devotions they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in Rituals and Roſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All their Religion was external Pomp, Ceremony and Magnificence, puzled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated with a thouſand inventions and devices, that had no relation to it, otherwiſe than to deſtroy it from the Earth: Now by theſe means they had got the Keys into their hands; But what Keys? even thoſe of the bottomleſs Pit, to ſink men in Perdition. But thus it was, and by theſe evil arts they had made themſelvs the oracles of the age, through whoſe mouth all Religion and Devotion muſt proceed; They call'd themſelves the Church, all their Conſtitutions &amp; Injunctions muſt now be irrefragable, and they muſt needs pretend to be Infallible, ſince they ſaw all matters of Religion depending upon them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſeen or known but what was their pleaſure to apoint and declare: And who could convince them of Errour in the midſt of darkneſs? when all light of the Goſpel, and of Truth it ſelf ſeemed to be extinguiſhed? Thus have they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown that pure and undefiled Religion, denying the Lord that bought them, and betraying him with Judas into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Enemies; But he riſeth again to take vengeance of his Oppreſſors. But theſe things conſider'd, it is no wonder
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64616:9"/>
that our Anceſtors could not ſee through this miſt and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of errour, thicker than that of Aegypt, which had by this time overſpread the face of the whole earth. But partly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a generation of Deceivers, for the true Church, thought it Honourable to conferre what they could to its Greatneſs, partly through fear of Purgatory, and to deliver their Souls from that torment which they were taught to believe, partly to ſave their ſouls; For which purpoſe they were taught that theſe Donations were effectual, ſettled upon them their Lands, which were afterwards confirmed to them by Law upon the ſame account; For in Magna Charta there is expreſs mention made by the King of this end of his Grants, (viz.) the ſaving of his Soul: Now that they were deluded in theſe Donations, we need go no farther than the univerſal conſent of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who have ſhaken off the Papal Uſurpation, who have all declared againſt Praying for the Dead as inſignificant; and do acknowledge that all Donations given to the Clergy, could have no effect (as was pretended,) to ſave mens Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Add to this, there is no colour for it in Scripture, and was only then invented as a ſerviceable Engine to deceive men of their Eſtates, and thereby to Benefit and Inrich that Idolatrous Church: Which being conſider'd, that theſe Conditions on which they obtained their Lands were propoſed <hi>dolo malo,</hi> and farther, that they are not kept according to the will of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offor; Thoſe Cuſtoms being now aboliſhed of Praying for Souls, upon which account they held many conſiderable Lands; Whether the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge</hi> or other Laws will extend to redeem thoſe Lands, I leave to the learned in the Law to judge. If it be alledged, that theſe Lands, and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges have been confirmed to them all along under Proteſtant Princes; and that the King takes an Oath at his Coronation to defend them: It may be anſwer'd, that ſuch uſe and benefit of thoſe Lands may be permitted them by thoſe who were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors thereof; Not that the right of the Succeſſor ſhould be prejudic'd thereby: Or perhaps they underſtood not ſo fully
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64616:10"/>
their condition in reſpect to that Right, and therefore more juſtly accrues to us as the diſcoverers; or elſe they had not the ſame neceſſity to re-aſſume it: For our condition is ſuch, by Divine Providence appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is no other mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to ſave us from Ruine. I ſhall here add ſomthing much to this purpoſe out of <hi>Grotius; Si Lex fundetur in praeſumptione aliqua facti, quod factum revera ita ſe non habeat tunc ea Lex non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liget. Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Demens eſt qui fidem praeſtat Errori; Grotius</hi> alſo brings the opinion of <hi>Bodinus</hi> much to our purpoſe. <hi>Bodinus cenſet iiſdem ex cauſis Regem ſive aliena fraude &amp; dolo, ſive er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore circumventum, ſive metu reſtitui poſſe.</hi> In another place the ſame <hi>Grotius, Sed hoc quoque ſciendum eſt poſſe ſubditis jus etiam quaeſitum auferri per Regem duplici modo, aut in Poenam, aut ex vi ſuper-eminentis Dominii; Sed ut id fiat ex vi ſuper emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentis Dominii primum requiritur utilitas publica.</hi> Again, <hi>Illud quoque à multis traditum beneficia principum quae liberaliter ſunt conceſsa ſemper poſſe revocari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the Kings Oath, I ſhall only propoſe the words of the ſame <hi>Grotius, Ut valeat Juramentum oportet ut ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatio ſit licita; Quare nullas vires habebit jurata promiſsio de re illicita aut naturaliter, aut Divina interdictione, aut etiam humana,</hi> If this be not ſufficient, he adds farther, <hi>Imo etiamſi res quae promittitur non ſit illicita, ſed majus bonum morale impediens, ſic quoque non valebit Juramentum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Imputation of Sacriledge, we have thus much to ſay. 1. That the word has a very large ſignification, and it is hard to be punctually decided what is Sacriledge, and what not; But 2. Of this we are certain, that extreme neceſſity cannot be praeſcribed to by it; For we find <hi>David</hi> made uſe of the <hi>Shew-Bread</hi> in this caſe: And it is farther to be noted, that I have not directed that they ſhould be appropriate to any private uſe, but to be preſerved as a ſupport of the Commonwealth in all degrees where there may be neceſſity, and ſo to become the publick Endowment; For it is not to be applyed to the uſe of any particular Man, or Men, ſo as to be appropriated to them;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64616:10"/>
It being like <hi>Judas</hi>'s Mony, the price of a Saviour, with which the <hi>Jews</hi> bought the Potters Field to bury ſtrangers in, when it was returned by <hi>Judas</hi>: So theſe Lands alſo ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the benefit and relief of the Poor, the Stranger, and Neceſſitous, which may very well conſiſt with the method I have before mentioned.</p>
            <p>But farther, we may do well to conſider how they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves in the Fruition of theſe ample Priviledges they have been inveſted with: I ſhall not now trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a particular recitation of thoſe diſturbances and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations wherewith our Kings and Nobles, as well as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have ſuffered under Popiſh Biſhops; Nor yet the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of our late Biſhops of the Reformation; how they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Subjects, and overthrew all Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, to ſet up their own Power, and ſatisfie the luſt of tyrannous and abſolute Dominion, abuſing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Kings to this purpoſe, which things have been ſhewed already by others: It ſhall be ſufficient to obſerve, that when by the Reformation the Scriptues were opened, and put into every mans hands for their Direction, there were found very few whoſe minds were dis-engaged from the Superſtition of Popery, but manifeſted an inclination to embrace the Scripture in the true and native plainneſs of it, and to yield obedience to the ſincere practical Duties therein contained; And at that time it ſeemed to have an Influence upon the Clergy as well as others, who minding the calling the People off from Popery, or Confirming them in the Reformed Religion, or building them up in Faith and good Works, were not much ſollicitous of Dominion and Jurisdiction, but depended upon the Kings Grace, not only for any Authority to be exerciſed by them, but alſo for their very Lands and Revenues; And he that had ſo boldly ſpoiled Abbies and Monaſteries, bringing down proud and ſtately Fabricks to the duſt, and Confiſcating their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, could alſo upon the leaſt occaſion offer'd, or tending to oppoſe his Projects, have cauſed them to taſte of the ſame Lot
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64616:11"/>
with their Brethren; Theſe two things were concurring the Truth of Chriſt, and Fear of the Prince to whom they were ſubject, muſt needs make tolerable Biſhops, though it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they were good men notwithſtanding. But as it was in the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who of tollerable B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64616:11"/>
added ſtubborneſs and reſolution to the other; Theſe Cauſes of diſſention were kindling and ſomenting a long while, till the Biſhops at laſt ſo far abuſed the good nature of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſo far to the oppreſſion of the Truth, and the mantainers of it, and it was but the Name of a Puritan that muſt make a Man lyable to all the Inconveniences of a tyranical Court, to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended from his Office, and the Benefits of it; to have his Study and Houſe ranſack'd, forced to accuſe himſelf by an Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi>; and beſides waiting upon Vexatious and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Suits, without liberty of Pleading or anſwering to any thing that was objected againſt him: He muſt thus ſpend his Time and his Eſtate to the Ruine of Himſelf and his Family. Theſe and other things became ſo general a burden, that there was no redreſs but by taking up Arms againſt thoſe unjuſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of their Liberty, whoſe original Greatneſs being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht by Deceit and Falſhood, their Authority a Uſurpation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Government, though it had been Legal, yet ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably abuſed, to the diſturbance of the Peace and Liberty of the Subject; It were not in the Kings power, though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy'd him to their Party; nor was it juſt and right in him to defend or abett them, much leſs to eſteem what was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, to be done againſt Himſelf, His Royal Crown, or Sacred Authority; He is to be the Miniſter of Juſtice, and this muſt be adherd to, though with the loſs of whatſoever is moſt dear to him; Tis He acts againſt his own Life &amp; Crown, He betrays his Scepter and Authority, and is guilty of Treaſon againſt himſelf, when he takes part with the unrighteous, with cruel and blood-thirſty men, to diſturb the Peace of his true and Loyal Subjects; to ſpoil them of their Lives and Fortunes, and leave the Children of Innocent Men to the extremity of Sorrow and Diſtreſs: Thus were we at length engaged in a Civil War, and by a ſoul and reproachful Diſaſter contrary to the deſires and wiſhes of the Nation: The Hand of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was imbrued in the Blood of his King; and ſhall we think theſe Men Innocent in all this? Then may it be ſaid that he

who ſhall all manner of ways exagitate his enemie, and leave no part of malice unattempted to haſten the deſtruction of him, who hath no other quarrel to his Perſecutor, but the deſire of his amendment; if he ſhall drive him to the utmoſt and laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, ſo that he knows not which way to turn, and finds no poſſible means of Recovery and ſafety, but by diſarming his Perſecutor, and captivating that Power that was ſo unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn out againſt him: This Perſon thus diſarmed, may then complain he is abuſed and ſet upon, his Life and Fortune aſſaulted upon no ground or reaſon, he is Innocent, and only guilty (if that be guilt) of endeavouring to bring his Enemy to a right mind; that is, to be his Vaſſal, that he may ſet his foot upon the neck of his Enemy, and make him know, that HE alſo is a God that ruleth in the Earth: The ſame imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Spirit ſeems to continue ſtill with us, and has not been without its Eſsays of diſturbing that Peace and repoſe which we at preſent enjoy; But their wings are cut, and their nails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pair'd, Men do generally do ſee into the cheat, and every day brings freſh diſcoveries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof; and it were ſtrange that now mens minds are ſo buſily imploy'd in the ſearch of Knowledge and Improvement of Scienſe to that degree, as to have arrived at ſuch attainments in one Century, as we do not find that former ages were at any time Maſters of. It were ſtrange I ſay in ſuch increaſe of knowledge, if we ſhould be ſtill blind in matters that concern Religion; That we ſhould not apprehend that all that Pomp and ſtatelineſs is vaniſhed, for the ſupport and mantaining whereof, the Clergy were Inveſted with ſuch great Poſſeſſions, and ample Priviledges. I have two things more eſpecially, which with ſome reaſon I may impute the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of them to the preſent Church-Government. 1. The preſent Atheiſm and Debauchery that the Age and Nation la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with, which though it may have its riſe from ſome other Cauſe, yet it receives at leaſt ſtrength &amp; Confirmation, partly from the empty Formality of the Clergy, who have apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no other Deſigns but their own gains, partly from the open

They<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may add with ſome ſhew of Reaſon; Perhaps we ſhould not hear one word from them of theſe things, did they not find the Trade gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the means to be great in this world, was to profeſs to deny it; They will go on, ſure theſe Men do but <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tell us Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Fancies, and maze in a wilderneſs of Tattle and empty ſounding words; For if there were any reality in the thing they propoſe, it would ſure have ſome effect upon themſelves, to moderate their Projects and Deſires. Such kind of Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe they may draw from a Religious-Government; ſtamped for true and Orthodox by Publick Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet thus betraying it ſelf to its own Condemnation: As for the Diſſenters, they will appear to theſe Men ſilly deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that know nothing.</p>
            <p>The 2. Thing is, the various Opinions and Phrenſies that have of late infeſted our Nation, may be thought to have their original from hence, next to the Craft and Subtilty of our grand Enemy; For Engliſh men (to ſpeak without flattery,) are generally lovers of Truth and Integrity, and ſomwhat ſtiff and rigid in thoſe Principles they adhere to, eſpecially if they imagine them agreeable to Truth and Honeſty; When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had embraced the Goſpel and the Reformation; and conceiving withal, it manifeſted an oppoſition to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government; To keep to the one, they grew into dislike of th'other, which took deeper root when this Government began

               </gap>hey do in this Caſe, the Government had thrown them off, and purſued them as Enemies to it; They were too rigid to quit thoſe Principles they had taken up with ſuch appearance of Truth; And the Government would not yield to ſuch whom they thought muſt receive and not give Laws, according to the pride of Uſurpation; So that they were forced to wander as Sheep without a Shepherd, or rather whoſe Shepherd was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful; Some took one way, ſome another, as their Fancy led them, to <hi>Munſter,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> or worſe, till at laſt all things came into Confuſion. Thus hath Eccleſiaſtical Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven birth to diſscentions, and Fuel to continual Animoſities, adminiſtred ſtrength and growth to Atheiſm &amp; Irreligion; By it Men have been ſtaved off from Unity, and peaceable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lives; Thereby they have been plunged in the depth of errour and diſtraction; have been driven to ſheath their Swords in the Bowels of their Brethren; And that no wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs might be left un-atchieved, the ſad effects of all this hath been yet depending upon, and a Conſequent to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the ſpilling the Blood of the Sacred perſon of their King; Theſe evils hang together as a Chain of many Links, whoſe firſt Link is the denying, not hearkning to, rejecting and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the word of God, and the light of the Goſpel; Bring in this, and the reſt follow as part of the Chain; But eſtabliſh the Truth of Chriſtian Religion, and you have therewith ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and peace, and a ſtrong defence againſt all theſe Evils. Now our Enquiry ſhall be concerning Religion, How it may be ſettled with Truth as to it ſelf, with Comfort to all people, and with ſecurity to the Nation. We ſhall therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a brief account of Religion, according to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent we have received. It muſt be known, Firſt then, that it is of another Nature than thoſe outward things we converſe with; That is, It is not of the World, nor according to the faſhion of the World; Neither doth it agree or aſsociate with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64616:13"/>
any thing that is external, but it is oppoſite and contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, even to all Forms of Worſhip of what kind ſoever; All Ceremonies &amp; Conſtitutions of Men be they of what kind they will, But much more to the enjoyments of the preſent Life, Riches, and Honours, and the like; To all deſigns of getting a Name, Dominion, Power, Eſtates, &amp;c. This manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears throughout the Scripture, eſpecially the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence this pure Doctrine is called a New Creation, Regeneration, New Birth, &amp;c. To ſhew that there is ſomthing old that muſt be ſhaken off, even the things of this world, which this is to ſucceed; For we cannot be ſaid to be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or Created again, unleſs that firſt Creation be made null and void, and brought to nothing, and this ſubſtituted in the room thereof: A man cannot Re-build his Houſe that has not firſt pulled down the old one. Hence our Lord makes it the firſt ſtep to come to him, to deny our ſelves, and take up our Croſs; That is, to caſt away all concern for the things of this Life, any deſire after them or ſatisfaction in them, and to be eſteemed nothing, of no account; yea Fools and Mad for his ſake: Hence alſo we may obſerve a perfect oppoſition in Scripture, between the Kingdom of Chriſt and of this World; thoſe things are called Spiritual, Heavenly, not Fading: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Contradiction to them, are <hi>Put</hi> Earthly, Carnal, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, <hi>&amp;c. Love</hi> not the <hi>World,</hi> nor the <hi>Things</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>; if any man <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> is not in him. Saith St. <hi>John,</hi> the Carnal man Savoureth not the things of God, they are Spiritually diſcerned; where we may obſerve that Contrariety which Logicians call <hi>Contradictoriè oppoſita</hi>: Our Saviour alſo very diligently ſeperats them; ye cannot ſerve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon,</hi> bidding us take no care <hi>What</hi> we ſhall <hi>Eat,</hi> or <hi>What</hi> we ſhall <hi>Drink,</hi> or <hi>What</hi> we ſhall <hi>Put on</hi>: But bids us in oppoſition to theſe things, ſeek <hi>Firſt</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> and its <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and all theſe things ſhall be added. I might be large in Collecting to this purpoſe, but let it ſuffice to obſerve: That we cannot imagine the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64616:14"/>
to be more expreſs then it is, ſuppoſing it had been in the Mind of the Law-giver to make us fully ſenſible of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety and Inconſiſtency of outward enjoyments, with the Purity of a Chriſtian life; and had he not deſigned to Caution us diligently in this reſpect, it were impoſſible there ſhould be found ſuch expreſſions in his Will revealed: But here it muſt be noted, that the oppoſition is not of that nature; as that he that hath the Bleſſings of Wealth or Honour muſt preſently throw them away, but he <hi>Muſt</hi> throw them out of his mind, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t his heart and affections be not ſet upon them, which may be obtained by earneſt Prayer, and doing ſome good to others with the Enjoyments we poſſeſs: We muſt note farther, that if there be a Divine Command for forſaking of them, as in <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Apoſtles, or what is Equivalent thereto, as ſuffering the Will of God in times of Perſecution; they muſt be actually forſaken and thrown away: Farther, we muſt note as to our preſent deſigne, that this oppoſition ſo far prevails, as that it will be hardly or not at all poſſible for us to partake of this Heavenly Life, and be true Diſciples of Chriſt, if we make it our deſigne and buſineſs to ſeek after and fill our ſelves with earthly enjoyments; if we uſe them to the oppreſſion of others, to an unjuſt Dominion over our Brethren, if they are made the chiefe thing in our aime, ſought with Care, Deceit, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Lying, Freeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we proſtitute all our Actions, and Conſcience it ſelf for an empty Tittle, and tranſient Revenue: And Generally (in the words of <hi>Solomon</hi>) he that maketh haſte to be Rich cannot be innocent. So that then this Contrariety between Fleſh and Spirit, between Religion and the World, is ſuch as they exclude each other: The man whoſe mind is taken up with Religion, values not the World, nor any thing therein; he wants them not, he deſires them not, he ſeeks them not: The man whoſe mind is taken up with the Affairs of the World, values not the things of Chriſt, they are fooliſhneſs unto him. Which thing alſo may be evinced by natural Light or Reaſon: For we ſee men that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64616:14"/>
are given to Vices, run on without Deliberation, or regard of any other thing, to that immenſe degree, after ſatisfaction in their Vices; as not only to conſume their Patrimony, though a Princely Revenue, but the Health of their Bodyes, and even the World it ſelf, to be ſatisfied in their deſires; thus the deſires of Drunkenneſs and Luſt, being infinite and never to be ſatisfied, but rather irritated by the fulneſs of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the deſires tending vehemently to the fruition, the fruition giving birth to new deſires: That if men were permitted to act in their full carier, and proſecute theſe Vices without reſtraint of Divine and Humane Laws, how ſoon would it run the World in Confuſion and Ruine, and yet not a ſtop put to theſe deſires, for they are Infinite. Thus the Covetous man deſires to gain more and more from others and incloſe to himſelf all things, till at length all things elſe (if his deſires be fulfilled) muſt periſh for want of ſubſiſtance: So the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will have all things ſubjected to himſelf, and if the whole world be his Vaſſallage; yet his deſires carry him ſtill to graſp more Power and Dominion, as is reported of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>: Thus we ſee Vice in its true nature, tends to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all things, and conſiſts in an inordinateneſs of the mind, whereby its deſires are infinite, and not to be ſatisfied: The mind having forſaken God, and ſet up it ſelf in its place, will thus have all things ſubſervient to it, and is carried forth infinitely to obtain this end: And this inordinate mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited deſiring and Luſting after that which it takes to, is that Corruption which was brought in by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which we call O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iginal Sin; which is no other then this inordinate mind forſaking God and luſting infinitely after its own fancies and devices. Now to help loſt man, and free him from this Slavery of an inordinate mind, was the buſineſs of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>; who came down from Heaven, took our Nature upon him in the form of a Servant, ſuffering upon the Croſs that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil, and eſtabliſh an ordinate regular mind in thoſe that believe in him:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64616:15"/>
That is the Divine Nature whereof he was partaker, by his taking our Nature, is communicated to all Men that believe, which reſcues them from this ſlavery of their inordinate mind, and by virtue of which they ſubdue all thoſe deſires which were introduced by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsion; where we muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that we ſaid Chriſt in the Divine Nature was united with our Nature; and that by virtue of this Union it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Men that believe, in oppoſition to <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion redounded to all by not believing, or diſobedience; in which it muſt be farther noted, That it being a Divine Nature united to Chriſtians by Faith, 1. It is no other than the third Perſon in the Trinity the holy Ghoſt, which proceedeth from the Father and the Son, becauſe he operates this work in us. Obſerve <hi>2dly.</hi> That we cannot do any good work of our ſelves, for our Regeneration and new Life, is this Union of the Divine Nature, the holy Spirit in our hearts, our good actions coming from the Principle of Life, muſt alſo be from him who is that life. Now we may ſee clearly what our Saviour ſays, they that worſhip the Father, ſhal worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, even in the Spirit which is communicated to all Fleſh by the union of the Divine and humane Nature.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak all in a word; <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsion luſting after the forbidden Fruit, opened the dore to a luſting and inordinate mind in all his Poſterity, tending to ſubvert all things; This was taken away by the word becoming Fleſh, uniting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane Nature, and thereby communicated to all men that believe, that the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in the power thereof might become the Sons of God, In the ſtrength of this Divine Nature to them that ask it, they are able to ſubdue thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate inſatiable deſires of the mind, which are propagated from <hi>Adam</hi> to all Poſterity. Now we ſee what Religion is, even an imploring the Gracious Spirit to ſubdue theſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we were addicted to, and a living in the exerciſe of this ſtrength and power againſt all aſſaults of our ſpiritual Enemies. Religion then is an internal exerciſe to keep the ſoul pure, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64616:15"/>
free from inordinate deſires, clean and immaculate from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſo is the Mother of all moral duties; It is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life whereby it does deny an external life, and abandons not only the enjoyments of the external life, but even the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of them, which it only and principally aims at. Now let us conſider what is Antichriſtian or Antichriſt; The Name ſhews that it is oppoſite to Chriſt, and ſomthing ſet up inſtead of him, or againſt him; And ſure if he will anſwer his name, he muſt overthrow that which Chriſt hath done and appointed, and ſet up ſomthing elſe in the room thereof, whatever he has a mind to, or his pleaſure is to ſet up that is contrary thereto, which he has no other way to accompliſh, but by bringing this Internal exerciſe of the Mind to ſome External exerciſe and performance; For thereby the Mind will forget the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal work, being amuſed and taken up with External duties. Now that he may bring may bring Religion to an external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, he needs no more then with ſome ſhew of zeal to excogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now becauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity, there will be Lapſes; Charity will oblige that the offence be covered, and the Perſon offending upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (privately manifeſted to any of the Company) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; But if after private and particular admonitions he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue pervicacious and impenitent, he is to be ſecluded, and caſt off from the Company: Here is no External Violence to be uſed, no aſſiſtance from the ſecular arm, no imployment for the Maſtiſtrates Sword, but a plain and ſimple ſhutting him out of the Society, that will not be guided by the Laws of it, and thereby it becomes his own act and not theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our Saviour hath given a greater Power with the Keys, not Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concerning Wills and Teſtamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Thus it muſt needs be, that all its Jurisdiction and Power muſt be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſince the very deſign of Chriſtian Religion, is to deny
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64616:17"/>
outward things; But we have been long trained up in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrine, the Miniſters ſtill placing themſelves in the room of Chriſt, will be heads when they ought to be but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and rule ſuch whom they ought to ſerve, ſeeking rather the Subſtance and Goods of the Flock, than the good of their Souls. This Society then being met together, their Exerciſe and Worſhip will be as agreeable as may be to their Religion; that is, Internal, I mean there will be not be need of any great pains or ſtudy to prepare for to entertain the Company with a ſtudied Diſcourſe of an hour long, but rather all being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, and Regenerated into the Divine Nature, as was ſaid, it will be neceſſary to act ſuitable thereto in all plainneſs and ſimplicity; And further, this being that Life from whence all a Chriſtians actions flow, let every one ſubmit to the direction and guidance thereof; and ſo whoever hath a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, let the reſt hear it, as coming from the ſame Spirit which is given to all: Let him that hath a mind to ſpeak, ſpeak freely, but humbly alſo, and willing to forbear if it ſhall be ſignifyed to him; This <hi>Paul</hi> calls Prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31, For they may all Prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. and the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets. As for the Miniſter or Biſhop, if this practice be mantained, it may ſoon be decided who he is, or ought to be, even he, whoſe Guifts, whoſe Zeal, whoſe Piety and wiſdom ſhall be noted as chief amongſt the reſt, and Honoured among them with general conſent as deſerving the firſt Rank: Now if there be diſſent in this regard, the beſt way to avoid ſtrife, is to decide it by Lot. According to what we have ſaid, his buſineſs will not be much, in regard of ſtudy, but in pains and labour, in cauſing them often to meet together, to exhort them earneſtly and diligently, to heal thoſe that are fallen, viſit the ſick, comfort the weak, take care for the poor, inſtruct the Ignorant, with many ſuch duties which accompany this weighty Charge. He earneſtly endeavours to build up the Inward man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64616:17"/>
wiſheth them far excluded from the civil practiſe of men. There are but two appointed and thoſe only neceſſary, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm or waſhing with Water, to ſhew our being cleanſed by the Holy Ghoſt from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, rendered pure from all Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is the admiſsion into this Holy Society: The other is the Supper, ſignifying to us, and alſo conveying to us by Bread and Wine, the fruit of our Lords being bruiſed for us, and farther confirming and ſtrengthning of us in his Power to reſiſt all Corruption; both which he will adminiſter to ſuch as underſtand what they do, and are ſincere in the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: All that we have ſaid may eaſily appear to be the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Primitive Church: They were ſo united in the Spirit of Love and Peace as to have all things common, and to be a wonder to the Heathens; who would ſay of them, ſee how theſe Chriſtians Love one another. Likewiſe that every man had liberty to ſpeak in the Congregation, appears by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Propheſying; alſo the Apoſtles as they removed from place to place, took care to appoint ſuch Paſtors or Biſhops in Church they were about to leave title to, as being Pious, Elderly and Zealous; might thereby have the beſt take care of the reſt, and to ſerve them in that Office: But when large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues came to be annexed to theſe Places; he was the fitteſt man among many pretenders, whom the Secular Authority did commend whether a Shepherd or a Wolfe, 'twas not regarded, But thus much to ſhew what is truth in Religion, and in its practiſe thereof, which we are gone ſo far from as to be Ignorant of the notion, but much more of the Actions agreeable to it. But it si good to know it, though we do not for the preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; yet to look whence we are fallen, may be ſome means of amendment, and to conſider well thereof is the firſt ſtep to it. At leaſt from hence it will appear very Juſt and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to remove thoſe unneceſſary Additions, to cut off thoſe ſuperflous Branches, thoſe redundant Revenues of Clergy, which tend to deſtroy Religion: It will alſo appear, that in propoſing a Hundred Pounds a year to the Clergy; I am ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64616:18"/>
far from being beyond the mark, that I am ſhort of it, and the danger is ſtill more in the largeneſs of the Revenue, then in the ſhortneſs of it. But it will be ſaid Miniſters will not be ſatisfied therewith. Neither will unreaſonable men be ſatisfied with any thing. Biſhops were never yet ſatisfied with the Power and Revenues they had unjuſtly obtained, but were continually Proling for more: Their Grand Captain the Pope, will not eaſily ſay it is enough: Should his Greatneſs be more widely extravagant then it is? In the mean time let the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate take care to give ſuch limits to their deſires, as may come neareſt to the bounds of Truth; and ſince they cannot govern themſelves in the Fortunes they enjoy, he ſhall do well to place them in ſuch Fortunes, as they ſhall have leaſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to abuſe; ſuch as may have a tendency to cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and conſider who they are, and what they are ſet about. Thus not only the neceſſiy of the Civil State require that the Lands of the Clergy be alienated, but likewiſe the Truth of Religon does more preſſingly urge it: The beſt means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and eſtabliſh which, if any outward means will do it, is to allow the Officers and Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſters thereof ſuch advanges from the World, as that they prove not Temptations to draw them aſide to a diſregard of their Office, to Pride, Malice, Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the other hand may keep them from being burdenſome to themſelves by the ſtraitneſs of their Fortune, or to their Neighbours for Relief: I have known a Miniſter, his Wife and Children Maintained out of Thirty Pound a year, with that Contentment to themſelves, and with ſuch eſteem amongſt their Neighbours: That though other Clergy men exceed him in Wealth, yet he much exceeds them in the abundance of his Enjoyments; if they are before him in Honour and large Poſſeſſions; he is much before them in Happineſs and Content, which is the fulneſs that all things tend to adminiſter. For theſe men whilſt they teach others, are themſelves yet to learn what it is to live Well and Happily; it is not to have much or Great things, which with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64616:18"/>
increaſe the deſires of them, and ſo there is no reſt, and conſequently no ſatisfaction: But it is to have a mind ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to it ſelf, and well governed, making uſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyments, without anxiety for the future, and cutting off theſe reſtleſs deſires in the bud, which if proſecuted ſerve only for a ſnare and torment, as Heathens have obſerved: For a concluſion we ſhall propoſe theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what has been ſaid, it appears that Chriſtian Religion is beſt upheld by ſmall Revenues in the Miniſters of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its deſigne is to ſhake off all the outward things of this World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thing, that no Pomp or Ceremony, no Altar, no Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are required in the Chriſtian Religion: The reaſon is, Religion being an Internal work, and a change of the mind from outward things, and inconſiſtant therewith: To what purpoſe are theſe outward forms and Ceremonies? what Reference have they? Unleſs it be to amuſe the mind, and frame a beliefe in men that Religion (quite contrary to the nature of it) conſiſts in externalls, whereby (to the deſtruction of Religion) the mind ſhall be drawn forth into external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, to cauſe it delight in that Pomp and Vanity which it ſhould forſake; and by this means it will be blinded ſo much, as not once to look within it ſelf, but thinks all is well where there is nothing but rottenneſs and Corruption. If you ſay that theſe externals are repreſentations of the Internal, work, and ſerve to lead us to them. I anſwer, it is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and indirect means; for what is ſo near me as I am to my ſelf? And why cannont I deſcend into my own mind every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without taking that for an advantage which brings ruine with it? As Croſſes, Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Ceremonies are not only needleſs, but miſcheivous, cheating and blinding the World, whereby they let go the ſubſtance and embrace the ſhaddow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters or Biſhops have no concern in publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or in Secular Juriſdiction; their buſineſs is to preſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64616:19"/>
Faith in Chriſt, both in themſelves and others; to remove the Corruption fallen upon mens minds: what duty then lyes upon them for Secular buſineſs, or what claime have they to it? The nature of their Profeſſion and Doctrine does diveſt them thereof as much as is poſſible, being quite oppoſite to it; forbidding even too much concerne for their Private Affairs in the World; which ſhews that it is their extravagancy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy when they thruſt themſelves into publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has ſuch tendency to overcharge their minds with that which they ſhould be altogether cleanſed from, as we have before ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is almoſt needleſs here to ſay there is no ſuch Power of Excommunication as is now in uſe, being made to uphold a lye and an unjuſt uſurpation in Secular Affaires, to lacky after Fees, and to ſerve the Secular Intereſt of the Clergy: which according to the Truth of their Imployment is none at all; we have ſhewed before, what this Excommunication is: And certainly the true Church as well as the Government thereof being Internal and Spiritual, not External and Secular, all the Acts of its Juriſdiction muſt be agreeable thereto.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Method of Preaching, is a prejudice to the Life and Power of Religion, wherein men ſet forth themſelves by Studied Diſcourſes, with Ornaments of Hiſtory, Rhetorick, ſubtile Diſputations, nice Diſtinctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For by theſe things the mind is taken up with things that are Circumſtantial and External, and thereby lets ſlip thoſe things that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and of nearer Concernment, and therefore has a ſtamp of of the Beaſt upon it; tending to inhance the value of all other External things which men ought to deny, cauſing them to love and embrace what they ſhould caſt away, to deſire more earneſtly ſuch things as they ſhould be mortified unto; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they will run more ſwiftly then before to the pit of Deſtruction, where Antichriſt and the falſe Prophet is: So that at the end, theſe men are worſe then at the beginning they might have been; had they not been trained up in ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64616:19"/>
as this, and it were better for them not to have known the way of Truth, then having known it, to make it the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of more enlarged wickedneſs; and of going yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God then at firſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Miniſter or Biſhop takes no honour to himſelf; all that he is or hath, he hath received it, it is the purchaſe of the the blood of Chriſt, exhibited according to the word in the ſecond Covenant to all that belive; he ſeeks not reward nor laboureth for gain, having deveſted himſelf of Worldly and outward things: He Governs the people, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is ſet over, not with force but meekneſs; he uſeth no means of Compulſion, but draweth them gently; he pretends not power over their Wills, but an Office to perſwade, but if men will deſtroy themſelves, he is guiltleſs, doing what is ſuitable to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to reclaime them, alwayes willing to help them, alwayes with open Arms to receive ſuch as come to the Church, and reſtore ſuch as are fallen, Lamenting and Praying for ſuch whoſe Miſcarriages are from their own Wills, and not in his power to help.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The laſt thing we obſerve from what is ſaid before, is that it is impoſſible there ſhould be any Difference or Sect in the Chriſtian Religion; and if you find any amongſt them, ſay aſſuredly <hi>Inimicus homo fecit hoc,</hi> it is a ſtranger to the Truth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d proceeds from ſome other cauſe. The reaſon is plain, for what occaſion can be imagined of Diviſion or Schiſme amongſt thoſe who all conſpire only in this, to keep their minds Pure and clean from Corruption, by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and in the power of that Holy Spirit, which is one in all of them: From which oneneſs divided through many members, there muſt needs be unity: But you will ſay, the preſent time teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Diviſion that is among Chriſtians. I anſwer, that ſuch as are Chriſtians in pretence only, may diviſe a hundred more Sects and Parties: They are men that will inſpite of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſerve two Maſters, God and <hi>Mammon</hi>; the Lord and <hi>Baall.</hi> Men who are Chriſtians by the halfes, that will ſerve
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64616:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord, yet not without a Babel of their own ſetting up. In Briefe, the Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will add to the Scriptures ſomething that is meerly of their own fancies, imagining the Scripture to ſound according to their prejudice and preconception, Now if one man will ſet up one thing, and ſay this is according to Scripture; another man with the ſame reaſon may ſet up another thing of his own hatching and framing, and ſay the like, and ſo we may go on in <hi>Infinitum:</hi> If the Biſhops ſay, ſuch and ſuch Ceremonies are to be uſed in the Church, ſeeming to them decent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture. The Presbyterians are not obliged to think as they do, nor take the ſame meaſures of Decency as they do, and therefore may claim Priviledge as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a ſecond Conſtitution, which perhaps will not ſo well agree with Independants; and therefore with as much Right may they ſet up a third, and ſo every man as his Fancy leads him: In the mean time this difference is not in Religion it ſelf, but in the Braines and Fancies of men, that love to cloth and dreſs Religion according to their own faſhion; and there cannot be a unity till men ſhall come to throw away all theſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Imaginations, and return to the obedience of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life and Truth, which proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and is only able to make us wiſe unto Salvation. There is no unity but in this; the occaſion of our diviſions, was by departing therefrom, and our returning to it, will be our advancement to our right minds, to live in unity, in love, in Peace, in ſerving the Lord our God with one heart, and one mind, rejoycing before him continually.</p>
            <p>Now it ſhould methinks ſhame theſe Teachers of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom nation ſoever, that ſet up a Doctrine of their own framing though out of the Litteral Word; if they conſider, that after all their contrivances and deſignes, their ſtudy and labour, and ſpending ſo much ſweat and words in the Pulpit; it is as impoſſible for them to make men Believe, or Holy, or Powerful to reſiſt the leaſt Temptation, as it was in the Prieſts of <hi>Baall</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64616:20"/>
after their Bellowings and howlings to obtain the pure fire from Heaven to conſume the Sacrifice; and I wiſh they would no longer (with them) halt between two opinions; But if God be to be Worſhiped, let him be only Worſhiped and entirely Worſhiped; and made not only the object, but to fill all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured according to my Talent to ſhew, with what plainneſs I could the nature of Chriſtian Religion, and to preſerve it from the miſtakes it lyes under at this day, by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government, and ſhewn that the neceſſity of the Affairs of the Nation conſpire with Religion to aboliſh it; and let us underſtand the voice of God and what he requires, when he has thus hedged in our way, that we cannot divert to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path, but with great Detriment: He hath proclaimed the Truth of his Religion and Worſhip, which he will no longer ſuffer to be oppreſt with unjuſt uſurpation: If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall think good to intereſt themſelves in his cauſe, it will be well for them, but if not, he will find other means and make way for the accompliſhment of his will. And let not the Biſhops and their Party ſay, that every dangerous change in the Common-wealth, ſtill makes them the firſt objects of the aſſault, and begins through their ſides to ruine the Common-wealth. For the thing is contrary, and he that will bring any Reformation in Church or State, muſt begin with them who generally have been the diſturbers of both, and alwayes the ſtrongeſt oppoſers of any thing that tended much to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of either; ſo that any thing that is good and truly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, muſt needs call for their removal, as its firſt ſtep to advancement.</p>
            <p>How great the benefit would be of caſting off the Biſhops Courts, and that unſupportable Yoke the Subject is enſlaved to by means thereof; though all men are in ſome meaſure ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet thoſe only can fully underſtand who have felt the Laſh of it; and I think, there is no man that conſiders the abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Corruption in thoſe Courts, that any thing is carried
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64616:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which way the man deſires that gives the moſt Money, that all ſuch perſons as are of any Rank, or Fortune, or Eſteem in the World are freed from the moleſtations of theſe Courts, only ſuch as are poor and have little, muſt have this addition to their Miſery, to maintain the Credit of this unjuſt Authority, by the expence of their time, and that little lively-hood they have; whereby it is plainly to be ſeen, that they are not keept to rectifie Diſorders, or ill Manners, as they pretend; but purely for ſupport of Epiſcopal Authority without any farther end, or which is worſe, to Grind the poor, and to rob ſuch as are ready to ſtarve.</p>
            <p>And after all that has been ſaid, ſhall we imagine that the Magiſtrate does ill to take away Biſhops Lands, or is their any cauſe to doubt what he ought, or what is his duty to do in this caſe; rather do not the rules of Juſtice, and Conſcience oblidge him thereto, with the ſtrongeſt obligation; for what greater obligation can there happen to a Magiſtrate than to honour his Creatour, to obey him from whom he has received that truſt he is inveſted with, and to take away all remainders of an unſavory Idolatrous Worſhip What can oblige him more then to procure the Happineſs and welfare of his Subject in all caſes, where it may be done with ſafely to himſelf and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with Juſtice and Piety, and without injury to any, ought he not in Conſcience to eſtabliſh a Harmony and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongſt his people, tending to their peace and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and manifold ſatisfaction. Ought he not like a good Phyſitian, to take away that ill humour that has layne ſo long corroding upon their Bowells: Or is there any other or better means of laying a ſolid foundation of durable empire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed Government, then in the proſperity and contentment of the people: Do not all our Laws and degrees of Magiſtracy, and even Civil Society it ſelf tend to this end; is not this that bond that at firſt linked men into Civility, made them reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſociable, and void of this, they ſlide inſenſibly into confuſion, and return to the Savage nature of ſuch as Prey
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64616:21"/>
upon their own kind: For ſuch is ſaid to be the condition of our Anceſtors before they underſtood the benefit of concord, and uſefulneſs of well ordered Government; which reſtrains Injuſtice by Laws, and gives Life to whatever may benefit mankind. But I cannot think that barbarous Age ſo bad, when force prevailed and ſtrength of Arme bore down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, when nothing could be called a mans own longer then the abſence of a more puiſſant Champion gave him leave to enjoy it; when weakneſs and innocence was the greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and occaſion and ſuffering continual Inſolences and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages: When Robbery and Stealing gave a juſt Title to all things a man could Poſſeſs, and the ſecurity thereof lay only in the ſtrength of Poſſeſſour, if we compare theſe times with what has ſucceeded under Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, we ſhall find the ſame exorbitances, but perhaps more grievous coming upon the Stage, the Scene only altered; ſince unrighteouſneſs was eſtabliſhed by a Law, and backed with Religion; ſince Piety and the fear of God was thought worthy the greateſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Innocence and Humility the greateſt guilt; to open the mouth againſt vanity and wickedneſs was the greateſt Hereſie: Since men have acted Lyes with Applauſe, and Deceit with Honour and Remuneration, profeſſing Chriſt, yet trampling him under their feet, renouncing the World, yet inſatiable in their deſires after it, pretending Humility, yet inſulting over the greateſt Princes: Encouraging a contempt of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their Creatour and Redeemer, filling their Coffers by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences and Pardons thereof, and in the mean time the violation of the leaſt Punctilio enjoyned by them, muſt be worthy of death: I could enlarge upon theſe things, but why ſhould I do it: To thee, O Lord Vengeance belongeth: Shew thy ſelf, O God of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>There are two things more (which are wanting) to give us a vigorous and laſting health? one is the Regulating the Laws, and the abuſes of the numerous pretenders to it. For the firſt, in my Apprehenſion, it were neceſſary that the beginning of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64616:22"/>
every Kings Reigne, ſhould be accompanied with a Cleanſing, Digeſting and Gompiling a certain Perfect Body of the Law, that it might be ſomething certain, and that it might not be lyable to the Quirkes and Fallacies of ſo many buſie Deceivers, and alſo that it may be brought as near as may be to the preſent Genius and Humour of men, by that means that we be not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by an Antique Humour, as we would not be clothed in their faſhion. To Regulate the abuſes therein, and hinder Multiplicity of Suites; the means may be to appoint Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that no Suit ſhall be in any of the Kings Courts under a hundred Pounds: But that the Parties at variance for any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue under that, be made to chuſe each his Arbitratour, and to enter into bond, to approve the Arbitrators ſhall determine, only this bond in caſe Covenants be not performed, to be brought into the higher Courts and Sentence ſtrictly paſſed thereupon; alſo in caſe one Party refuſe this Arbitration, that then the other proceed in the Kings Court, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſer be proceeded againſt upon Evidence given, as Non-ſuited. Some ſuch effectal application the Corruption of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature and increaſe of Law Suites do ſeem to require. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits whereof will be, 1. That people ſhall in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide themſelves their diſagreements, it being done by thoſe whom themſelves chuſe. 2. The Caſe may be more fully known, being near the place and Juſtice more exactly render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that means. 3. It ſaves great Expences and long Journeys. 4. It may be a means that men run not out of their Eſtates by long Suits. 5. It may keep a good Ballance of Money in the Pockets of meaner men, which tends to the advancement of Trade, and ſo Lawyers may be prevented of drawing too much thereof into their Pockets, where it is either uſeleſs to the publick, or manifeſtly prejudicial by Uſury and exaction.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it were highly requiſite the Univerſities were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, which are become Seminaries of Debauchery, rather then good Learning or good Manners to the Nation. They
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64616:22"/>
have too great a Temptation to Debauchery from the too large Beneficence of their Founders, which would be Retrenched, and part of the Revenues, and alſo of their Colledges better ſetled, upon another deſigne <hi>viz.</hi> for maintaining Profeſſors in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gentile Heroick exerciſes, that young Gentlemen may not only know Arts and Sciences, but alſo to Fence, Ride, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall an Army and the like; continual reading flats and deads the mind, makes it unfit for Action: But this exerciſe will whet and inlarge it, and make men capable of being imployed in the Common-wealth, and I perſwade my ſelf that theſe two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjoyned, Reading and Exerciſe would make a wiſe active people.

            <p>The difference of Habit in their degrees, ſerve to puff them up, and cauſe them to carry a Magiſterial Pride throughout their Lives, every little adds to a mind already corrupted.</p>
            <p>For a Concluſion, let Politicians enquire whether it be ſafe and requiſite in a Common-wealth to allow of two Authorities and two diſtinct orders of Government in the ſame body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, I ſuppoſe they will find it noxious, if the conſider that the Stability and Perpetuity of a Common wealth depends upon its oneneſs or unity,<note place="margin">It is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in a Common-wealth explained by the general conſent of all Politicians.</note> which is like the ſtraight line of the Mathematicians, the foundation of all other their operations; now this oneneſs is ſo near the foundation of a Common-wealth, that any receding from it, moſt needs have a dangerous influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Fabrick, being a weakning and looſning the Foundations; and the effects muſt follow that a violent Puſh of Storm and Wind will through this defect endanger its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: For this Epiſcopal Government being eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64616:23"/>
on different principles and different Intereſt to the reſt of the Government, with another Authority then that of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, it will follow, that though it may agree well for a time in ſubordination to the ſupream Authority, yet there is a gap open for Diviſion, which will not be without its evil effects; when any unuſual accident ſhall happen in the Common-wealth to its diſturbance; thus we know by vertue of this Authority, and from this principle of Diviſion in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, our Kings to have been thrown off, the whole Kingdom diſturbed and made Feudatary to a Forreigne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,<note place="margin">There is no Kingdom in <hi>Europe</hi> that has not ſome time or other taſted the ill effects of it.</note> as in King <hi>John</hi>: In thoſe times it played with its Batteries upon our Kings, but ſince the Reformation it has turned the Engines of Malice upon the People, and cauſe them to begin a War. In briefe, Epiſcopacy being a Government of it ſelf, diſtinct from the ſupream and lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without any juſt Title or pretenſions (all which come within the verge of the Civil Magiſtrate) it muſt needs (to ſupport it ſelf, for it cannot be idle) trouble the Waters that it may have the better Fiſhing: If you ſay it is neceſſary for Maintaining Religion, the Anſwer is, I have ſhewed before that Religion needs no ſuch ſupports: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the firſt Inſtituters of our Religion, never uſed nor claimed any ſuch Authority, but with the greateſt ſubmiſſion yeilded to the Secular Power in all things. The Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tends to benefit mankind with all good things temporal and eternal; it is perfect goodneſs and perfect unity, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a principle of Diviſion ſhould proceed from it: And therefore, thoſe Diviſions in Common-wealths can proceed from no other cauſe then the author of Diviſion, who having at firſt ſeparated from the Holy God, makes it his buſineſs to fill all things with the effects of that Diviſion. But you will ſay, the Church under Chriſt and his Apoſtles was perſecuted and hated. The Anſwer is, that the Tempter made the firſt proffer, the Kingdoms of the earth, and the Glories of them, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64616:23"/>
our Saviour if he would fall down and Worſhip him, which our Saviour refuſing to do and his Apoſtles; he was forced to keep them till he met ſuch as admiring the beguiling Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; would ſubmit to the Condition.</p>
            <p>But Politicians will tell us, that all mutation in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goes not unaccompanied with danger; to which we may Anſwer: That this happens when Circumſtantials are changed for other Circumſtantialls, as I may call them: As the danger is nothing ſo much in taking away any thing in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that is ſuperfluous, but in the bringing in a thing ſuperfluous. (Thus the taking away the Ceremonies in <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Reformation, was without any great noiſe, but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding a new Lyturgy was not without Tumult and War; the like we have ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> the pulling down of Abbies and Monaſteryes in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and alienating the Lands of the Church, was done with ſafety and ſilence enough: But the practiſes of bringing in new Ceremonies in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, was followed with a Bloody War, &amp; wonderful change of Affairs, whereas the contrary Acts were a kind of Stability to the Kings Throne; and generally it may be obſerved throughout <hi>Europe</hi> in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and other places that the Reformation, and taking away what was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in the Government, was not only done peaceably, but alſo without the leaſt change of Government, only perhaps it was better ſecured thereby; whereas all attempts of bringing in, or re-eſtabliſhing thoſe Futilous Ceremonies and Devices, were alwayes accompanied with long and Bloody Wars.) Or when a part of the Government is changed, and ſomething put into the room of it of a different Nature. 2. Not when Circumſtantials are aboliſhed without addition or Subſtitution of others. 3. Not when it is to the guſt and liking of the greateſt part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. Nor when it is recompenſed with great advantage to all the people. And beſides, let us conſider what <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> has done in this kind, being in far worſe Circumſtances, and in much more dangerous Condition then we are: As firſt very Potent Adverſaries abroad, the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64616:24"/>
King of <hi>Spain.</hi> 1. This whole Nation had ſat down a long time under that beliefe which he oppoſed, and ſucked it in with their milk, that this change muſt needs appear monſtrous and formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; which would not only bring a change upon the outward Condition of the Nation, but mens minds alſo: They muſt change thoſe thoughts and opinions which were almoſt as natural to them, as the Aire they Breathed in: Whereas in our Condition, there is nothing to be feared upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from a Forreigne Enemy: Neither ſhall we have need oppoſe any Preconceptions, or row againſt the tide of the common ſentiments of the Nation: Add to this the benefit we may reap by it, whereas the former Reformation was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a bare preheminence of Power and Dominion: and ſo looked ſomething like Tyranny. Farther, we want not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Churches of the Reformation that were in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and thoſe parts, how a Chriſtian Church may moſt fully agree with a ſubmiſſion of all external Juriſdiction to the Magiſtrate, and live in excellent Harmony with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, of which they are Members, their Intereſt (not differing therefrom as in the Epiſcopacy) but bound up in all things that concerne the external Government with it. Which is done, 1. By giving them a competent maintenance equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided to all. 2. Let them chuſe one of the moſt ſober and wiſe amongſt them (for ſuch a time) to have the Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over them and the affairs of the Church. 3. In their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtories or publick Meetings, let a Secular imployed by the King be alwayes preſent. 1. To ſee they meddle not with State Affairs. 2. To provide that no dammage redound to the Publick by Heates or Controverſies. Thus ſhall we have a truer and more perfect Religion, a ſurer foundation of Peace, a firmer Eſtabliſhment of Government, and laſting ſupport of Unity and Commerce in all degrees amongſt us, Now the Author all Bleſſings, publick and private, grant us Grace to open our Eyes, that we may ſee the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our Peace, which is thus conjoyned with the Honour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64616:24"/>
of his Name; and let him that is as great in power as goodneſs, ſtrengthen our Hearts and our Hands, that all of us may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our aſſiſtance to the pulling down that great Babylon of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this of our own Nation, which are as well a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, as the Obſtacles of our Peace</p>
