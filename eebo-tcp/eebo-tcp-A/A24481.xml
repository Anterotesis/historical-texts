         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT, of Major General KIRCK,
And LONDON-DERRY;
WITH A
Geographical Account of the River he Sail'd down, and the Various
Forts on it, Perticularly that of
KULMORE.</head>
            <head>Lycenſed, according to Order,</head>
            <p>THE Mouth of the River of <hi>London-Derry,</hi>
lies about <hi>Weſt</hi> and by <hi>South</hi>
or <hi>Weſt South Weſt</hi> from <hi>Kintyre</hi> in
the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is not
above Fourteen or Fifteen Miles diſtant from
it. As you Enter it upon the <hi>Weſt</hi> is a Fort
called <hi>Green-Caſtle,</hi> but is of no Importance,
the River being ſo wide there that they can
eaſily go in without the reach of this Caſtle:
About Seven or Eight Miles above it lies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called <hi>Red Caſtle,</hi> but is of as little uſe as
the former, the River likewiſe being of that
Bredth there, that no Shot can reach them
from this Fort. Above this, about Three or
Four Miles diſtance is another called <hi>White-Caſtle,</hi>
which is Situated between a quarter and
half a mile from the River, which is of as
little uſe to hinder Landing as either of the
former; for though the River be Narrower
than at the former Two, yet it being at that
diſtance from the River cannot hinder the
Entrance of any Ships. Betwixt this Place
and the going in at the Fort of <hi>Kulmore</hi> is ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Water, ſo that no Ships of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Burthen can Enter but about the Spring-Tide;
and therefore, though the Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
has Entred the Mouth of the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Ten or Twelve Days agoe, yet upon
Sounding the Depth of the River he found,
that he could not ſafely go in, till ſuch time it
is High-water, unleſs he was reſolved to ſtrand
his Ships. The Fort of <hi>Kulmore</hi> is about Three
Miles from <hi>London-Derry,</hi> but it is not of ſuch
Importance as <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other Diſafected
Perſons would make the World believe. For
in the time of the late <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion (ſince
which time the Fort has had no additions of
ſtrength that we hear of) when the Town of
<hi>London-Derry</hi> was Blockt up as ſtraitly as now
it is, and when there were not above 500 in
Garriſon in it, and endured a Seige of above
Six Months, Coll.—was ſent to reinforce
it with one Regiment only, he was forced to
wait for the Spring-Tide, before he could paſs
the Fort of <hi>Kulmore;</hi> though in the mean
while the Beſeiged keept Correſpondence, by
ſending in the Night time ſome Perſons that
could Swim well down to him, who brought
Intelligence back from him again to the Town
till ſuch time as he had Water enough to carry
his Ships over; at which time, though he had
but one Man of War in his Company, and
there was a Chain over the River by <hi>Kulmore,</hi>
yet he eaſily broke the Chain, and paſſed that
Fort without receiving any conſiderable Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
And no doubt the Beſeiged keeps as good
Correſpondence with the Major General now,
as thoſe did then; and he having Four Men
of War in his Company will Enter with leſs
Damage then they did.</p>
            <p>The Town it ſelf lies higher than the Land
within Shot of it, and is for the moſt part ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with the River and Boggs, ſo that they
can eaſily defend themſelves a conſiderable time
againſt the Enemy. It has Four Gates, <hi>Butchers
Gate, Ferry Gate, Biſhops Gate</hi> and <hi>Ships Gate.</hi>
In the middle of the Town is the <hi>Market-place,</hi>
where is likewiſe the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of the Town.
It is ſufficiently Planted about with great Guns
for Annoying their Enemies: It has Proviſions
ſufficient, there having ſeveral Ships got in
thither within theſe Four Weeks from <hi>Scotland;</hi>
ſo that we need not doubt, but what by the
ſtrength of the Town and the Valour of the
Inhabitants (which has been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
by the great Havock they have
made, as well of the Greateſt of their Officers,
as of the Private Sentinals of their Enemies)
it will be able to hold out till ſuch time as the
Major General ſhall get in with his Soldiers,
Ammunitions and Proviſions for its Relief.</p>
