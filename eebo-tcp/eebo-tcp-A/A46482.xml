            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THings being come to that Extremity, That I have been forc'd to ſend away the Queen, and my Son the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> That they might not fall into my Enemies Hands (which they muſt have done, had they ſtay'd) I am oblig'd to do the ſame thing, and to endeavour to fecure my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the beſt I can, in hopes that it will pleaſe God, out of his infinite Mercy to this unhappy Paſſion, to touch their Hearts again with true Loyalty and Honour. If <hi>I</hi> could have relied on all my Troops <hi>I</hi> might not have been put to this Extremity <hi>I</hi> am in; and would, at leaſt, have had one Blow for it: But though <hi>I</hi> know there are amongſt you very many loyal and brave Men, both Officers and Souldiers; yet you know, That both your ſelf, and ſeveral of the General Officers of the Army, told me, it was no ways adviſable for me to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my ſelf at their Head, or to think to fight the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with them. And there remains only for me to thank you, and all thoſe, both Officers and Souldiers, who have ſtuck to me, and been truly loyal; and hope you will ſtill retain the ſame Fidelity to me: And to <hi>I</hi> do not expect you ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelves, by reſiſting a foreign Army, and a poiſoned Nation; yet <hi>I</hi> hope your former Principles are ſo rooted in you, That you will keep your ſelves free from Aſſociations, and ſuch pernicious Things.
