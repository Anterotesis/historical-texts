            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING Peruſed your Eſſay, I finde it as ſhort of it's intent as the Nation is of a ſettlement, but I could wiſh that it came from ſuch a ſpirit (as it's ſwift comprehenſions would ſeem to import) that could at once unite divided intereſts, and ſecure them from the undermining attempts of their hypocriticall profeſſing leaders. I ſhall as briefly as I can lay open the weightieſt part of your Teſtimony (waving many honeſt things therein, though doubtleſſe bottom'd with a great deal of craft) which from your Paper I gather to be this, ſuſpending the rights of the Nation, you declare for ſuch men to be Rulers that are qualified and limited according to the word of God, men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, fearing God and hating covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>To this I Object; Firſt, The injuſtice of your Teſtimony it being impoſſible that any number of men ſhould be impoſed and perpetuated Governours of this Nation without abſolute violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the rights thereof, as may be evinced from the practice of the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there being alſo no reaſon in nature much leſſe divine, for ſupremacy or a generall ſubjection, without the conſent of the people firſt had, to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, conditions and laws thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If upon Objection (that a great part of the people have by acting againſt, forfeited their right hereto, or otherwiſe through ignorance of prophaneneſſe are incapeable of it, and ſo we contract the Nation into ſuch part unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned the quarrel againſt Royalty (whoſe diviſions are lamentable and the Land groans under) by what equity can you vindicate your teſtimony to exclude the intereſt of thoſe that hazzarded their lives and goods equally, if not more then your ſelves, to purchaſe this freedom with you, how will the ſoul of any impartial man abhor your ingratitude and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like dealing to raviſh that from others and your brethren too, that you would not to be taken from your ſelves, what glorious pretence ſoever this comes under, as the reign of Chriſt and his kingdom, ſelf, ambition, and a Miſtery of iniquity may be as well ſuſpected to be the root, though it may be not intended by the more ſimple ones.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Conſtitution of Government you mention (I meane not the qualifications of the perſons) muſt ineritably induce confuſion and ruine, the temper of the Nation being totally unſuitable to it, the minds of moſt ſober men being big with expectations of a more equal diſtribution of Government, for the reuniting of diſſenting parties, ſo much promiſed and ſucceſsfully ſpeculated into of late dayes, which if againe diſappointed by the inſinuation of an abſolute arbitrary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant power, will aggravate our annamoſities, inflame hatred, and expoſe the whole as a prey to the common enemy, beſides the confuſion, that naturally muſt follow your model, is very evident, for where will you finde diſcerning ſpirits that ſhall pick out men ſo qualified, and ſecure the Nation that under a Maſk of Religion, they ſhall not play their owne game and exceed their Teachers, and Predeceſſors? And how can you promiſe your ſelves that thoſe who ſhall inveſt ſuch men with power ſhall remaine their obedient humble ſervants and not when their ends ſhall be ſerved, with your aſſiſtance uſher in a ſingle Perſon againe, ſeeing it may be probable that thoſe who contributed ſo freely to advance the former, in reaſon ſhould as eagerly purſue it for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> If you reflect upon paſt providences towards Epiſcopacie, and Preſbittery, both pretending Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, and under it crowding into the civill Government for which they are ſufficiently condemned, you will finde your pretence to be much of that nature, rather worſe, for under covert of Chriſts kingdome, you would carry all away, you may well feare your ſucceſs, for he doth not appeare to be a Patron of ſo much wrong, ſeeing there are as many fervent lovers of his kingdome, that are not of your mind in this ſettlement, as you can pretend to, and for this reaſon to looſe their rights, as men will not be owned by that King in the day of his appearing; Neither can we ſee men ſo divinely fortified amongſt you as to count them more invincible then others to the baits of Honours and profits that may be expoſed to them in places of truſt. I ſhall therefore wind up with this advice to you and all others that deſire the peace and proſperity of their Country, that they will wait with patience the iſſues of providence, which as we may hope on good ground, will not long indulge a ſelfiſh ſpirit amongſt us, the experience whereof may make men tremble that harbour it: and let us multiply our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heaven, for a ſpirit of truth in the Parliament, the only preſent viſible power, to perform their promiſes to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſettle them in a well conſtituted Common-wealth, ſo limited as may ſecure the intereſt of the honeſt, and inſinuate to the love of their enemies, and it might be wiſhed, ſuch proviſions might be made for elections to power, by lot that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might have a more immediate diſpoſe thereof, for our good or evill, at his pleaſure.</p>
