            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7854:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the latter part of the 15. and throughout the 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. The fourth and laſt part, is the concluſion, in the 21. and 22. verſes, and hath two partes, <hi>Viz.</hi> a promiſe in the 21. verſe, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the 22. verſe.</p>
            <p>This Scripture is a member of the third generall part of this Epiſtle, which is the narration thereof; and hath three partes, <hi>Viz.</hi> firſt a reprehenſion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly good counſell, thirdly waightie admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt, he very ſharpely reproueth them, and that by an elegant metaphor, ſaying, <hi>thou art neither cold nor hote:</hi> that is, they knew the truth, but liued in a careleſſe mediocrity, and idle ſecurity; they did neither vtterly denie the Goſpel, nor ſoundly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it; they were neither profeſſed enemies, nor ſound <note n="“" place="margin">Necplane hostes, nec vere amiciſed neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trales.</note> friends, but wholy plied their trades &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, not greatly caring which end went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Gods matters, ſo they might enioy their pleaſures and profites; yea, hee telleth them flatly this is their eſtate, and that they were deceiued, for they thought themſelues rich and increaſed with goods, and had neede of nothing; when as in truth, they were wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blind, and naked; and therefore this will be the end of it, if they continue in this ſtate: <hi>hee will ſpue them but of his mouth.</hi> And truely as it is a marueilous ordinary thing, for them that liue in wealth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with pleaſures, and haue all things which the fleſh deſireth, to grow ſecure: ſo if wee make application hereof to our ſelues, wee ſhall find, that moſt Congregations, men and women in this land, are fearefully growing luke-warm, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7854:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in farre better eſtate then they be.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing laid open their dangerous eſtate, (that it might appeare vnto them, hee ſought their good, and delighted not in their deſtruction.) In the ſecond place hee giueth them louing and good counſell, and ſheweth them how they may become rich, couer their nakedneſſe, and cure their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Thirdly and laſtly, hee doth very grauely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, firſt to make good vſe of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, by becomming more zealous and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the verſe immediatly going before; ſecondly to make good vſe of the preſent meanes and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their good, in the wordes of my text: <hi>Beholde, I ſtand at the doore and knocke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are guilty of this Churches ſin, I pray God we may make good vſe of this admonion, and this day that God ſpeaketh and knocketh, let vs take heede we harden not our hearts; ſhe was reproued, let vs repent; ſhe was well counſelled, let vs obey; ſhe was threatned, let vs tremble; ſhe was admoniſhed, let vs take heede; yea, ſhe is now puniſhed, Oh let vs beware.</p>
            <p>Thus with <hi>Noahs</hi> Doue, I haue long houered, but now I haue recouered the Arke: yea, with the Arke I haue long floted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now am arriued on the mountaine of <hi>Armeniah,</hi> and (I hope not vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) made way to the Scripture that I purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vpon: for the more orderly handling whereof, theſe partes are to be conſidered: Viz. firſt a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Particular Diuiſion.</note> in theſe words; (<hi>Behold, I ſtand as the doore and knocke</hi>) ſecondly promiſes, in theſe words; (<hi>If any man heare my voyce, and open the doore, I wil come in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

               <hi>him, and will ſuppe with him and he with me.</hi>) The propoſition ſheweth the great willingnes of Chriſt to a ſinners conuerſion: the promiſes ſhew the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe happines of the ſinner conuerted.

               <hi>heare his voyce</hi>) ſecondly, (<hi>to open the doore.</hi>) The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made vpon theſe conditions, are two, viz. firſt, perpetuall abode, ((<hi>I will come in vnto him</hi>) ſecondly, perpetuall reioycing together, expreſſed by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of feaſting or banquetting, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, viz. firſt, the Sinners feaſting of Chriſt (<hi>I will ſuppe with him</hi>) and ſecondly, Chriſts feaſting of the Sinner, (<hi>and he with me</hi>) The note of attention ſet at the doore of my Text, doth knocke at the doores of your hearts, for reuerent and chriſtian attention to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7854:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the handling of all theſe Partes. And firſt, let vs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Porter.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Behold</hi>) This word hath principally a double vſe;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. VSE.</note> Firſt, it is as a Demonſtration, vſed for the greater certaintie and aſſurance of a thing, as a man is moſt certaine of that which he ſeeth; therefore ſaid the Diſciples vnto <hi>Thomas; We haue ſeene the Lord;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Except I ſee in his hands the print of the nayles, I will not</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 20. 25.</note> 
               <hi>beleeue.</hi> Thus for greater certaintie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Lords neere comming to Iudgement, Saint <hi>Iude</hi> vſeth this phraſe of ſpeech, <hi>Behold, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with thouſands of his Saints, to giue iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Iude 14.</note> 
               <hi>men.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to like purpoſe, hath the like phraſe, <hi>Behold, hee commeth with</hi>

               <hi>cloudes, viz.</hi> he commeth ſo certainely, and is ſo neere, that if you will but looke vp vnto the cloudes, you may ſee him. So to aſſure vs, that this is no fable, he ſaith here, (<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>) I ſtand &amp;c. yea, if we had but the eyes of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Num. 22. 23.</note> Aſſe, we might ſee him: but if we had a true faith, we would make no doubt of it, for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therof is greater then of ſight or <note n="“" place="margin">

            <p>The ſecond vſe of this word, is to procure atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Firſt in matters of wonder, the more to prouoke<note place="margin">1. Caſe.</note> men to maruell, this word is vſed; So the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> intreating of the rare and extraordinary, ſtrange and wonderfull maner of Chriſts Conception, thus
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7854:8"/>
expreſſeth it, <hi>Behold, a Virgine ſhall conceaue and beare a</hi>

               <hi>Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in Caſe of gladneſſe, the more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke men to reioycing, this word is vſed; as when<note place="margin">2. Caſe.</note> Chriſt, the Prince of peace and eternall glory, ſhould come into the Citie of Ieruſalem, to the great ioy of all ſuch as receiued him, the Euangeliſt cyting the words of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Goe tell the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King commeth vnto thee, meeke and ſitting on an Aſſe, therefore reioyce greatly, yea, ſhowt for</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Zach. 9. 9. matth. 21. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ioy:</hi> So here, to aſſure vs that the matter here deliuered is no trifle, but both caſes concurring, the more to prouoke vs both to wonder and reioyce, he thus deliuereth it, (<hi>Behold,</hi>) <hi>I ſtand at the doore and knocke.</hi> Yea, there is not one word in this ſentence, but deſerueth the ſtampe, and impreſſion of this Character vpon it.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Behold,</hi>) not a Seruant or Miniſter; not a Prophet or an Apoſtle; not a Saint or an Angell; but Chriſt Ieſus the Lord of life and glory himſelfe: <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken, they had had no</hi>

            <p>Behold, hee ſtandeth not in the Hall, Parlour, or Chamber, places and roomes for friends, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, entertainement, and content, but at the (<hi>doore</hi>) in the open ayre, a place for ſtrangers and enemies, where the head is filled with dew, and the lockes defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the drops of the <note n="y" place="margin">Cantic. 5. 2.</note> night.</p>
            <p>Behold, he ſtandeth at the doore, not mute, ſtill, and ſilent; but moſt friendly and louingly calleth and

               </note> towards vs, who will vouchſafe to come to our doore; but much more to ſtand and knocke there; which moſt fully appeareth from theſe three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, viz.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7854:9"/>
when by our preaching and prayſing his glory and goodneſſe, we make that which is infinite in it ſelfe, to be reputed great of others.
