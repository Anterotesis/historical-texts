            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ventured to fetch <hi>David</hi> the waters of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> they had nothing but the praise of their Boldness, because their Service was no more than the satisfaction of a Curiosity. But as Law-givers by their Rewards declare the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Obedience, so do Subjects also by the <hi>grandeur</hi> of what they expect set a value on the Law and the Law-giver, and do their Services accordingly.</p>

do but little more than humane Services. Christ hath taught us more, and given us more, and promis'd to us more than ever was in the world known or believ'd before him; and by the strengths and confidence of these, thrusts us forward in a holy and wise Oeconomy, and plainly declares that we must serve him by the measures of a new Love, do him Honour by wise and material Glorifications, be united to God by a new Nature, and made alive by a new Birth, and fulfil all Righteousness; to be humble and meek as Christ, to be merciful as our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is, to be pure as God is pure, to be partakers of the Divine Nature, to be wholly renewed in the frame and temper of our mind, to become people of a new heart, a direct new Creation, new Principles and a new Being, to do better than all the world before us ever did, to love God more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, to despise the world more generously, to contend for the Faith more earnestly; for all this is but a proper and a just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the great Promises which our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Law-giver came to publish and effect for all the world of Believers and Disciples.</p>

than the Scribes and Pharisees; more holy than the Doctors of the Law, than the Leaders of the Synagogue, than the wise Princes of the <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than some that were Prophets and High Priests, than some that kept the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Law without blame: men that lay in Sackcloth, and fasted much, and prayed more, and made Religion and the Study of the Law the work of their lives.

                  <p>They did well, and we must do better; their houses were Marble, but our roofs must be gilded and fuller of Glory. * But as the matter is very great, so the necessity of it is the greatest in the world. It must be so, or it will be much worse: unless it be thus, we shall never see the glorious Face of God. Here it concerns us to be wise and fearful; for the matter is not a question of an Oaken Garland, or a Circle of Bayes, and a Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ribband: it is not a question of Money

or Land, nor of the vainer rewards of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular noises, and the undiscerning Suffrages of the people, who are contingent Judges of good and evil: but it is the great stake of Life Eternal. We cannot be Christians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we be righteous by the new measures: the Righteousness of the Kingdom is now the only way to enter into it, for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is fixt, and the Judgement is decreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Judge infallible, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree irreversible: <hi>For I say unto you,</hi> said Christ, <hi>unless your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

I will not be so nice in the Observation of these words, as to take notice that Christ does not name the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> but the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> though there may be something in it: the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were called <hi>Caraim</hi> from <hi>Cara,</hi> to read; for they thought it Religion to spend one third part of their day in reading their

Scriptures, whose fulness they so admired they would admit of no suppletory Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were called <hi>Than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim,</hi> that is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, they added to the Word of God words of their own, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does at this day, they and these fell into an equal fate; while they <hi>taught far Doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> they prevaricated the righteousness of God. What the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to evil purposes hath done in this particular, may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in due time and place; but what false and corrupt glosses under the specious title of the Tradition of their Fathers the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had introducedour, Blessed Saviour reproves, and are now to be represented as the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that you may see that Righteousness beyond which all they must go that intend that Heaven should be their Journeys end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Pharisees obeyed the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Letter, not in the Spirit. They minded what God spake, but not what he intended: they were busie in the outward work of the hand, but incurious of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and choice of the heart. <gap reason="foreign">

that is, they rested <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> calls it, in the outward work of Piety, which not only <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi>

                        <p>Philip. 3.34.</p>
                     </note> but St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Carnality,</hi> not meaning a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Appetite, but a carnal Service. Their error was plainly this; they never distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished Duties natural from Duties relative; that is, whether it were commanded for it self, or in order to something that was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whether it were a principal Grace, or an instrumental Action. So God was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Letter, they did not much inquire into his Purpose. And therefore they were curious to wash their hands, but cared not so much to purifie the hearts; They would give Alms, but hate him that received it; they would go to the Temple, but did not revere the Glory of God that dwelt there between the Cherubins: they would fast, but not mortify their Lusts; they would say good Prayers, but not labour for the Grace they prayed for. This was just as if a man should run on his Masters errand, and do no business when he came there. They might easily have thought that by the Soul only a man approaches to God, and draws the Body after it, but that no wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or corporal Services could unite them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105896:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the <hi>Shechinah</hi> together, no such thing could make them like to God, who is the Prince of Spirits.* They did as the Dunces in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> School, who when their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had said, <hi>Fabis abstineto,</hi> by which he intended <hi>they should not ambitiously seek for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,</hi> they thought themselves good <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi> if they <hi>did not eat Beans</hi>; and they would be sure to put their Right foot first into the shooe, and their Left foot into the water, and supposed they had done enough, though if they had not been Fools they would have understood their Masters mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have been, that <hi>they should put more affections to labour and travel, and less to their pleasure and recreation</hi>; and so it was with the <hi>Pharisee.</hi> For as the <hi>Chaldees</hi> taught their Morality by mystick words, and the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> by Hieroglyphicks, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> by Fables; so did God by Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies external; leading them by the Hand to the Purities of the Heart; and by the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Body to the Obedience of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which because they would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, they thought they had done enough in the observation of the Letter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In moral Duties, where God express'd Himselfe more plainly, they made no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

of kindness; but regarded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition so nakedly, and divested of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, Consequents, Similitudes and Proportions, that if they stood clear of that hated name which was set down in <hi>Moses</hi> Tables, they gave themselves liberty in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances of the same kindred &amp; alliance. If they abstained from murder, they thought it very well, though they made no scruple of murdering their Brothers fame; they would not cut his throat, but they would call him Fool, or invent lyes in secret, and publish his disgrace openly; they would not dash out his brains, but they would be extremely and unreasonably angry with him; they would not steal their brothers money, but they would oppress him in crafty and cruel bargains. The Commandment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade them to commit Adultery, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Fornication was not named, they made no scruple of that; and being commanded to Honour their Father and their Mother, they would give them good words and fair observances, but because it was not named that they should maintain them in their need, they thought they did well enough to pretend <hi>Corban</hi> and let their Father starve.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105896:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> placed their Righteousness in Negatives; they would not commit what was forbidden; but they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but little for the included positive, and the omissions of good Actions did not much trouble them; they would not hurt their Brother in a forbidden instance, but neither would they do him good according to the intention of the Commandment; It was a great Innocence if they did not rob the Poor, then they were righteous men; but thought themselves not much concerned to acquire that god-like excellency, a <hi>Philanthropy</hi> and love to all mankind. Whosoever blasphem'd God was to be put to death; but he that did not glorifie God as he ought, they were unconcerned for him, and let him alone; he that spake against <hi>Moses</hi> was to dy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy; but against the ambitious and the covetous, against the proud man and the unmerciful they made no provisions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Virtus est vitium fugere, &amp; sapientia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</l>
                     <l>Stultitiâ caruisse.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>They accounted themselves good, not for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but for doing no evil; that was the sum of their Theology.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105896:12"/>4. They had one thing more as bad as all this. They broke <hi>Moses</hi> Tables into pieces, and gathering up the fragments took to themselves what part of Duty they pleased, and let the rest alone. For it was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb amongst the Jews, <hi>Qui operam dat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto, liber est à praecepto</hi>; that is, If he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses one positive Commandment for his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, he may be less careful in any of the rest. Indeed they said also, <hi>Qui multiplicat legem, multiplicat vitam</hi>; he that multiplies the Law, increases Life; that is, if he did attend to more good things, it was so much the better; but the other was well enough: but as for Universal Obedience, that was not the measure of their Righteousness; for they taught that God would put our good works and bad into the balance, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the heavier scale give a portion in the world to come: so that some evil they would allow to themselves and their Disciples; alwayes provided it was less than the good they did. They would devour Widows houses, and make it up by long Prayers; they would love their Nation and hate their Prince, offer Sacrifice and curse <hi>Caesar</hi> in their heart, advance Judaism and destroy Humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105896:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lastly, St. <hi>Austin</hi> summ'd up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Pharisaical and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical righteousness, in two words; <hi>Brevis differentia inter Legem &amp; Evangelium; timor &amp; amor.</hi> They serv'd the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the spirit of Fear, and we worship the Father of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in the spirit of Love, and by the spirit of Adoption; and as this Slavish principle of theirs was the cause of all their former Imperfections, so it finally and chiefly express'd it self in these two particulars. 1. They would do all that they thought they lawfully could do. 2. They would do nothing but what was expresly commanded.</p>
                  <p>This was the Righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sed Belzebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis callida Commenta Christus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struit.</hi>
                     </note> and their Disciples the Jews, which because our B. Saviour reproves, not only as imperfect then, but as criminal now, calling us on to a new Righteousness, the Righteousness of God, to the Law of the Spirit of Life, to the Kingdom of God and the proper Righteousness thereof, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us in the next place to look after the measures of this, ever remembring that it is infinitely necessary that we should do so; and men do not generally know, or not consider what it is to be a Christian; they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105896:13"/>
understand not what the Christian Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth or commandeth. But as for this in my Text, it is indeed our great measure: but it is not a question of good and better, but of Good and Evil, Life and Death, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Damnation; for unless our Righteousness be weighed by new weights, we shall be found too light, when God comes to weigh the actions of all the world: and unless we be more righteous than they, we <hi>shall in no wise,</hi> that is, upon no other terms in the world <hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning this, we shall do very much amiss, if we take our measures by the manners and practises of the many who call themselves Christians; for there are, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> expresses it, the <gap reason="foreign">

But I am sure that to bid defiance to the Laws of Christ, to laugh at Religion, to make a merriment at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and damnation of our Brother, is a state of evil worse than that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>: and yet even among such
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105896:14"/>
men how impatient would they be, and how unreasonable would they think you to be, if you should tell them, that there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent hopes or possibility that in this state they are in they can be saved.</p>

A right heart alone will not do it; or rather the heart is not right when the hand is wrong. <hi>If a man strikes his Neighbor, and says, Am not I in jest? It is folly and shame to him,</hi> said <hi>Solomon.</hi> For, once for all; Let us remember this, that Christianity is the most profitable, the most useful, and the most bountiful institution in the whole world, and the best definition I can give of it is this; It is the <hi>Wisdom of God brought down among us to do good to men</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not do less than the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who did the outward work; at least let us be sure to do all the work that is laid before us in the Commandments. And it is strange that this should be needful to be press'd amongst Christians whose Religion requires so very much more. But so it is, upon a pretence that we must serve God with the mind. Some are such fools as to think that it is enough to have a good meaning. <hi>Iniquum
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105896:15"/>
perpol verbum est, bene vult, nisi qui bene facit.</hi> And because we must serve God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, therefore they will not serve God with their Bodies; and because they are called upon to have the power and the life of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, they abominate all external works as mere forms; and because the true fast is to abstain from Sin, therefore they will not abstain from meat and drink, even when they are commanded; which is just as if a <hi>Pharisee</hi> being taught the Circumcision of the heart should refuse to Circumcise his Flesh; and as if a Christian, being instructed in the Excellencies of Spiritual Communion, should wholly neglect the Sacramental; that is, because the Soul is the life of man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fitting to die in a humour, and lay aside the Body. * This is a taking away the Subject of the Question; for our iniquiry is, How we should keep the Commandments; how we are to do the work that lyes before us, by what Principles, with what Intention, in what Degrees, after what manner, <hi>ut bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num bene fiat,</hi> that the good thing be done well. This therefore must be presupposed; we must take care that even our Bodies bear a part in our Spiritual Services. Our voice and tongue, our hands and our Feet, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105896:16"/>
our very bowels must be servants of God, and do the work of the Commandments.</p>
                  <p>This being ever supposed, our Question is, how much more we must do; and the first measure is this; Whatsoever can be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and ministred to by the Body, the Heart and the Spirit of a man must be the principal Actor. We must not give Alms without a charitable Soul, nor suffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom but in Love and in Obedience; and when we say our Prayers, we do but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our time unless our mind ascend up to God upon the wings of desire.</p>
                  <p>Desire is the life of prayer; and if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed desire what you pray for, you will also labour for what you desire; and if you find it otherwise with your selves, your coming to Church is but like the Pharisees going up to the Temple to pray. If your heart be not present, neither will God; and then there is a found of men and women between a pair of dead walls, from whence because neither God nor your Souls are present, you must needs go home without a Blessing.</p>
                  <p>But this measure of Evangelical righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is of principal remark in all the rites and solemnities of Religion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to say this, that Christian Religion is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105896:16"/>
something that is not seen, it is the hidden man of the heart; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>I will speak unto their heart</hi>; is a proverbial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, signifying to speak spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and in the mystical sense signifies <gap reason="foreign">

Our Service to God must not be in outward works and Scenes of Religion, it must be something by which we become like to God; the Divine Prerogative must extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the outward man; nay, even beyond the mortification of Corporal vices; the Spirit of God must go <hi>in trabis crassitudinem,</hi> and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all our secret pride, and ingenerate in us a true humility, and a Christian meekness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a Divine Charity. For in the Gospel, when God enjoyns any external Rite or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, the outward work is alwayes the less principal. For there is a bodily and a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part, an outside and a Cabinet of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105896:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Christianity it self. When we are baptized, the purpose of God is that we cleanse our selves from all pollution of the Flesh and Spirit, and then we are indeed <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, clean all over. And when we communicate, the Commandment means that we should be made one Spirit with Christ, and should live on him, believing his Word, praying for his Spirit, supported with his Hope, refreshed by his promises, recreated by his Comforts, and wholly and in all things conformable to his Life; that is the true Communion. The Sacraments are not made for Sinners until they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; they are the food of our Souls, but our Souls must be alive unto God, or else they cannot eat; It is good <hi>to confess our sins,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> sayes, and to open our wounds to the Ministers of Religion, but they absolve none but such as are truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>Solemn Prayers, and the Sacraments, and the Assemblies of the Faithful, and fasting dayes, and acts of external worship, are the solemnities and rites of Religion; but the Religion of a Christian is in the Heart and Spirit.

                     </gap>: all the parts &amp; faculties that make up a man, must make up our Religion; but the heart is <hi>Domus principalis,</hi> it is the Court of the great King; and he is properly served with interior graces and moral Vertues, with a humble and a good mind, with a bountiful heart, and a willing Soul, and these will command the eye, and give laws to the hand, and make the shoulders stoop, but <hi>anima cujusque est quisque</hi>; a mans soul is the man, and so is his Religion; and so you are bound to understand it.</p>
                  <p>True it is, God works in us his Graces by the Sacrament; but we must dispose our selves to a reception of the Divine blessing by Moral instruments. The Soul is <gap reason="foreign">

The sum is this: No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian does his Duty to God but he that serves him with all his heart: And although it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105896:18"/>
comes us to fulfil all righteousnes, even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal also; yet that which makes us gracious in his Eyes is not the external, it is the love of the heart and the real change of the mind and obedience of the spirit; that's the first great measure of the Righteousness Evangelical.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Righteousness Evangelical must exceed that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> by extension of our Obedience to things of the same signification;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Leges non ex verbis, sed ex mente intelligendas,</hi> sayes the Law. There must be a Commentary of kindness in the understanding the Laws of Christ. We must understand all Gods meaning; we must secure his service, we must be far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the dangers of his displeasure. And therefore our Rigteousness must be the purification and the perfection of the Spirit. So that it will be nothing for us not to commit Adultery, unless our Eyes and Hands be chast, and the desires be clean. A Christian must not look upon a woman to lust after her. He must hate Sin in all dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in all distance, and in every angle of its reception. A Christian must not sin, and he must not be willing to sin if he durst. He must not be lustful, and therefore he must not feed high, nor drink deep, for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105896:18"/>
these make provisions for lust: and amongst Christians, great eatings and drinkings are acts of uncleanness as well as of intemperance, and whatever ministers to sin, and is the way of it; it partakes of its nature and its curse.</p>
                  <p>For it is remarkable that in good and evil the case is greatly different. Mortification (<hi>e. g.</hi>) is a duty of Christianity; but there is no Law concerning the Instruments of it. We are not commanded to roll our selves on thorns, as St. <hi>Benedict</hi> did; or to burn our flesh, like St. <hi>Martinian</hi>; or to tumble in Snows with S. <hi>Francis</hi>; or in pools of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with S <hi>Bernard.</hi> A man may chew <hi>Aloes,</hi> or ly upon the ground, or wear sackcloth if he have a mind to it, and if he finds it good in his circumstances and to his purposes of mortification; but it may be he may do it alone by the Instrumentalities of Fear and Love; and so the thing be done, no special Instrument is under a command. * But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Instruments of vertue are free, yet the Instruments and ministeries of vice are not. Not only the sin is forbidden, but all the wayes that lead to it. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of vertue are of themselves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that is, not naturally, but good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their relation sake, and in order to their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105896:19"/>
end. But the Instruments of vice are of themselves vitious; they are part of the sin, they have a share in the phantastick plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and they begin to estrange a mans heart from God, and are directly in the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we are commanded to fly from temptation, to pray against it, <hi>to abstain from all appearances of evil,</hi> to make a covenant with our eyes, to pluck them out if there be need. And if Christians do not understand the Commandments to this extension of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, they will be innocent only by the measures of humane laws, but not by the righteousness of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the same consideration it is also that we understand Christs Commandments to extend our Duty, not only to what is named, and what is not named of the same nature and design; but that we abstain from all such things as are like to sins. * Of this nature there are many. All violences of Passion, Irregularities in Gaming, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of our time, Undecency of action, doing things unworthy of our Birth or our Profession, aptness to go to Law, <hi>Ambitus,</hi> or a fierce prosecution even of honourable employments; misconstruction of the words and actions of our brother; easiness to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105896:19"/>
evil of others, willingness to report the evil which we hear; curiosity of Dyet, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness toward servants, indiscreet and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune standing for place, and all excess in ornaments; for even this little instance is directly prohibited by the Christian and royal Law of Charity.

there be any irregularity that is less than a wrinkle, the Evangelical righteousness does not allow it. * These are such things which if men will stand to defend, possibly a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Reprover will be more ashamed than an impudent Offender. *If I see a person apt to quarrel, to take every thing in an ill sense, to resent an error deeply, to reprove it bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, to remember it tenaciously, to repeat it frequently, to upbraid it unhandsomly, I think I have great reason to say, that this person does not do what becomes the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Christian Spirit. If it be replied, It is no where forbidden to chide an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing person, and that it cannot be a fault to understand when a thing is said or done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. I cannot return an answer, but by saying, That suppose nothing of it were a sin, yet that every thing of it is so like a sin, that it is the worse for it; and that it were better not to do so; at least I think so, and so ought you too, if you be curious of your eternal interest: a little more tenderness here would do well, I cannot say that this dress, or this garment, or this standing for place is the direct sin of pride; but I am sure it looks like it in some persons; at least the letting it alone is much better, and is very
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105896:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like humility. And certain it is, that he is dull of hearing who understands not the voice of God, unless it be clamorous in an express and a loud Commandment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with Trumpets and Clarions upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; but a willing and an obedient ear understands the still voice of Christ, and is ready to obey his meaning at half a word; and that is the righteousness Evangelical. It not only abstains from Sins named, and sins implied, but from the beginnings and instruments of sin; and from whatsoever is like it. The Jews were so great haters of Swine upon pretensions of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> rites, that they would not so much as name a Swine, but called it <gap reason="foreign">

But know this, that in the righteousness Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, one duty cannot be exchang'd for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and three vertues will not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for one remaining vice.

                     </gap>, one said it of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: they obey the Laws, and by the goodness of their lives exceed the Laws; and certain it is, no man hath the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness Evangelical if he resolves alwayes to take all his liberty in every thing that is meerly lawful; or if he purpose to do no more than he must needs, that is, no more than he is just commanded. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are plain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Christian that resolves to do every thing that is lawful, will many times run into danger and inconvenience; because the utmost extremity of lawful is so near to that which is unlawful, that he will often pass into unlawful undiscernably. Vertues and Vices have not in all their instances a great land-mark set between them, like warlike nations separate by prodigious walls, vast seas and portentous hills; but they are oftentimes like the bounds of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105896:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men are fain to cut a cross upon the turf, and make little marks and annual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations for memorials: so it is in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unlawful, by a little mistake a man may be greatly ruined. He that drinks till his tongue is full as a spunge, and his speech a little stammering and tripping, hasty and disorderly, though he be not gone as far as drunkenness, yet he is gone beyond the severity of a Christian; and when he is just past into unlawful, if he disputes too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, he will certainly deceive himself for want of a wiser curiosity.</p>
                  <p>But 2. He that will do all that he thinks he may lawfully, had need have an infallible guide alwayes by him, who should without error be able to answer all cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which will happen every day in a life so careless and insecure; for if he should be mistaken, his error is his crime, and not his excuse. A man in this case had need be very sure of his Proportion; which because he cannot be, in charity to himself, he will quickly find that he is bound to abstain from all things that are uncertainly good, and from all disputable evils, from things which although they may be in themselves lawful, yet accidentally, and that from a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105896:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thousand cause may become unlawful, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidus quippe &amp; formidolosus est Ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>istianus,</hi> saith <hi>Salvian,— atque in tantum peccare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuens, ut interdum &amp; non timenda formidet.</hi> A Christian is afraid of every little thing: and he sometimes greatly fears that he hath sinned, even then when he hath no other reason to be afraid, but because he would not do so for all the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that resolves to use all his liberty cannot be innocent, so long as there are in the world so many bold temptations, and presumptuous actions, so many scandals, and so much ignorance in the things of God, so many things that are suspitious, and so many things that are of evil report; so many ill customs and disguises in the world, with which if we resolve to comply in all that is supposed lawful, a man may be in the regions of death, before he perceive his head to ake; and instead of a staff in his hand, may have a splinter in his Elbow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Besides all this; he that thus stands on his terms with God, and so carefully husbands his duty, and thinks to make so good a market of obedience, that he will quit nothing which he thinks he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep, shall never be exemplar in his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105896:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
life, and shall never grow in grace, and therefore shall never enter into glory. He therefore that will be righteous by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures Evangelical, must consider not only what is lawful, but what is expedient; not only what is barely safe, but what is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that which may secure, and that which may do advantage to that concern that is the greatest in the world.</p>
                  <p>And 2. The case is very like with them that resolve to do no more good than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. For 1. it is infinitely unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as to our eternal interest, because no man does do all that is commanded at all times; and therefore he that will not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do more, besides that he hath no love, no zeal of duty, no holy fires in his soul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, I say, he can never make any amends towards the reparation of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>Let him that stole steal no more</hi>; that's well; but that's not well enough, for he must, if he can, make restitution of what he stole, or he shall never be pardoned; and so it is in all our entercourse with God. To do what is commanded is the duty of the present; we are tyed to this in every present, in every period of our lives; but therefore if we never do any more than just the present
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105896:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duty, who shall supply the deficiences, and fill up the gaps, and redeem what is past? This is a material consideration in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>But then 2. we must know that in keeping of Gods Commandments every degree or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duty is under the Commandments; and therefore whatever we do, we must do it as well as we can. Now he that does his Duty with the biggest affection he can, will also do all that he can; and he can never know that he hath done what is commanded, unless he does all that is in his power. For God hath put no limit but love and possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and therefore whoever says, Hither will I go and no further, This I will do and no more, Thus much will I serve God, but that shall be all, he hath the affections of a Slave, and the religion of a Pharisee, the craft of a Merchant, and the falseness of a Broker; but he hath not the proper measures of the righteousness Evangelical. But so it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the mud and slime of the River <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borus,</hi> when the eye of the Sun hath long dwelt upon it, and produces Frogs and Mice which begin to move a little under a thin cover of its own parental matter, and if they can get loose to live half a life, that is all; but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105896:25"/>
the hinder parts, which are not formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the setting of the Sun, stick fast in their beds of mud, and the little moyety of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dies before it could be well said to live; so it is with those Christians, who will do all that they think lawful, and will do no more than what they suppose necessary; they do but peep into the light of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; they have the beginnings of life; but their hinder parts, their passions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the desires of the lower man are still unformed; and he that dwells in this state is just so much of a Christian as a Spunge is of a plant, and a mushrom of a shrub: they may be as sensible as an oyster, and discourse at the rate of a child, but are greatly short of the righteousness Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with those parts of the Christian righteousness, which were not only an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or excess, but an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the Pharisaical: but because I ought not to conceal any thing from you that must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate our duty, and secure our title to the kingdom of Heaven; there is this to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that this precept of our blessed Saviour is to be extended to the direct degrees of our duty. We must do more duties, and we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105896:26"/>
must do them better. And in this, although we can have no positive measures, because they are potentially infinite, yet therefore we ought to take the best, because we are sure the greatest is not too big; and we are not sure that God will accept a worse, when we can do a better. Now although this is to be understood of the internal affection only; because that must never be abated, but God is at all times to be loved and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with all our heart, yet concerning the degrees of external duty, as Prayers, and Alms, and the like, we are certainly tyed to a greater excellency in the degree, than was that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> I am obliged to speak one word for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> to how much more of external duty Christians are obliged, than was in the righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> In order to this, briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Salvian</hi> speaking of old men summing up their Repentances, and making amends for the sins of their whole life, exhorts them to Alms and works of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. But inquiring how much they should do towards the redeeming of their Souls, answers with a little Sarcasm, but plainly enough to give a wise man an answer. <q>A
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105896:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man, says he, is not bound to give away all his goods, unless peradventure he ows all to God; but in that case I cannot tell what to say; for then the case is altered. A man is not bound to part with all his estate; that is, unless his sins be greater than his estate; but if they be, then he may consider of it again, and consider better. And he need not part with it all, unless pardon be more precious to him than his money, and unless heaven be worth it all, and unless he knows justly how much less will do it. If he does, let him try his skill, and pay just so much and no more than he owes to God: but if he does not know, let him be sure to do enough.</q> His meaning is this. Not that a man is bound to give all he hath, and leave his children beggars; he is bound from that by another obligation. But as when we are tyed to pray continually, the meaning is, we should consecrate all our time by taking good portions out of all our time for that duty; the devoutest person being like the waters of <hi>Siloam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>S. Hier. in comment.</hi> Isai. 8. <hi>Isidor, l.</hi> 13. <hi>Orig. cap.</hi> 13.</note> a perpetual spring, but not a perpetual current; that is alwayes in readiness, but actually thrusting forth his waters at certain periods every day.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105896:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So out of all our estate we must take for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Repentance such portions as the whole estate can allow; so much as will consecrate the rest; so much as is fit to bring when we pray for a great pardon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate a mighty anger, and turn aside an intolerable fear, and will purchase an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent peace, and will reconcile a sinner: Now in this case a Christian is to take his measures according to the rate of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and his love, his Religion and his fear, his danger and his expectation, and let him measure his amends wisely; his sorrow pouring in, and his fear thrusting it down, and it were very well, if his love also would make it run over. For deceive not your selves, there is no other measure but this. So much good as a man does, or so much as he would do, if he could, so much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and so much of repentance he hath, and no more: and a Man cannot ordinarily know that he is in a saveable condition, but by the Testimony which a Divine Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a good mind alwayes gives, which is to omit no opportunity of doing good in our several proportions and possibilities.</p>
                  <p>There was an Alms which the Scribes and Pharisees were obliged by the Law to

                  <p>I have many more things to say, but ye cannot hear them now, because the time is past.

Christian Parliaments must exceed the Religion and Government of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> Your Laws must be more holy, the condition of the Subjects be made more tolerable, the Laws of Christ must be strictly enforced, you must not suffer your great Master to be dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

nor his Religion dismembred by Sects, or disgraced by impiety: you must give no impunity to vitious persons, and you must take care that no great example be greatly corrupted; you must make better provisions for your poor than they did, and take more care even of the external advantages of Christs Religion and his Ministers, than they did of the Priests and Levites; that is, in all things you must be more zealous to promote the kingdom of Christ, than they were for the Ministeries of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sum of all is this; The righteousness Evangelical is the same with that which the Ancients called <gap reason="foreign">

You cannot entertain your friend but excess is the measure; and that you may be very kind to your Guest, you step aside and lay away the Christian; your love cannot be expressed unless you do him an ill turn, and civilly invite him to a Feaver. Justice is too often taught to bow to great interests, and men cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery; and there are some Trades that minister to sin, so that without a sin we cannot maintain our Families; and if you mean to live, you must do as others do.

Fain they would but cannot tell how to help it. But since it is no better, it is well it is no worse. For it is <hi>S.

Truth can do us no hurt, and therefore be willing to let this matter pass under examination; for if it trouble us now, it will bring comfort hereafter. And therefore before I enter into the main inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I shall by describing the state of the man, of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks here, tell you plainly, who it is that is in this state of sad things, and then do ye make your resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according as you shall find it necessary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105896:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the saving of your souls; which I am sure ought to be the end of all preaching.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The man S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of is one that is <hi>dead,</hi> v. 9. one that was <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>slain,</hi> v. 11. one in whom <hi>sin was exceeding sinful,</hi> v. 13. that is, highly imputed, greatly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, infinitely destructive: he is one who is <hi>carnal, and sold under sin,</hi> v. 14. he is one that sins against his <hi>conscience</hi> and his <hi>reason,</hi> v. 16. he is one in whom <hi>sin dwells</hi> but the Spirit of God does not dwell; for <hi>no good thing dwels in him,</hi> v. 18. he is one who is <hi>brought into captivity to the law of sin,</hi> he is a servant of uncleanness, with his flesh and members serving the law of sin, v. 25. Now if this be a state of regeneration, I wonder what is, or can be a state of reprobation! for though this be the state of Nature, yet it cannot be the state of one redeemed by the Spirit of Christ; and therefore flatter not your selves any more, that it is enough for you to have good desires, and bad perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: never think that any sin can reign in you, and yet you be servants of God: that sin can dwell in you, and at the same time the Spirit of God can dwell in you too; or that life and death can abide together. The sum of affairs is this.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note>

                  <p>My Text is one of the hard places of S. <hi>Paul</hi>; which, as <hi>S.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105896:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the end of Christs coming, and cannot be in vain unless we make it so. He came to bless us by turning every one of us from our iniquities. Now concerning this, besides the evidence of the thing itself, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> does not speak these words of himself, but by a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But for the stating of this great case of conscience, I shall first in short describe to you what are the proper causes which place men, and keep them in this state of a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sinning; and 2. I shall prove the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity of coming out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and quitting all our sin. 3. In what degree this is to be affected. 4. By what Instruments this is to be done; and all these
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105896:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being practical will of themselves be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent use to the Doctrines, and need no other applicatory but a plain exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What are the causes of this evil, by which we are first placed, and so long kept in a necessity of sinning, so that we cannot do what good we would, nor avoid the evil that we hate?</p>
                  <p>The first is the evil state of our Nature. And indeed he that considers the dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of his own weak Nature, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inconstancy of his soul being like a sick mans legs, or the knees of Infants, reeling and unstable by disease or by infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the perpetual leaven and germina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the thrustings forth, and swelling of his senses, running out like new wine into vapours and intoxicating activities, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confess, that though even in nature there may be many good inclinations to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances of the Divine Commandments; yet it can go no further than this <hi>velleity,</hi> this desiring to do good, but is not able. And upon this account it is that <hi>Lactantius</hi> brings in the Pagan or natural man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <hi>Volo equidem non peccare, sed vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, indutus enim sum carne fragili &amp; imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillà.</hi> This is very true; and I adde only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105896:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this caution. There is not in the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature so much as will save us harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, or make us excusable if we sin against God. Natural corruption can make us criminal, but not innocent; for though by him that willingly abides in the state of mere nature, sin cannot be avoided, yet no man is in that state longer than he loves to be so; for the Grace of God came to rescue us from this evil portion, and is alwayes present to give us a new nature, and create us over again: and therefore though sin is made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the natural man by his impotency and fond loves, that is by his unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nature, yet in the whole constitution of affairs, God hath more then made it up by his Grace, if we will make use of it. <hi>In pueris elucet spes plurimorum, quae ubi emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur aetate, manifestum est non defecisse naturam, sed curam,</hi> said <hi>Quintilian.</hi> We cannot tell what we are, or what we think in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and when we can know our thoughts we can easily observe that we have learned evil things by evil examples, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners of an evil conversation: <hi>&amp; ubi per socordiam vires, tempus, ingenium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxêre, naturae infirmitas accusatur</hi>; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is too true; we grow lazy, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105896:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and we lose our time, and abuse our parts, and do ugly things, and lay the fault wholly upon our natural infirmities; but we must remember that by this time it is a state of Nature, a state of flesh and blood, which cannot enter into Heaven. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man and the natural child are not the same thing in true Divinity. The natural child indeed can do no good; but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man cannot choose but do evil; but it is because he will do so; he is not born in the second bir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h, and renewed in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have brought our selves into an accidental necessity of sinning by the evil principles which are sucked in by great parts of mankind. We are taught ways of going to Heaven without forsaking our sins; of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without restitution; of being in charity without hearty forgiveness, and without love; of believing our sins to be pardoned before they are mortified; of trusting in Christs death without conformity to his life; of being in Gods fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur upon the only account of being of such an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that when we are once in, we can never be out. We are taught to believe that the events of things do not depend upon our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105896:35"/>
crucifying our evil and corrupt affections, but upon eternal and unalterable Counsels; that the promises are not the rewards of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but graces pertaining only to a few praedestinates, and yet men are Saints for all that; and that the Laws of God are of the race of the Giants, not to be observed by any grace or by any industry, this is the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism of the ignorant and the prophane: but without all peradventure the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are the way to make the world bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but certainly they that believe these things do not believe it necessary that we should eschew all evil: and no wonder then if when men upon these accounts slacken their industry and their care, they find sin still prevailing, still dwelling within them, and still unconquerable by so slight and disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned labours. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. To our weak and corrupted nature, and our foolish discourses, men do dayly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce evil habits and customs of sinning. <hi>Consuetudo mala tanquam hamus infixus animae,</hi> said the Father; an evil custom is a hook in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105896:35"/>
the soul, and draws it whither the Devil pleases. When it comes to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s word is, <hi>a heart exercised with covetous practices,</hi> then it is also <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it is weak and unable to do the good it fain would, or to avoid the evil which in a good fit it pretends to hate. This is so known I shall not insist upon it; but adde this only, that wherever a habit is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it is all one what the instance be; it is as easie as delicious, as unalterable in vertue as in vice; for what helps nature brings to a vitious habit, the same and much more the Spirit of God, by his power and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts can do in a vertuous; and then we are well again. You see by this who are, and why they are in this evil condition. The evil natures, and the evil principles, and the evil manners of the world, these are the causes of our imperfect willings, and weaker actings in the things of God; and as long as men stay here, sin will be unavoidable. For even meat it self is loathsom to a sick sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; and it is impossible for him that is heart-sick to eat the most wholsom diet; and yet he that shall say eating is impossible, will be best confuted by seeing all the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men in the world eat heartily every day.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105896:36"/>2. But what then? Cannot sin be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Cannot a Christian mortifie the deeds of the body? Cannot Christ redeem us, and cleanse us from all our sins? Cannot the works of the Devil be destroyed? That's the next particular to be inquired of. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be not necessary, and therefore very possible for a servant of God to pass from this evil state of things, and not only hate evil, but avoid it also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that saith he hath not sinned is a lyar</hi>; but what then? Because a Man hath sinned, it does not follow he must do so always. <hi>Hast thou sinned? do so no more</hi> (said the wise <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirach</hi>) and so said Christ to the poor Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, <hi>Go and sin no more.</hi> They were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words spoken by a holy Prophet [<hi>Let not the sinner say he hath not sinned; For God shall burn coals of fire upon his head, that saith before the Lord God and his glory, I have not sinned.</hi>] Well! that case is confessed. <hi>All men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</hi> But is there no remedy for this? Must it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be so, and sin for ever must have the upper hand, and for ever baffle our resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all our fierce and earnest promises of amendment? God forbid; there was a time then to come, and, blessed be God, it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105896:36"/>
hath been long come [<hi>Yet a little while</hi> (saith that Prophet) <hi>and iniquity shall be taken out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign among you.</hi>] For, that's in the day, of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the manifestation of the Gospel: when Christ reigns in our hearts by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Dagon and the Ark cannot stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we cannot serve Christ and <hi>Belial.</hi> And as in the state of nature no good thing dwells within us, so when Christ rules in us, no evil thing can abide. <hi>For every plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up,</hi> and cast away into the fires of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption or purification. But how shall this come to pass, since we all find our selves so infinitely weak and foolish? I shall tell you. <hi>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> said Christ. It is impossible to nature, it is impossible to them that are given to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is impossible for them that delight in the evil snare. But Christ adds; <hi>With men this is impossible, but with God all things are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> What we cannot do for our selves, God can do for us and with us. What Nature cannot do, the Grace of God can. So that the thing may be done, not indeed by our selves, but <hi>gratia Dei mecum,</hi> saith
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105896:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi>; God and man together can do it. But if it can be done any way that God hath put into our powers, the consequent is this; No mans good will shall be taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the real and actual mortification of his sins. He that sins, and would fain not sin, but sin is present with him whether he will or no, let him take heed; for the same is <hi>the Law of sin,</hi> and <hi>the Law of death</hi> (saith the Apostle) and that mans heart is not right with God. For it is impossible men should pray for deliverance and not be heard, that they should labour and not be prosperous, unless they pray amiss, and labour falsely. Let no man therefore please himself with talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great things, with perpetual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in pious discourses, or with ineffective desires of serving God. He that does not practise as well as he talks, and do what he desires, and what he ought to do, confesses himself to sin greatly against his conscience; and it is a prodigious folly to think that he is a good man, because though he does sin, yet it was against his mind to do so. A mans conscience can never condemn him, if that be his excuse, to say that his conscience checkt him; and that will be but a sad apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy at the day of Judgement. Some men
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105896:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
talk like Angels, and pray with great fervor, and meditate with deep recesses, and speak to God with loving affections, and words of union, and adhere to him in silent devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when they go abroad are as passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as ever, peevish as a frighted Fly, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with their own reflexions. They are cruel in their bargains, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their tenants, and proud as a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Prince. They are for all their fine words impatient of reproof, scornful to their Neighbours, lovers of money, supream in their own thoughts, and submit to none; all their spiritual life they talk of, is nothing but spiritual fancy and illusion: they are still under the power of their passions, and their sin rules them imperiously, and carries them away infallibly. Let these men consider; there are some men think it impossible to do as much as they do. The common swearer cannot leave that vice and talk well; and these men that talk thus well, think they cannot do as well as they talk; but both of them are equally under the power of their respective sins, and are equally deceived, and equally not the servants of God. * This is true; but it is equally as true; that there is no necessity for all this; for it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105896:38"/>
ought, and it may be otherwise if we please. For I pray be pleased to hear S. <hi>Paul. Walk in the Spirit,</hi>

That is plainly, As there is a state of carnality (of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in my Text) so that in that state a man cannot but obey the flesh: so there is also a state of spirituality, when sin is dead, and righteousness is alive; and in this state the flesh can no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, than the Spirit could do in the other. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> Some men cannot choose but sin; for <hi>the carnal mind is not subject to God, neither indeed can be</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>;) but there are also some men, that cannot endure any thing that is not good. It is a great pain for a temperate man to suffer the disorders of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness, and the shames of Lust are intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a chaste and modest person. This also is affirmed by <hi>S. John,</hi>

We may see something of this in common experiences. What man of ordinary prudence and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can be tempted to steal, or for what price would he be tempted to murder his friend?

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the saying of S. <hi>Paul, Christ came to redeem to himself a Church, and to present it pure and spotless before the Throne of Grace</hi>; and if you mean to be of this number, you must endeavour to be under this qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, (as <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to be) <hi>void of offence both towards God, and towards Man.</hi> And so I have done with the second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; It is necessary that all sin great and little should be mortified and dead in us, and that we no longer abide in that state of slavery as to say, <hi>The good that I would, I do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the next place we are to inquire in what degree this is to be effected; for though in negatives properly there are no degrees, yet unless there be some allays in this Doctrine, it will not be so well, and it may be your experiences will for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my Arguments. For <hi>who can say that he is clean from his sin</hi>? (said the Wiseman) and as our Blessed Saviour said, <hi>He that is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105896:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amongst you all, let him throw the first stone at the sinner</hi> and spare not.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer in the words of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi> All mans righteousness will be found to be unrighteous, if God should severely enter into judgment; but therefore even after our innocence we must pray for pardon, <hi>ut quae succumbere discussa poterat, ex judicis pietate convalescat,</hi> that our innocence which in strictness of Divine judgment would be found spotted and stained, by the mercy of our Saviour may be accepted. <hi>S. Bernard</hi> expresses this well. <hi>Nostra siqua est humilis justitia, recta forsitan sed non pura.</hi> Our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble righteousness is perhaps right in the eyes of God, but not pure, that is, accepted by his mercy, but it is such as dares not contend in judgment. For as no man is so much a sinner, but he sometimes speaks a good word, or does some things not ill; and yet that little good interrupts not that state of evil: so it is amongst very good men, from whom sometimes may pass something that is not commendable; and yet their heart is so habitually right towards God, that they will do nothing but (I do not say which God in justice cannot, but) which in mercy he will not impute to eternal condemnation,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105896:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It was the case of <hi>David; He was a man after Gods own heart</hi>; nay it is said, <hi>he was blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less save in the matter of</hi> Uriah; and yet we know he numbred the people, and God was angry with him and punished him for it: but because he was a good man and served God heartily, that other fault of his was imputed to him no further: God set a fine upon his head for it, but it was <hi>salvo conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemento,</hi> the main stake was safe.</p>
                  <p>For concerning good men the question is not whether or no God could not in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of justice blame their indiscretion, or impute a foolish word, or chide them for a hasty answer; or a careless action, for a less devout prayer, or weak hands, for a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, or a trembling faith. These are not the measures by which God judges his children; <hi>for he knoweth whereof we are made, and he remembers that we are but dust.</hi> But the question is, whether any man that is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or proud, false to his trust, or a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, can at the same time be a child of God? No certainly he cannot. But then we know that God judges us by Jesus Christ, that is, with the allays of mercy, with an eye of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with the sentences of a Father, by the measures of a man, and by analogy to all our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105896:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unavoidable abatements. God could enter with us into a more severe judgment, but he would not; and no justice tied him from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising that mercy. But according to the measures of the Gospel, <hi>he will judge every man according to his works.</hi> Now what these measures are is now the question. To which I answer first in general, and then more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In general thus. A Christians inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is always to be measured by the plain lines and measures of the Commandments; but are not to be taken into account by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and fond opinions, and the scruples of zealous and timorous persons. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this. Some men tell us that every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination to a forbidden object is a sin; which they that believe, finding them to be natural, do also confess that such sins are unavoidable. But if these natural and first motions be sins, then a man sins whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he resist them, or resists them not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he prevails, or prevails not; and there is no other difference but this; he that fights not against, but always yields to his desires, sins greatest; and he that never yields but fights always, sins oftenest. But then, by this reckoning it will indeed be impossible to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105896:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
avoid millions of sins; because the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our duty does suppose a sin. If God should impute such first desires to us as sins, we were all very miserable; but if he does not impute them, let us trouble our selves no further about them, but to take care that they never prevail upon us. Thus men are taught that they never say their prayers, but they commit a sin. Indeed that is true but too often; but yet it is possible for us by the Grace of God to please him in saying our prayers, and to be accepted of him. But indeed if God did proceed against us as we do against one another, no man could abide innocent for so much as one hour. But Gods judgement is otherwise: He inquires if the heart be right, if our labour be true, if we love no sin, if we use prudent and efficacious instruments to mortifie our sin, if we go about our Religion as we go about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest concerns of our life; if we be sincere and real in our actions and intentions. For this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that God requires of us all; this is that sinless state, in which if God does not find us, we shall never see his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious face, and if he does find us, we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be saved by the blood of Jesus. For in the style of Scripture to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:105896:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the same thing; to be sincere, and to be without offence is all one. Thus <hi>David</hi> spake heartily, <hi>I am utterly purpos'd that my mouth shall not offend; and thou shalt find no wickedness in me.</hi> He that endeavours this, and hopes this, and does actions, and uses means accordingly, not being deceived by his own false heart, nor abused by evil propositions, this man will stand upright in the Congregations of the Just; and though he cannot challenge Heaven by merit, yet he shall receive it as a gift, by promise and by grace. <hi>Lex nos innocentes esse jubet, non cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosos,</hi> said <hi>Seneca.</hi> For God takes no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us by any measures; but of the Commandment without, and the heart and the conscience within; but he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Laws to be a snare to us, or to entrap us with consequences and dark interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by large deductions and witty simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of faults; but he requires of us a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart and a hearty labour in the work of his Commandments: he calls upon us to avoid all that which his Law plainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, and which our consciences do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. This is the general measure. The particulars are briefly these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Every Christian is bound to arrive
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105896:43"/>
at that state, that he have remaining in him no habit of any sin whatsoever. Our old man must be crucified; the body of sin must be destroyed; he must no longer serve sin; sin shall not have the dominion over you. All these are the Apostles words; that is plainly, as I have already declared, you must not be at that pass, that though ye would avoid sin ye cannot. For he that is so, is a most perfect slave, and Christs freed man cannot be so. Nay, he that loves sin, and delights in it, hath no liberty indeed, but he hath more shew of it, than he that obeys it against his will.

                     </q>
He that loves to be in the place, is a less prisoner, than he that is confined against his will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that commits any one sin by choice and deliberation is an enemy to God, and is under the dominion of the flesh. In the case of deliberate sins one act does give the denomination; he is an Adulterer that so much as once foully breaks the holy Laws of Marriage. <hi>He that offends in one is guilty
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105896:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all,</hi> saith S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Peters</hi> Denial, and <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery had passed on to a fatal issue, if the mercy of God, and a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance had not interceded. But they did so no more, and so God restored them to Grace and Pardon. And in this sense are the words of S. <hi>John, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he that does a sin is of the Devil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> and <hi>he that is born of God <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a sin</hi>; he chooses none, he loves none, he endures none, <hi>talia quae non faciet bonae fidei &amp; spei Christianus</hi>; they do no great sin, and love no little one. A sin chosen and deliberately done, is, as <hi>Tertullians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is, <hi>crimen devoratorium salutis</hi>; it devours salvation. For as there are some sins which can be done but once; as a man can kill his Father but once, or himself but once; so in those things which can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, a perfect choice is equivalent to a habit, it is the same in principle, that a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is in the product. In short he is not a child of God, that knowingly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately chooses anything that God hates.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every Christian ought to attain to such a state of life, as that he never sin, not only by a long deliberation, but also not by passion. I do not say that he is not a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105896:44"/>
good Christian, who by passion is suddenly surpriz'd and falls into folly; but this I say, that no passion ought to make him choose a sin. For let the sin enter by anger or by desire, it is all one, if the consent be gain'd. It is an ill sign if a man, though on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, consents to a base action. Thus far every good man is tied, not only to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but to prevail against his Sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is one step more; which if it be not actually effected, it must at least be greatly endeavour'd; and the event be left to God: and that is, that we strive for so great a dominion over our sins and lust, as that we be not surpriz'd on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. This indeed is a work of time, and it is well if it be ever done; but it must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be endeavoured. But in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, even good men are sometimes unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous. <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> grew once into choler, and they past too far, and lost more then their argument, they lost their reason, and they lost their patience: and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> wished that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> might not die a Bishop; and he in a peevish exchange wished that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might never return to his <hi>Bishoprick</hi>; when they had forgotten their foolish anger, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105896:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, and said <hi>Amen</hi> to both their cursed speakings. Nay, there is yet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er example of humane frailty. S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were very holy persons, but once in a heat they were both to blame, they were peevish and parted company. This was not very much: but God was so displeased, even for this little Fly in their Box of Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that their story sayes, they never saw one anothers face again. These earnest emissions and transportations of passion do sometime declare the weakness of good men; but that even here we ought at least to endeavour to be more than Conquerors appears in this, because God allows it not, and by punishing such follies does manifest that he intends that we should get victory over our suddain passions, as well as our natural lusts. And so I have done with the third inquiry, in what degree God expects our innocence; and now I briefly come to the last particular, which will make all the rest practicable; I am now to tell you how all this can be effected, and how we shall get free from the power and dominion of our sins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The first great instrument is Faith. He that hath Faith like a grain of Mustard
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105896:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seed can remove mountains; the mountains of sin shall fall flat at the feet of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, and shall be removed into the sea, the Sea of Christs blood and penitential waters. <hi>Faith overcometh the world,</hi> saith S. <hi>John</hi>; and <hi>walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh</hi>: there are two of our enemies gone; the world and the flesh, by Faith and the Spirit, by the Spirit of Faith; and as for the Devil, <hi>put on the shield of Faith,</hi> and <hi>resist the Devil, and he will flee from you,</hi> saith the Apostle; and the powers of sin seem insuperable to none, but to them that have not Faith; we do not believe that God intends we should do what he seems to require of us; or else we think that though Gods grace abounds, yet sin must superabound expresly against the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or else we think that the evil spirit is stronger than the good Spirit of God. Hear what <hi>S. John</hi> saith, <hi>My little children, ye are of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 Joh. 4.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and have overcome the evil one; for the Spirit that is in you is greater than that which is in the world.</hi> Believest thou this? If you do, I shall tell you what may be the event of it. When the father of the boy, possessed with the Devil, told his sad story to Christ;<note place="margin">Mark 9.23.</note> he said; <hi>Master if thou canst do
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105896:45"/>
any thing, I pray help me.</hi> Christ answered him, <hi>If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</hi> N. B. And therefore if you do believe this, go to your prayers, and go to your guards, and go to your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and try what God will do for you. For whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye shall receive them, and ye shall have them. Now consider; Do not we every day pray in the Divine Hymn called <hi>Te Deum, Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin</hi>? And in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect at morning prayer, [<hi>and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger, but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do alwayes that which is righteous in thy sight</hi>?] Have you any hope, or any faith when you say that Prayer? And if you do your duty as you can, do you think the failure will be on Gods part? Fear not that; if you can trust in God, and do accordingly; <hi>though your sins were as scarlet, yet they shall be as white as snow,</hi> and pure as the feet of the holy Lamb. Only let us forsake all those weak propositions which cut the nerves of faith, and make it impossible for us to actuate all our good desires, or to come out from the power of sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:105896:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. He that would be free from the slavery of Sin, and the necessity of sinning must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes watch. I, that's the point; but who can watch alwayes? Why every good man can watch alwayes: and that we may not be deceived in this, let us know, that the running away from a temptation is a part of our watchfulness, and every good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is another great part of it, and a laying in provisions of Reason and Religion before hand, is yet a third part of this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; and the conversation of a Christian is a perpetual watchfulness; not a continual thinking of that one, or those many things which may indanger us; but it is a continual doing something directly or indirectly against sin. He either prayes to God for his Spirit, or relies upon the promises, or receives the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or goes to his Bishop for Counsel and a Blessing, or to his Priest for Religious offices, or places himself at the feet of good men to hear their wise sayings, or calls for the Churches prayers, or does the duty of his calling, or actually resists Temptation, or frequently renews his holy Purposes, or fortifies himself by Vows, or searches into his Danger by a daily examination; so that in the whole he is for ever upon his guards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:105896:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>* This duty and caution of a Christian is like watching lest a man cut his finger. Wise men do not often cut their fingers, and yet every day they use a knife; and a mans eye is a tender thing, and every thing can do it wrong, and every thing can put it out; yet because we love our eyes so well, in the midst of so many dangers, by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and a prudent natural care, by wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when any thing comes against them, and by turning aside when a blow is offered, they are preserved so certainly, that not one man in ten thousand does by a stroak lose one of his eyes in all his life time. If we would transplant our natural care to a spiritual caution, we might by Gods grace be kept from losing our souls, as we are from losing our eyes; and because a perpetual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness is our great defence, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual presence of Gods grace is our great security, and that this Grace never leaves us, unless we leave it, and the precept of a dayly watchfulness is a thing not only so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, but so many easy wayes to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, we see upon what terms we may be quit of our sins, and more than Conquerors over all the enemies &amp; impediments of Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you would be in the state of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105896:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> that is, that you may not be servants of sin in any instance; be sure in the mortifications of sin, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or carelesly to leave no remains of it, no nest-egg, no principles of it, no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it; if any thing remains, it will prove to us as Manna to the sons of <hi>Israel</hi> on the second day, <hi>it will breed worms and stink.</hi> Therefore labour against every part of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every proposition that gives it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; pray to God against it all; and what then? Why then, <hi>Ask and you shall have</hi> (said Christ.) Nay, say some; it is true; you shall be heard; but in part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for God will leave some remains of sin within us, lest we should become proud by being innocent. So vainly do men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against Gods goodness and their own blessings and Salvation, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> sayes) they contrive witty arts to undo themselves, being intangled in the periods of ignorant disputations. But as to the thing it self, if by the remains of sin they mean the propensities and natural inclinations to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden objects; there is no question but they will remain in us so long as we bear our flesh about us; and surely that is a great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105896:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
argument to make us humble. But these are not the sins which God charges on his people. But if by remains we mean any part of the habit of sin, any affection, any malice or perverseness of the Will; then it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to say that God leaves in us such remains of Sin, lest by innocence we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proud. For how should Pride spring in a mans heart, if there be no remains of Sin left? And is it not the best, the surest way to cure the Pride of our hearts by taking out every root of bitterness, even the root of Pride it self? Will a Physician purposely leave the Reliques of a disease. and pretend he does it to prevent a relapse? And is it not more likely he will relapse, if the sickness be not wholly cured? * But besides this; If God leaves any remains of Sin in us, what remains are they, and of what sins? Does he leave the remains of Pride? If so; that were a strange cure to leave the remains of Pride in us to keep us from being proud. But if not so; but that all the remains of Pride be taken away by the grace of God blessing our endeavours; what danger is there of being proud, the remains of which Sin are by the grace of God wholly taken away? But then, if the Pride of the heart
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105896:48"/>
be cured, which is the hardest to be remov'd, and commonly is done last of all, who can distrust the power of the Spirit of God, or his goodness, or his promises, and say that God does not intend to cleanse his Sons and Servants from all unrighteousness; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer, <hi>keep their bodies and souls, and spirits, unblameable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jesus.</hi> But however, let God leave what remains he please; all will be well enough on that side, but let us be careful, as far as we can, that we leave none: lest it be severely imputed to us, and the fire break out and consume us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us without any further question, put this argument to a material issue; let us do all that we can do, towards the destruction of the whole body of sin; but let us never say we cannot be quit of our Sin till we have done all that we can do towards the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it. For till that be done, how can any man tell where the fault lies, or whether it can be done or no. If any man can say that he hath done all that he could do, and yet hath failed of his duty; if he can say truly, that he hath endured as much as is possible to be endured, that he hath watched alwayes, and never nodded, when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105896:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he could avoid it, that he hath loved as much as he could love, that he hath waited till he can wait no longer; then indeed, if he sayes true, we must confess that it is not to be understood. But is there any man in the World that does all that he can do? If there be, that man is blameless; if there be not, then he cannot say but it is his own fault that his sin prevails against him. It is true that no man is free from sin; but it is as true, that no man does as much as he can against it: and therefore no man must go about to excuse himself by saying, no man is free from his sin; and therefore no man can be; no not by the powers of grace: for he may as well argue thus, No man does do all that he can do against it; and therefore it is impossible he should do what he can do. The argument is apparently foolish, and the excuse is weak, and the deception visible, and sin prevails upon our weak arguings; but the consequence is plainly this. When any man commits a sin, he is guilty before God; and he cannot say he could not help it, and God is just in punishing every sin, and very merciful when he forgives us any: but he that sayes he cannot avoid it, that he cannot overcome his lust, confesses himself a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105896:49"/>
servant of Sin, and that he is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of the Holy Lamb.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He that would be advanced beyond the power and necessity of sinning must take great caution concerning his thoughts and secret desires. <hi>For lust when it is conceived bringeth forth sin</hi>; but if it be suppressed in the conception, it comes to nothing: but we find it hard to destroy the Serpent when the egg is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To sum up all, every good man is a new Creature, and Christianity is not so much a Divine institution, as a Divine frame and temper of Spirit, which if we heartily pray for, and endeavour to obtain, we shall find it as hard and as uneasie to sin against God, as now we think it impossible to abstain from our most pleasing sins. For as it is in the Spermatick vertue of the heavens, which diffuses it self Universally upon all sublunary bodies, and subtilly insinuating it self into the most dull and unactive Element produces Gold and Pearls; Life and motion, and brisk activities in all things that can receive the influence and heavenly blessing; so it is in the Holy Spirit of God, and the word of God and the grace of God, which <hi>S.

Certainly both of them; but neither of them have been well understood; insomuch that they have not only made divisions of heart among the faithful, but one party relies on faith to the disparagement of good life; and the other makes works to be the main ground of our hope and confidence, and consequently to exclude the efficacy of faith. The one makes Christian Religion a lazy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active institution; and the other, a bold presumption on our selves; while the first tempts us to live like Heathens, and the other recals us to live the life of Jews, while one sayes <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and another, <hi>I am of S.

                  <p>My purpose is not with subtile arts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them that never disagreed; the two Apostles spake by the same Spirit, and to the same last design, though to differing intermedial purposes; but because the great end of Faith, the design, the definition, the State, the Oeconomy of it, is that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers should not live according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit; before I fall to the close handling of the Text, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise some preliminary considerations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way of holiness, to explicate the differing senses of the Apostles, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the question and the duty, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the causes of the vulgar mistakes of most men in this Article, and then proceed to the main inquiry.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105896:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much that in the Latin Concordances of <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> Bible published by <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> you may see no less than twenty two several senses and acceptations of the word Faith, set down with the several places of Scripture referring to them. To which if out of my own observation I could add no more, yet these are an abundant demonstration, that whatsoever is said of the efficacy of Faith for Justification, is not to be taken in such a sense as will weaken the necessity, and our carefulness of good life, when the word may in so many other senses be taken to verifie the affirmation of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> of Justification by Faith, so as to reconcile it to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is in the word Faith, so it is in works; for by works is meant sometimes the thing done, sometimes the labour of doing, sometimes the good will; it is sometimes taken for a state of good life, sometimes for the Covenant of works; it sometimes means the works of the Law, sometimes the works of the Gospel; sometimes it is taken for a perfect, actual, unsinning obedience, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a sincere endeavour to please God; sometimes they are meant to be such which can challenge the reward as of Debt, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105896:54"/>
they mean only a disposition of the person to recieve the favour and the grace of God. Now since our good works can be but of one kind, for ours cannot be merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ours cannot be without sin all our life, they cannot be such as to need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it is no wonder if we must be justified without works in this sense; for by such works no man living can be justified. And these S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the works of the Law, and sometimes he calls them our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and these are the Covenant of works. But because we came into the world to serve God, and God will be obeyed, and Jesus Christ came into the world to save us from sin, and <hi>to redeem to himself a people zealous of good works,</hi> and hath to this purpose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us all his Fathers will, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the works of the Devil, and gives us his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; and by him we shall be justified in this obedience; therefore when works, signifie a sincere, hearty endeavour to keep all Gods commands out of a belief in Christ, that if we endeavour to do so, we shall be helped by his grace, and if we really do so we shall be pardoned for what is past, and if we continue to do so, we shall receive a Crown of Glory, therefore it is no wonder
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105896:55"/>
that it is said we are to be justified by works; alwayes meaning, not the works of the law, that is, works that are meritorious; works that can challenge the reward; works that need no mercy, no repentance, no humiliation, and no appeal to grace and favour, but alwayes mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, works that are an obedience to God by the measures of good will, and a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and the faith of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thus also it is in the word [Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.] For God is justified, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is justified, and man is justified, and a sinner is not justified as long as he continues in sin, and a sinner is justified when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and when he is pardoned; and an innocent person is justified when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be no criminal, and a righteous man is justified when he is saved, and a weak Christian is justified when his imperfect ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are accepted for the present, and himself thrust forward to more grace; and he that is justified may be justified more; and every man that is justified to one purpose is not so to all, and faith in divers senses gives justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in as many; and therefore though to every sense of Faith there is not alwayes a degree of justification in any; yet when the faith is such, that justification is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105896:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and correspondent, as that Faith may be imperfect, so the justification is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and either must proceed further, or else as the faith will dy, so the justification will come to nothing. The like observation might be made concerning imputation and all the words used in this question, but these may suffice till I pass to other particulars.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not only the word Faith, but also charity and godliness, and religion signifie sometimes particular graces, and sometimes they suppose Universally, and mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations and Unions of graces, as is evident to them that read the Scriptures with obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now when justification is attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Faith, or Salvation to godliness, they are to be understood in the aggregate sense: for that I may give but one instance of this; when S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of faith as it is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grace and separate from the rest, he also does separate it from all possibility of bringing us to Heaven; <hi>Though I have all Faith, so that I could remove Mountains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13:2:</note> 
                     <hi>and have no charity, I am nothing.</hi> When Faith includes charity, it will bring us to Heaven; when it is alone, when it is without charity, it will do nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Neither can this <gap reason="foreign">

saying, that though Faith alone does justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, yet when she does justifie she is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but good works must follow: for this is said to no purpose. 1. Because if we be justified by faith alone, the work is done, whether charity does follow or no, and therefore that want of charity cannot hurt us. 2. There can be no imaginable cause why charity and obedience should be at all necessary, if the whole work can be done without it. 3. If obedience and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be not a condition of our Salvation, than it is not necessary to follow faith; but if it be, it does as much as faith, for that is but a part of the condition. 4. If we can be sav'd without charity and keeping the Commandments, what need we trouble our selves for them: if we cannot be saved without them, then either faith without them does not justifie, or if it does, we are never the better, for we may be damned for all that justification.</p>
                  <p>The Consequent of the these observations is briefly this.</p>

(that I may use the words of <hi>Cicero) haec enim spinosiora priùs, ut confiteor, me cogunt quam ut assentiar.</hi> These things are knotty and too intricate to do any good; they may amuse us, but never instruct us; and they have already made men careless and confident, disputative and troublesom, proud and uncharitable, but neither wiser nor better. Let us therefore leave these weak wayes of troubling our selves or others, and directly look to the Theology of it, the direct duty, the end of Faith, and the work of Faith, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and the instruments of our Salvation, the just foundation of our hopes, how our faith can destroy our sin, and how it can unite us unto God; how by it we can be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105896:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made Partakers of Christs death, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his life. For since it is evident by the premises, that this article is not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or relyed upon by arguing from words of many significations; we must walk by a clearer light, by such plain sayings and Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Propositions of Scripture which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently teach us our duty, and place our hopes upon that which cannot deceive us, that is, which require Obedience, which call upon us to glorifie God, and to do good to men, and to keep all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, with diligence and sincerity.</p>
                  <p>For since the end of our faith is that we may be Disciples and Servants of the Lord Jesus, advancing his Kingdom here, and partaking of it hereafter, since we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe what Christ taught, that it may appear as reasonable as it is necessary to do what he hath commanded, since Faith and works are in order one to the other, it is impossible that Evangelical Faith, and Evangelical works should be opposed one to the other in the effecting of our Salvation. So that as it is to no purpose for Christians to dispute whether we are justified by Faith or the works of the law, that is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works without the help of Faith and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105896:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the auxiliaries and allowances of mercy on Gods part, and repentance on ours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no Christian can pretend to this: so it is perfectly foolish to dispute whether Christians are to be justified by Faith, or the works of the Gospel; for I shall make it appear that they are both the same thing. No man disparages faith but he that sayes, Faith does not work righteousness; for he that sayes so, sayes indeed it cannot justifie: for he sayes that faith is alone; it is faith only, and the words of my Text are plain; you see (saith <hi>S. James</hi>) that is, it is evident to your sense, it is as clear as an ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, <hi>that a man is justified by works and not by Faith only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Text hath it in these two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a negative and an affirmative. The negative is this, 1. By Faith only a man is not justified. The affirmative, 2. By works also a man is justified.</p>
                  <p>When I have briefly discoursed of these; I shall only adde such practical considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as shall make the Doctrines useful, and tangible, and material.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By faith only a man is not justified. By faith only, here is meant, faith without Obedience. For what do we think of those
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105896:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that detain the faith in Unrighteousness? they have faith, they could not else keep it in so ill a Cabinet, but yet the Apostle reckons them amongst the Reprobates; for the <hi>abominable, the Reprobates and the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient</hi> are all one; and therefore such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for all their faith shall have no part with faithful <hi>Abraham</hi>: for none are his Children but they that <hi>do the works of</hi> Abraham.

Therefore deceive not your selves; they are the words of our Blessed Lord himself; <hi>Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord,</hi> that is, not every one that confesses Christ, and believes in him, calling Christ Master and Lord shall be sav'd,

                     <hi>but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> These things are so plain, that they need no Commentary; so evident, that they cannot be denyied: and to these I add but this one truth: that faith alone without a good life is so far from justifying a sinner, that it is one of the greatest aggravations of his condemnation in the whole World. For no man can be so greatly damned as he that hath faith; for unless he knows his masters will, that is, by faith be convinced, and assents to the revelations of the will of God, <hi>he can be beaten but with few stripes</hi>: but he that believes hath no excuse, he is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, many stripes, the greater condemnation shall be his portion. Natural reason is a light to the Conscience, but faith is a greater, and therefore if it be not followed, it damns deeper than the Hell of the Infidels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instructed. And so I have done with the Negative Proposition of my Text; a man is not justified by faith alone, that is, by faith which hath not in it Charity and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If faith alone will not do it, what will? The affirmative part of the Text answers;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105896:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not faith alone; but works must be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient: a man is justified by works; and that is now to be explicated and prov'd. It will be absolutely to no purpose to say that faith alone does justifie, if when a man is justified, he is never the nearer to be sav'd. Now that without Obedience no man can go to Heaven, is so evident in holy Scripture, that he that denyes it, hath no faith, <hi>There is no peace saith my God unto the wicked</hi>;<note place="margin">Isa. 57.21: Exod. 23.7.</note> and <hi>I will not justifie a sinner,</hi> saith God; unless faith purges away our sins it can never justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.

Faith is a great purger and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of the soul, <hi>purifying your hearts by Faith,</hi> faith the Apostle. It is the best physick in the World for a sinful soul, but if it does not work, it corrupts in the stomach, it makes us to rely upon weak Propositions and trifling confidences, it is but a dreaming <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a Phantastick dream, and introduces Pride or superstition, swelling thoughts and presumptions of the Divine favour. But what saith the Apostle? <hi>Follow

If faith does not make you charitable and holy, talk no more of justification by it, for you shall never see the glorious face of God. Faith indeed is a title and relation to Christ; it is a naming of his names, but what then? Why than saith the Apostle, <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For let any man consider, can the Faith of Christ, and the hatred of God stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? Can any man be justified that does not love God? Or can any man love God and sin at the same time? And does not he love sin that falls under its temptation, and obeyes it in the lusts thereof, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the vanity, and makes excuses for it, and returns to it with passion, and abides with pleasure? This will not do it; such a man cannot be justified for all his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But therefore the Apostle shews us a more excellent way:<note place="margin">Titus 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>This is a true saying, and I will that thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God, be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works.</hi> The Apostle puts great force on this Doctrine, he arms it with a double Preface; the saying is true, and it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105896:60"/>
is to be constantly affirmed; that is, it is not only true, but necessary; it is like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> dream doubled, because it is bound upon us by the decree of God, and it is unalterably certain, that every believer must do good works, or his believing will signifie little; nay more than so, every man must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do good works, and more yet; he must carefully maintain them, that is, not do them by fits and interrupted returns, but <gap reason="foreign">

of a sinner, the pardoning of his sins, is then only effected, when the spiritual evil is taken away: that's the best indication of a real and an eternal pardon; when God takes away the hardness of the heart, the love of sin, the accursed habit, the evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the sin that doth so easily beset us: and when that is gone, what remains within us that God can hate? Nothing stayes behind, but Gods creation, the work of his own hands, the issues of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The faith of a Christian is <gap reason="foreign">

But all this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and therefore ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by any Christian. Severe are those words of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Every plant in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 15.2:</note> Faith ingrafts us into Christ; by faith we are inserted into the vine; but the plant that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105896:62"/>
is ingrafted, must also be parturient and fruitful, or else it shall be quite cut off from the root, and thrown into the everlasting burning. And this is the full and plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those words so often used in Scripture for the magnification of faith. <hi>The just shall live by Faith.</hi> No man shall live by faith but the just man, he indeed is justified by faith, but no man else; the unjust and the unrighteous man hath no portion in this matter. That's the first great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this affair; no man is justified in the least sense of justification, that is, when it means nothing but the pardon of sins, but when his sin is mortified and destroyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No man is actually justified, but he that is in some measure sanctified. For the understanding and clearing of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we must know, that justification when it is attributed to any cause, does not alwayes signifie justification actual. Thus when it is said in Scripture, <hi>We are justified by the death of Christ,</hi> it is but the same thing as to say, <hi>Christ dyed for us</hi>; and he rose again for us too, that we might indeed be justified in due time, and by just measures and dispositions; <hi>he dyed for our sins, and ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105896:62"/>
death and Resurrection he hath obtained this power, and effected this mercy, that if we believe him and obey, we shall be justified and made capable of all the blessings of the Kingdom. But that this is no more but a capacity of pardon, of grace and of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appears not only by Gods requiring Obedience as a condition on our parts; but by his expresly attributing this mercy to us at such times and in such circumstances, in which it is certain and evident that we could not actually be justified. For so saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>We when we were enemies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. v. 8.10.</note> 
                     <hi>were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Son; and while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</hi>; that is, then was our Justification wrought on Gods part, that is, then he intended this mercy to us, then he resolved to shew us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to give us Promises, and Laws, and Conditions, and hopes, and an infallible Oeconomy of Salvation; and when faith layes hold on this Grace, and this Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we are to do the other part of it; that is, as God made it potential by the death and resurrection of Christ, so we lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on these things by Faith, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteousness of Faith, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what is required on our parts, we,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105896:63"/>
I say, make it actual; and for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is that the Apostle puts more <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> upon the Resurrection of Christ than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Death.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28. Rom. 4.25.</note>

When the righteousness of God becomes <hi>your righteousness, and exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> when the righteousness of the Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, <hi>by walking not after the flesh but after the Spirit</hi>; then we are justified by Gods truth and by ours, by his Grace, and our Obedience. So that now we see that Justification and Sanctification cannot be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105896:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
distinguished, but as words of Art signifying the various steps of progression in the same course; they may be distinguished in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and speculation; but never when they are to pass on to material events: for no man is justified but he that is also sanctified. They are the express words of <hi>S. Paul, Whom he did foreknow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> 
                     <hi>them he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,</hi> to be like to Christ; and then it follows, <hi>Whom he hath predestinated,</hi> so predestinated, <hi>them he hath also called, and whom he hath called, them he hath also justified</hi>; and then it follows, <hi>Whom he hath justified, them he hath also glorified.</hi> So that no man is justified, that is, so as to signifie Salvation, but Sanctification must be precedent to it; and that was my second consideration <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that which I was to prove.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I pray consider; that he that does not believe the promises of the Gospel, cannot pretend to Faith in Christ; but the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are all made to us upon the conditions of Obedience; And he that does not believe them as Christ made them, believes them not at all. <hi>In well doing commit your selves to God as unto a faithful Creator</hi>; there is no committing our selves to God without well-doing;

                     <hi>to them that obey unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, indignation and wrath; but to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, to them eternal life.</hi> So that if faith apprehends any other promises, it is illusion, and not faith. God gave us none such, Christ purchased none such for us; search the Bible over and you shall find none such. But if faith layes hold on these promises that are, and as they are, then it becomes an Article of our faith, that without obedience, and a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep Gods Commandments, no man living can be justified. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take heed when we magnifie the free Grace of God, we do not exclude the conditions which this free Grace hath set upon us. Christ freely died for us; God pardons us freely in our first access to him; we could never deserve pardon, because when we need pardon we are enemies, and have no good thing in us; and he freely gives us of his Spirit, and freely he enables us to obey him; and for our little imperfect ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he freely and bountifully will give us eternal life; here is free Grace all the way, and he overvalues his pitiful services, who
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105896:65"/>
thinks that he deserves Heaven by them; and that if he does his duty tolerably, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is not a free gift to him, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served reward.</p>

But if I do live holily, I do not think that I deserve Heaven, it is the cross of Christ that procures me grace; it is the Spirit of Christ that gives me grace; it is the mercy and the free gift of Christ that brings me unto Glory. But yet he that shall exclude the works of faith from the Justification of a sinner by the blood of Christ, may as well exclude faith it self; for faith it self is one of the works of God: it is a good work; so said Christ to them that asked him.<note place="margin">John 6.28.29:</note> [<hi>What shall we do to work the works of God? Jesus said, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</hi>] Faith
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105896:65"/>
is not only the Foundation of good works, but it self is a good work, it is not only the cause of obedience, but a part of it; it is not only as the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> calls it, <hi>initium adhaerendi Deo,</hi> a beginning of cleaving unto God; but it carries us on to the perfection of it. Christ is the Author and finisher of our Faith, and when Faith is finished, a good life is made perfect in our kind. Let no man therefore expect events for which he hath no promise, nor call for Gods fidelity without his own faithfulness, nor snatch at a promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when God made a Covenant of faith, he made also the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the law of Faith, and when he admitted us to a Covenant of more mercy than was in the Covenant of works, or of the law, he did not admit us to a Covenant of idleness, and incurious walking in a State of disobedience, but the mercy of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to repentance, and when he gives us better promises, he intends we should pay
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105896:66"/>
him a better obedience: when he forgives us what is past, he intends we should sin no more: when he offers us his graces, he would have us to make use of them; when he causes us to distrust our selves, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is we should rely upon him; when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to do what he commands us, he commands us to do all that we can. And therefore this Covenant of Faith and mercy is also a Covenant of holiness, and the grace that pardons us does also purifie us; for so saith the Apostle, <hi>He that hath this hope pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies himself even as God is pure.</hi> And when we are so, then we are justified indeed; this is the <gap reason="foreign">

And so I have done with the affirmative Proposition of my Text; you see that a man is justified by works.</p>
                  <p>But there is more in it then this matter yet amounts to.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the obedience of Faith, by the works of Faith, by the law of Faith; by righteousness Evangelical, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Gospel and the measures of Christ. I have many things to say in this particular; but because I have but a little time left to say them in, I will sum it all up in this Proposition, That in the question of justification and salvation, Faith and good works are no part of a distinction, but mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one intire body. Faith and good works together work the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God. That is, that I may speak plainly, justifying faith contains in it obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and if this be made good, then the two Apostles are reconciled to each other, and both of them to the necessity, the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable necessity of a good life.</p>
                  <p>Now that justifying and saving Faith must be defined by something more than an act of understanding, appears not only in this, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> reckons Faith as distinctly from knowledge, as he does from patience, or strength or brotherly kindness;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5.</note> saying [<hi>Add to your faith vertue, to vertue knowledge</hi>] but in this also; because an error in life, and whatsoever is against holiness, is against faith.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105896:67"/>
And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons the lawless and the disobedient, murders of Parents, man-stealing and such things to be against sound doctrines, for the doctrine of Faith is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the doctrine that is according to godliness. And when <hi>S. Paul</hi> prayes against ungodly men,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3.2.</note> he adds this reason,<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. for all men have not Faith: meaning that wicked men are Infidels and Unbelievers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly he affirms of him <hi>that does not provide for his own,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> that he hath denyed the Faith.</hi> Now from hence it follows that faith is godliness, because all wickedness is infidelity, it is an Apostacy from the Faith. <hi>Ille erit, Ille no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens qui me tibi fecerat hostem</hi>; he that sins against God, he is the enemy to the Faith of Jesus Christ; and therefore we deceive our selves if we place faith in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only; it is not that, and it does not dwell there, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith the Apostle, the Mystery of Faith is kept no where, it dwells no where but in a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>For I consider that since all moral habits are best defined by their operations, we can best understand what faith is by seeing what it does. To this purpose hear <hi>S. Paul, By

                     <hi>By faith</hi> Noah <hi>made an Ark. By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>left his Country and offered up his Son. By faith</hi> Moses <hi>chose to suffer affliction, and accounted the reproach of Christ greater than all the riches of</hi> Aegypt. In short, the children of God <hi>by faith subdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and wrought righteousness</hi>: To work righteousness is as much the duty and work of faith as believing is. So that now we may quickly make an end of this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, whether a man is justified by Faith, or by works, for he is so by both; if you take it alone, faith does not justifie, but take it in the aggregate sense as it is used in the question of Justification by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and then faith does not only justifie, but it san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies too, and then you need to inquire no further; obedience is a part of the definition of faith, as much as it is of Charity. This is love, saith S. <hi>John, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And the very same is affirmed of Faith too by <hi>Bensirach,</hi>

There was at first no distinction of Sects and Opinions in the Church: she knew no difference of men, but good and bad; there was no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made, but what was made by piety or impiety, or (sayes he) which is all one, by fidelity and infidelity. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. For Faith hath in it the Image of godliness engraven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity hath the character of wickedness and prevarication. A man was not then esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Saint for disobeying his Bishop or an Apostle, nor for misunderstanding the hard sayings of S. <hi>Paul</hi> about predestination: to kick against the laudable customs of the Church was not then accounted a note of the godly party: and to despise Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was but an ill mark, and weak indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of being a good Christian. The Kingdom of God did not then consist in words, but in power, the power of godliness; though now we are fallen into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method: we have turned all Religion into Faith, and our Faith is nothing but the productions of interest or disputing; it is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105896:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
adhering to a party, and a wrangling against all the world beside; and when it is asked of what Religion he is of, we understand the meaning to be, what faction does he follow; what are the articles of his Sect, not what is the manner of his life; and if men be zealous for their party and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, then they are precious men, though otherwise they be Covetous as the grave, factious as <hi>Dathan,</hi> Schismatical as <hi>Corah,</hi> or proud as the falling Angels, Alas! these things will but deceive us; the faith of a Christian cannnot consist in strifes about words, and perverse disputings of men.

But the faith of a Christian had other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: that was faith then which made men faithful to their vows in Baptism. The faith of a Christian was the best security in contracts, and a Christians word was as good as his bond, because he was faithful that promised, and a Christian would rather dy then break his word; and was alwayes

true to his trust; he was faithful to his Friend, and loved as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did <hi>David.</hi> This was the Christian Faith then: their religion was to hurt no man, and to do good to every man, and so it ought to be. <hi>True Religion is to visit the Fatherless and Widow, and to keep our selves unspotted of the World.</hi> That's a good religion, that's <hi>pure and undefiled</hi>: so <hi>S.

By this faith he was justified, saith S. <hi>Paul; by these works he was justified,</hi> saith S. <hi>James</hi>; that is, by this faith working this obedience. And then all the difficulty is over; only remember this, your faith is weak and will do but little for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105896:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, if it be not stronger then all your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular desires and all your peevish angers. Thus we find in the holy Gospels, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction declared necessary,<note place="margin">Mark. 11.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</hi> Here is as glorious an event promised to Faith as can be expressed, Faith shall obtain any thing of God. True; but it is not Faith alone; but faith in prayer; faith praying, not faith simply believing. So S. <hi>James</hi>; the <hi>prayer of Faith shall save the sick,</hi> but adds, it must be the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, so that faith shall prevail; but there must be prayer in faith, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in prayer, and devotion in fervour, and righteousness in devotion, and then impute the effect to faith if you please, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it be declared: that effect cannot be wrought by Faith unless it be so qualified. But Christ adds one thing more. <hi>When ye stand praying, forgive, but if ye will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, neither will your Father forgive you.</hi> So that it will be to no purpose to say a man is justified by faith, unless you mingle charity with it: for without the charity of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there can be no pardon; and then justification is but a word, when it effects nothing.</p>

                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:105896:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. Let every one take heed that by an importune adhering to and relying upon a mistaken Faith, he do not really make a shipwrack of a right Faith. <hi>Hymenaeus &amp; Alexander</hi> lost their faith by putting away a good conscience, and what matter is it, of what religion or faith a man be of, if he be a Villain and a cheat, a man of no truth, and of no trust, a lover of the World, and not a lover of God. But I pray consider, can any man have faith that denyes God? That's not possible: and cannot a man as well deny God by an evil action, as by an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritical Proposition? Cannot a man deny God by works as much as by words? Hear what the Apostle sayes,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> Disobedience is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God. <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare,</hi> is as plain a renouncing of Christ, as <hi>nolumus huic cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to no purpose to say we believe in Christ and have faith, unless Christ reign in our hearts by faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From these premises we may see but too evidently, that though a great part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind pretend to be saved by Faith, yet they know not what it is, or else wilfully mistake
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105896:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, and place their hopes upon sand, or the more unstable water. Believing is the least thing in a justifying faith. For faith is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of many Ingredients; and faith is a Covenant, and faith is a law, and faith is obedience, and faith is a work, and indeed it is a sincere cleaving to and closing with the terms of the Gospel in every instance, in every particular. Alas! the niceties of a spruce understanding, and the curious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of useless speculation, and all the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men that make the divisions of heart, and do nothing else, cannot bring us one drop of comfort in the day of tribulation; and therefore are no parts of the strength of faith. Nay, when a man begins truly to fear God, and is in the Agonies of mortification, all these new-nothings and curiosities will neglected by, as baubles do by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are deadly sick. But that only is faith that makes us to love God, to do his will, to suffer his impositions, to trust his promises, to see through a cloud, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World, to resist the Devil, to stand in the day of tryal, and to be comforted in all our sorrows. <q>This is that precious faith so mainly necessary to be insisted on, that by it we may be Sons of the free woman,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105896:71"/>
                        <hi>liberi à vitiis ac ritibus,</hi> that the true <hi>Isaac</hi> may be in us, which is Christ according to the Spirit, the wisdom and power of God, a Divine vigour and life, whereby we are enabled with joy and cheerfulness to walk in the way of God.</q> By this you may try your faith, if you please, and make an end of this question. Do you believe in the Lord Jesus, yea or no? God forbid else, but if your Faith be good it will abide the trial. There are but three things that make the integrity of Christian faith, believing the words of God, confidence in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and keeping his commandments.</p>
                  <p>For the first, it is evident that every man pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds to it; if he calls himself Christian, he believes all that is in the Canon of the Scriptures, and if he did not, he were indeed no Christian. But now consider, what think we of this Proposition? <hi>All shall be damned who believe not the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.12:</note> 
                     <hi>but have pleasure in unrighteousness.</hi> Does not every man believe this? Is it possible they can believe there is any such thing as unrighteousness in the World, or any such thing as damnation; and yet commit that which the Scriptures call unrighteousness, and which all laws, and all good men say is so? Consider how many
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105896:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unrighteous men there are in the world, and yet how few of them think they shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I know not how it comes to pass; but men go upon strange principles, and they have made Christianity to be a very odd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, if it had not better measures than they are pleased to afford it. There are two great roots of all evil, Covetousness and Pride; and they have infected the greatest parts of mankind, and yet no man thinks himself to be either covetous or proud. And therefore whatever you discourse against these sins, it never hits any man, but like <hi>Jonathans</hi> arrows to <hi>David,</hi> they fall short, or they fly beyond. <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of it in his time. <hi>Hoc ad crimina nostra addimus, ut cum in omnibus rei simus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>etiam bonos nos, &amp; sanctos esse credamus.</hi> This we add unto our crimes, we are the vilest persons in the world, and yet we think our selves to be good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when we dy make no question but we shall go to Heaven. There is no cause of this, but because we have not so much Faith as believing comes to, and yet most men will pretend not only to believe, but to love Christ all this while. And how do they prove this? Truly they hate the memory of <hi>Judas,</hi> and curse the Jews that crucified Christ, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105896:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think <hi>Pilate</hi> a very miserable man, and that all the Turks are damned, and to be called <hi>Cajaphas</hi> is a word of reproach; and indeed there are many that do not much more for Christ than this comes to; things to as little purpose, and of as little signification. But so the Jews did hate the memory of <hi>Corah</hi> as we do of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and they builded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the Prophets, and we also are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at them that killed the Apostles and the Martyrs. But in the mean time we neither love Christ nor his Saints; for we neither obey him, nor imitate them. And yet we should think our selves highly injured, if one should call us Infidels and haters of Christ. But I pray consider; what is hating of any man, but designing and doing him all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and spite we can? Does not he hate Christ that dishonours him, that makes Christs members the members of an harlot? That doth not feed &amp; clothe these members? If the Jews did hate Christ when they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, then so does a Christian too when he crucifies him again. Let us not deceive our selves; a Christian may be damned as well as a Turk; and Christians may with as much malice crucifie Christ as the Jews did. And so does every man that sins wilfully; he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105896:73"/>
spills the blood of Christ, making it to be spent in vain. <hi>He that hateth you, hateth me, he that receives you, receives me,</hi> said Christ to his Apostles. I wish the world had so much faith as to believe that; and by this try whether we love Christ, and believe in him or no, I shall for the tryal of our Faith ask one easy question. Do we believe that the story of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> is true? Have we so much faith as to think it possible that two Rivals of a Crown should love so dearly? Can any man believe this, and not be infinitely ashamed to see Christians (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Christians) to be irreconcileably angry, and ready to pull their brothers heart out, when he offers to take our Land or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from us? Why do almost all men that go to law for right hate one anothers persons? Why cannot men with patience hear their titles questioned? But if Christianity be so excellent a Religion, why are so very many Christians so very wicked? Certainly they do not so much as believe the propositions and principles of their own Religion. For the body of Christians is so universally wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it would be a greater change to see Christians generally live according to their profession, than it was at first from infidelity
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105896:73"/>
to see them to turn Believers. The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Christian to Christian, from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in title to Christian in sincerity, would be a greater miracle then it was when they were converted from Heathen and Jew to Christian. What is the matter? Is not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works</hi> reckoned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 6. <hi>Hebr.</hi> as one of the fundamental points of Christian Religion? Is it not a piece of our Catechism, the first thing we are taught, and is it not the last thing that we practise? We had better be without Baptism than without repentance, and yet both are necessary; and therefore if we were not without faith, we should be without neither. Is not Repentance a forsaking all sin, and an intire returning unto God? Who can deny this? And is it not plainly said in Scripture, <hi>Vnless ye repent ye shall all perish</hi>? But shew me the man that believes these things hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that is, shew me a true penitent, he only believes the doctrines of repentance.</p>
                  <p>If I had time I should examine your faith by your confidence in God, and by your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But if we fall in the meer belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it is not likely we should do better in the other. But because all the promises of God are conditional, and there can be no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105896:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confidence in the particular without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or revelation, it is not possible that any man that does not live well should reasonably put his trust in God. To live a wicked life, and then to be confident that in the day of our death God will give us pardon, is not faith but a direct want of faith. If we did believe the promises upon their proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or believe that Gods commandments were righteous and true, or that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were as really intended as they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly spoken, we should not dare to live at the rate we do: But <hi>wicked men have not faith,</hi> saith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and then the wonder ceases.</p>
                  <p>But there are such palpable contradictions between mens practices and the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of our faith, that it was a material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>When the Son of man comes shall he find faith upon the earth</hi>? Meaning it should be very hard and scant: <hi>every man shall boast of his own goodness; sed virum fidelem,</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) but a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man who can find</hi>? Some men are very good when they are afflicted.</p>

                  <p>When the gown of the day is the mantle of the night, and cannot at the same time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head, and make the feet warm; when they have but one broken dish and no spoon, then they are humble and modest; then they can suffer an injury, and bear contempt: but give them riches and they grow insolent; fear and pusillanimity did their first work, and an opportunity to sin undoes it all. <hi>Bonum militem perdidisti, Imperatorem pessimum creâsti,</hi> said <hi>Galba,</hi> you have spoiled a good Trooper when you made me a bad Commander. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can never serve God, but when they are prosperous: if they lose their fortune they lose their Faith, and quit their Charity. <hi>Non rata fides ubi jam melior fortuna ruit.</hi> If they become poor, they become liars and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their trust, envious and greedy, restless and uncharitable; that is, one way or other they shew that they love the world, and by all the faith they pretend to cannot overcome it.</p>
                  <p>Cast up therefore your reckonings imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; See what is, what will be required at your hands. Do not think you can be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, unless your faith be greater then

all your passions; you have not the learning, not so much as the common notices of faith, unless you can tell when you are covetous, and reprove your self when you are proud; but he that is so, and knows it not (and that is the case of most men) hath no faith, and neither knows God, nor knows himself.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. He that hath true justifying faith, believes the power of God to be above the powers of nature; the goodness of God above the merit and disposition of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the bounty of God above the excellency of our works, the truth of God above the contradiction of our weak arguings and fears, the love of God above our cold experience and ineffectual reason, and the necessities of doing good works above the faint excuses and ignorant pretences of disputing sinners. But want of faith makes us so generally wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as we are, so often running to despair; so often baffled in our resolutions of a good life. But he whose faith makes him more than Conqueror over these difficulties, to him <hi>Isaac</hi> shall be born even in his old age; the life of God shall be perfectly wrought in him, and by this faith so operative, so strong, so lasting, so obedient, he shall be justified, and he shall be saved.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Obedience to the Commands of the Right Honourable the Lords Justices, and the most Reverend and Learned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and to the desires of my Reverend Brethren, put it past my inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ought to publish this following Sermon. I will not therefore excuse it, and say it might have advantages in the Delivery, which it would want in the Reading; and the ear would be kind to the Piety of it, which was apparent in the design, when the eye would be severe in its censure of those arguments, which as they could not be longer in that measure of time; so would have appeared more firm, if they could have had liberty to have been pursued to their utmost issue. But reason lies in a little room, and Obedience in less. And although what
<pb facs="tcp:105896:77"/>
I have here said, may not stop the mouths of Men resolved to keep up a faction, yet I have said enough to the sober and pious, to them who love Order, and hearken to the voice of the Spouse of Christ, to the Loving and to the Obedient: And for those that are not so, I have no argument fit to be used, but Prayer, and readiness to give them a reason, when they shall modestly demand it. In the mean time I shall only desire them to make use of those trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s which the more Learned of their party have by the evidence of fact been forced to confess. <hi>Rivet</hi> affirms that it descended <hi>ex veteris aevi reliquiis,</hi> that Presbyters should be assistants or conjoyned to the Bishops, (who is by this confessed to be the principal) in the imposition of hands for Ordination. <hi>Walo Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> acknowledges it to be <hi>rem antiquissimam,</hi> a most ancient thing that these two Orders, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Bishops and Presbyters, should be distinct, even in the middle, or in the beginning of the next age after Christ. <hi>Dd. Blondel</hi> places it to be <hi>35.</hi> years after the death of <hi>S. John.</hi> Now then Episcopacy is confessed to be of about <hi>1600.</hi> years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: and if before this they can shew any Ordination by mere Presbyters, by any but an Apostle, or an Apostolical man; and if there were not visibly a distinction of powers and persons relatively in the Ecclesiastical Government, or if they can give a rational account why they who are forced to confess the Honour and distinct Order of Episcopacy for about <hi>16.</hi> ages, should in the dark interval of <hi>35.</hi> years (in which they can pretend to no Monument or Record to the contrary) yet make unlearned scruples of things they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not colourably prove; if (I say) they can reasonably account
<pb facs="tcp:105896:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for these things, I for my part will be ready to confess that they are not guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of the greatest, the most unreasonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable schism in the World. But else, they have no colour to palliat the unlearned crime. For will not all wise men in the world conclude; that the Church of God, which was then <hi>Holy,</hi> not in title only and design, but practically and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially; and pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cuted, and not immerged in secular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, could not all in one instant joyn together to alter that form of Church Government, which Christ and his Apostles had so recently established, and without a Divine warrant destroy a Divine institution, not only to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Hierarchy, but to the ruine of their own Souls. It were strange that so great a change should be, and no good man oppose it. <hi>In toto orbe decretum est:</hi> so <hi>S. Hierom.</hi> All the world consented in the advancement of the Episcopal Order. And therefore if we had no more to say for it, yet in prudence and piety we cannot say they would innovate in so great a matter.</p>
                  <p>But I shall enter no further upon this inquiry: only I remember that it is not very many Months since the Bigots of the Popish party cryed out against us vehemently, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Where is your Church of <hi>England,</hi> since you have no Unity? for your Ecclesiastick head of Unity, your Bishops, are gone. And if we should be desirous to verify their argument, so as indeed to destroy Episcopacy, We should too much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Popery, and do the most imprudent and most impious thing in the world. But blessed be God, who hath restored that Government, for which our late King of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gave his blood. And that (me thinks) should very much
<pb facs="tcp:105896:78"/>
weigh with all the Kings true hearted Subjects, who should make it Religion not to rob that glorious Prince of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est honour of such a Martyrdom. For my part, I think it fit to rest in those words of another Martyr, <hi>S. Cyprian, Si quis cum Episcopo non sit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep. 69.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>in Ecclesia non esse:</hi> He that is not with the Bishop, is not in the Church: that is, he that goes away from him, and willingly separates, departs from Gods Church; and whether he can then be with God, is a very material consideration, and fit to be thought on by all that think Heaven a more eligible good then the interests of a faction, and the importune desire of rule can countervail.</p>
                  <p>However, I have in the following papers spoken a few things, which I hope may be fit to perswade them that are not infinitely prejudiced: and although two or three good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as good as two or three hundred, yet my purpose here was to prove the dignity and necessity of the Office and Order Episcopal, only that it might be as an Oeconomy to convey notice, and remembrances of the great duty incumbent upon all them that undertake this great charge. The Dignity and the Duty take one another by the hand, and are born together: only every Sheep of the Flock must take care to make the Bishops duty as easy as it can, by humility and love, by prayer and by Obedience. It is at the best very difficult, but they who oppose themselves to Government, make it harder and uncomfortable. But take heed; if thy Bishop hath cause to complain to God of thee for thy perversness and uncharitable walking, thou wilt be the loser. And for us, we can only say in the words of the Prophet, <hi>We will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people</hi>:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Who are these Rulers of Christs Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for though Christ knew it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needed not to ask; yet we have disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it so much, and obeyed so little, that we have changed the plain hypothesis into an intangled question. The answer yet is easy as to some part of the inquiry. The Apostles are the first meaning of the Text; for they were our Fathers in Christ; They begat Sons and Daughters unto God; and were a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105896:81"/>
spiritual paternity is evident: we need look no further for spiritual Government, because in the paternal rule all power is founded; They begat the Family by the power of the word and the life of the Spirit, and they fed this Family and ruled it by the word of their proper Ministery. They had the keyes of this house, the Stewards Ensign; and they had the Rulers place; for they sat on twelve thrones and judged the twelve tribes of Israel. But of this there is no question.</p>
                  <p>And as little of another proposition; that this Stewardship was to last for ever; for the powers of Ministring in this Office and the Office it self were to be perpetual. For the issues and powers of Government are more necessary for the perpetuating the Church, then for the first planting; and if it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the Apostles should have a rod and a staff at first, it would be more necessary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the Family was more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and their first zeal abated, and their native simplicity perverted into arts of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy and forms of godliness, when <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies should arise, and the love of many should wax cold.</hi> The Apostles had also a power of Ordination; and that the very power it self does <hi>denote,</hi> for it <hi>makes</hi> perpetuity, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105896:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not expire in the dayes of the Apostles; for by it they themselves propagated a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. And Christ having promised his spirit to abide with his Church for ever, and made his Apostles the Channels, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and conveyances of it, that it might descend as the inheritance and eternal porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Family; it cannot be imagined that when the first Ministers were gone, there should not others rise up in the same places, some like to the first, in the same Office and Ministery of the Spirit. But the thing is plain and evident in the matter of fact also. <hi>Quod in Ecclesiâ nunc geritur, hoc olim fecerunt Apostoli,</hi> said S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 73. <hi>ad Jubaj.</hi>
                     </note> What the Apostles did at first, that the Church does to this day, and shall do so for ever. For when <hi>S. Paul</hi> had given to the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this Family;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.14.</note> he commands that they should be <hi>observed till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>: and therefore these au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and charges are given to him and to his Successors; it is the observation of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon the warranty of that Text, and is obvious and undeniable.</p>
                  <p>Well then. The Apostles were the first Stewards; and this Office dies not with them, but must for ever be succeeded in;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105896:82"/>
and now begins the inquiry, who are the Successors of the Apostles: for they are, they must evidently be the Stewards to feed and to rule this Family. There are some that say that all who have any portion of work in the Family, all the Ministers of the Gospel are these Stewards, and so all will be Rulers. The Presbyters surely; for say they, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and Bishop is the same thing, and have the same name in Scripture, and therefore the Office cannot be distinguished. To this I shall very briefly say two things, which will quickly clear our way through this bush of thorns.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is but an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable appellative used amongst the Jews, as <hi>Alderman</hi> amongst us; but it signifies no order at all, nor was ever us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in Scripture to signify any distinct company or order of Clergy. And this appears not only by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction in all the enumerations of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Ministerial in the New Testament: <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12.6. Ephe. 4 11. 1 Cor. 12.28.</note> where to be a Presbyter is never reckoned either as a distinct Office, or a distinct order; but by its being indifferently communicated to all the Superior Clergy, and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The second thing I intended to say is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105896:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this, that although all the Superior Clergy had not only one, but divers common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatives; all being called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

things that were wanting</hi> in the Churches, the same with that power of <hi>S. Paul; [other things will I set in order when I come,</hi>] said he to the Corinthian Churches; in which there were many who were called Presbyters; who nevertheless for all that name, had not that power. To the same purpose it is plain in Scripture, that <hi>some would have been Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles that were not</hi>;<note place="margin">Cap. 2. V. 2.</note> such were those whom the spirit of God notes in the Revelation; and some did love <hi>preeminence</hi> that had it not; for so did <hi>Diotrephes</hi>; and some were Judges of questions, and all were not, for therefore they appealed to the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and S. <hi>Philip</hi> though he was an Evangelist, yet he could not give confirmation to the Samaritans whom he had baptized, but the Apostles were sent for; for that was part of the power reserved to the Episcopal or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick order.</p>
                  <p>Now from these premises the conclusion is plain and easy. 1. Christ left a Government in his Church, and founded it in the persons of the Apostles. 2. The Apostles received this power for the perpetual use and benefit, for the comfort and edification of the Church for ever. 3. The Apostles had this Government, but all that were taken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105896:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the Ministry, and all that were called Presbyters had it not. If therefore this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in which there is so much disparity in the very nature and exercise and first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it, must abide for ever; then so must that disparity: If the Apostolate in the first stabiliment was this eminency of power; then it must be so, that is, it must be the same in the succession, that it was in the foundation. For after the Church is founded upon its Governours, we are to expect no change of Government. If Christ was the Author of it, then as Christ left it, so it must abide for ever: forever there must be the Governing and the Governed, the superior and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, the Ordainer and the ordained, the confirmer and the confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the way is straight, and the path is plain. The Apostles were the Stewards and the ordinary Rulers of Christs Family by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the order and office Apostolical; and although this must be succeeded to for ever; yet no man for his now, or at any time being called a Presbyter or Elder can pretend to it; for besides his being a Presbyter, he must be an Apostle too; else, though he be called <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and may do the offices of assistance and understewardship; yet

                     </gap>, the Government and Rule of the Family belongs not to him.</p>
                  <p>But then <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; who are these Stewards and Rulers over the houshold now? To this the answer is also certain and easy. Christ hath made the same Governours to day as heretofore; <hi>Apostles still,</hi> For though the twelve Apostles are dead; Yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical order is not: it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. Therefore, certain and known it is, that Christ appointed two sorts of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick persons; the XII. Apostles, and the LXXII. Disciples; to these he gave a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted commission, to those a fulness of power; to these a temporary imployment, to those a perpetual and everlasting; from these two societies founded by Christ, the whole Church of God derives the two superiour orders in the sacred Hierarchy; and as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops do not claim a Divine right but by succession from the Apostles; so the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105896:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot pretend to have been instituted by Christ, but by claiming a succession to the LXXII. And then consider the difference, compare the Tables, and all the world will see the advantages of argument we have; for since the LXXII. had nothing but a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on a temporary errand &amp; more then that we hear nothing of them in Scripture; but upon the Apostles Christ powred all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical power, and made them the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers of that spirit which was to abide with the Church for ever; the Divine institution of Bishops, that is, of Successors to the Apostles, is much more clear then that Christ appointed Presbyters, or Successors of the LXXII. And yet if from hence they do not derive it, they can never prove their order to be of Divine institution at all, much less to be so alone.</p>
                  <p>But we may see the very thing it self; the very matter of fact. S. <hi>James</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is by <hi>S. Paul</hi> called an Apostle;<note place="margin">Gal. 1.19.</note>

Bishops; and places them in the seat of Fathers, the first Apostles.</p>
                  <p>After these plain and evident testimonies of Scripture, it will not be amiss to say, that this great affair relying not only upon the words of institution, but on matter of fact; passed forth into a demonstration and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est notoreity by the Doctrine and practice of the whole Catholick Church. For so S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> who was one of the most Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and might easily make good his affirmative; <hi>We can</hi> (sayes he) <hi>reckon the men who by the Apostles were appointed Bishops in the Churches, to be their Successors unto us; leaving to them the same power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they had.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> was by the Apostles made Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>; S. <hi>Clement</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by St. <hi>Peter, and divers others by the Apostles,</hi> faith <hi>Tertullian</hi>; saying also that the Asian Bishops were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by <hi>S.

But when <hi>Constantine</hi> received the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms, he found it universally governed by Bishops, and therefore no wise or good man professing to be a Christian, that is, to believe the holy Catholick Church, can be content to quit the Apostolical Government; (that by which the whole Family of God was fed, and taught, and ruled,) and beget to himself new Fathers and new Apostles, who by wanting succession from the Apostles of our Lord, have no Ecclesiastical and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative communion with these fountains of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>If ever <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi>'s rule could be used in any question, it is in this: <hi>Quod sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, quod ubique, quod ab omibus</hi>; That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are the successors of the Apostles in this Stewardship; and that they did alwayes rule the Family, was taught and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alwayes, and every where, and by all men that were of the Church of God: and if these evidences be not sufficient to convince modest and sober persons in this question, we shall find our faith to fail in many other articles, of which we yet are very confident, For the observation of the Lords day, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the holy Eucharist by Priests, the baptizing Infants, the communicating of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the very Canon of the Scripture it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105896:87"/>
self rely but upon the same probation; and therefore the denying of Articles thus proved is a way (I do not say) to bring in all Sects and Heresies, (that's but little) but a plain path and inlet to Atheism and Irreligion; for by this means, it will not only be impossible to agree concerning the meaning of Scripture, but the Scripture it self, and all the Records of Religion will become useless, and of no efficacy or perswasion.</p>
                  <p>I am entered into a sea of matter, but I will break it off abruptly, and sum up this inquiry with the words of the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which is one of the four Generals, by our laws made the measures of judging Heresies. <gap reason="foreign">

And I shall say one thing more, which indeed is a great truth, that the diminution of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy was first introduced by Popery, and the Popes of Rome by communicating to

Abbots, and other mere Priests, special gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to exercise some essential Offices of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy, hath made this sacred order to be cheap, and apt to be invaded. But then add this: If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in so damnable a condition for offering to buy the gifts and powers of the Apostolical order, what shall we think of them that <hi>snatch</hi> them away, and pretend to wear them whether the Apostles and their Successors will or no?

For the Bishops Office is all that duty which can be signified by those excellent words of S <hi>Cyprian; He is a Bishop or Overseer of the Brotherhood, the Ruler of the people, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the Flock, the Governour of the Church, the Minister of Christ, and the Priest of God.</hi> These are great titles, and yet less then what is said of them in Scripture; which calls them <hi>Salt of the Earth, Lights upon a candlestick, Stars and Angels, Fathers of our Faith, Embassadors of God, Dispensers of the Misteries of God, the Apostles of the Churches, and the Glory of Christ</hi>; but then they are great burdens too: for the Bishop is <gap reason="foreign">

But all this is nothing but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral measures, I cannot be useful or understood unless I be more particular. The particulars we shall best enumerate by recounting those great conjugations of worthy offices and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which Christian Bishops have blessed and built up Christendom; for because we must be followers of them, as they were of Christ, the recounting what they did worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their generations, will not only demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105896:91"/>
how useful, how profitable, how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Episcopacy is to the Christian Church, but it will at the same time teach us our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by what services we are to benefit the Church, in what works we are to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how to give an account of our Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardship with joy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Christian Church was founded by Bishops, not only because the Apostles, who were Bishops, were the first Preachers of the Gospel, and Planters of Churches, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostolical men, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles used in planting and disseminating Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were by all Antiquity affirmed to have been Diocesan Bishops; in so much that as S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witnesses,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Tit. 1.</note> there were at the first disseminations of the faith of Christ, many Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s who had in them no other Clergy, but a Bishop and his Deacons, and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were brought in afterwards as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest grew greater. But the Bishops names are known, they are <hi>recorded in the book of Life,</hi> and <hi>their praise is in the Gospel</hi>; such were <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Linus, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Dionysius, Onesimus</hi> and <hi>Caius, Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and S. <hi>James our Lords Brother, Evodius</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi>; all which, if there be any faith in Christians that gave their lives for a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105896:91"/>
to the faith, and any truth in their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and unless we who believe <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Plutarch, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> think that all Church story is a perpetual Romance, and that all the brave men, the Martyrs and the Doctors of the Primitive Church, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire as one man to abuse all Christendom for ever; I say unless all these impossible suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions be admitted, all these whom I have now reckoned were Bishops fixed in several Churches, and had Dioceses for their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>The consequent of this consideration is this. It Bishops were those upon whose Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry Christ founded and built his Church, let us consider what great wisdom is required of them that seem to be Pillars: the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Christs Family must be wise: that Christ requires, and if the order be necessary to the Church, wisdom cannot but be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Order. For it is a shame if they who by their Office are Fathers in Christ, shall by their unskilfulness be but Babes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; understanding not the secrets of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the mysteries of Godliness, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Evangelical law, all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and disadvantages in the Spiritual life. A Bishop must be exercised in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105896:92"/>
a man of great experience in the secret conduct of Souls, not satisfied with an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary skill in making homilies to the people; and speaking common exhortations in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cases; but ready to answer in all secret inquiries, and able to convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, and to speak wisdom amongst them that are perfect.</p>
                  <p>If the first Bishops laid the foundation; their Successors must not only preserve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is fundamental, but build up the Church in a most holy Faith, taking care that no Heresie sap the foundation, and that no hay or rotten wood be built upon it; and above all things, that a most Holy life be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructed upon a holy and unreproveable Faith. So the Apostles laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and built the walls of the Church, and their Successors must raise up the roof as high as Heaven. For let us talk and dispute eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we shall never compose the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in Religion, and establish truth upon unalterable foundations, as long as men handle the word of God deceitfully, that is, with designs and little artifices, and secular partialities, and they will for ever do so, as long as they are proud or covetous. It is not the difficulty of our questions, or the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105896:92"/>
subtilty of our adversaries that makes disputes interminable; but we shall never cure the itch of disputing, or establish Unity, unless we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves to humility, and contempt of riches. If we will be contending, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend like the Olive and the Vine, who shall produce best, and most fruit; not like the Aspine and the Elm which shall make most noise in a wind. And all other methods are a beginning at a wrong end. And as for the people; the way to make them conformable to the wise and holy rules of faith and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is by reducing them to live good lives. When the children of Israel gave themselves to gluttony and drunkenness, and filthy lusts, they quickly fell into abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable idolatries; and <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayes that men make shipwrack of their Faith by putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a good conscience;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19. 2 Tim. 3.9.</note> for the mystery of Faith is best preserved <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in a pure conscience, saith the same Apostle; secure but that, and we shall quickly end our disputes, and have an obedient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable people; but else never.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Bishops were the first Fathers of Churches, and gave them being; so they preserve them in being. For withour Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there is no Church; or it will be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105896:93"/>
starved and dy: and without Bishops there can be no Priests, and consequently no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and that must needs be a supreme order from whence ordination it self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. For it is evident and notorious that in Scripture there is no record of ordination, but an Apostolical hand was in it; one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one of the chief, one of the superior and Ruling Clergy; and it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the descending ages of the Church, the Bishop alwayes had that power, it was never denyed to him, and it was never impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Presbyters; and <hi>S. Hierom</hi> himself, when out of his anger against <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he endeavoured to equal the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter with the Bishop, though in very many places he spake otherwise, yet even then also and in that heat, he excepted <hi>Ordination,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that to be the Bishops peculiar. And therefore they who go about to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Episcopacy, do as <hi>Julian</hi> did; they destroy the Presbytery and starve the Flock, and take away their Shepherds, and dispark their pastures, and tempt Gods providence to extraordinaries, and put the people to hard shifts, and turn the chanels of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quite another way, and leave the Church to a perpetual uncertainty, whether she be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105896:93"/>
alive or dead, and the people destitute of the life of their Souls, and their daily bread, and their spiritual comforts, and holy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
                  <p>The consequent of this is. If Sacraments depend upon Bishops, then let us take care that we convey to the people holy and pure materials, sanctified with a holy ministry, and ministred by holy persons. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that the efficacy of the Sacraments does not depend wholly upon he worthiness of him that ministers; yet it is as true, that it does not wholly rely upon the worthiness of the Receiver; but both together relying upon the goodness of God produce all those blessings which are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Minister hath an influence into the effect, and does very much towards it; and if there be a failure there, it is a defect in one of the concurring causes; and therefore an unholy Bishop is a great diminution to the peoples blessing. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> presses this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely: <hi>Impiè faciunt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They do wickedly who affirm that the holy Eucharist is consecrated by the words</hi> [alone] <hi>and solemn prayer of the consecrator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>in Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Zeph.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and not</hi> [also] <hi>by his life and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and therefore <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.</note> that <hi>none but holy and upright men are to be chosen,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105896:94"/>
who offering their Sacrifices worthily to God may be heard in their prayers for the Lords people</hi>: but for others; <hi>Sacrificia eorum panis luctus</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Hosea,) their Sacrifices are like the bread of sorrow, whoever eats thereof shall be defiled.</hi> This discourse is not mine but S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>: and although his words are not to be understood dogmatically, but in the case of duty and caution, yet we may lay our hands upon our hearts, and consider how we shall give an account of our Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, if we shall offer to the people the bread of God with impure hands; it is of it self a pure nourishment, but if it passes through an unclean vessel, it looses much of its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The like also is to be said concerning prayer. For the Episcopal order is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to be the great Ministers of Christs Priesthood, that is, to stand between Christ and the people in the entercourse of prayer and blessing. <hi>We will give our selves continually to prayer</hi>; said the Apostles, that was the one half of their imployment; and indeed a Bishop should spend very much of his time in holy prayer, and in diverting Gods judgments, and procuring blessings to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for in all times, the chief of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105896:94"/>
was ever the chief Minister of blessing. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> blessed <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> blessed the people; and <hi>without all controversy</hi> (saith the Apostle,) <hi>the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ss is blessed of the Greater.</hi> But then <hi>we know that God heareth not sinners</hi>; and it must be <hi>the effectual fervent prayer of a Righteous man</hi> that shall <hi>prevail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore we may easily consider that a vitious Prelate is a great calamity to that Flock, which he is appointed to bless and pray for. How shall he reconcile the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, who is himself at enmity with God? How shall the Holy Spirit of God descend upon the Symbols at his prayer who does perpetually grieve him, and quench his holy fires, and drive him quite away? How shall he that hath not tasted of the spirit by contemplation, stir up others to earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Celestial things? Or what good shall the people receive, when the Bishop layes upon their head a covetous or a cruel, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just or an impure hand? But therefore that I may use the words of S. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

all the people, there is not in the world a greater indecency then a holy office ministred by an unholy person, and no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er injury to the people, then that of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which God sends to them by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries Evangelical they should be cheated and defrauded by a wicked Steward. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was an excellent prayer which to this very purpose was by the son of <hi>Sirach</hi> made in behalf of the High Priests the sons of <hi>Aaron; [God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in Righteousness,</hi>

                     <hi>that their good things be not abolished, and that their glory may endure for ever.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the offices Ecclesiastical alwayes were, and ought to be conducted by the Episcopal order, as is evident in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal doctrine and practise of the primitive Church.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The consequent of this consideration is no other then the admonition in my text. <hi>We are Stewards of the manifold Grace of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> and dispensers of the mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and <hi>it is required of Stewards that they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105896:95"/>
be found faithful; that we preach the word of God in season and out of season, that we rebuke and exhort, admonish and correct</hi>; for these, God calls <hi>Pastores secundùm cor meum, Pastors according to his own heart, which feed the people with knowledge and understanding</hi>; but they must also <hi>comfort the afflicted and bind up the broken heart</hi>;<note place="margin">Jer. 3.15.</note> minister the Sacraments with great diligence, and righteous measures, and abundant charity, alwayes having in mind those passionate words of Christ to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> If thou lovest me, feed my sheep; If thou hast any love to me, feed my lambs.</p>
                  <p>And let us remember this also, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can enforce the people to obey their Bishops as they ought, but our doing that duty and charity to them which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. There is reason in these words of <hi>S. Chrysostom, [It is necessary that the Church should adhere to their Bishop as the body to the head, as plants to their roots, as rivers to their springs, as children to their Fathers, as Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to their Masters.</hi>] These similitudes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press not only the relation and dependency, but they tell us the reason of the duty. The head gives light and reason to conduct the body, the roots give nourishment to the plants, and the springs, perpetual emanation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105896:96"/>
of waters to the chanels. Fathers teach and feed their children, and Disciples receive wise instruction from their Masters: and if we be all this to the people, they will be all that to us; and wisdom will compel them to submit, and our humility will teach them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and our charity will invite their compliance. Our good example will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to good works, and our meekness will melt them into softness and flexibility. For all the Lords people are <hi>populus volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> a free and willing people; and we who cannot compel their bodies, must thus constrain their souls; by inviting their wills, by convincing their understandings, by the beauty of fair example, the efficacy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and the demonstrations of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>experimentum ejus qui in nobis loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Christus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13.7.</note> The experiment of Christ that speaketh in us. For to this purpose those are excellent words which S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake.

I could adde, how that Bishops were the cause that <hi>S. John</hi> wrote his Gospel; that the Christian Faith was for 300. years together bravely defended by the sufferings, the prisons and flames, the life and the death of Bishops, as the principal Combatants. That the Fathers of the Church whose writings are held in so great veneration in all the Christian World, were almost all of them Bishops. I could adde, that the Reformation of Religion in <hi>England</hi> was principally by the Preachings and the disputings, the writings and the Martyrdom of Bishops. That Bishops have ever since been the greatest defensatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery. That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were governed by Bishops ever since they were Christian, and under their conduct have for so many ages enjoyed all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Gospel. I could add also, that Episcopacy is the great stabiliment of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but of this we are convinced by a sad and too dear bought experience. I could therefore in stead of it, say, that Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy

That it endears obedience, and is subject to the Laws of Princes. And is wholly ordained for the good of mankind, and the benefit of Souls. But I cannot stay to number all the blessings which have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the World at this door: I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark these because they describe unto us the Bishops imployment, which is, to be busy in the service of Souls, to do good in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, to serve every mans need, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote all publick benefits, to cement Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to establish peace, to propagate the Kingdom of Christ, to do hurt to no man, to do good to every man; that is, so to minister, that Religion and Charity, publick peace, and private blessings may be in their exaltation.</p>
                  <p>As long as it was thus done by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bishops, the Princes and the people gave them all honour. Insomuch that by a decree of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, the Bishop
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105896:98"/>
had power given him to retract the sentences made by the Presidents of Provinces, and we find in the acts of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued some innocent persons from death when the executioner was ready to strike the fatal blow; which thing even when it fell into inconvenience, was indeed forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi>; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and honour was only changed, it was not taken away: for the condemned criminal had leave to appeal to the <hi>Audientia Episcopalis,</hi> to the Bishops Court. This was not any right which the Bishops could challenge, but a reward of their Piety; and so long as the Holy Office was holily admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, the world found so much comfort and security, so much justice and mercy, so many temporal and spiritual blessings conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the ministries of that order, that as the Galatians to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> men have plucked out their eyes to do them service, and to do them honour. For then Episcopacy did that good that God intended by it: it was a spiritual Government, by spiritual persons, for spiritual ends. Then the Princes and the people gave them honours because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and sought them not: then they gave them wealth, because they would dispend
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105896:98"/>
it wisely, frugally and charitably: Then they gave them power; because it was sure to be used for defence of the innocent, for relief of the oppressed, for the punishment of evil doers, and the reward of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. Then they desired to be judged by them, because their audiences or Courts did <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>My time is now done; and therefore I cannot speak to the third part of my text, the reward of the good Steward and of the bad; I shall only mention it to you in a short exhortation; and so conclude. In the Primitive Church a Bishop was never admitted to publick penance; not only because in them every crime is ten, and he that could descern a publick shame, could not deserve a publick honor, nor yet only because every such punishment was scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and did more evil by the example of the crime, then it could do good by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the punishment; but also because no spiritual power is higher then the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and therefore they were to be referred to the Divine judgment, which was likely to fall on them very heavily. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, punishment with the circumstances of detestation and exemplarity. Consider therefore what is your great duty. Consider what is your great danger. The lines of duty I have already described; only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how dear and pretious Souls are to God, since for their salvation Christ gave his bloud, and therefore will not easily lose them, whom though they had sin'd against him, yet he so highly valued; remember that you are Christs deputies in the care of Souls, and that you succeed in the place of the Apostles. <hi>Non est facilè stare loco Pauli, &amp; tenere gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Petri</hi>; You have undertaken the work of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Office of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and what think you upon this account will be required of us? S. <hi>Hierom</hi> expresses it thus. The wisdom and skill of a Bishop ought to be so great, that his countenance, his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, his motion, every thing should be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>ut quicquid agit, quicquid loquitur, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina sit Apostolorum</hi>: that whatever he does or speaks be doctrine Apostolical. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers had a pious opinion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Angel guardian which is appointed to the guard of every man; there is to every Bishop a second Angel appointed to him at the Consecration; and to this <hi>Origen</hi> alludes, saying that every Bishoprick hath two Angels,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105896:100"/>
the one visible and the other invisible. This is a great matter, and shews what a precious thing that order and those persons are in the eyes of God; but then this also means, that we should live Angelick lives, which the Church rarely well expresses by saying, that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal dignity is the Ecclesiastick state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and supposes the persons to be so far advanced in holiness, as to be in the state of confirmation in grace. But I shall say nothing of these things; because it may be they press too hard, but the use I shall make of it upon occasion of the reward of the good and bad Steward, is to remind you of your great danger. For if it be required of Bishops to be so wise and so holy, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious and so careful, so busy and so good up to the height of best examples; if they be anointed of the Lord, and are the Husbands of the Churches, if they be the Shepherds of the flock, and Stewards of the houshould; it is very fit they consider their danger, that they may be careful to do their duty. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> considers it well in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Henry Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Sens</hi>; If I lying in my Cell, and smoaking under a Bushel, not shining, yet cannot avoid the breath of the winds, but that my light is almost blown

Souls committed to the care and conduct of some one Shepherd, who yet will find his own Soul work enough for all his care and watchfulness. If any man should desire me to carry a Frigat into the Indies, in which a 100. men were imbarqued; I were a mad man to undertake the charge, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable skill; and therefore when there is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

in the undertaking, and greatest care in the conduct.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account we find many brave persons in the first and in the middle ages of the Church with great resolution refusing Episcopacy. I will not speak of those who for fear of Martyrdom declined it: but those who for fear of damnation did refuse. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was by three rich Cities severally called to be their Bishop, and by two to be their Archbishop, and he refused them; S. <hi>Dominicus</hi> refused four successively; S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> refused the Archbishoprick of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius</hi> would not accept of <hi>Valentia,</hi> or <hi>Ilerda,</hi> and <hi>Bernardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Senensis</hi> refused the Bishopricks of <hi>Sens Vrbin</hi> and <hi>Ferrara.</hi> They had reason; and yet if they had done amiss in that Office which they declined, it had been something more excusable; but if they that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the Primitive Church (as the Ecclesiastick Histories observe,) when they deposed a Bishop from his office, ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his crime, and made no record of it; yet remember this, that God does, and will call us to a strict and severe account.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Ought not to dispute your commands for the printing my Sermon of <hi>Obedience</hi>; lest my Sermon should be <hi>protestatio contra factum:</hi> here I know my Example would be the best Use to this Doctrine, and I am sure to find no inconveniency so great as that of Disobedience; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I be confident that I am wise in any thing but when I obey; for then I have the wisdome of my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour for my warrant, or my excuse. I remember the saying of <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Aequius est me tot &amp; talium amicorum consilium, quam tot tales meam unius voluntatem sequi.</hi> I could easily have pretended excuses, but that day I had taught others the contrary; and I would not shed that Chalice which
<pb facs="tcp:105896:107"/>
my own hands had newly filled with waters issuing from the fountains of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>My eyes are almost grown old with seeing the horrid mischiefs which came from Rebellion and Disobedience; and I would willingly now be blessed with observation of Peace and Righteousness, Plenty and Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which do already, and I hope shall for ever, attend upon Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the best KING and the best CHURCH in the world. I see no objection against my hopes, but that which ought least of all in this case to be pretended. Men pretend Conscience against Obedience; expressly against Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, teaching us to <hi>obey for conscience sake</hi>; but to disobey for Conscience in a thing indifferent, is never to be found in the books of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>It is very hard when the Prince is forc'd to say to his rebellious Subject, as God did to his stubborn people, <hi>Quid faciam tibi?</hi> I have tried all the waies I can to bring thee home, and what shall I now doe unto thee? The Subject should rather say, <hi>Quid me vis facere</hi>? What wilt thou have me to doe? This Question is the best end of disputations. <hi>Corrumpitur atque dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur Imperantis officium, si quis ad id quod facere jussus est, non obsequio debito, sed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio non considerato respondeat,</hi> said one in <hi>A. Gellius.</hi> When a Subject is commanded to obey, and
<pb facs="tcp:105896:107"/>
he disputes, and saies, <hi>Nay,</hi> but the other is better, he is like a servant that gives his Master necessary counsel, when he requires of him a necessary obedience. <hi>Utilius parére edicto quam efferre consilium,</hi> he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obey then give counsel: by how much it is better to be profitable then to be witty, to be full of goodness ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then full of talk and argument.</p>
                  <p>But all this is acknowledged true in strong men, but not in the weak; in vigorous, but not in tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: for Obedience is strong meat, and will not down with weak stomacks. As if in the world any thing were easier then to obey: for we see that the food of Children is milk and lawes; the breast-milk of their Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the commands of their Parents is all that food and Government by which they are kept from harm and hunger, and conducted to life and wisdome. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are weak brethren, of all things in the world have the least reason to pretend an excuse for disobedience, for nothing can secure them but the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Laws: for they are like Children in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; they cannot be trusted to their own conduct, and therefore must live at the publick charge, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Superiors is their guide and their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And this was wisely advised by S. <hi>Paul, Him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtfull disputations:</hi> that's not the way for him; Children
<pb facs="tcp:105896:108"/>
must not dispute with their Fathers and their Masters. If old men will dispute, let them look to it; that's meat for the strong indeed, though it be not very nutritive: but the Laws and the Counsels, the Exhortations and the Doctrines of our Spiritual Rulers, are the measures by which God hath appointed Babes in Christ to become Men, and the weak to become strong; and they that are not to be received to doubtful disputations, are to be received with the arms of love into the imbraces of a certain and regular Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But it would be considered, that Tenderness of Conscience is an equivocal terme, and does not alwaies signifie in a good sense. For a Child is of a tender flesh; but he whose foot is out of joint, or hath a bile in his arme, or hath strained a sinew, is much more tender. The <hi>tenderness of age</hi> is that weakness that is in the ignorant and new beginners: the <hi>tenderness of a bile,</hi> that is soreness indeed rather then tenderness, is of the diseased, the abused, and the mis-perswaded. The first indeed are to be tenderly dealt with, and have usages accordingly: but that is the same I have already told; you must teach them, you must command them, you must guide them, you must chuse for them, you must be their guardians, and they must comport themselves accordingly. But for that <hi>tenderness of Conscience</hi> which is the <hi>disease</hi> and <hi>soreness of Conscience,</hi> it
<pb facs="tcp:105896:108"/>
must be cured by anodynes and soft usages, unless they prove ineffective, and that the Launcet be necessary. But there are amongst us such tender stomacks, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure Milk, but can very well digest Iron; Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences so tender, that a Ceremony is greatly offensive, but Rebellion is not; a Surplice drives them away as a bird affrighted with a man of clouts, but their Consciences can suffer them to despise Government, and speak evil of Dignities, and curse all that are not of their Opinion, and disturb the peace of Kingdomes, and commit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and account Schisme the character of Saints. The true Tenderness of Conscience is <hi>1.</hi> that which is impatient of a sin; <hi>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi> it will not endure any thing that looks like it; and <hi>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi> it will not give offence. Now since all Sin is Disobedience, <hi>1.</hi> it will be rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent that a man in a Christian Common-wealth shall be tied to disobey, to avoid <hi>sin:</hi> and certain it is, if such a case could happen, yet <hi>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi> nothing of our present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions is so <hi>like a sin,</hi> as when we refuse to obey the Laws; to stand in a clean Vestment is not so ill a sight as to see men stand in separation, and to kneel at the Communion is not so <hi>like</hi> Idolatry as <hi>Rebellion</hi> is to <hi>Witchcraft:</hi> and then <hi>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi> for the matter of <hi>giving offences,</hi> what scandal is greater then that which scandalizes the Laws? and who is so carefully to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, lest he be offended, as the KING? And if that
<pb facs="tcp:105896:109"/>
which offends the weak brother is to be avoided, much more that which offends the strong; for this is certainly really criminal, but for the other it is much oddes but it is mistaken. And when the case is so put, between the obedient and the disobedient, which shall be offended, and one will, I suppose there is no question but the Laws will take more care of Subjects then of Rebels, and not weaken them in their duty in compliance with those that hate the Laws, and will not endure the Government.</p>
                  <p>And after all this, in the conduct of Government what remedy can there be to those that call themselves Tender Consciences? I shall not need say that every man can easily pretend it; for we have seen the vilest part of mankind, men that have done things so horrid, worse then which the Sun never saw, yet pretend tender Consciences against Ecclesiastical Laws: but I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that they are really such, that they in the simplicity of their hearts follow <hi>Absolom,</hi> and in weakness hide their heads in little Conventicles and places of separation for a trifle; what would they have done for themselves?</p>
                  <p>If you make a Law of Order, and in the sanction put a clause of favour for tender Consciences, do not you invite every Subject to Disobedience by impunity, and teach him how to make his own excuse? is not such a Law, a Law without an obligation? may not every man chuse whether he will obey or no? and if he pretends to
<pb facs="tcp:105896:109"/>
disobey out of Conscience, is not he that disobeyes equally innocent with the obedient; altogether as just, as not having done any thing without leave, and yet much more Religious and conscientious? <hi>Quicunque vult</hi> is but an ill preface to a Law; and it is a strange obligation that makes no difference between him that obeyes and him that refuses to obey.</p>
                  <p>But what course must be taken with tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? Shall the execution of the Law be suspended as to all such persons? that will be all one with the former: for if the execution be commanded to be suspended, then the obligation of the Law by command is taken away, and then it were better there were no Law made. And indeed that is the pretension, that is the secret of the business; they suppose the best way to prevent Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to take away all Laws. It is a short way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; there shall then be no Disobedience, but at the same time there shall be no Government: but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is worse then the Disease; and to take away all Wine and strong drink to prevent Drunkenness would not be half so great a folly.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore tell what to advise in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but that every <hi>Spiritual guide</hi> should consider who are tender Consciences and who are weak brethren, and use all the waies of piety and prudence to instruct and to inform them, that they may increase in knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:105896:110"/>
and spiritual understanding. But they that will be alwaies learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth, they that will be children of a hundred years old and never come to years of discretion, they are very unfit to guide others, and to be Curates of Souls: but they are most unfit to reprove the Laws, and speak against the wisdome of a Nation, when it is confessed that they are so weak, that they understand not the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Liberty which Christ hath purchased for them, but are servants to a scruple, and affrighted at a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, and in bondage under an indifferent thing, an so much Idolaters of their Sect or Opinion as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it before all their own nobler interests, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their brother, and the Peace of a whole Church and Nation.</p>
                  <p>To you, my Lords and Gentlemen, I hope I may say as <hi>Marcus Curius</hi> said to a stubborn young man, <hi>Non opus Vos habere cive qui parére nesciret</hi>; the Kingdome hath no need of those that know not how to obey. But as for them who have weak and tender Consciences, they are in the state of Childhood and mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but then you know that a Child is never happy by having his own humor: if you chuse for him, and make him to use it, he hath but one thing to doe; but if you put him to please himself, he is troubled with every thing, and satisfied with nothing. We find that all Christian
<pb facs="tcp:105896:110"/>
Churches kept this Rule. They kept themselves and others close to the rule of Faith, and peaceably suffered one another to differ in Ceremonies, but suffered no difference amongst their own: they gave Liberty <hi>to other Churches,</hi> and gave Laws, and no Liberty, <hi>to their own Subjects.</hi> And at this day the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Geneva, France, Switzerland, Germany, Low Countries,</hi> tye all their people to their own Laws, but tye up no mans Conscience; if he be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded as they are, let him charitably dissent, and leave that Government, and adhere to his own Communion. If you be not of their mind, they will be served by them that are: they will not trouble your Conscience, and you shall not disturb their Government. But when men think they cannot enjoy their Conscience unless you give them good Livings, and if you prefer them not, you afflict their Consciences, they do but too evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it is not their Consciences but their Profits they would have secured. Now to these I have only this to say, That their Conscience is to be enjoyed by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of God's Word, but the Rule for their Estates is the Laws of the Kingdome: and <hi>I shew you yet a more excellent way</hi>; Obedience is the best security for both; because this is the best conservatory of Charity and Truth and Peace. <hi>Si vis brevi perfectus esse, esto obediens etiam in minimis,</hi> was the saying of
<pb facs="tcp:105896:111"/>
a Saint; and the world uses to look for Miracles from them whom they shall esteem Saints: but I had rather see a man truly humble and obedient, then to see him raise a man from the dead, said old <hi>Pachomius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to conclude: if weak brethren shall still plead for Toleration and Compliance, I hope my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops will consider where it can doe good and doe no harm, where they are permitted, and where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are bound up by the Laws, and in all things where it is safe and holy to labour to bring them ease and to give them remedy: but to think of removing the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease by feeding the Humor, I confess it is a strange cure to our present Distempers. He that took clay and spittle to open the blind eyes can make any thing be <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrium</hi>; but he alone can doe it. But whether any humane power can bring good from so unlikely an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if any man desires yet to be better informed, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him, besides the calling to mind the late sad effects of Schime, to remember that no Church in Christendome ever did it. It is neither the way of Peace nor Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor yet a proper remedy for the cure of a weak Conscience.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore pray to God that these men who separate in simplicity may by God's mercy be brought to understand their own Liberty, and that they may not for ever be babes and <hi>Neophytes,</hi> and wax old in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles;
<pb facs="tcp:105896:111"/>
and for ever stay at entrances and outsides of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but that they would pass <hi>in interiora domûs,</hi> and seek after Peace and Righteousness, Holiness and Justice, the love of God and Evangelical perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then they will understand how ill-advised they are who think Religion consists in zeal against Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and speaking evil of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, what I said in pursuance of publick Peace and private Duty, and some little inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to both, I now humbly present to you, more to shew my own Obedience then to re-mind you of your Duty, which hitherto you have so well observed in your amicable and sweet concord of counsels and affections, during this present Session. I owe many thanks to you who heard me patiently, willingly and kindly; I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to please God, and I find I did not displease you: but he is the best hearer of a Sermon who first loves the Doctrine, and then practises it; and that you have hitherto done, very piously and very prosperously. I pray God continue to direct your Counsels so that you in all things may please him, and in all things be blessed by him, that <hi>all generations may call you blessed</hi> Instruments of a lasting Peace, the restorers of the old paths, the Patrons of the Church, friends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Subjects fitted for your Prince, who is Just up to the greatest example, and Merciful beyond all
<pb facs="tcp:105896:112"/>
examples, a Prince who hath been nourished, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and restored, and blessed by Miracles; a Prince whose Vertues and Fortunes are equally the greatest.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105896:113"/>
For either the authority is incompetent, or the law it self is <hi>Statutum non bonum,</hi> or it is impossible to be kept, or at least very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and we are to be reliev'd in equity, or there is a secret dispensation, and it does not bind in my particular case, or not now; or it is but the law of a man, and was made for a certain end; or it does not bind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but 'twas only for Political regards; or, if the worst happen, I will obey pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, and then I am innocent. Thus every man snuffes up the wind, like <hi>the wild asses in the wilderness,</hi> and thinks that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is an incroachment upon a mans birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and in the mean time never considers that Christ took upon him our Nature that he might learn us Obedience, and in that also make us become like unto God. In his Justice and his Mercy he was imitable before; but before the Incarnation of Christ we could not in passive graces imitate God who was impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But he was pleased at a great rate to set forward this duty; and when himself became obedient in the hardest point, <hi>obediens usque ad mortem,</hi> and is now become to us <hi>the author and finisher of our Obedience,</hi> as well as of <hi>our Faith,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105896:113"/>
admonetur omnis aetas fieri posse quod aliquando factum est.</hi> We must needs confess it very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to obey the severest of the divine laws, even to dye if God commands, because it was already done by a man; and we must needs confess it excellent, because it was done by God himself.</p>
                     <p>But this great Example is of universal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the whole matter of Obedience. For that I may speak of that part of this Duty which can be useful, and concerns us; Men do not deny but they must obey in all Civil things, but in Religion they have a Supreme, <hi>God only,</hi> and Conscience is his interpreter; and in effect every man must be the Judge whether he shall obey or no. Therefore it is that I say, the Example of our Lord is the great determination of this inquiry: for he did obey and suffer, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Superiors under whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was placed; he <hi>gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to the nippers</hi>; he kept the orders of the Rulers, and the customes of the Synagogues, the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the rights of the Temple; and by so doing <hi>he fulfilled all righteousness.</hi> Christ made no distinctions in

his Obedience, but obeyed God <hi>in all things,</hi> and those that God set over him <hi>in all things according to God,</hi> and in things of Religion most of all; because to obey was of it self a great instance of Religion, and if ever Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion comes to be pretended against Obedience in any thing where our Superior can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it is imposture: For that is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of my text, <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice.</hi> Our own judgment, our own opinion is the sacrifice, seldome fit to be offered to God, but most commonly deserving to be consumed by fire: but take it at the best, it is not half so good as <hi>Obedience</hi>; for <hi>that</hi> was indeed <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and (as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s sword, <hi>non est alter talis</hi>) there is no other sacrifice that can be half so good: and when <hi>Abraham</hi> had lifted up his sacrificing knife to slay his Son, and so express'd his obedience, God would have no more; he had the Obedience, and he cared not for the Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Sacrifice</hi> here then is meant the external and contingent actions of Religion; by <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is meant submission to Authority, and observing the command. <hi>Obedience</hi> is a not chusing our Duty, a not disputing with our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105896:114"/>
Betters, not to argue, not to delay, not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure; it is not this, but it is much better; for it is <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Usefulness,</hi> and I think these do <hi>reductively</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that is excellent in the whole conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Graces.</p>
                     <p>My Text is a perfect Proposition, and hath no special remark in the words of it; but is only a great representation of the most useful Truth to all Kingdomes and Parliaments and Councels and Authorities in the whole world: It is your Charter, and the Sanction of your authority, and the stabiliment of your Peace, and the honour of your Laws, and the great defence of your Religion, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and the guarding of the King's Throne. It is that by which all the Societies in heaven and earth are firm: without this you cannot have a Village prosperous, or a Ship arrive in harbour. It is that which God hath bound upon us by hope and fear, by wrath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, by duty and necessity. Obedience is the formality of all Vertues, and every Sin is Disobedience. There can no greater thing be said, unless you please to adde, that we never read that the earth opened and swallowed up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105896:115"/>
any man alive, but a company of rebellious disobedient people, who rose cup against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Prince of the People, and the Priest of God. For Obedience is the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thing in the world, and <hi>corruptio optimi est pessima</hi>:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nullum malum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feliciter feracius quam ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientia.</hi> Seneca.</note> Disobedience is the greatest evil in the world, and that alone which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it.</p>
                     <p>My text is instanced in the matter of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God; but yet the case is so, that though I shall in the first place discourse of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to man, I shall not set one foot aside from the main intention of it; because Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Superiors is <hi>really</hi> and is <hi>accounted</hi> to be Obedience to God, for they are sent by God, they are his vicegerents, his Ministers, and his Embassadors. <hi>Apostolus cujusque est quisque</hi> say the Jewes, Every mans Apostle is himself; and <hi>he that heareth or despiseth you,</hi> said Christ, <hi>heareth or despiseth me</hi>: And the reason is very evident, because it is not to be expected that God should speak to us by himself, but sometimes by Angels, sometimes by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, once by his Son, and alwaies by his Servants.</p>
                     <p>Now I desire two things to be observed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105896:115"/>First, We may as well perceive that God speaks to us when he uses the ministry of men as when he uses the ministry of Angels: one is as much declared and as certain as the other. And if it be said, a man may pretend to come from God, and yet deliver nothing but his own errand; that is no strange thing: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member also that S. <hi>Paul</hi> puts this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the case of an Angel, [<hi>If an Angel preach any other Gospel</hi>;] and we know that many Angels come like Angels of light, who yet teach nothing but the waies of Darkness. So that we are still as much bound to obey our Superior as to obey an Angel: a man is <hi>paulò minor angelis,</hi> a little lower then the Angels; but <hi>we</hi> are much lower then the King. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then with what fear and love we should receive an Angel, and so let us receive all those whom God hath sent to us, and set over us; for they are no less: less indeed in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but not in their Authorities. Nay the case is nearer yet; for we are not only bound to receive God's Deputies as God's Angel, but as God himself. For it is the power of God in the hand of a man, and <hi>he that resists, resists God's ordinance.</hi> And I pray remember
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105896:116"/>
that there is not only no power greater then God's, but there is no other; for all Power is his. The consequent of this is plain enough; I need say no more of it: It is all one to us who commands, God, or God's Vicegerent. This was the first thing to be observed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there can be but two things in the world requir'd to make Obedience neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, the greatness of the Authority, and the worthiness of the Thing. In the first you see the case can have no difference, because the thing it self is but one. There is but one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the world, and that is God's: as there is but one Sun whose light is diffused into all Kingdomes. But is there not great difference in the Thing commanded? Yes certainly, there is some; but nothing to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant disbobedience: for whatever the thing be, it may be commanded by man, if it be not countermanded by God. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not required that every thing commanded should of it self be necessary;</hi> for God himself oftentimes commands things which have in them no other excellency then that of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. What made <hi>Abraham</hi> the friend of God? and what made his offer to kill his Son to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105896:116"/>
so pleasing to God? It had been naturally no very great good to cut the throat of a little child; but only that it was Obedience. What excellency was there in the journeys of the Patriarchs from <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> to <hi>Syria,</hi> from the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi>? and what thanks could the sons of <hi>Israel</hi> deserve that they sate still upon the seventh day of the week? and how can a man be dearer unto God by keeping of a Feast, or building of a Booth, or going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or cutting off the foreskin of a boy, or washing their hands and garments in fair water? There was nothing in these things but the Obedience. And when our blessed Lord himself came to his Servant to take of him the Baptisme of Repentance, alas, he could take nothing but the water and the ceremony: for, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, he was <hi>nullius poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae debitor,</hi> he was indeed <hi>a just person and needed no repentance</hi>; but even so <hi>it became him to fulfil all righteousness</hi>: but yet even <hi>then</hi> it was that the Holy Spirit did descend upon his holy head, and crown'd that Obedience, though it were but to a ceremony. <hi>Obedience,</hi> you see, <hi>may be necessary when the law is not so.</hi> For in these cases, God's Son and God's Servants did obey
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105896:117"/>
in things which were made good only by the commandement: and if we doe so in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of humane Laws, there is nothing to be said against it, but that what was not of it self necessary, is made so by the authority of the Commander and the force of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. But there is more in it then so. For,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, We pretend to be willing to obey even in things <hi>naturally not necessary,</hi> if a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand does interpose; but if it be only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of man, and the thing be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary of it self, then we desire to be excus'd. But will we doe nothing else? We our selves will doe many things that God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and may not our Superiors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us in many cases to doe what we may lawfully doe without a commandement? Can we become a law unto our selves, and cannot the word and power of our Superiors also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a law unto us? hath God given more to a private then to a publick hand? But consider the ill consequents of this fond opinion. Are all the practices of <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> recorded in the Word of God? are the trifling Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their publick Penance recorded in the four Gospels? are all the rules of decency,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105896:117"/>
and all <hi>things that are of good report,</hi> and all the measures of prudence, and the laws of peace and war, and the customes of the Churches of God, and the lines of publick honesty, are all these described to us by the laws of God? If they be, let us see and read them, that we may have an end to all questions and minute cases of Conscience: but if they be not, and yet by the Word of God these are bound upon us in the general, and no otherwise; then it follows that the particulars of all these, which <hi>may be</hi> infinite, and <hi>are</hi> innumerable, yet may be the matter of humane Laws; and then are bound upon us by the power of God put into the hands of man. The consequent is this, that whatsoever is commanded by our Superior according to the will of God, or whatsoever is not against it, is of necessity to be obey'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, But what if our Princes or our Prelates command things against the Word of God? what then? Why nothing then, but that we must obey God and not man; there's no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of that. But what then again? Why therefore saies the Papist I will not obey the Protestant Kings, because against the Word of God they command me to come to Church
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105896:118"/>
where Heresy is preached; and I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Bishops, saith the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, because they are against the discipline and scepter of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ; and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hates Parochial meetings, and is wholly for a gathered Church, and supposes this to be the practice Apostolical; and I will not bring my Child to Baptisme, (saith the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist) because God calls none but believers to that Sacrament; and I will acknowledge no Clergy, no Lord, no Master, saith the Quaker, because Christ commands us to <hi>call no man master on the earth,</hi> and <hi>be not called of men Rabbi.</hi> And if you call upon these men to obey the Authority God hath set over them, they tell you with one voice, with all their hearts, as far as the Word of God will give them leave; but God is to be obey'd, and not man: and therefore if you put the Laws in execution against them, they will obey you passively, because you are stronger, and so long as they know it they will not stir against you; but they in the mean time are little less then Martyrs, and you no better then Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105896:118"/>What shall we doe now? for here is evidently a great heap or disorder: they all confess that authority must be obey'd; but when you come to the trial, none of them all will doe it, and they think they are not bound: but because their Opinions being contrary cannot all be right, and it may be none of them are, it is certain that all this while Authority is infinitely wronged and prejudiced amongst them, when all fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick Opinions shall be accounted a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason to despise it. I hope the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian will joyn with the Protestant, and say that the Papist, and the Socinian, and the Independent, and the Anabaptist, and the Quaker are guilty of Rebellion and Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience for all their pretence of the Word of God to be on their side: and I am more sure that all these will joyn with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and say that the Presbyterian hath no reason to disobey Authority upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their new Government concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they do but <hi>dream dreams,</hi> when they think <hi>they see visions.</hi> Certain it is that the biggest part of dissenters in the whole world are criminally disobedient; and it is a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105896:119"/>
thousand to one but that Authority is in the right against them, and ought to be obey'd. It remains now in the next place, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Authority is to doe in this case, and what these Sectaries and Recusants are to doe; for these are two things worth inquiry,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning Authority. All disagreeing persons, to cover their foul shame of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Disobedience, pretend Conscience for their Judge, and the Scripture for their Law. Now if these men think that by this means they proceed safely, upon the same ground the Superior may doe what he thinks to be his duty, and be at least as safe as they. If the Rebellious Subject can think that by God's Law he ought not to obey; the Prince may at the same time think that by God's Law he ought to punish him: and it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he is justly punished, as he thinks it certain he reasonably disobeys. Or is the Conscience of the Superior bound to relaxe his lawes, if the inferior tells him so? Can the Prince give Laws to the peoples will; and can the people give measures to the Princes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? If any one of the people can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe or make it necessary to change the Law,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105896:119"/>
then every one can; and by this time every new Opinion will introduce a new Law, and that Law shall be obey'd by him only that hath a mind to it, and that will be a strange Law that binds a man only to doe his own pleasure. But because the King's Conscience is to him as sure a Rule as the Conscience of any disobedient Subject can be to himself, the Prince is as much bound to doe his duty in Government, as the other can be to follow his Conscience in disagreeing; and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will be, that whether the Subject be right or wrong in the disputation, it is certain he hath the just reward of Disobedience in the conclusion. If one mans Conscience can be the measure of another mans action, why shall not the Princes Conscience be the Subject's measure? but if it cannot, then the Prince is not to depart: from his own Conscience, but proceed according to the Laws which he judges just and reasonable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Superior is tied by the laws of Christian Charity so far to bend in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his Laws, as to pity the invincible Ignorance and Weakness of his abused people, <hi>qui devoratur à malis Pastoribus</hi> (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105896:120"/>
expression is) that are devour'd by their evill Shepheards: but this is to last no longer then till the Ignorance can be cured, and the man be taught his duty; for whatsoever comes after this looks so like Obstinacy, that no Laws in the world judge it to be any thing else. And then secondly, this also is to be understood to be the duty of Superiors only in matters of mere Opinion, not relating to Practice. For no mans Opinion must be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to doe mischief, to disturb the Peace, to dishonour the Government: not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every disagreeing person can to serve his end pretend his Conscience, and so claim im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity for his Villany; but also because those things which concern the good of mankind and the Peace of Kingdomes are so plainly taught, that no man who thinks himself so wise as to be fit to oppose Authority, can be so foolish as in these things not to know his Duty. In other things, if the Opinion does neither bite nor scratch, if it dwells at home in the house of understanding, and wanders not into the out-houses of Passion and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar orations, the Superior imposes no laws, and exacts no obedience, and destroies no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105896:120"/>
liberty, and gives no restraint. This is the part of Authority.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next enquiry is, What must the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Subject doe when he supposes the Superiors command is against the Law of God? I answer that if he thinks so, and thinks true, he must not obey his Superior in that: but because most men that think so think amiss, there are many particulars fit by such persons to be consider'd.</p>
                     <p>1. Let such men think charitably of others, and that all are not fools or mad-men who are not of the same Opinion with themselves or their own little party. 2. Let him think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as fallible and subject to mistake as other men are. 3. But let him by no means think that every Opinion of his is an Inspiration from God; for that is the pride and madness of a pretended Religion: such a man is to be cured by Physick; for he could not enter <hi>into that</hi> perswasion by Reason or Experience, and therefore it must enter <hi>into him</hi> by folly or the anger of God. 4. From hence it will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that he ought to think his Opinion to be uncertain, and that he ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself like the man that is too confident;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105896:121"/>
but because his Obedience is Duty, and his Duty certain, he will find it more wise and safe and holy to leave that which is disputable, and pursue that which is demonstrable; to change his uncertain Opinion for his certain Duty. For it is twenty to one but he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Opinion; but if he be, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that whatsoever his Conscience be, yet in his separation from Authority he is a sinner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every man who by his Opinion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged against Authority, should doe well to study his doubtful Opinion less, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Obedience more. But you say, that this concerns not me, for my disagreeing is not in a doubtful matter, but I am sure I am in the right; there is no <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands</hi> in my case. Well, it may be so: but were it not better that you did doubt? <hi>A wise man feareth</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) and departeth from evil; but a fool rageth and is confident</hi>: and the difference between a Learned man and a Novice is this, that the yong fellow crieth out, I am sure it is so; the better learned answers, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, possibly it may, and peradventure it is so, but I pray enquire: and he is the best <hi>Diviner,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he is the best
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105896:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Judge that conjectures best, not he that is most confident; for, as <hi>Xenophanes</hi> said wisely, <hi>Man does but conjecture, but God only knows</hi>; and it is no disparagement to a wise man to learn, and by suspecting the fallibility of things and his own aptness to mistake, to walk pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and safely, with an eye to God, and an eare open to his Superior. Some men are drunk with fancy, and mad with Opinion. Who believe more strongly then boyes and women? who are so hard to be perswaded as fools? and who so readily suspect their teachers as they who are govern'd by chance, and know not the intrinsick measures of good and evil? <hi>Qui pauca considerat de facili pronunciat</hi>; it is a little learning and not enough that makes men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hastily, and clap fast hold on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion before they have well weighed the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses: but Experience and Humility would teach us Modesty and Fear.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In all disputes he that obeys his Superior can never be a <hi>Heretick in the estimate of Law,</hi> and he can never be a <hi>Schismatick in the point of Conscience</hi>; so that he certainly avoids one great death, and very probably the other. <hi>Res judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata pro veritate accipitur,</hi> saith the Law; If the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105896:122"/>
Judge have given sentence, that sentence is suppos'd a truth: and <hi>Cassiodor</hi> said according to the sentence of the Law, <hi>Nimis iniquum est ut ille patiatur dispendium, qui imperium fecit alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Our Obedience secures us from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of evil, and Error does but seldome goe in company with Obedience. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is this advantage to be gotten by <hi>Obedience;</hi> that he who prefers the sentence of the Law before his own Opinion does doe an act of great Humility, and exercises the grace of Modesty, and takes the best way to secure his Conscience and the publick Peace, and pleases the Government which he is bound to please, and pursues the excellencies of Unity, and promotes Charity and Godly Love: whereas on the other side, he that goes by himself apart from his Superior is alwaies materially a Schismatick, and is more likely to be deceiv'd by his own Singularity and Prejudice and Weakness, then by following the guides God hath set over him. And if he loses Truth, certainly he will get nothing else: for by so doing we lose our Peace too, and give publick offence, and arme Authority against us, and are scandalous in Law, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105896:122"/>
pull evil upon our heads; and all this for a proud Singularity, or a trifling Opinion, in which we are not so likely to be deceived, if we trust our selves less, and the publick more. <hi>In omnibus falli possum, in obedientia non possum,</hi> said S. <hi>Teresa,</hi> I can in every thing else, but in Obedience I can never be deceived. And it is very remarkable in my Text, that <hi>Rebellion</hi> or Disobedience is compared to <hi>the sin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</hi> Indeed it seems strange, for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is not only that a Rebel is as much hated by God as a Witch, but it means that the sinnes are alike in their very natures: <hi>quasi peccatum divinationis</hi> (saith the Vulgar <hi>Latine</hi>) they that disobey Authority, trusting in their own opinions, are but like Witches or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that is, they are led by an evil spirit; pride and a lying and deceiving spirit is their teacher, and their answers are seldome true; for though they pretend the Truth of God for their Disobedience, yet <hi>they fall into the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the devil,</hi> and that's the end of their soothsaying. And let me adde this, that when a man distrusts his Superior and trusts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he misses Truth, it will be greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him; he shall feel the evil of his error
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105896:123"/>
and the shame of his pride, the reproach of his folly and the punishment of his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the dishonour of singularity, and the restlesness of Schisme, and the scorn of the multitude: but on the other side, if he obey Authority, and yet be deceived, he is greatly excused, he erred on the safer side, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the hands of many vertues, and gets peace and love of the Congregation.</p>
                     <p>You see the Blessings of Obedience, even in the questions and matters of Religion: but I have something more to say, and it is not only of great use to appease the tumultuary disputations and arguings of Religion which have lately disturbed these Nations, but is proper to be spoken to, and to be reduced to practice by this Honourable and High Court of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>That which I am to say is this; You have no other way of Peace, no better way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease and quiet the Quarrels in Religion which have been too long among us, but by reducing all men to Obedience, and all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to the measures of the Laws. For they on both sides pretend Scripture, but one side onely can pretend to the Laws: and they that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105896:123"/>
do admit no authority above their own to expound Scripture, cannot deny but Kings and Parliaments are the makers and proper expounders of our Laws; and if ever you mean to have <hi>Truth and Peace kiss each other,</hi> let no man dispute against your Laws. For did not our Blessed Saviour say, that an Oath is the end of all questions, and after depositions are taken, all Judges goe to sentence? What Oaths are to private questions, that Laws are to publick. And if it be said that Laws may be mistaken; it is true, but may not an Oath also be a Perjury? and yet because in humane affairs we have no greater certainty, and greater then God gives we may not look for, let the Laws be the last determination; and in wise and religious Governments no disputation is to goe beyond them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But this is not onely true in religious prudence and plain necessity, but this is the way that God hath appointed, and that he hath blessed, and that he hath intended to be the means of ending all questions. This we learn from S. <hi>Paul, I exhort that first of all prayers,</hi>

that are in Authority.</hi> For all; for Parliaments and for Councils, for Bishops and for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: it is for all, and for Kings above all. Well, to what purpose is all this? <hi>that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</hi> Mark that: Kings and all that are in Authority are by God appointed to be the means of obtaining unity and peace in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="3">3. And indeed because this is God's way of ending our Controversies, the matter of Authority is highly to be regarded. If you suffer the Authority of the King to be lessened, to be scrupled, to be denied in Ecclesiastical affairs, you have no way left to silence the tongues and hands of gainsaying people. But so it is, the Kings Authority is appointed and enabled by God to end our questions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:<note place="margin">Prov. 16.10.</note>

infallibility, but by this it appears there is divinity in the Kings sentence: for God gives to Kings, who are his Vicegerents, a peculiar spirit.<note place="margin">L. 8. cod. de veteri jure enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleando.</note> And when <hi>Justinian</hi> had out of the sense of <hi>Julian</hi> the Lawyer observed that there were many cases for which Law made no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he addes, <hi>If any such shall happen, Augustum imploretur remedium,</hi> run to the King for remedy; <hi>for therefore God hath set the Imperial fortune over humane affairs, ut possit omnia quae noviter contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt &amp; emendare &amp; componere, &amp; modis ac regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis competentibus tradere,</hi> that the King may amend and rule and compose every new-ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing question. And it is not to be despised, but is a great indication of this Truth, that the Answers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes and Judges recorded in the Civil Law are such that all Nations of the world do approve them, and are a great testimony how the sentences of Kings ought to be valued, even in matters of Religion, and questions of greatest doubt. <hi>Bona conscientia Scyphus est Josephi,</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105896:125"/>
let the sentence of his Laws be our last resort, and no questions be permitted after his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and legal determination. For Wisedome saith, <hi>By me Princes rule, by me they decree justice</hi>: and therefore the spirit of the King is a divine eminency, and is as the spirit of the most High God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let no man be too busy in disputing the laws of his Superiors, for a man by that seldome gets good to himself, but seldome misses to doe mischief unto others. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105896:125"/>
from a strangled hen or a bloody pudding could not of themselves be necessary; but the commandement came, authority did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and then they were made so.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But then besides the advantages both of the spirit, and the authority of Kings in matters of question, the laws and decrees of a National Church ought upon the account of their own advantages be esteem'd as a final sentence in all things disputed. The thing is a plain command <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.7. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God</hi>: this tels what Rulers he means; Rulers Ecclesiastical: and what of them? <hi>whose faith follow;</hi> they must <hi>praeire in articulis</hi>; they are not masters of your faith, but guides of it: and <hi>they that sit in Moses chair</hi> must be heard and obey'd, said our blessed Saviour. These words were not said for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and they were nothing if their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were nothing.</p>
                     <p>For between the laws of a Church and the opinion of a Subject the comparison is the same as between a publick spirit and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. The publick is far the better, the daughter of God, and the mother of a blessing,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105896:126"/>
and alwaies dwels in light. The publick spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath already passed the trial, it hath been <hi>subjected to the Prophets,</hi> tried and searched and approved; the private is yet to be examined. The publick spirit is uniform and apt to be followed; the private is various and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as chance, and no man can follow him that hath it. For if he follows one, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a thousand; and if he changes, he may get a shame, but no truth: and he can never rest but in the arms and conduct of his Superior. When <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> murmured against <hi>Moses,</hi> God told them that they were Prophets of an inferior rank then <hi>Moses</hi> was. God communicated himself to them in dreams and visions;<note place="margin">

And this is the full case of the private and publick spirit; that is, of a Subject speaking against the spirit and the laws of the Church. In heaven, and in the air,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105896:126"/>
and in all the regions of spirits, the spirit of a lower order dares not speak against the spirit of an higher; and therefore for a private spirit to oppose the publick, is a disorder greater then is in hell it self.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this point; Let us consider whether it were not an intolerable mischief if the Judges should give sentence in causes of instance by the measures of their own fancy, and not by the Laws; who would endure them? and yet why may they not doe that as well as any Ecclesiastic person preach Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not which the Laws allow, but what is taught him by his own private Opinion? but he that hath the Laws on his side, hath ever something of true Religion to warrant him, and can never want a great measure of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Laws and the customes of the country are the results of wise counsels or long experience; they ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Peace and publick benefit: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this can be said of private Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for they break the Peace, and trouble the Conscience, and undo Government, and despise the Laws, and offend Princes, and dishonour the wisdome of Parliaments, and destroy Obedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105896:127"/>Well, but in the last place, if we cannot doe what the Laws command, we will suffer what they impose; and then all is well again. But first, who ever did so that could help it? And secondly, this talking of passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is but a mockery; for what man did ever say the Laws were not good, but he also said the Punishment was unjust? And thirdly, which of all the Recusants did not endeavour to get ground upon the Laws, and secretly or openly asperse the Authority that put him to pain for doing that which he calls his duty? and can any man boast of his passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that calls it Persecution? he may think to please himself, but he neither does or saies any thing that is for the reputation of the Laws. Such men are like them that sail in a storm; they may possibly be thrown into a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but they are very sick all the way.</p>
                     <p>But after all this I have one thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to such persons, That such a passive Obedience as this does not acquit a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and he that suffers what the Law inflicts is not discharg'd in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but there he is still a sinner and a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For <hi>the law is not made for the righteous, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105896:127"/>
for sinners</hi>; that is, the punishment appointed by the Law falls on <hi>him only</hi> that hath sinned: but an offending subject cannot <hi>with the fruit of his body pay for the sin of his Soul</hi>: when he does evil he must suffer evil; but if he does not repent besides, a worse thing will happen to him; for we are not tied to obey only for wrath, but also for Conscience. <hi>Passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is only the correspondent of <hi>wrath,</hi> but it is the <hi>active obedience</hi> that is required by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi> and whatever the Subject suffers for his own fault, it matters nothing as to his Duty, but this also God will exact at the hands of every man that is placed under Authority.</p>
                     <p>I have now told you the summe of what I had to say concerning Obedience to Laws and to your own Government, and it will be to little purpose to make laws in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or in any thing else, if the end of it be, that every man shall chuse whether he will obey or no: and if it be questioned whether you be deceiv'd or no, though the suffering such a question is a great diminution to your authority, yet it is infinitely more probable that you are in the right then that the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105896:128"/>
Subject is; because you are conducted with a publick spirit, you have a special title and peculiar portions of the promise of God's assistance, you have all the helps of Counsel and the advantages of deliberation, you have the Scriptures and the Laws, you are as much concerned to judge according to truth as any man, you have the principal of all capacities and states of men to assist your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, you are the most concern'd for Peace, and to please God also is your biggest interest: and therefore it cannot be denied to be the most reasonable thing in the world which is set down in the Law: <hi>Praesumptio est pro authoritate imponentis,</hi> the presumption of truth ought to be on your side; and since this is the most likely way for Truth, and the most certain way for Peace, you are to insist in this, and it is not possible to find a better.</p>
                     <p>I have another part or sense of my Text yet to handle; but because I have no more time of mine own, and I will not take any of yours, I shall only doe it in a short Exhortation to this most Honourable Auditory, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:105896:128"/>God hath put a Royal Mantle, and fastned it with a Golden Clasp, upon the shoulder of the KING, and he hath given you the Judges Robe; the King holds the Scepter, and he hath now permitted you to touch the golden Ball, and to take it a while into your handling and made obedience to your Laws to be Duty and Religion: but then remember that the first in every kind is to be the measure of the Subjects should obey you, unless you obey God. I do not speak this only in relation to your personal duty; though in that also it would be consider'd, that all the Bishops and Ministers of Religion are bound to teach the same Doctrines by their Lives as they do by their Sermons; and what <hi>we</hi> are to doe in the matters of <hi>Doctrine, you</hi> are also to doe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Laws</hi>; what is reasonable for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of <hi>Religion,</hi> is also the best Method for the advantages of <hi>Government; we</hi> must <hi>preach</hi> by our good Example, and <hi>you</hi> must <hi>govern</hi> by it; and your good example in observing the laws of Religion will strangely endear them to the affections of the people. But I shall rather speak to you as you are in a capacity of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105896:129"/>
union and of Government; for as now you have a new Power, so there is incumbent upon you a special Duty.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take care that all your power and your counsels be imploy'd in doing honour and advantages to Piety and Holiness. Then you obey God in your publick capacity, when by holy Laws and wise administrations you take care that all the Land be an obedient and a religious People. For then you are princely Rulers indeed when you take care of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a whole Nation. <hi>Nihil aliud est im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium nisi cura salutis alinae,</hi> said <hi>Ammianus</hi>; Government is nothing but a care that all men be saved. And therefore take care that men do not destroy their Souls by the abominations of an evil life: see that God be obey'd, take care that the breach of the laws of God may not be unpunished. The best way to make men to be good Subjects to the King is to make them good servants of God. Suffer not Drunkenness to pass with impunity, let Lust find a publick shame. Let the sonnes of the Nobility and Gentry no more dare to dishonour God then the meanest of the people shall: let baseness be basely esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105896:129"/>
that is, put such characters of Shame upon dishonourable Crimes, that it be esteem'd more against the honour of a Gentleman to be drunk then to be kicked, more shame to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate then to be can'd: and for honours sake and the reputation of Christianity, take some course that the most unworthy sins of the world have not reputation added to them by being the practice of Gentlemen and persons of good birth and fortunes. Let not them who should be examples of Holiness have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity and a licence to provoke God to anger; lest it be said that in <hi>Ireland</hi> it is not lawful for any man to sin, unless he be a person of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Optimus est reipublicae status,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                        <hi>ubi nihil deest nisilicentia pereundi</hi>; In a common-wealth that's the best state of things, where every thing can be had but a leave to sin, a licence to be undone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As God is thus to be obey'd, and you are to take care that he be, so God also must be honnourd, by paying that reverence and religious obedience which is due to those persons whom he hath been pleased to honour by admitting them to the dispensation of <hi>his blessings,</hi> and the ministeries of <hi>your Religion.</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105896:130"/>
For certain it is, this is a right way of giving honour and obedience to God. The Church is in some very peculiar manner the <hi>portion</hi> and the <hi>called</hi> and the <hi>care</hi> of God; and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you in pursuance of your obedience to God, to take care that they in whose hands Religion is to be ministred and conducted, be not discouraged. For what your Judges are to the ministry of Laws, that your Bishops are in the ministeries of Religion; and it concerns you that the hands of neither of them be made weak: and so long as you make Religion your care, and Holiness your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, you will not think that Authority is the more to be despised because it is in the hands of the Church, or that it is a sin to <hi>speak evil of dignities,</hi> unless they be Ecclesiastical; but that they may be reviled, and that though nothing is baser then for a man to be a Thief, yet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege is no dishonour; and indeed to be an Oppressor is a great and crying sin, yet to oppress the Church, to diminish her rents, to make her beggerly and contemptible, that's no offence; and that though it is not lawful <hi>to despise Government,</hi> yet if it be Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that then the case is altered. Take heed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105896:130"/>
of that, for then God is dishonoured, when any thing is the more despised by how much it relates nearer unto God. No Religion ever did despise their chiefest Ministers: and the Christian Religion gives them the greatest honour. For honourable Priesthood is like a shower from heaven, it causes blessings every where: but a pitiful, a disheartned, a discouraged Clergy, waters the ground with a water-pot, here and there a little good, and for a little while; but every evil man can destroy all that work whenever he pleases. Take heed; in the world there is not a greater misery can happen to any man, then to be an enemy to God's Church. All Histories of Christendome and the whole Book of God have sad records, and sad threatnings, and sad stories of <hi>Corah,</hi> and <hi>Doeg,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Uzzah,</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> and of Hereticks and Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smaticks, and sacrilegious; and after all, these men could not prevail finally, but pai'd for the mischief they did, and ended their daies in dishonour, and left nothing behind them but the memory of their sin, and the record of their curse.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105896:131"/>3. In the same proportion you are to take care of all inferiour Relatives of God and of Religion. Find out methods to relieve the Poor, to accommodate and well dispose of the cures of Souls; let not the Churches lye wast and in ruinous heaps, to the diminution of Religion, and the reproach of the Nation, lest the nations abroad say, that the <hi>Britans</hi> are a kind of Christians that have no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: for Churches, and Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the publick defences of an Imperial City, are <hi>res sacrae</hi>; they are venerable in Law, and honourable in Religion.</p>
                     <p>But that which concerns us most is, that we all keep close to our Religion. <hi>Ad magnas rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae utilitates retinetur Religio in civitatibus,</hi> said <hi>Cicero</hi>; by Religion and the strict pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of it, ye shall best preserve the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the Nation: and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> Apostle, <hi>Mark them which cause divisions amongst us, contrary to the doctrine that ye have receiv'd, and avoid them.</hi> For I beseech you to consider, all you that are true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; do you not think that your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is holy, and Apostolical, and taught by Christ, and pleasing unto God? If you do not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105896:131"/>
think so, why do you not leave it? but if you do think so, why are ye not zealous for it? Is not the Government a part of? it is that which immures, and adorns, and conducts all the rest, and is establisht in the 36. Article of the Church, in the publick Service-book, and in the book of consecration: it is therefore a part of our Religion, and is not all of it worth preserving? If it be, then they which make Schisms against this Doctrine, by the rule of the Apostle are to be avoided. <hi>Beatus qui praedicat verbum inauditum,</hi> Blessed is he that preaches a word that was never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so said the <hi>Spanish</hi> Jesuite: but Christ said otherwise, <hi>No man having drunk old wine straight desires new, for he saith the old is better.</hi> And so it is in Religion, <hi>Quod primum verum,</hi> Truth is alwaies first: and since Episcopacy hath been of so lasting an abode, of so long a blessing, since it hath ever combin'd with Government, and hath been taught by that spirit that hath so long dwelt in God's Church, and hath now according to the promise of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that saies <hi>the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church,</hi> been restored amongst us by a heap of miracles, and as it went away, so it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105896:132"/>
return'd again in the hand of Monarchy, and in the bosome of our Fundamental Laws; suffer no evil tongue to speak against this Truth, which hath had so long a testimony from God, and from Experience, and from the wisdome of so many Ages, of all your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours and all your Laws, lest ye be found to speak against God, and neglect the things that belong unto your Peace, and get nothing by it but news and danger, and what other effects ye know not. But <hi>Leontimus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> stroak'd his old white beard and said, <hi>When this snow is dissolved, a great deal of dirty weather will follow</hi>; meaning, that when the old Religion should be questioned and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, the new Religion would bring nothing but trouble and unquietness: and we have found it so by a sad-experience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Ye cannot obey God unless ye doe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: for this also is better then sacrifice, said <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 21.3. For Christ, who is <hi>the Sun of righteousness,</hi> is a <hi>Sun and a Shield</hi> to them that doe righteously. The <hi>Indian</hi> was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured sufficiently by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> sea, nor the <hi>Bosphoran</hi> by the walls of Ice, nor the <hi>Arabian</hi> by his meridian Sun; the Christian Justice of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105896:132"/>
the <hi>Romane</hi> Princes brake through all inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and by Justice set up Christs standard, and gave to all the world a testimony how much could be done by Prudence and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, when they were conducted by the hands of Justice. And now you will have a great trial of this part of your Obedience to God.</p>
                     <p>For you are to give sentence in the causes of half a Nation: and he had need be a wise and a good man that divides the inheritance amongst Brethren; that he may not be abused by contrary pretences, nor biassed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of friends, nor transported with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just thoughts even of a just Revenge, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the opportunities of Spoile, nor turn'd aside by Partiality in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, nor blinded by Gold, which puts out the eyes of wise men, nor couzened by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Zeal, nor wearied with the difficulty of questions, nor directed by a general measure in cases not measurable by it, nor born down by Prejudice, nor abused by resolutions taken before the cause be heard, nor over-ruled by National Interests. For Justice ought to be the simplest thing in the world, and is to be measured by nothing but by Truth and by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105896:133"/>
Laws and by the decrees of Princes. But whatever you doe, let not the pretence of a different Religion make you think it lawful to oppress any man in his just rights. For Opinions are not, but Laws only, and <hi>doing as we would be done to,</hi> are the measures of Justice: and though Justice does alike to all men, Jew and Christian, Lutheran and Calvinist; yet to doe right to them that are of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the way to win them; but if you for Conscience sake doe them wrong, they will hate you and your Religion.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as <hi>obedience is better then sacrifice,</hi> so God also said, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice</hi>; meaning that Mercy is the best Obedience. <hi>Perierat totum quod Deus fecerat, nisi misericordia subvenisset,</hi> said <hi>Chrysologus</hi>; all the creatures both of heaven and earth would perish, if Mercy did not relieve us all. Other good things, more or less, every man expects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the portion of his fortune: <hi>Ex cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentia omnes idem sperant,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> but from Mercy and Clemency all the world alike do expect advantages. And which of us all stands here this day, that does not need God's pardon and the King's? Surely no man is so much pleased
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105896:133"/>
with his own innocence, as that he will be willing to quit his claim to Mercy: and if we all need it, let us all shew it.

If you do but see a Maiden carried to her grave a little before her intended marriage, or an Infant dye before the birth of Reason, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath taught us to pay a tributary tear: Alas! your eyes will behold the ruine of many Families, wnich though they sadly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet Mercy is not delighted with the spectacle; and therefore God places a watry cloud in the eye, that when the light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shines upon it, it may produce a rain-bow to be a Sacrament and a memorial that God and the sons of God do not love to see a man perish. God never rejoyces <hi>in the death of him that dies</hi>; and we also esteem it undecent to have Musick at a Funeral. And as Religion teaches us to pity a condemned Criminal, so Mercy intercedes for the most benign inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Laws. <hi>You must indeed be as just as the Laws, and you must be as merciful as your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105896:134"/>
Religion</hi>: and you have no way to tye these together, but to follow the pattern in the Mount; doe as God does, who <hi>in judgement remembers mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude; If every one in this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Assembly would joyn together to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Christian Religion in it's true notion, that is, Peace and Holiness, the Love of God and the Love of our Brother, Christianity in all its proper usefulness, and would not indure in the Nation any thing against the laws of the Holy <hi>Jesus</hi>; if they were all zealous for the doctrines of Righteousness, and impatient of Sin in your selves and in the people, it is not to be imagined what a happy Nation we should be. But if ye divide into parties, and keep up useless differences of names or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests; if ye do not joyn in the bands of Peace, that is, the King, and the Church, Religion, and the good of the Nation, you can never hope to see a blessing to be the end of your labours. Remember the words of <hi>Solomon, Righteousness exalteth a Nation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 24.34.</note> 
                        <hi>but sin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any people:</hi> but when Righteousness is advanced in the hearts and lives of the Nation, who shall dare to reprove your
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105896:134"/>
Faith? who can find fault with your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</p>
                     <p>God of his mercy grant that in all your Consultations the Word of God may be your measure, the Spirit of God may be your guide, and the glory of God may be your end: He of his mercy grant that Moderation may be your limit, and Peace may be within your walls as long as you are there, and in all the Land for ever after. But remember, that since the honour and service of his Majesty, and the peace and prosperity of the Church, the perpetuity of our fundamental Laws, publick Justice, and the honour of all legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the advancement of Trade and the wealth of the Nation is your design, remember, I pray, what warranty you have to expect all this; no less then the words of our Blessed Saviour, but it is upon these terms, <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdome of God, and the righteousness thereof, and all these things shall be added to you.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>EACE is so great a Blessing, and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Questions in Religion are so little friends to Peace, that I have thought no mans time can be better spent then in propositions and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace, and consequently in finding expedients, and putting periods to all contentious Learning. I have already in a discourse before the Right Honourable the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prov'd that Obedience is the best <hi>medium</hi> of Peace and true <hi>Religion</hi>; and <hi>Lawes</hi> are the only common term and certain rule and measure of it. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catâ ad concionem multitudine, quae coalesce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in populum Unius corporis nullâ re praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam legibus poterat,</hi> said <hi>Livy. Obedience to Man</hi> is the externall instrument; and the best in the World. To which I now add, that <hi>Obedience to God</hi> is the best internall instrument; and I have prov'd it in this discourse. Peace and Holiness are twin-Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
<pb facs="tcp:105896:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after which because every man is bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and he that does not shall never see God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the office of a Bishop is in nothing so signally to be exhibited as in declaring by what means these great duties and blessings are to be acquir'd. This way I have here describ'd is an old way; for it was Christs way, and therefore it is truth and life: but it hath been so little regarded and so seldom taught, that when I first spake my thoughts of it in the following words before the Little, but Excellent, University of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they consented to it so perfectly, and so piously entertain'd it, that they were pleas'd with some earnestness to desire me to publish it to the World, and to consigne it to them as a perpetual memorial of their duty, and of my regards to them, and care over them in my Station. I was very desirous to serve and please them in all their worthy desires, but had found so much reason to distrust my own abilities, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to do what I fain would have done; till by a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond communication of those thoughts, though in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring words, I had publish'd it also to my <hi>Clergy</hi> at the <hi>Metropolitical Visitation</hi> of the most Reverend and Learned Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> in my own Diocese. But when I found that they also thought it very reasonable and pious, and joyn'd in the desire of making it publick, I consented perfectly, and now only pray to God it may do that Work which I intended. I have often thought of those excellent words of Mr.

                     <hi>Hooker</hi> in his very learned discourse of <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; [<q>Such is the untoward constitution of our Nature, that we do neither so perfectly understand the way and knowledge of the Lord, nor so stedfastly embrace it when it is understood, nor so graciously utter it when it is embraced, nor so peaceably maintain it when it is uttered, but that the best of us are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken sometime through blindness, sometime through hastiness, sometime through impatience, sometime through other passions of the mind, whereunto (God knows) we are too subject] That I find by true expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the best way of Learning and Peace is that which cures all these evils, as far as in this World they are curable; and that is the wayes of Holiness, which are therefore the best and only way of Truth.</q> In Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations there is no end, and but very little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but the way of godliness hath in it no Error, and no Doubtfulness.

Christianity is all for Practice, and so much time as is spent in quarrells about it is a diminution to its Interest: men inquire so much what it is, that they have but little time left to <hi>be Christians.</hi> I remember a saying of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus,</hi> that when he first read the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with fear and a good mind, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to understand it and obey it, he found it very usefull and very pleasant: but when afterwards he fell on reading the vast differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Commentaries, then he understood it lesse then he did before, then he began <hi>not</hi> to understand it.

But therefore since we are so miserable, and are in error, and have wandered very far, we must do as wandring Travellers use to do, go back just to that place from whence they wandered, and begin upon a new Account. Let us go to the Truth it self, to Christ, and he will tell us an easie way of ending all our Quarrells. For we shall find Christianity to be the easiest and the hardest thing in the World: it is like a secret in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,</hi> infinitely hard till it be found out by a right operation, and then it is so plain, we wonder we did not understand it earlier.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ's</hi> way of finding out of truth is by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God.</hi> We will try that by and by, if possibly we may find <hi>that</hi> easie and certain: in the mean time let us consider what wayes men have propounded to find out Truth, and upon the foundation of that to establish Peace in Christendom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is but one true way is agreed upon; and therefore almost every Church of one denomination that lives under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propounds to you a Systeme or collective Body of Articles, and tells you, <hi>that's</hi> the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>Church,</hi> and the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people of <hi>God</hi>: like <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> of

whom one sayes, <hi>Ubicunque ipsi essent, praetexebant esse rempublicam,</hi> they suppos'd themselves were the Commonwealth; and <hi>these</hi> are the Church, and out of this Church they will hardly allow salvation. But of this there can be no end. For divide the Church into Twenty parts, and in what part soever your lot falls, you and your party are Damned by the other Nineteen; and men on all hands almost keep their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes by affrighting them with the fearful Sermons of Damnation: but in the mean time here is no security to them that are not able to judge for themselves, and no Peace for them that are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Others</hi> cast about to cure this evil, and conclude that it must be done by submission to an Infallible Guide; this must do it or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and this is the way of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Follow but the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergie, and you are safe, at least as safe as their warrants can make you. Indeed this were a very good way, if it were a way at all; but it is none; for this can never end our Controversies: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because the greatest Controversies are about this Infallible Guide; but also because, 1. We cannot find that there is upon Earth any such Guide at all. 2. We do not find it necessary that there should. 3. We find that they who

That they do not believe themselves to be Infallible whatever they say to us; because they do not put an end to all their own Questions that trouble them. 5. Because they have no peace but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by force and Government. 6. And lastly, because if there were such a Guide, we should fail of Truth by many other causes: for it may be that Guide would not do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or we are fallible followers of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Leader; or we should not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his meaning at all times, or we should be perverse at some times, or something as bad: because we all confesse that <hi>God</hi> is an Infallible Guide, and that some way or other he does teach us sufficiently, and yet it does come to passe by our faults that we are as far to seek for Peace and Truth as ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Some</hi> very wise men finding this to fail, have undertaken to reconcile the differences of Christendom by a way of moderation. Thus they have projected to reconcile the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-remonstrants,</hi> and project that each side should abate of their asperities, and pare away something of their proportions, and joyn in Common terms and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105896:145"/>
phrases of Accommodation, each of them sparing something, and promising they shall have a great deal of peace for the exchange of a little of their opinion. This was the way of <hi>Cassander, Modrevius, Andreas Frisius, Erasmus, Spalato, Grotius,</hi> and indeed of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in part, but something more heartily of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the Second. This device produced the conferences at <hi>Poissy,</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> at many places more: and what was the event of these? Their parties when their Delegates returned, either disclaimed their Moderation, or their respective <hi>Princes</hi> had some other ends to serve, or they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Meetings upon uncertain hopes, and a triall if any good might come; or it may be they were both in the wrong, and their mutuall abatement was nothing but a mutuall quitting of what they could not get, and the shaking hands of false friends; or it may be it was all of it nothing but Hypocrisie and Arts of Craftiness, and, like <hi>Lucian's</hi> man, every one could be a Man and a Pestle when he pleased. And the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cover, made use of the artifice, but made the secret manifest and common: for at this day the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in the Questions <hi>de auxiliis Divinae gratiae</hi> have prevailed with the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to use
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105896:146"/>
                     <hi>their</hi> expressions, and yet they think they still keep the sentence of their own Order. From hence can succeed nothing but folly and a phantastick peace. This is but the skinning of an old sore, it will break out upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Others,</hi> who understand things beyond the common rate, observing that many of our Controversies and peevish wranglings are kept up by the ill stating of the Question, endeavour to declare things wisely, and make the matter intelligible, and the words cleare; hoping by this meanes to cut off all disputes. Indeed this is a very good way, so far as it can go; and would prevaile very much, if all men were wise, and would consent to those stateings, and would not fall out upon the main enquiry when it were well stated: but we find by a sad experience that few Questions are well stated; and when they are, they are not consented to; and when they are agreed on by both sides that they are well stated, it is nothing else but a drawing up the Armies in <hi>Battalia</hi> with great skill and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; the next thing they do is, they thrust their Swords into one anothers sides.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What remedy after all this? Some other good men have propounded one way yet: but that is a way of Peace rather then Truth; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105896:146"/>
that is, that all Opinions should be tolerated and none persecuted; and then all the World will be at peace. Indeed this relies upon a great reasonableness: not onely because Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions cannot be forced; but because if men receive no hurt, it is to be hoped they will do none. But we find that this alone will not do it. For besides that all men are not so just as not to do any Injury (for some men begin the evil) besides this (I say) there are very many men amongst us who are not content that you permit them; for they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, but <hi>rule over your faith,</hi> and say that their way is not only true, but necessary; and therefore the Truth of God is at stake, and all Indifference and moderation is carnall Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and want of Zeal for God: nay more then so, they preach for Toleration when themselves are under the rod, who when they got the rod into their own hands thought To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration it self to be Intolerable. Thus do the <hi>Papists,</hi> and thus the <hi>Calvinists</hi>: and for their Cruelty they pretend Charity. They will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>force</hi> you to come in, but it is in true Zeal for your Soul: and if they do you violence, it is no more then if they pull your Arme out of joynt, when to save you from drowning they draw you out of a River; and if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105896:147"/>
plain, it is no more to be regarded then the out-cries of Children against their Rulers, or sick men against Physicians. But as to the thing it self, the truth is, it is better in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation then in Practice: for reckon all that is got by it when you come to handle it, and it can never satisfie for the infinite disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders happening in the Government; the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Religion, the secret dangers to publick Societies, the growth of Heresie, the nursing up of parties to a grandeur so considerable as to be able in their own time to change the Lawes and the Government. So that if the Question be whether meer Opinions are to be persecuted, it is certainly true, they ought not. But if it be considered how by Opinions men rifle the affaires of Kingdoms, it is also as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they ought not to be made publick and permitted. And what is now to be done? must Truth be for ever in the dark, and the World for ever be divided, and Societies dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and Governments weakned, and our Spirits debauched with Error and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Opinions and the Pedantery of talking men? Certainly there is a way to cure all this evil; and the wise Governour of all the World hath not been wanting in so necessary a matter as to lead us into all Truth. But the way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105896:147"/>
hath not yet been hit upon, and yet I have told you all the wayes of Man and his Imaginations in order to Truth and Peace: and you see these will not do; we can find no rest for the soles of our feet amidst all the waters of Contention and disputations, and little artifices of divided Schools. <hi>Every man is a lyar,</hi> and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is weak, and his Propositions uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and his Opinions trifling, and his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances imperfect: and neither Truth nor Peace does come from man. I know I am in an Auditory of inquisitive persons, whose bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse is to study for Truth, that they may find it for themselves, and teach it unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: I am in a School of Prophets and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Sons, who all ask <hi>Pilate's</hi> Question, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> You look for it in your Books, and you tug hard for it in your Disputations, and you derive it from the Cisterns of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and you enquire after the old wayes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are taken with new appearances, and you rejoyce in false lights, or are delighted with little umbrages and peep of Day. But where is there a man, or a Society of men, that can be at rest in his enquiry, and is sure he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands all the truths of God? where is there a man but the more he studies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, still he discovers nothing so clearly as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105896:148"/>
his own Ignorance? This is a demonstration that we are not in the right way, that we do not inquire wisely, that our Method is not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall. If men did fall upon the right way, it were impossible so many learned men should be engaged in contrary parties and opinions. We have examined all wayes but one, all but <hi>God's</hi> way: Let us (having missed in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) try this: let us go to God for Truth; for <hi>Truth</hi> comes from God only, and his wayes are plain, and his sayings are true, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>: and if we miss the Truth, it is because we will not find it: for certain it is, that all that Truth which God hath made necessarie, he hath also made legible and plain, and if we will open our eyes, we shall see the Sun, and if <hi>we will walk in the light, we shall rejoyce in the light</hi>: only let us withdraw the Curtains, let us remove the <hi>impediments and the sin that doth so easily beset us</hi>; thats Gods way. Every man must in his station do that portion of duty which God requires of him, and then he shall be taught of God all that is fit for him to learn: there is no other way for him but this. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 111. ver. 10.</note>

And this is the only way which Christ hath taught us: if you ask, <hi>What is truth?</hi> you must not doe as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, ask the Question, and then go away from him that only can give you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; for as God is the author of Truth, so he is the teacher of it; and the way to learn it is this of my Text: For so saith our blessed Lord, <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God or no.</hi>

                  <p>My <hi>Text</hi> is simple as Truth it self, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comprehensive, and contains a truth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will enable you to understand all <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and to expound all <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and to interpret all <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to search into all Secrets, all (I mean) which concern our happinesse and our duty: and it being an affirmative hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall, is plainly to be resolved into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>The way to judge of Religion is by doing of our duty, and Theology is rather a Divine life then a Divine knowledge.</hi> In Heaven indeed we shall first see, and then love; but here on Earth we must first love, and love will open our eyes as well as our hearts, and we shall then see and perceive and understand.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. No man understands the <hi>Word of God</hi> as it ought to be understood, unlesse he layes aside all affections to Sin: of which because we have taken very little care, the product hath been that we have had very little wisdom, and very little knowledge in the wayes of God. <gap reason="foreign">

A Covetous man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands nothing to be good that is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a Voluptuous man likes your reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning well enough if you discourse of <hi>Bonum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum,</hi> the pleasures of the sense, the ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of lust, the noises and inadvertencies, the mirth and songs of merry Company. But if you talk to him of the melancholy Lectures of the Cross, the content of Resignation, the peace of Meeknesse, and the Joyes of the holy Ghost, and of rest in God; after your long discourse and his great silence he cryes out, What's the matter? He knows not what you meane. Either

you must fit his humour, or change your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Arianus</hi> tells of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was banished from <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his sorrow visited the Philosopher, and he heard him talk wisely, and believed him, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to leave all the thoughts of <hi>Rome</hi> and splendours of the Court, and retire to the course of a severe Philosophy: but before the good mans Lectures were done, there came <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, letters from <hi>Caesar</hi> to recall him home, to give him pardon, and promise him great Imployment. He presently grew weary of the good mans <hi>Sermon,</hi> and wished he would make an end, thought his discourse was dull and flat; for his head and heart were full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother storie and new principles; and by these measures he could heare only and he could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
                  <p>Every man understands by his Affections more then by his Reason: and when the <hi>Wolfe</hi> in the Fable went to School to learn to spell, whatever letters were told him, he could never make any thing of them but <hi>Agnus</hi>; he thought of nothing but his belly: and if a man be very hungry, you must give him meate before you give him counsell. A mans mind must be like your proposition before it can be entertained:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105896:150"/>
for whatever you put into a man it will smell of the Vessell: it is a mans mind that gives the <hi>emphasis,</hi> and makes your argument to prevail.</p>
                  <p>And upon this account it is that there are so many false Doctrines in the only Article of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Men know they must repent, but the definition of Repentance they take from the convenience of their own affaires: what they will not part with, that is not necessary to be parted with, and they will repent, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store: they will say <hi>nollem factum,</hi> they wish they had never done it; but since it is done, you must give them leave to rejoyce in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase: they will ask forgivenesse of God; but they sooner forgive themselves, and suppose that God is of their mind. If you tye them to hard termes, your Doctrine is not to be understood, or it is but one Doctors opinion, and therefore they will fairly take their leave, and get them another Teacher.</p>
                  <p>What makes these evil, these dangerous and desperate Doctrines? not the obscurity of the thing, but the cloud upon the heart; for say you what you will, He that hears must be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder, and we can never suppose but a man will give sentence in behalf of what he passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately loves. And so it comes to pass that, as <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> observ'd that God for the greatest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105896:150"/>
Sin imposed the least Oblation, as a she-Goat for the sin of Idolatry; for a woman accused of Adultery, a Barly-cake: so do most men; they think to expiate the worst of their sins with a trifling, with a pretended, little, insignificant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. God indeed did so, that the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the oblation might teach them to hope for pardon; not from the Ceremony, but from a severe internal repentance. But men take any argument to lessen their repentance, that they may not lessen their pleasures or their estates, and that Repentance may be nothing but a word, and Mortification signifie nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their pleasures, but be a term of Art on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fitted for the Schools or for the Pulpit, but nothing relative to practice, or the exterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their sin. So that it is no wonder we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand so little of Religion: it is because we are in love with that which destroyes it; and as a man does not care to hear what does not please him, so neither does he believe it; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, he will not understand it.</p>
                  <p>And the same is the Case in the matter of <hi>Pride</hi>; the Church hath extremely suffer'd by it in many ages. <hi>Arius</hi> missed a Bishoprick, and therefore turned Heretick; <gap reason="foreign">

[<hi>That the peace of the Church was better then the satisfaction of his person, or the promoting his foolish Opinion.</hi>] And do not we see and feel that at this very day the Pride of men makes it seem impossible for many persons to obey their <hi>Superiors?</hi> and they do not see what they can read every day, that it is a sin <hi>to speak evill of Dignities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man would think it a very easie thing to understand the 13. Chapter to the <hi>Romans, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever resisteth the power, resisteth the Ordinance of God</hi>: and yet we know a generation of men to whom these words were so obscure, that they thought it lawfull to fight against their <hi>King.</hi> A man would think it easie to believe that those who were <hi>in the gain-saying of Corah,</hi> who rose up against the high Priest, were in a very sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and yet there are too many amongst us who are in the gain-saying of <hi>Corah,</hi> and think they do very well; that they are the <hi>Godly party,</hi> and the good people of God. Why? what's the matter? In the world there can be nothing plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then these words, <hi>Let every soul the subject to the higher powers,</hi> and that you need not make a scruple who are these higher powers, it is as plainly said, <hi>there is no power but of God</hi>; all that are set over you by the Laws of your Nation, these are <hi>over you in the Lord</hi>: and yet men will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105896:151"/>
not understand these plain things; they deny to doe their notorious duty, and yet believe they are in the right, and if they sometimes obey <hi>for wrath,</hi> they oftner disobey for <hi>Conscience sake.</hi> Where is the fault? The words are plain, the duty is certain, the Book lyes open; but, alas! <hi>it is Sealed within,</hi> that is, <hi>men have eyes and will not see, eares and will not heare.</hi> But the wonder is the lesse; for we know when God said to <hi>Jonas, doest thou well to be angry?</hi> he answered God to his face, <hi>I do well to be angry even unto the death.</hi> Let God declare his mind never so plainly, if men will not lay aside the evil principle that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, their open love to their secret sin, they may kill an Apostle, and yet be so ignorant as to <hi>think they do God good service</hi>; they may disturb Kingdomes, and break the peace of a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Church, and rise up against their Fathers, and be cruell to their Brethren, and stir up the people to Sedition; and all this with a cold sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and a hot liver, with a hard heart and a tender Conscience, with humble carriage and a proud spirit. For thus men hate Repentance, because they scorn to confesse an Errour; they will not return to Peace and Truth, because they feare to lose the good opinion of the people whom themselves have couzened; they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to be good, lest they should confess they

have formerly done amisse: and he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves how much evil is done, and how many Heresies are risen, and how much obstinacy and unreasonable perseverance in folly dwells in the World upon the stock of Pride, may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that no learning is sufficient to make a proud man understand the truth of God, unless he first learn to be humble. But <hi>Obedite &amp; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligetis</hi> (saith the Prophet) obey and be humble, leave the foolish affections of sin, and then ye shall understand. That's the First particular: All remaining affections to sin hinder the learning and understanding of the things of God.</p>

                  <p>For the things of the world, besides that they entangle one another, and make much business, and spend much time, they also take up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of a mans mind, &amp; spend his faculties,

                  <p>I have now done with the First part of my undertaking, and proved to you that our evill life is the cause of our Controversies and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances in the Religion of the things of God. You see what hinders us from becoming good Divines. But all this while we are but in the preparation to the Mysteries of Godlinesse. When we have thrown off all affections to sin; when we have stript our selves from all fond adherencies to the things of the world, and have broken the chains and dominion of our Passions; then we may say with <hi>David, Ecce paratum est Cormeum, Deus; My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready</hi>: then we may say, <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth</hi>: but we are not yet instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105896:155"/>
It remaines therefore that we enquire what is that immediate principle or meanes by which we shall certainly and infallibly be led into all truth, and be taught the mind of God, and understand all his secrets: and this is worth our knowledge. I cannot say that this will end your labours, and put a period to your studies, and make your learning easie: it may possibly increase your labour, but it will make it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; it will not end your Studies, but it will direct them; it will not make humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing easie, but will make it <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> and conduct it into true notices and wayes of wisdom.</p>
                  <p>I am now to describe to you the right way of knowledge. <hi>Qui facit voluntatem Patris mei</hi> (saith Christ) that's the way: <hi>do Gods will, and you shall understand Gods Word.</hi> And it was an excellent saying of St. <hi>Peter, Add to your faith Vertue,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note>

If God teaches us, then all is well: but if we do not learn wisdom at his feet, from whence should we have it? it can come from no other spring. And therefore it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that by how much nearer we are to God, by so much better we are like to be instructed.</p>
                  <p>But this being supposed, as being most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we can easily proceed by wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and steps of progression in the Oeconomy of this Divine Philosophy. For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is in every righteous man a new vital principle: the Spirit of Grace is the spirit of Wisdome, and teaches us by secret inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by proper arguments, by actuall perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by personall applications, by effects and energies: and as the soul of a man is the cause
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105896:156"/>
of all his vitall operations, so is the Spirit of God the life of that life, and the cause of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and productions Spirituall. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this is what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us of; <hi>Ye have received the Unction from above:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and that anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teacheth you all things.</hi> All things of some one kind: that is, certainly, <hi>all things that pertain to life and Godlinesse</hi>; all that by which a <hi>man</hi> is wise and happy. We see this by common experience. Unlesse the soul have a new life put into it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there be a vital principle within, unlesse the spirit of life be the Informer of the spirit of the man, the Word of God will be as dead in the operation as the body in its powers and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities. <hi>Sol &amp; Homo generant hominem,</hi> saith our Philosophy. A Man alone does not beget a man; but a Man and the Sun: for without the influence of the Celestiall bodyes all natural actions are ineffective: and so it is in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Soul.</p>

                     </gap>, <hi>they bely the holy Ghost</hi>: For the Spirit of God makes men wise; it is an evil Spirit that makes them Fools. The Spirit of God makes us <hi>Wise unto Salvation,</hi> it does not spend its holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences in disguises and convulsions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Gods spirit does not destroy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but heightens it: he never disorders the beauties of Government, but is a God of Order; it is the spirit of Humility, and teaches no Pride: he is to be found in Churches and Pulpits, upon Altars and in the Doctors Chaires; not in Conventicles and mutinous corners of a house: he goes in company with his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and makes progressions by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of life: his infusions are just as our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and his Graces pursue the methods of nature: that which was imperfect he leads on to perfection, and that which was weake he makes strong: he opens the heart, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive murmurs, or to attend to secret whispers, but to hear the Word of God; and then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the heart, and creates a new one; and without this new creation, this new principle of life, we may heare the Word of God, but we can never understand it; we heare the sound,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105896:157"/>
but are never the better; unlesse there be in our hearts a secret conviction by the spirit of God, the Gospel it self is a dead Letter, and worketh not in us the light and righteousness of God.</p>
                  <p>Do not we see this by a daily experience? Even those things which a good man and an evil man know, they do not know them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. A wicked man does know that good is lovely, and sin is of an evill and destructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and when he is reproved, he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and when he is observed, he is ashamed; and when he hath done, he is unsatisfied; and when he pursues his sin, he does it in the dark. Tell him he shall dye, and he sighs deeply, but he knows it as well as you: proceed, and say that after death comes Judgement, and the poor man believes and trembles. He knows that God is angry with him; and if you tell him that for ought he knows he may be in Hell to morrow, he knows that it is an intolerable truth, but it it also undeniable. And yet after all this he runs to commit his sin with as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an event and resolution, as if he knew no argument against it. These notices of things terrible and true passe through his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as an Eagle through the Air: as long as her flight lasted, the Air was shaken; but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no path behind her.</p>

They both read the Scriptures, they read and heare the same <hi>Sermons,</hi> they have capable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, they both believe what they heare and what they read, and yet the event is vastly different. The reason is that which I am now speaking of: the one understands by one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the other by another; the one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands by Nature, and the other by Grace; the one by humane Learning, and the other by Divine; the one reads the Scriptures without, and the other within; the one understands as a son of man, the other as a son of <hi>God</hi>; the one perceives by the proportions of the World, and the other by the measures of the Spirit; the one understands by Reason, and the other by Love; and therefore he does not only understand the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105896:158"/>
                     <hi>Sermons</hi> of the Spirit, and perceives their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he pierces deeper, and knows the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that meaning, that is, the secret of the Spirit, that which is spiritually discerned, that which gives life to the Proposition, and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>And the reason is, because he hath a Divine principle within him, and a new understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that is plainly, he hath Love, and that's more then Knowledge; as was rarely well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by St. Paul, <hi>Knowledge puffethup, but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity edifieth</hi>; that is, Charity makes the best Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. No <hi>Sermons</hi> can edify you, no Scriptures can build you up a holy building to God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the love of God, be in your hearts; and <hi>purifie your souls from all filthinesse of the Flesh and spirit.</hi>

But God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the Heavens to be the causes of all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and motions here below, hath placed his Angels in their houses of light, and given to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105896:159"/>
every one of his appointed officers a portion of the fiery matter to circumagitate and roll; and now the wonder ceases: for if it be enquired why this part of the fire runs Eastward and the other to the South, they being both indifferent to either, it is because an Angel of God sits in the Centre, and makes the same matter turne, not by the bent of its own mobility and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but in order to the needs of Man and the great purposes of God; and so it is in the understandings of men: When they all receive the same notions, and are taught by the same Master, and give full consent to all the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and can of themselves have nothing to distinguish them in the events, it is because God hath sent his Divine spirit, and kindles a new fire, and creates a braver capacity, and applies the actives to the passives, and blesses their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For there is in the heart of man such a dead sea, and an indisposition to holy flames, like as in the cold Rivers in the North, so as the fires will not burn them, and the Sun it self will never warme them, till Gods holy Spirit does from the Temple of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> bring a holy flame, and make it shine and burn.</p>

                  <p>He therefore who so understands the Words of God, that he not only believes, but loves the proposition; he who consents with all his heart, and being convinced of the truth does also apprehend the necessity, and obeys the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and delights in the discovery, and layes his hand upon his heart, and reduces the notices of things to the practice of duty; he who dares trust his proposition, and drives it on to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

For when our reason is raised up by the spirit of Christ, it is turned quickly into experience: when our Faith relyes upon the principles of Christ, it is changed into vision: &amp; so long as we know God only in the wayes of man, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Learning, by arguing and dispute, we see nothing but the shadow of him, and in that shadow we meet with many dark appearances, little certainty and much conjecture: But when we know him <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For although the Scriptures themselves are written by the Spirit of God, yet they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within and without: and besides the light that shines upon the face of them, unlesse there be a light shining within our hearts, unfolding the leaves and interpreting the mysterious sense of the spirit, convincing our Consciences and preaching to our hearts; to look for Christ in the leaves of the Gospell, is to look for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amongst the dead.

the glories of God in the admirable order, motion and influences of the Heaven: but besides all this, they were taught of God something far beyond these prettinesses. <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> read <hi>Moses</hi>'s Books, and so did <hi>Plato</hi>; and yet they became not Proselytes of the Religion, though they were learned Scholars of such a Master. The reason is, because that which they drew forth from thence was not the life and secret of it. <q>Tradidit arcano quodcunque Volumine Moses.</q> There is a secret in these Books, which few men, none but the Godly, did understand: and though much of this secret is made manifest in the Gospel, yet even here also there is a <hi>Letter</hi> and there is a <hi>Spirit</hi>: still there is a reserve for Gods secret ones, even all those deep mysteries which the old Testament covered in Figures, and stories, and names, and prophesies, and which Christ hath, and by his Spirit will yet reveale more plainly to all that will understand them by their proper measures. For although the Gospel is infinitely more legible and plain then the obscurer Leaves of the Law, yet there is a seale upon them also: <hi>which Seale no man shall open hut he that is worthy.</hi> We may understand some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it by the three Children of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; they were all skil'd in all the wisdom of

the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and so was <hi>Daniel</hi>: but there was something beyond that in him; <hi>the wisdom of the most high God was in him,</hi> and that taught him a learning beyond his learning.</p>
                  <p>In all Scripture there is a spirituall sense, a spirituall <hi>Cabala,</hi> which as it tends directly to holiness, so it is best and truest understood by the sons of the Spirit, who love God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know him. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as a flame touches a flame, and combines into splendor and to glory: so is the Spirit of a man united unto Christ by the spirit of God.

Our light is like a Candle, every wind of vain Doctrine blows it out, or spends the wax, and makes the light tremulous; but the lights of Heaven are fixed and bright, and shine for ever.</p>
                  <p>But that we may speak not only things myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but things intelligible; how does it come to passe, by what means and what Oeconomy is it effected, that a holy life is the best determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all Questions, and the surest way of

Is it to be supposed that a Godly man is better enabled to determine the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Purgatory or Transubstantiation? is the gift of Chastity the best way to reconcile <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi>? and is a temperate man alwayes a better Scholar then a Drunkard? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that in all things in which true wisdom consists, Holinesse, which is the best wisdom, is the surest way of understanding them. And this</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is effected by Holinesse as a proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural instrument: for naturally every thing is best discerned by its proper light and congenial instrument.</p>

                  <p>For as the eye sees visible objects, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding perceives the Intellectual; so does the spirit the things of the Spirit. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,) knows not the things of God, for they are Spiritually discerned</hi>: that is, they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by a proper light, and concerning these things an unsanctified man discourses pittifully, with an imperfect <hi>Idea,</hi> as a blind man does of Light and Colours which he never saw.</p>
                  <p>A good man, though unlearned in secular notices, is like the windows of the Temple, narrow without and broad within: he sees not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105896:163"/>
so much of what profits not abroad; but whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is within, and concerns Religion and the glorifications of God, that he sees with a broad inspection. But all humane learning without God is but blindnesse and ignorant folly.</p>

                     </gap>, righteousnesse dipt in the wells of Truth, it is like an eye of Gold in a rich Garment, or like the light of Heaven, it shews it self by its own splendor. What Learning is it to discourse of the Philosophy of the Sacrament, if you do not feel the virtue of it? and the man that can with eloquence and subtilty discourse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumentall efficacy of Baptismal waters, talkes ignorantly in respect of him who hath <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience</hi> within, and is cleansed by the purifications of the Spirit. If the Question concern any thing that can perfect a man and make him happy, all that is the proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and notice of the good man. How can a wicked man understand the purities of the heart? and how can an evil and unworthy Communicant tell what it is to have received Christ by faith, to dwell with him, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, to receive him in his heart? The good man only understands that: the one sees the colour, and the other feels the substance; the one discourses of the Sacrament, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105896:164"/>
receives Christ; the one discourses for or against Transubstantiation, but the good man feels himself to be changed and so joyn'd to Christ, that he only understands the true sense of Transubstantiation, while he becomes to Christ bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, and of the same spirit with his Lord.</p>
                  <p>We talk much of Reformation, and (blessed be God) once we have felt the good of it: But of late we have smarted under the name and pretension. The Woman that lost her groate, <hi>everrit domum,</hi> not <hi>evertit</hi>; she swept the house, she did not turn the house out of doors. That was but an ill Reformation that untiled the Roof, and broak the Walls, and was digging down the Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Now among all the pretensions of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who can tell better what is, and what is not, true Reformation, then he that is truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd himself? He knows what pleases God, and can best tell by what instruments he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.<note place="margin">Prov. 10.31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>The mouth of the just bringeth forth wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the lips of the righteous know what is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> He cannot be cousen'd by names of things, and feels that Reformation to be Imposture that is Sacrilegious: himself is humble and obedient, and therefore knows that is not Truth that perswades to Schisme and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105896:164"/>
Disobedience: and most of the Questions of Christendom are such which either are good for nothing, and therefore to be layd aside; or if they be complicated with action, and are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries of practice, no man can judge them so well as the spirituall man. <hi>That which best pleases God, that which does good to our Neighbour, that which teaches sobriety, that which combines with Government, that which speaks honour of God and does him honour,</hi> that only is Truth. Holinesse therefore is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and naturall instrument of Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and must needs be the best way of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Questions of Christendom, because in the most of them a Duty is complicated with the Proportion.</p>
                  <p>No man that intends to live holily can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer any pretences of Religion to be made to teach him to fight against his <hi>King.</hi> And when the men of <hi>Geneva</hi> turned their Bishop out of doors, they might easily have considered that the same person was their Prince too; and that must needs be a strange Religion that rose up against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> at the same time: but that hath been the method ever since. There was no Church till then was ever Governed without an Apostle or a <hi>Bishop</hi>: and since then, they who go from their Bishop have said very often to their <hi>King</hi> too, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare</hi>:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105896:165"/>
and when we see men pretending Religion, and yet refuse to own the Kings Supremacy, they may upon the stock of holinesse easily reprove their own folly; by considering that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancy does introduce into our Churches the very worst, the most intolerable parts of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For <hi>perfect submission to</hi> Kings <hi>is the glory of the,</hi> Protestant <hi>cause</hi>: and really the reproveable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are by nothing so much confuted, as that they destroy good life by consequent and evident deduction; as by an Induction of particulars were easie to make apparent, if this were the proper season for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Holinesse is not only an advantage to the learning all wisdom and holinesse, but for the discerning that which is wise and holy from what is trifling and uselesse and contentious: and to one of these heads all Questions will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: and therefore in all, from Holinesse we have the best Instructions. And this brings me to the next Particle of the generall Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that which we are taught by the holy Spirit of God, this <hi>new nature,</hi> this <hi>vital principle</hi> within us, it is that which is worth our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not vaine and empty, idle and insignificant notions, in which when you have laboured till your eyes are fixed in their Orbes and your flesh unfixed from its bones, you are no better and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105896:165"/>
no wiser. If the Spirit of God be your Teacher, he will teach you such truths as will make you know and love God, and become like to him, and enjoy him for ever, by passing from simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to union and eternal fruition. But what are you the better if any man should pretend to teach you whether every Angel makes a <hi>species</hi>? and what is the individuation of the Soul in the state of separation? what are you the wiser if you should study and find out what place <hi>Adam</hi> should for ever have lived in if he had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len? and what is any man the more learned if he heares the disputes, whether <hi>Adam</hi> should have multiplied Children in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and what would have been the event of things if one Child had been born before his Fathers sin?</p>
                  <p>Too many Scholars have lived upon Air and empty notions for many ages past, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselves with tying and untying Knots, like <hi>Hypochondriacs</hi> in a fit of Melancholy, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>nothing,</hi> and troubling themselves with <hi>nothing,</hi> and falling out about <hi>nothings,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wise and very learned in things that are not and work not, and were never planted in <hi>Paradise</hi> by the finger of God. Mens notions are too often like the Mules, begotten by aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall and unnaturall Generations; but they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105896:166"/>
make no <hi>species</hi>: they are begotten, but they can beget nothing: they are the effects of long study, but they can do no good when they are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: they are not that which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>viam intelligentiae, the way of understanding.</hi> If the Spirit of God be our Teacher, we shall learn to avoid evil, and to do good, to be wise and to be holy, to be profitable and carefull: and they that walk in this way shall find more peace in their Consciences, more skill in the Scriptures, more satisfaction in their doubts, then can be obtain'd by all the polemical and impertinent disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world. And if the holy spirit can teach us how vain a thing it is to do foolish things, he also will teach us how vain a thing it is to trouble the world with foolish Questions, to disturb the Church for interest or pride, to resist Government in things indifferent, to spend the peoples zeale in things unprofitable, to make Religion to consist in outsides, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to circumstances and trifling regards. No, no, the Man that is wise, he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Spirit of God, knows better in what Christs Kingdom does consist, then to throw away his time and interest and peace and safety; for what? for Religion? no: for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Religion? not so much: for the garment of the body of Religion? no, not for so much:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105896:166"/>
but for the <hi>Fringes</hi> of the <hi>garment</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; for such and no better are the disputes that trouble our discontented Brethren; they are <hi>things,</hi> or rather <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> which the Soul and spirit is not at all concerned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Holinesse of life is the best way of finding out truth and understanding; not only as a <hi>Naturall medium,</hi> nor only as a <hi>prudent medium,</hi> but as a <hi>means by way of Divine blessing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.21.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.</hi> Here we have a promise for it; and upon that we may rely.</p>
                  <p>The old man that confuted the <hi>Arian</hi> Priest by a plain recitall of his <hi>Creed,</hi> found a mighty power of God effecting his own Work by a strange manner, and by a very plain instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it wrought a divine blessing just as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments use to doe: and this Lightning some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes in a strange manner as a peculiar blessing to good men. For God kept the secrets of his Kingdom from the wise Heathens and the learned <hi>Jewes,</hi> revealing them to Babes, not because they had less learning, but because they had more love; they were children and Babes in <hi>Malice,</hi> they loved Christ, and so he became
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105896:167"/>
to them a light and a glory. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had more learning then they all; and <hi>Moses</hi> was instructed in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>: yet because he was the meekest man upon Earth, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the wisest, and to his humane Learning in which he was excellent, he had a divine light and excellent wisdome superadded to him by way of spiritual blessings. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he went very far to the knowledge of many great and excellent truths by the force of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, yet he was far short of perfective truth and true wisdom till he learned a new lesson in a new School, at the feet of one greater then his <hi>Gamaliel</hi>: his learning grew much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his notions brighter, his skill deeper, by the love of Christ, and his desires, his passionate desires after <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The force and use of humane learning and of this <hi>Divine learning</hi> I am now speaking of, are both well expressed by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 29.11, 12. <hi>And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a Book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot, for it is seal'd. And the Book is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him that is not learned, saying Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</hi> He that is no learned man, who is not bred up in the Schools of the Prophets, cannot read Gods Book for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105896:167"/>
want of learning. For humane Learning is the gate and first entrance of Divine vision; not the only one indeed, but the common gate. But beyond this, there must be another learning; for he that is learned, bring the Book to him, and you are not much the better as to the secret part of it, if the Book be sealed, if his eyes be closed, if his heart be not opened, if God does not speak to him in the secret way of discipline. Humane learning is an excellent Foundation; but the top-stone is laid by Love and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the will of God. For we may further observe, that blindnesse, errour and Ignorance are the punishments which God sends upon wicked and ungodly men. <hi>Etiamsi propter nostrae intelligentiae tarditatem &amp; vitae demeritum veritas non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum se apertissime ostenderit,</hi> was St. <hi>Austin's</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The truth hath not yet been manifested fully to us, <hi>by reason of our demerits</hi>: our sins have hindred the brightnesse of the truth from shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon us. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, that when the Heathens gave themselves <hi>over to lusts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>God gave them over to strong delusions, and to believe a Lie.</hi> But <hi>God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom and knowledge and joy,</hi> said the wise <hi>Preacher.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 2.26.</note> But this is most expresly promised in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and particularly in that admirable <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> which our blessed Saviour preach'd a little

                     <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things.</hi> Well: there's our Teacher told of plainly. But how shall we obtain this teacher, and how shall we be taught? <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. Christ will pray for us that we may have this spirit. That's well: but shall all Christians have the spirit? Yes, all that will live like Christians: for so said Christ, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements; and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that may abide with you for ever; even the spirit of truth, whom the World cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth him.</hi> Mark these things. The Spirit of God is our teacher: he will abide with us for ever to be our teacher: he will teach us all things; but how? <hi>if ye love Christ,</hi> if ye keep his Commandments, but not else: if ye be of the World, that is, of worldly affections, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see him, ye cannot know him. And this is the particular I am now to speak to, The way by which the Spirit of God teaches us in all the wayes and secrets of God is Love and Holinesse.</p>

by the weak inventions of disputing people; if he only talks of Essences and existencies, Hypostases and personalities, distinctions without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and priority in Coequalities, and unity in Pluralities, and of superior Praedicates of no larger extent then the inferior Subjects, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse himself, and find his understanding will be like St. <hi>Peters</hi> upon the Mount of <hi>Tabor</hi> at the Transfiguration: he may build three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles in his head, and talke something, but he knows not what. But the good man that feels the <hi>power of the Father,</hi> and he to whom the Son is become <hi>Wisdom, Righteousnesse, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi>; he in <hi>whose heart the love of the Spirit of God is spread,</hi> to whom God hath communicated the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Comforter</hi>; this man, though he understands nothing of that which is unintelligible, yet <hi>he only</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the mysteriousnesse of the Holy Trinity. No man can be convinced well and wisely of the Article of the <hi>Holy, Blessed</hi> and <hi>Undivided Trinity,</hi> but he that feels the mightiness of the Father begetting him to <hi>a new life,</hi> the wisdome of the Son <hi>building him up in a most holy Faith,</hi> and the <hi>love of the spirit of God</hi> making him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like unto God.</p>
                  <p>He that hath passed from his Childhood in Grace under the spirituall generation of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:105896:169"/>
and is gone forward to be <hi>a young man</hi> in Christ, strong and vigorous in holy actions and holy undertakings, and from thence is become an old Disciple, and strong and grown old in Religion, and the conversation of the Spirit; this man best understands the secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernable Oeconomie, he feels this unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible mysterie, and sees with his heart what his tongue can never express, and his Metaphysics can never prove. In these cases Faith and Love are the best Knowledge, and <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ is best known by <hi>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>; and if the Kingdom of God be <hi>in us,</hi> then we know God, and are known of him: and when we communicate of the Spirit of God, when we pray for him, and have received him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him, and dwelt with him, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our selves by his holy fires, then we know him too. But there is no other satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> but this: And therefore whatever thing is spoken of God <hi>Metaphysically,</hi> there is no knowing of God <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically</hi> and as he ought to be known, but by the measures of Holinesse and the proper light of the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this case Experience is the best learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Christianity is the best institution, and the Spirit of God is the best teacher, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105896:170"/>
is the greatest wisdome; and he that sins most is the most Ignorant, and the humble and obedient man is the best Scholar.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 21.11.</note> 
                     <hi>For the Spirit of God is a loving Spirit, and will not enter into a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Soul: But he that keepeth the Law getteth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding thereof, and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom,</hi> said the wise <hi>Ben-Sirach.</hi> And now give me leave to apply the Doctrine to you, and so I shall dismisse you from this attention.</p>
                  <p>Many wayes have been attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the differences of the Church in matters of Religion, and all the Counsels of man have yet proved ineffective. Let us now try Gods Method, let us betake our selves to live holily, and then the spirit of God will lead us into all truth. And indeed <hi>it matters not what Religion any man is of, if he be a Villaine</hi>; the opinion of his Sect, as it will not save his Soul, so neither will it do good to the publick. But this is a sure Rule; If the holy man best understands Wisdom and Religion, then by the proportions of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we shall best measure the Doctrines that are obtruded to the disturbance of our peace, and the dishonour of the Gospell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is no good Religion whose Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples destroy any duty of Religion. He that shall maintain it to be lawfull to make a <hi>War</hi> for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105896:170"/>
the defence of his <hi>Opinion</hi> be it what it will, his Doctrine is against Godlinesse. Any thing that is proud, any thing that is peevish and scornful, any thing that is uncharitable, is against the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>forme of sound Doctrine</hi> which the Apostle speaks of. And I remember that <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> telling of <hi>George</hi> a proud and factious Minister, that he was an Informer against his Brethren, he sayes, he did it <hi>oblitus professionis suae, que nil nisi justum suadet &amp; lene</hi>; He forgot his profession, which teaches nothing but justice and meekness, kindnesses and charity. And however <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others are pleased to take but indirect and imperfect notice of it, yet <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is the best note of the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is but an ill sign of Holinesse when a man is busie in troubling himself and his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in little Scruples and Phantastick Opinions about things not concerning the life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the pleasure of God, or the excellencies of the Spirit. A good man knows how to please God, how to converse with him, how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Kingdome of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> to set forwards Holinesse and the love of God and of his Brother; and he knows also that there is no Godliness in spending our time and our talk, our heart and our spirits, about the garments and outsides of Religion. And they can ill teach
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105896:171"/>
others, that do not know that Religion does not consist in these things; but Obedience may, and <hi>reductively</hi> that is Religion; and he that for that which is no part of Religion destroys Religion directly, by neglecting that duty that is adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Religion, is a man of fancy and of the World: but he gives but an ill account that he is a man of God, and a son of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Spend not your time in that which profits not; for your labour and your health, your time and your studies are very valuable; and it is a thousand pitties to see a diligent and a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person spend himself in gathering Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells and little pebbles, in telling Sands upon the shores, and making Garlands of uselesse Daisies. Study that which is profitable, that which will make you useful to Churches and Common-wealths, that which will make you desirable and wise. Onely I shall add this to you, That in <hi>Learning</hi> there are variety of things as well as in <hi>Religion</hi>: there is Mint and Cummin, and there are the weighty things of the Law; so there are studies more and lesse usefull, and every thing that is usefull will be required in its time: and I may in this also use the words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>These things ought you to</hi> look after, and <hi>not to leave the other</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. But your great care is to be in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105896:171"/>
things of God and of Religion, in holiness and true wisdom, remembring the saying of <hi>Origen,</hi> that the knowledge that arises from goodnesse is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, something that is more certain and more divine then all demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then all other Learnings of the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That's no good Religion that disturbs Governments, or shakes a foundation of publick peace. <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> are the foundations and the great principles of unity, of peace and Government; like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> they build up the house of <hi>Israel</hi>: and those blind <hi>Samsons</hi> that shake these Pillars intend to pull the house down. <hi>My Son, fear God and the King,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon; and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> That is not Truth that loves changes: and the new-nothings of Heretical &amp; Schismatical Preachers are infinitely far from the blessings of Truth.</p>
                  <p>In the holy Language <hi>Truth</hi> hath a Mysterious Name, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Emet</hi>; it consists of three Letters, the first and the last and the middlemost of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Letters: implying to us that <hi>Truth</hi> is first, and will be last, and it is the same all the way, and combines and unites all extreams; it tyes all ends together. <hi>Truth is lasting, and ever full of blessing.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> observe that those Letters which signifie <hi>Truth,</hi> are both in the figure and the number <hi>Quadrate,</hi> firme and cubical; these
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105896:172"/>
signifie a foundation, and an abode for ever. Whereas on the other side; the word which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies <hi>a lye, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this very observation will give good light in our Questions and disputes. And I give my instance in <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> which hath been of so lasting an abode, of so long a blessing, hath its firmament by the principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, hath been blessed by the issues of that stabiliment, it hath for sixteen hundred yeares combined with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and hath been taught by the spirit which hath so long dwelt in Gods Church, and hath now (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that sayes <hi>the gates of Hell shall never prevail against the Church</hi>) been restored amongst us by a heap of Miracles; and as it went away, so now it is returned againe in the hand of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and in the bosome of our Fundamental Laws. Now that Doctrine must needs be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Error and an intolerable Lye that speaks against this Truth, which hath had so long a testimony from God, and from the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and experience of so many ages, of all our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and all our <hi>Lawes.</hi>

                  <p>And now to conclude, to you <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> you who are, or intend to be of the <hi>Clergie;</hi> you see here the best <hi>Compendium</hi> of your Studies, the best abbreviature of your labours, the truest method of wisdom, and the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the only way of judging concerning the Disputes and Questions in Christendom. It is not by reading multitude of Books, but by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the truth of God: it is not by laborious Commentaries of the <hi>Doctors</hi> that you can fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish your work, but by the expositions of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>: it is not by the Rules of <hi>Metaphysics,</hi> but by the proportions of <hi>Holinesse</hi>: and when all Books are read, and all Arguments examined, and all Authorities alledged, nothing can be found to be true that is unholy. <hi>Give your selves to reading, to exhortation, and to Doctrine,</hi> saith St.

                     <hi>Paul. Read</hi> all good Books you can: but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> unto good life is the best Instrument, and the best teacher of true <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of that which is <hi>according to Godlinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let me tell you this, The great learning of the <hi>Fathers</hi> was more owing to their piety then to their skill; more to God then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and to this purpose is that excellent eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> with which I will conclude. <q> O blessed and happy men, whose names are in the Book of life,<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Condition of Man in this world is so limited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, so relative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that the best things he does he does weakly, and the best things he hath are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in their very constitution. I need not tell how little it is that we know; the greatest indication of this is, That we can never tell how many things we know not: and we may soon span our own Knowledge, but our Ignorance we can never fathom. Our very Will, in which Mankind pretends to be most noble and imperial, is a direct state of imperfection; and our very liberty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105896:177"/>
of Chusing good and evil is permitted to us, not to make us proud, but to make us humble; for it supposes weakness of Reason and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Love. For if we understood all the degrees of Amability in the Service of God, or if we had such love to God as he deserves, and so perfect a conviction as were fit for his Services, we could no more Deliberate: For Liberty of Will is like the motion of a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick Needle toward the North, full of trembling and uncertainty till it were fixed in the beloved Point; it wavers as long as it is free, and is at rest when it can chuse no more. And truly what is the hope of Man? It is indeed the resurrection of the Soul in this world from sorrow and her saddest pressures, and like the Twilight to the Day, and the Harbinger of joy; but still it is but a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Infirmities, and proclaims our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent calamity, onely because it is uneasie here, it thrusts us forwards toward the light and glories of the Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>For as a Worm creeping with her belly on the ground, with her portion and share of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, curse, lifts up its head to partake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the blessings of the air, and opens the junctures of her imperfect body, and curles her little rings into knots and combinations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105896:177"/>
drawing up her tail to a neighbourhood of the heads pleasure and motion; but still it must return to abide the fate of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and dwell and sleep upon the dust: So are the hopes of a mortal Man; he opens his eyes and looks upon fine things at distance, and shuts them again with weakness, because they are too glorious to behold; and the Man rejoyces because he hopes fine things are staying for him; but his heart akes, because he knows there are a thousand wayes to fail and miss of those glories; &amp; though he hopes, yet he enjoys not; he longs, but he possesses not, and must be content with his portion of dust; and being <hi>a worm and no Man</hi> must lie down in this portion, before he can receive the end of his hopes, the Salvation of his Soul in the resurrection of the dead. For as Death is the end of our lives, so is the Resurrection the end of our hopes; and as we die daily, so we daily hope: but Death, which is the end of our life, is the enlargement of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from hope to certainty, from uncertain fears to certain expectations, from the death of the body to the life of the soul; that is, to partake of the light and life of Christ, to rise to life as he did; for his Resurrection is the beginning of ours: He died for us alone, not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105896:178"/>
for himself; but he rose again for himself and us too. So that if he did rise, so shall we; the Resurrection shall be universal; good and bad; all shall rise, but not altogether. First Christ, then we that are Christs; and yet there is a third Resurrection, though not spoken of here; but thus it shall be. <hi>The dead in Christ shall rise first;</hi> that is, next to Christ; and after them the wicked shall rise to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>So that you see here is the summe of affairs treated of in my Text; Not whether it be lawful to eat a Tortoise or a Mushrome, or to tread with the foot bare upon the ground within the Octaves of <hi>Easter. It is not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> whether Angels be material or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; or whether the dwellings of dead In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be within the Air or in the regions of the Earth; the inquiry here is whether we <hi>are to be Christians or no? whether we are to live good lives</hi> or no? or whether it be permitted to us to live with Lust or Covetousness acted with all the daughters of rapine and ambition? whether there be any such thing as sin, any judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Consciences, any rewards of Piety, any difference of Good and Bad, any rewards after this life? <hi>This is the design of these words by proper interpretation: for if Men shall die like Dogs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105896:178"/>
and sheep,</hi> they will certainly live like Wolves and Foxes: but he that believes the Article of the Resurrection, hath entertained the greatest Demonstration in the world, That nothing can make us happy but the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and Conformity to the life and death of the holy Jesus. Here therefore are the great Hinges of all Religion: 1. Christ is already risen from the dead. 2. We also shall rise in Gods time and our order. Christ is the first fruits. But there shall be a full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest of the Resurrection, and all shall rise. My Text speaks onely of the Resurrection of the just, of them that belong to Christ; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely I say of these; and therefore directly of Resurrection to life eternal. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he also sayes there shall be an order for every man; and yet every man does not belong to Christ; therefore indirectly also he implies the more universal Resurrection unto judgment. But this shall be the last thing that shall be done; for, according to the Proverb of the Jews, <hi>Michael</hi> flies but with one wing, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> with two; God is quick in sending Angels of peace, and they flye apace; but the messengers of wrath come slowly: God is more hasty to glorifie his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then to condemn the wicked. <hi>And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105896:179"/>
therefore in the story of</hi> Dives <hi>and</hi> Lazarus <hi>we find that the beggar died first; the good man Lazarus</hi> was first taken away from his misery to his comfort, and afterwards the rich man died: and as the good <hi>many times die first, so all of them rise first, as if it were a matter</hi> of haste: And as the mothers breasts swell and shoot and long to give food to her babe; so Gods <hi>bowels did yearn over his banish'd children, and he longs to cause them</hi> to eat and drink in his Kingdom. And at last the wicked shall rise unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that must be done too; every man in his own order: <hi>first Christ, then Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and at last Christs enemies. The first of these is the great ground of our faith,</hi> the second is the consummation of all our hopes: the first is the foundation of God that stands sure, the second is that superstructure that shall never perish: by the first we believe in God unto righteousness, by the second we live in God unto salvation: But the third, for that also is true &amp; must be consider'd, is the great affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all them that live ungodly. But in the whole Christs Resurrection and ours is <hi>the Α and Ω of a Christian</hi>; that as <hi>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to day, and the same for ever</hi>; so may we in Christ, become in the morrow of the Resurrection the same or better then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105896:179"/>
yesterday in our natural life; the same body and the same soul tied together in the same essential union, with this onely difference, that not Nature but Grace and Glory with an Hermetick seal give us a new signature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shall no more be changed, but <hi>like unto Christ our head we shall become the same for ever.</hi> Of these I shall discourse in order. 1. <hi>That Christ, who is the first fruits, is the first in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> he is already risen from the dead. 2. <hi>We shall all take our turns, we shall all die,</hi> and as sure as death we shall all rise again. And 3. <hi>This very order is effective of the thing it self. That Christ is first risen, is the demonstration</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ours, for because there is an order in this oeconomy, the first in the kind is the measure of the rest. If Christ be the first fruits, we are the whole vintage, and we shall all die in the order of Nature, and shall rise again in the order of Christ: They that are Christ's, and are found so at his coming, shall partake of his resurrection. But Christ first, then they that are Christ's: that's the order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ is the first fruits; he is already risen from the dead. For he alone could not be held by death. <hi>Free among the dead.</hi>

Death was Sins eldest daughter, and the Grave-clothes were her first mantle; but Christ was conquerour over both, and came to take that away, and to disarm this. This was a glory fit for the head of mankind, but it was too great and too good to be easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by incredulous and weak-hearted Man. It was at first doubted of by all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but they that saw it had no reason to doubt any longer. But what's that to us who saw it not? Yes, very much. <hi>Valde dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum est ab illis, ne dubitaretur à nobis,</hi> saith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> They doubted very much, that by their confirmation we might be established and doubt no more. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> saw him first, and she ran with joy and <hi>said she had seen the Lord, and that he was risen from the dead; but they believed her not. After that divers women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether saw him,</hi> and they told it, but had no thanks for their pains, and obtain'd no credit among the Disciples. <hi>The two Disciples that went to</hi> Emaus <hi>saw him,</hi> talk'd with him, eat with him, and they ran and told it: they told true, but nobody believ'd them. <hi>Then</hi> S. Peter <hi>saw him, but he was not yet got into the Chair of the Catholick Church, they did not think him</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fallible, and so they believ'd him not at all. Five times in one day he appear'd; for after
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105896:180"/>
all this he appear'd to the Eleven; they were indeed transported with joy and wonder, but they would scarce believe their own eyes, and though they saw him they doubted. Well, all this was not enough; he was seen also of <hi>James,</hi> and suffered <hi>Thomas</hi> to thrust his hand into his side, and appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and was seen by <hi>five hundred brethren at once.</hi> So that there is no capacity of mankind, no time, no place, but had an ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his Resurrection. He appeared to Men and Women, to the Clergy and the Laity, <hi>to sinners of both sexes; to weak men and to criminals, to doubters and deniers, at home and abroad, in publick and in private,</hi> in their houses and their journeys, unexpected and, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, betimes in the morning and late at night, to them in conjunction and to them in dispersion, when they did look for him and when they did not; he <hi>appeared upon earth to many, and to S.</hi> Paul <hi>and S.</hi> Stephen <hi>from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that we can require no greater testimony then all these</hi> are able to give us, and they saw for themselves and for us too, <hi>that the Faith and certainty of the Resurrection of Jesus</hi> might be conveyed to all that shall die and follow Christ in their own order.</p>
                  <p>Now this being matter of fact, cannot be

suppos'd infinite, but limited to time and place, and therefore to be prov'd by them who at that time were upon the place; good men and true, simple and yet losers by the bargain, many and united, confident and constant, preaching it all their life, and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaining it at their death. Men that would not deceive others, and <hi>Men that could not be deceiv'd themselves in a matter so notorious and so prov'd, and so seen: and if this be not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent credibility in a matter of Fact as</hi> this was, then we can <hi>have no story credibly transmitted to us, no Records kept, no</hi> Acts of Courts, no narratives of the dayes of old, no traditions of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, no memorials of them in the third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Nay, if from these we have not sufficient <hi>causes and arguments of Faith, how shall we be able to know the will of Heaven upon Earth? unless God do not only tell it once,</hi> but alwayes, and not only alwayes to some Men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to all Men: for if some Men must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others, they can never do it in any thing more reasonably than in this; and if we may not trust them in this, then without a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual miracle, no Man could have Faith: <hi>for Faith could never come by hearing; by nothing but by seeing.</hi> But if there be any use of History, any Faith in Men, any honesty in manners,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105896:181"/>
any truth in humane entercourse; if there be any use of Apostles or Teachers, of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, or Letters, of ears or hearing; if there be any such thing as the Grace of Faith, that is less than demonstration or intuition, then we may be as sure that Christ the first Fruits is already risen, as all these credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can make us. <hi>But let us take heed; as God hates a lie, so he hates incredulity; an obstinate, a foolish and pertinacious</hi> understanding. What we do every minute of our lives in matters of title and great concernment, if we refuse to do it in Religion, which yet is to be conducted as all humane affairs are, by humane instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and arguments of perswasion proper to the nature of the thing, it is an obstinacy as cross to humane reason, as it is to Divine Faith.</p>
                  <p>But this Article was so clearly prov'd, that presently it came to pass that Men were no longer asham'd of the Cross, but it was worn upon breasts, printed in the air, drawn upon foreheads, carried upon Banners, put upon crowns Imperial, presently it came to pass that the Religion of the despised Jesus did infinitely prevail: a Religion that taught Men to be meek and humble, apt to receive injuries, but unapt to do any; a Religion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105896:182"/>
that gave countenance to the poor and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in a time when riches were ador'd, and ambition and pleasure had possessed the heart of all Mankind; a Religion that would change the face of things, and the hearts of Men, and break vile habits into gentleness and counsel; that such a Religion, in such a time by the Sermons and Conduct of Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Men of mean breeding and illiberal Arts, should so speedily triumph over the Philosophy of the World, and the arguments of the subtil, and the Sermons of the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; the Power of Princes and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of States, the inclinations of Nature, and the blindness of zeal, the force of custom, and the sollicitation of passions, the pleasures of sin and the busie Arts of the Devil; that is, against Wit and Power, Superstition and Wilfulness, Fame and Money, Nature and Empire, which are all the causes in this World that can make a thing impossible; this, this is to be ascrib'd to the power of God, and is the great demonstration of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jesus. Every thing was an Argument for it, and improv'd it; no Objection could hinder it, no Enemies destroy it; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was for them, it made the Religion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; whatsoever was against them, made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105896:182"/>
it to increase; Sun-shine and Storms, Fair Weather or Foul, it was all one as to the event of things: for they were instruments in the hands of God, who could make what himself should chuse to be the product of any cause; So that if the Christians had peace, they went abroad and brought in Converts; if they had no peace, but persecution; the Converts came in to them. In prosperity they allur'd and intic'd the World by the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; in affliction and trouble they amaz'd all men with the splendour of their Innocence, and the glories of their patience; and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was that the World became Disciple to the glorious <hi>Nazarene,</hi> and men could no longer doubt of the Resurrection of Jesus, when it became so demonstrated by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them that saw it, and the courage of them that died for it, and the multitude of them that believ'd it; who by their Sermons, and their Actions, by their publick Offices and Discourses, by Festivals and Eucharists, by Arguments of Experience and Sense, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion, by perswading rational Men, and establishing believing Christians, by their living in the obedience of Jesus, and dying for the testimony of Jesus, have greatly advanc'd his Kingdom, and his Power, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105896:183"/>
his Glory, into which he entred after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead. For he is the first fruits; and if we hope to rise through him, we must confess that himself is first risen from the dead. That's the first particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an order for us also. We also shall rise again.

The ashes of old <hi>Camillus</hi> shall stand up sprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his Urne; and the Funeral fires shall produce a new warmth to the dead bones of all those who died under the arms of all the Enemies of the Roman greatness. This is a less wonder than the former: for <hi>admonetur omnis aetas jam fieri posse quod aliquando factum est.</hi> If it was done once, it may be done again; for since it could never have been done, but by a power that is infinite, that infinite must also be eternal and indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

                  <p>When Man was not, what power, what causes made him to be? whatsoever it was, it did then as great a work as to raise his body to the same being again; and because we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105896:183"/>
know not the method of Natures secret chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and how we can be fashioned beneath <hi>in secreto terrae,</hi> and cannot handle and discern the possibilities and seminal powers in the ashes of dissolved bones, must our ignorance in Philosophy be put in balance against the Articles of Religion, the hopes of Mankind, the Faith of Nations and the truth of God? and are our Opinions of the power of God so low, that our understanding must be his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and he shall be confessed to do nothing, unless it be made plain in our Philosophy? Certainly we have a low Opinion of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we believe he can do more things then we can understand. But let us hear S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s demonstration: If the Corn dies and lives again; if it layes its body down, suffers alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, dissolution and death, but at the spring rises again in the verdure of a leaf, in the fulness of the ear, in the kidneys of wheat; if it proceeds from little to great, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness to ornament, from emptiness to plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from unity to multitude, from death to life: be a Sadducee no more, shame not thy understanding, and reproch not the weakness of thy Faith, by thinking that Corn can be restor'd to life and Man cannot; especially since in every creature the obediential capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105896:184"/>
is infinite, and cannot admit degrees; for every Creature can be any thing under the power of God, which cannot be less than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
                  <p>But we find no obscure foot-steps of this mystery even amongst the Heathens. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports that <hi>Appion</hi> the Grammarian by the use of the plant <hi>0siris</hi> call'd <hi>Homer</hi> from his grave; and in <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> we find that <hi>Aelius Tubero</hi> return'd to life when he was seated in his Funeral pile; and in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Soleus</hi> after three dayes burial did live, and in <hi>Valerius</hi> that <hi>Aeris Pamphilius</hi> did so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten dayes. And it was so commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that <hi>Glaucus</hi> who was choked in a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of honey did rise again, that it grew to a Proverb; <hi>Glaucus poto melle resurrexit; Glaucus</hi> having tasted honey, died and liv'd again. I pretend not to believe these stories true; <hi>but from these instances it may be concluded that</hi> they believ'd it possible that there should be a Resurrection from the dead; and natural reason, and their Philosophy did not wholly destroy their hopes and expectation to have a portion in this Article.</p>
                  <p>For God knowing that the great hopes of Man, that the biggest endearment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the sanction of private Justice, the

                  <p n="3">3. First Christ and then we. And we therefore because Christ is already risen. But you must remember, <hi>that the Resurrection and Exaltation of Christ was the reward</hi> of his perfect obedience and purest holiness; and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to an imitation of the <hi>same obedience, and the same perfect holiness, prepares a way</hi> for us to the same Resurrection. If we by holiness become the Sons of God as Christ was, we shall also as he was become the Sons of God in the Resurrection: But upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms.

                     <hi>when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon thrones judging the tribes of Israel.</hi> For as it was with Christ the first fruits, so it shall be with all Christians in their own order: as with the Head, so it shall be with the Members. He was the Son of God by love and obedience, and then became the Son of God by Resurrection from the dead to life Eternal, and so shall we; but we cannot be so in any other way. To them that are Christ's, and to none else shall this be given. For we must know that God hath sent Christ into the World to be a great

example and demonstration of the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy and Dispensation of Eternal life. As God brought Christ to glory, so he will bring us, but by no other method. He first obeyed the will of God, and patiently suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the will of God; he died, and rose again, and entered into glory; and so must we. Thus Christ is made <hi>Via, Veritas, &amp; Vita,</hi> the Way, the Truth, and the Life; that is, the true way to Eternal life: He first trode this Wine-press, and we must insist in the same steps, or we shall never partake of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Resurrection. He was made the Son of God in a most glorious manner, and we by him, by his merit, and by his grace, and by his example: but other then this there is no way of Salvation for us. That's the first and great effect of this glorious order.</p>

So is every sinner that lies down in shame, and makes his grave with the wicked; he shall indeed rise again, and be called upon by the voice of the Archangel, but then he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into sorrows greater then the reason and the patience of a man, weeping and shrieking louder then the grones of the miserable chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Valley of <hi>Hinnon.</hi>

said <hi>Phocyllides</hi>; for we hope that from our beds of darkness we shall rise into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of light, and shall become like unto God: They shall partake of a Resurrection to life; and what this can infer is very obvious. For if it be so hard to believe a Resurrection from one death, let us not be dead in trespasses and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105896:189"/>
sins, for a Resurrection from two deaths will be harder to be believ'd, and harder to be effected. But if any of you have lost the life of Grace, and so forfeited all your title to a life of Glory, betake your selves to an early and an entire piety, that when by this first Resurrection you have made this way plain before your face, you may with confidence expect a happy Resurrection from your graves. For if it be possible that the spirit, when it is dead in sin, can arise to a life of righteousness; much more it is easie to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the body after death is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing restor'd again. And this is a consequent of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument, <hi>If when ye were enemies ye were reconciled by his death,</hi>

The first Resurrection is certainly the greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: But he that hath risen once, may rise again; and this is as sure as that he that dies once, may die again, and die for ever. But he who partakes of the death of Christ by Mortification, and of his Resurrection by holiness of life and a holy Faith, shall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the expression of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Enter into his chamber of death</hi>;<note place="margin">Isa. 26.20.</note> when Nature and Gods decree <hi>shall shut the doors upon him, and there he shall be hidden for a little moment</hi>: But then shall they that dwell in dust awake and sing, with Christs dead body shall they arise: all shall rise, but <hi>every man in his own order, Christ the first fruits, then they that are Christs at his coming.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with my Meditation of the Resurrection; but we have a new and a sadder subject to consider: It is glorious and brave when a Christian contemplates those glories which stand at the foot of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all God's Servants; but when we consider, that before all or any thing of this happens every Christian must twice <hi>exuere hominem,</hi> put off the Old man, and then lie down in dust and the dishonours of the Grave, it is <hi>Vinum Myrrhatum,</hi> there is Myrrhe put into our Wine; it is wholsom, but it will allay all our pleasures of that glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. But no man can escape it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Great <hi>Cyrus</hi> had rul'd long in a mighty Empire; yet there came a Message from Heaven, not so sad it may be, yet as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory as the Hand-writing on the wall that

For if Wit and Learning, great Fame and great Experience, if wise Notices of things, and an honourable Fortune, if Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Skill, if Prelacy and an honourable Age, if any thing that could give Greatness and Immunity to a wise and prudent man, could have been put in bar against a sad day, and have gone for good plea, this sad Scene of Sorrows had not been the entertainment of this Assembly.

While they liv'd they seem'd nothing, when they are dead, every man for a while speaks of them what they please, and afterwards they are as if they had not been. But the piety of the Christian Church hath made some little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision

And we have great reason so to do in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sad accident of the death of our late most Reverend Primate, whose death the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath very great reason to deplore; and we have great obligation to remember: his very many worthy Deeds done for this poor afflicted and despised Church.

For since good men, while they are alive, have their conversation in Heaven; when they are in Heaven 'tis also fit that they should in their good names live upon Earth.

when Envy and Flattery can have no Interest to interpose, as it is the best and most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sermon and Incentive to great things; so to conceal what good God hath wrought by them, is great unthankfulness to God and to good men.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Dorcas</hi> died the Apostle came to see the dead Corps, and the friends of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed expressed their grief and their love by shewing the Coats that she, whilest she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wrought with her own hands.

                  <p>He was bred in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>Sidney-college</hi> under Mr. <hi>Hulet,</hi> a grave and a worthy man, and he shewed himself not onely a fruitful Plant by his great progress in his Studies, but made him another return of gratitude, taking care to provide a good Imployment for him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he then began to be greatly interested. It was spoken as an honour to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he gave his Tutor an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Funeral; and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Statue unto his; and <hi>Gratian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour made his Master <hi>Ausonius</hi> to be <hi>Consul</hi>: And our worthy Primate, knowing the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which they pass upon us, who do <hi>Obstetricari gravidae animae,</hi> help the parturient Soul to bring forth fruits according to its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal powers, was careful not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the industry of such persons so useful to

the Church in the cultivating <hi>infantes palma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> young Plants, whose joynts are to be stretch'd and made streight; but to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that his Scholar knew how to value Learning, when he knew so well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Teacher.</p>
                  <p>Having pass'd the course of his studies in the University, and done his Exercise with that Applause which is usually the reward of pregnant Wits and hard study, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd into <hi>York-shire</hi>; where first in the City of <hi>York</hi> he was an assiduous Preacher, but by the disposition of the Divine Providence he happened to be engaged at <hi>North-Alerton</hi> in Disputation with three pragmatical Romish Priests of the Jesuits Order, whom he so much worsted in the Conference, and so shamefully disadvantaged by the evidence of Truth, represented wisely and learnedly, that the famous Primate of <hi>York,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Matthews,</hi> a learned and an excellent Prelate, and a most worthy Preacher, hearing of that Triumph, sent for him and made him his Chaplain; in whose service he continued till the death of the Primate, but in that time had given so much testimony of his great Dexterity in the Conduct of Ecclesiastical and Civil Affairs, that he grew dear to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105896:192"/>
In that Imployment he was made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of <hi>York,</hi> and then of <hi>Rippon</hi>; the Dean of which Church having made him his Sub-Dean, he managed the affairs of that Church so well, that he soon acquir'd a greater fame, and entered into the possession of many hearts, and admiration to those many more that knew him. There and at his Parsonage he continued long to do the duty of a learned and good Preacher, and by his Wisdom, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Deportment, so gain'd the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Nobility, Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of that Countrey, that as at his return thither upon the blessed Restauration of His most Sacred Majesty he knew himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd enough, and was so kind as to give them a Visit; so they by their coming in great numbers to meet him, their joyful Reception of him, their great Caressing of him when he was there, their forward hopes to enjoy him as their Bishop, their trouble at his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their unwillingness to let him go away, gave signal testimonies that they were wise and kind enough to understand and value his great worth.</p>
                  <p>But while he lived there he was like a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in the dust, (or <hi>Lucius Quinctius at the plough</hi>) his low Fortune covered a most

valuable person, till he became observ'd by Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> Lord President of <hi>York,</hi> whom we all knew for his great Excellencies, and his great but glorious Misfortunes. This rare person espied the great abilities of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and made him his Chaplain, and brought him into <hi>Ireland</hi> as one whom he believ'd would prove the most fit instrument to serve in that design, which for two years before his arrival here he had greatly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and resolved, the Reformation of Religion and the Reparation of the broken Fortunes of the Church: The Complaints were many, the Abuses great, the Causes of the Church vastly numerous, but as fast as they were brought in, so fast they were by the Lord Deputy referred back to Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> who by his indefatigable Pains, great Sagacity, perpetual Watchfulness, daily and hourly Consultations, reduc'd things to a more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition then they had been left in by the Schismatical principles of some, and the unjust Prepossessions of others, form any years before. For at the Reformation the Popish Bishops and Priests seemed to conform, and did so, that keeping their Bishopricks they might enrich their Kindred and dilapidate the Revenues of the Church; which by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105896:193"/>
Offices, false Informations, Fee-farms at contemptible Rents, and ungodly Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were made low as Poverty it self, and unfit to minister to the needs of them that serv'd the Altar, or the noblest purposes of Religion. For Hospitality decayed, and the Bishops were easie to be oppressed by those that would; and they complained, but for a long time had no helper, till God raised up that glorious Instrument the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who brought over with him as great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Church and to all publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, and as admirable Abilities, as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time did invest and adorn any of the Kings Vicegerents: and God fitted his hand with an Instrument good as his skill was great. For the first Specimen of his Abilities and Diligence in recovery of some lost Tithes being represented to His late Majesty of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and glorious memory, it pleased His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty upon the death of Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> to advance the Doctor to the Bishoprick of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But his care was beyond his Diocese, and his zele broke out to warm all his Brethren; and though by reason of the Favour and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King <hi>James</hi> the escheated Counties were well provided for their Tithes, yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks were not so well till the Primate, then Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> by the favour of the Lord Lieutenant and his own incessant and assiduous labour and wise conduct, brought in divers Impropriations, cancell'd many unjust Alienations, and did restore them to a condition much more tolerable; I say much more tolerable; for though he rais'd them above contempt, yet they were not near to envy; but he knew there could not in all times be wanting too many that envied to the Church every degree of prosperity: so <hi>Judas</hi> did to Christ the expence of Oyntment, and so <hi>Dyonisius</hi> told the Priest, When himself stole the golden Cloak from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and gave him one of Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the goods of this World are called waters by <hi>Solomon.</hi> Stollen waters are sweet, and they are too unstable to be stopt: some of these waters did run back from their proper chanel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to another course than God and the Laws intended, yet his labours and pious Counsels were not the less acceptable to God and good men, and therefore by a thankful and honourable recognition the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath transmitted in Record to posterity their deep resentment of his singular services and great abilities in this whole affair. And this honour will for ever remain to that Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>; he had a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> who repair'd the Temple and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105896:196"/>
restor'd its beauty, but he was the <hi>Joshuah,</hi> the High-priest, who under him ministred this blessing to the Congregations of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But his care was not determin'd in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour part onely, and Accessaries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; he was careful, and he was prosperous in it, to reduce that Divine and excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Church to publick and constant Exercise, to Unity and Devotion; and to cause the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be accepted as the Rule of publick confessions and perswasions here, that they and we might be <hi>Populus unius labii,</hi> of one heart and one lip, building up our hopes of heaven on a most holy Faith; and taking away that <hi>Shibboleth</hi> which made this Church lisp too undecently, or rather in some little degree to speak the speech of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and not the language of <hi>Canaan</hi>; and the excellent and wise pains he took in this particular no man can deho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestate or reproch, but he that is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to confess that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the best Reformed Church in the world. But when the brave Roman Infantry under the Conduct of <hi>Manlius</hi> ascended up to the Capitol to defend Religion and their Altars from the fury of the Gauls, they all pray'd to God, <hi>Ut quemadmodum ipsi ad defendendum
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105896:196"/>

And this excellent man in the Cause of Religion found the like blessing which they prayed for; God by the prosperity of his labours and a blessed effect gave testimony not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Piety and Wisdom of his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but that he loves to bless a wise Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it is vigorously imployed in a wise and religious labour. He overcame the difficulty in defiance of all such pretences as were made even from Religion it self to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the better procedure of real and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Religion.</p>
                  <p>These were great things and matter of great envy, and like the fiery eruptions of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius</hi> might with the very ashes of Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have buried another man.

death. For he wrote a Letter to the Bishop, pretended Intelligence between them, desir'd that according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer agreement such a Gate might be deliver'd to him. The messenger was not advis'd to be cautious, not at all instructed in the art of Secrecy, for it was intended that he should be search'd, intercep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But here God manifested his mighty care of his Servants; he was pleas'd to send into the heart of the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger such an affrightment, that he directly ran away with the Letter, and never durst come near the Town to deliver it. This story was publish'd by Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> himself, who added, That if he could have thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snar'd the Bishop, he had good assurance the Town should have been his own: <hi>Sed bonitas Dei praevalitura est super omnem malitiam hominis,</hi> The goodness of God is greater then all the malice of Men; and nothing could so prove how dear that sacred Life was to God, as his rescue from the dangers. <hi>Stantia non poterant tecta probare Deos</hi>: To have kept him in a warm house had been nothing, unless the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105896:200"/>
roof had fallen upon his head, that rescue was a remark of Divine favour and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But it seems Sir <hi>Phelim's</hi> Treason against the Life of this worthy Man had a Correspondent in the Town; and it broke out speedily; for what they could not effect by malicious stratagem, they did in part by open force; they turn'd the Bishop out of the Town, and upon trifling and unjust preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces search'd his Carriages, and took what they pleas'd, till they were asham'd to take more: they did worse then divorce him from his Church, for in all the Roman Divorces they said, <hi>Tuas tibi res habeto,</hi> Take your goods and be gone; but Plunder was Religion then. However, though the usage was sad, yet it was recompenc'd to him by his taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by that most incomparable and divine Prince; but having served the King in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> by his Pen, and by his Counsels, and by his Interests, return'd back to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where under the excellent conduct of his Grace the now Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque and fortune of oppressed Vertue.</p>
                  <p>But God having still resolv'd to afflict us, the good man was forc'd into the fortune of the Patriarchs, to leave his Countrey and his

Charges, and seek for safety and bread in a strange Land; for so the Prophets were us'd to do, wandring up and down in sheeps-clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but poor as they were the world was not worthy of them; and this worthy man, despising the shame, took up his Cross and followed his Master.

                  <p>But this most Reverend Prelate found a nobler adversary and a braver scene for his contention. He found that the Roman Priests being wearied and baffled by the wise Discourses and pungent Arguments of the English Divines, had studiously declined any more to dispute the particular Questions against us, but fell at last upon a general Charge, imputing to the Church of <hi>England</hi> the great crime of Schism; and by this they thought they might with most probability deceive unwary and unskilful Readers; for they saw the Schism, and they saw we had left them, and because they consider'd not the Causes, they resolv'd to out-face us in the Charge.

the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only to be guilty of the Schism by making it necessary to depart from them, but they did actuate the Schisms, and themselves made the first separation in the great point of the Popes Supremacy, which was the <hi>Palladium</hi> for which they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally contended. He made it appear that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were Usurpers of the rights of Kings and Bishops, that they brought in new Doctrines in every Age, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their own devices upon Christendom as Articles of Faith, that they prevaricated the Doctrines of the Apostles, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> only return'd to her Primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that she joyn'd with Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that she agreed in all the Sentiments of the Primitive Church. He stated the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions so wisely, and conducted them so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and handled them so learnedly, that I may truly say, they were never more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially confuted by any man, since the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have so unhappily disturbed Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Verum hoc eos malè ussit</hi>: and they find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves smitten under the fifth rib, set up an old Champion of their own, a <hi>Goliah</hi> to fight against the Armies of <hi>Israel</hi>; the old Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> known to many of us, replied to this excellent Book; but was so

answer'd by a Rejoynder made by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> in which he so press'd the former Arguments, refuted the Cavils, brought in so many impregnable Authorities and Probations, and added so many moments and weights to his discourse, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of reading the Book would be the greatest, if the profit to the Church of God were not greater.

For so <hi>Sampson</hi>'s riddle was again expounded; <hi>Out of the strong came meat, and out of the eater came sweetness</hi>; his Arguments were strong, and the Eloquence was sweet and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and though there start up another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant against him, yet he had onely the honour to fall by the hands of Hector: still <hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo</hi>; the headed arrow went in so far, that it could not be drawn out, but the barbed steel stuck behind. And whenever men will desire to be satisfied in those great questions, the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>'s book shall be his Oracle.</p>
                  <p>I will not insist upon his other excellent writings; but it is known every where with what Piety and <hi>acumen</hi> he wrote against the Manichean Doctrine of Fatal necessity, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105896:204"/>
a late witty man had pretended to adorn with a new Vizor; but this excellent person wash'd off the Cerusse and the meretricious Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rarely well asserted the oeconomy of the Divine Providence, and having once more triumph'd over his Adversary, <hi>plenus victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum &amp; trophaeorum</hi> betook himself to the more agreeable attendance upon Sacred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and having usefully and wisely discours'd of the sacred Rite of Confirmation, impos'd hands upon the most Illustrious Princes, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Princess Royal, and ministred to them the promise of the holy Spirit, and ministerially establish'd them in the Religion and Service of the holy Jesus. And one thing more I shall remark, that at his leaving those Parts upon the Kings Return, some of the Remonstrant Ministers of the Low-Countries coming to take their leaves of this great man, and desiring that by his means the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be kind to them, he had reason to grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were learned men, and in many things of a most excellent belief; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd them, and gave them caution against it, that they approched too near and gave too much countenance to the great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errors of the Socinians.</p>

And had this remark in all his Government, that as he was a great hater of Sacrilege, so he professed himself a publick enemy to Non-residence, and often would declare wisely and religiously against it, allowing it in no case but of Necessity or the greater good of the Church. There are great things spoken of his Predecessor S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that he founded 700. Churches and Religious Convents, that he ordain'd 5000. Priests, and with his own hands consecrated 350. Bishops. How true the story is I know not; but we were all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that the late Primate, whose memory we now celebrate, did by an extraordinary contingency of Providence in one day conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate two Archbishops and ten Bishops; and did benefit to almost all the Churches in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was greatly instrumental to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endowments of the whole Clergy; and in the greatest abilities and incomparable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry was inferiour to none of his most glorious Antecessours.</p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:105896:206"/>At his coming to the Primacy he knew he should at first espy little besides the Ruines of Discipline, a Harvest of Thorns, and Heresies prevailing in the hearts of the People, the Churches possess'd by Wolves and Intruders, Mens hearts greatly estranged from true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and therefore he set himself to weed the fields of the Church; he treated the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries sometimes sweetly, sometimes he confuted them learnedly, sometimes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buk'd them sharply. He visited his Charges diligently, and in his own person, not by Proxies and instrumental Deputations: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens non nostra, sed nos, &amp; quae sunt Jesu Christi</hi>; he design'd nothing that we knew of but the Redintegration of Religion, the Honour of God and the King, the Restoring of collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Discipline, and the Renovation of Faith and the Service of God in the Churches. And still he was indefatigable, and, even as the last scene of his life, intended to undertake a a Regal Visitation. <hi>Quid enim vultis me otio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum à Domino comprehendi</hi>? said one; he was not willing that God should take him unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: But, good man, he felt his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle ready to fall in pieces, and could go no further, for God would have no more work done by that hand; he therefore espying this,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105896:206"/>
put his house in order, and had lately visited his Diocese, and done what he then could to put his Charge in order; for he had a good while since receiv'd the sentence of death within himself, and knew he was shortly to render an account of his stewardship; he therefore upon a brisk alarm of death, which God sent him the last <hi>January,</hi> made his Will; in which, besides the prudence and presence of spirit manifested in making just and wise settlement of his Estate, and provisions for his Descendants; at midnight, and in the trouble of his sickness and circumstances of addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing death, still kept a special sentiment and made confession of Gods admirable mercies, and gave thanks that God had permitted him to live to see the blessed Restauration of His Majesty and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> confess'd his Faith to be the same as ever, gave praises to God that he was born and bred up in this Religion, and prayed to God and hop'd he should die in the Communion of this Church, which he declar'd to be the most pure and Apostolical Church in the whole world.</p>
                  <p>He prayed to God to pardon his frailties and infirmities, relied upon the mercies of God and the merits of Jesus Christ, and with

a singular sweetness resign'd up his soul into the hands of his Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>But God, who is the great <hi>Choragus</hi> and Master of the Scenes of Life and Death, was not pleas'd then to draw the Curtains; there was an Epilogue to his Life yet to be acted and spoken.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emember that it is your great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and tied on you by many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that you be exemplar in your lives, and be Patterns and Presidents to your Flocks: lest it be said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>Why takest thou my Law into thy mouth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hatest to be reformed thereby</hi>? He that lives an idle life may preach with Truth and Reason, or as did the Pharisees; but not as Christ, or as one having Authority.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister in taking accounts of his life,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> must judge of his Duty by more strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer measures, than he does of his People; and he that ties heavy burthens upon others, ought himself to carry the heaviest end: and many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105896:212"/>
things may be lawful in them, which he must not suffer in himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Let every Minister endeavour to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all spiritual wisdome, and skilful in the things of God; for he will ill teach others the way of godliness, perfectly, that is himself a babe and uninstructed. An ignorant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is an head without an eye; and an evil Minister is salt that hath no favour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Every Minister, above all things, must be carefull that he be not a servant of passion, whether of anger or desire. For he that is not a master of his passions will alwayes be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and quickly will become contemptible and cheap in the eyes of his Parish.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Let no Minister be litigious in any thing; not greedy or covetous; not insisting upon little things, or quarrelling for, or exacting of every minute portion of his dues; but boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and easie; remitting of his right, when to do so may be useful to his people, or when the contrary may do mischief, and cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. <hi>Be not over-righteous</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) that is, not severe in demanding, or forcing every thing, though it be indeed his due.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Let not the name of the Church be made a pretence for personal covetousness; by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105896:212"/>
you are willing to remit many things, but you must not wrong the Church: for though it be true, that you are not to do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to succession, yet many things may be forgiven upon just occasions, from which the Church shall receive no incommodity; but be sure that there are but few things which thou art bound to do in thy personal capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the same also, and more, thou art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to perform, as thou art a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>Never exact the offerings, or customary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> wages, and such as are allowed by law, in the ministration of the Sacraments, nor condition for them, nor secure them before-hand; but first doe your office, and minister the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely, readily, and for Christs sake; and when that is done, receive what is your due.</p>
                     <p>Avoid all pride, as you would flee from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> the most frightful apparition, or the most cruel enemy; and remember that you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly teach humility, or tell what it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you practise it your selves.</p>
                     <p>Take no measures of Humility, but such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> as are material and tangible; such which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist not in humble words, and lowly gestures; but what is first truly radicated in your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105896:213"/>
Souls, in low opinion of your selves, and in real preferring others before your selves, &amp; in such significations, which can neither deceive your selves nor others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Let every Curate of Souls strive to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand himself best; and then to understand others. Let him spare himself least; but most severely judge, censure, and condemn himself. If he be learned, let him shew it by wise tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and humble manners. If he be not learned, let him be sure to get so much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as to know that, and so much humility, as not to grow insolent, and puffed up by his Emptiness. For many will pardon a good man that is less learned; but if he be proud, no man will forgive him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Let every Minister be careful to live a life as abstracted from the Affairs of the world, as his necessity will permit him; but at no hand to be immerg'd and principally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Affairs of the World: What cannot be avoyded, and what is of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and what he is oblig'd to by any perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or collateral Duty, that he may do, but no more. Ever remembring the Saying of our blessed Lord: <hi>In the world ye shall have trouble; but in me ye shall have peace</hi>: and consider this also, which is a great Truth; That every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105896:213"/>
of love to the world, is so much taken from the Love of God.</p>
                     <p>Be no otherwise sollicitous of your Fame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> and Reputation, but by doing your duty well and wisely: in other things refer your selfe to God: but if you meet with evil Tongues, be careful that you bear reproaches sweetly and temperately.</p>
                     <p>Remember that no Minister can govern <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> his people well, and prosperously, unless him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath learn'd humbly and cheerfully to obey his Superiour. For every Minister should be like the good Centurion in the Gospel: himself is under authority, and he hath peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under him.</p>
                     <p>Be sure in all your Words and Actions to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> preserve Christian simplicity and ingenuity; to do to others, as you would be done unto your self; and never to speak what you doe not think. Trust to Truth, rather than to your Memory: for this may fail you, that will never.</p>
                     <p>Pray much and very fervently, for all your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Parishioners, and all men that belong to you, and all that belong to God; but especially for the Conversion of Souls; and be very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for nothing, but for Gods glory, and the salvation of the World, and particularly of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105896:214"/>
your Charges: Ever remembring that you are by God appointed, as the Ministers of Prayer, and the Ministers of good things, to pray for all the World, and to heale all the World, as far as you are able.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> Every Minister must learn and practise pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that by bearing all adversity meekly, and humbly, and cheerfully, and by doing all his duty with unwearied industry, with great courage, constancy, and Christian magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, he may the better assist his people in the bearing of their crosses, and overcoming their difficulties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> He that is holy, let him be holy still, and still more holy, and never think he hath done his work, till all be finished by perseverance, and the measures of perfection in a holy Life, and a holy Death: but at no hand must he magnifie himself by vain separations from others, or despising them that are not so holy.</p>

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105896:214"/>Let no Minister be governed by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> of his People, and destroy his duty, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable compliance with their humours, lest as the Bishop of <hi>Granata</hi> told the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of <hi>Leria</hi> and <hi>Patti,</hi> like silly Animals they take burdens upon their backs at the pleasure of the multitude, which they neither can retain with Prudence, nor shake off with Safety.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Reverence of any man cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> you to sin against God; but in the matter of Souls, being well advis'd, be bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but abate nothing of the honour of God, or the just measures of your duty, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the importunity of any man whatsoever, and God will bear you out.</p>
                     <p>When you teach your people any part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> their duty, as in paying their debts, their tithes and offerings, in giving due reverence and religious regards, diminish nothing of admonition in these particulars, and the like, though they object, That you speak for your selves, and in your own cases. For a counsel is not the worse, but the better, if it be profitable both to him that gives, and to him that takes it. Onely do it in simplicity, and principally intend the good of their souls.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> Be not satisfied when you have done a good work, unless you have also done it well; and when you have, then be carefull that vain-glory, partiality, self-conceit, or any other folly or indiscretion, snatch it not out of your hand, and cheat you of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                     <p>Suffer no quarrel in your Parish, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> suppress it when it is begun; and though all wise men will abstain from interposing in other mens affairs, and especially in matters of Interest, which men love too well; yet it is your duty Duty here to interpose, by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to friendships, reconcilements, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate prosecutions of their pretences; and by all means you prudently can, to bring them to peace and brotherly kindness.</p>
                     <p>Suffer no houses of Debauchery, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/> Drunkenness or Lust in your Parishes; but implore the assistance of Authority for the suppressing of all such meeting-places and nurseries of Impiety: &amp; as for places of publick

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/> If there be any Papists or Sectaries in your Parishes, neglect not frequently to confer with them in the spirit or meekness, and by the importunity of wise Discourses seeking to gain them.

Cause them to love you and revere you; to love with Religion, not for your compliance; for the good you do them, not for that you please them.

Brethren, do well for your selves: do well for your selves as long as you have time; you know not how soon death will come.</p>
                     <p>Entertain no persons into your Assemblies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVII"/> from other Parishes, unless upon great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or in the destitution of a Minister, or by contingency and seldome visits, or with leave: lest the labour of thy brother be discouraged, and thy selfe be thought to preach Christ out of envy, and not of good will.</p>
                     <p>Never appeal to the judgement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVIII"/> in matters of controversie; teach them obedience, not arrogancy; teach them to be humble, not crafty. For without the aid of false guides you will find some of them of themselves apt enough to be troublesome: and a question put into their heads, and a power of judging into their hands, is a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to their choice whether you shall be troubled by them this week or the next; for much longer you cannot escape.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLI"/> Let ever Minister be carefull that what he delivers be indeed the Word of God: that his Sermon be answerable to the Text; for this is Gods Word, the other ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it; that although in it self it be but the word of Man, yet by the purpose, truth, and signification of it, it may in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary sense be the Word of God.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLII"/> Do not spend your Sermons in generall and indefinite things, as in Exhortations to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105896:218"/>
the people to get Christ, to be united to Christ, and things of the like unlimited signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but tell them in every duty, what are the measures, what circumstances, what instruments, and what is the particular mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute meaning of every general Advice. For Generals not explicated do but fill the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heads with empty notions, and their mouths with perpetual unintelligible talk: but their hearts remain empty, and themselves are not edified.</p>
                     <p>Let not the humours and inclinations of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIII"/> the people be the measures of your Doctrines, but let your Doctrines be the measure of their perswasions. Let them know from you what they ought to do; but if you learn from them what you ought to teach, you will give but a very ill account at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the souls committed to you. He that receives from the people what he shall teach them, is like a Nurse that asks of her Child what Physick she shall give him.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister in reproofs of sin and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIV"/> ought to concern himself in the faults of them that are present, but not of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; nor in reproofe of the times; for this can serve no end but of Faction and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, publick Murmur and private Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;

Every Minister ought to preach to his Parish, and urge their duty: S. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist told the Souldiers what the Souldiers should do, but troubled not their heads with what was the duty of the Scribes and Pharisees.</p>

For this grace is not finished by good words, nor yet by good works, but it is a great building, and many materials go to the structure of it. It is worth your study, for it is the fulfilling of the Commandements.</p>
                     <p>Because it is impossible that Charity should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIX"/> live, unless the lust of the tongue be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let every Minister in his charge be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and severe against slanderers, detractors and backbiters; for the Crime of backbiting is the poyson of Charity; and yet so common, that it is pass'd into a Proverb, [<hi>After a good dinner let us sit down and backbite our neighbours.</hi>]</p>

It is enough that you reprove an Errour; but what shall be the sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it at the day of Judgement, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not, and therefore pray for the erring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and reprove him, but leave the sentence to his Judge.</p>
                     <p>Let your Sermons teach the duty of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIII"/> states of men to whom you speak; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly take care of Servants and Hirelings, Merchants and Tradesmen, that they be not unskilful, nor unadmonished in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive duties; and in all things speak usefully and affectionately; for by this means you will provide for all mens needs, both for them that sin by reason of their little understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and them that sin because they have evil, dull, or depraved affections.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LV"/> Let every Minister in his charge, as much as he can, endeavour to destroy all popular errors and evil principles taken up by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or others with whom they converse; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that directly oppose the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable necessity of a holy life: let him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to understand in what true and useful sense Christs active obedience is imputed to us; let him make his people fear the defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Repentance, and putting it off to their death-bed; let him explicate the nature of Faith, so that it be an active and quickning principle of Charity; let him, as much as he may, take from them all confidencies that slacken their obedience and diligence; let him teach them to impute all their sins to their own follies and evil choice, and so build them up in a most holy faith to a holy life; ever remembring that in all ages it hath been the greatest artifice of Satan to hinder the increase of Christs Kingdome, by destroying those things in which it does consist, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Every Minister ought to be careful that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVI"/> never expound Scriptures in publick contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the known sense of the Catholick Church, and particularly of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor introduce any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine against any of the four first General Councils; for these, as they are measures of truth, so also of necessity; that is, as they are safe, so they are sufficient; and besides what is taught by these, no matter of belief is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation.</p>
                     <p>Let no Preacher bring before the people in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVII"/> his Sermons or Discourses, the Arguments of great and dangerous Heresies, though with a purpose to confute them; for they will much easier retain the Objection than understand the Answer.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Preacher make an Article of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVIII"/> Faith to be a matter of dispute; but teach it with plainness and simplicity, and confirm it with easie arguments and plain words of Scripture, but without objection; let them be taught to believe, but not to argue, lest if the arguments meet with a scrupulous person, it rather shake the foundation by curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, than establish it by arguments too hard.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXIX"/> Let every Minister exhort and press the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a devout and periodical communion, at the least three times in the year, at the great Festivals: but the devouter sort, and they who have leisure,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105896:225"/>
are to be invited to a frequent Communion: and let it be given and received with great reverence.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister ought to be well skill'd and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXX"/> in saying his Office, in the Rubricks, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, the Articles, and the Homilies of the Church, that he may do his duty readily, discreetly, gravely, and by the publick measures of the Laws. To which also it is very usefull that it be added, that every Minister study the ancient Canons of the Church, especially the Penitentials of the Eastern and Western Churches: let him read good Books, such as are approved by publick authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; such which are useful, wise and holy; not the scriblings of unlearned parties, but of men learned, pious, obedient and disinterested; and amongst these, such especially which describe duty and good life, which minister to Faith and Charity, to Piety and Devotion; Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and solid expositions of Scripture. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which learned and wise persons are to be consulted.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Curate of Souls trouble himself with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXXI"/> any studies, but such which concern his own or his peoples duty; such as may enable him to speak well, and to do well; but to meddle not with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, but such by which he may be enabled to convince the gainsayers in things that concern publick peace and a good life.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXXII"/> Be careful in all the publick adminstrations of your parish, that the poor be provided for. Think it no shame to beg for Christs poor members; stir up the people to liberal alms by your word and your example. Let a collection be made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lords day, and upon all solemn meetings, and at every Communion; and let the Collection be wisely and piously administred: ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that at the day of Judgement nothing shall publickly be proclaimed, but the reward of alms and mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXXIII"/> Let every Minister be sure to lay up a treasure of comforts and advices, to bring forth for every mans need in the day of his trouble; let him stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and heap together Instruments and Advices for the promoting of every virtue, and remedies and arguments against every vice; let him teach his people to make acts of virtue not onely by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal exercise, but also in the way of Prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal meditation.</p>
                     <p>In these and all things else that concern the Ministers duty, if there be difficulty you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to your Bishop for further advice, assistance and information.</p>
