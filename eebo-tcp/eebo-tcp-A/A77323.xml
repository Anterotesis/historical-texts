         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note n="b" place="margin">Lam. 3. 2.</note> and brings him into diſtreſſe,<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 19. 7.</note> his friends
and acquaintance are then wanting unto him,
<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 38. 11.</note> they ſtand aloofe,<note n="e" place="margin">Job 10. 1.</note> and leave him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

of Gods dealing with thoſe whom he loves,
for by this means,<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> though the outward man
periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day. But when the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to
<note n="h" place="margin">Jonah. 4. 6.</note> deliver the party afflicted from his griefe,<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 90. 15.</note>
he is exceeding glad, and then his<note n="i" place="margin">Job 42. 11.</note> friends
and acquaintance rejoyce with him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
their love and affections towards him in
a bountifull manner:<note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 116. 5, 6.</note> this have I (through
Gods goodneſſe) knowne by experience, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
theſe latter times:<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 5. 12.</note> for many are the

great favours, is ſuch a happineſſe to me, as I
muſt needs confeſſe you are to me more like a

            <p>IT is not unknowne to many, how that of late years
I<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles 2. 24.</note> enjoyed the bleſsings of this life with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and how I then lived in good credit, being
much reſpected of friends and kindred who<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 55. 14.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in my company, and many were as glad to receive
courteſies from me, as I was willing to beſtow them.<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 23. 24.</note> But
this laſted not long, for after a while<note n="d" place="margin">Job 3. 26.</note> I fell into many
troubles, and then<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 107. 27.</note> I loſt my ſelfe,<note n="f" place="margin">Job 19. 14.</note> and my friends, I

to make up the Tragedy, I loſt my liberty, being<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 18. 30.</note> caſt

and being there a while (<note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam 30. 4.</note> at the center of all my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

to give the beſt content <hi>I</hi> could to all my cuſtomers both
at home and abroad. Yet notwithſtanding all this, in
regard <hi>I</hi> could not procure ſo much as would diſcharge
my chamber rent, I was threatned by my Landlord (the

put into a<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 5. 18.</note> worſe place in the ſame priſon, which did in
