         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Sheets containing an Anſwer to Dr.
<hi>Goodall</hi>'s Letter; and alſo an Anſwer to a Sheet
of Paper writ by Dr. <hi>Leigh;</hi> I think my ſelf bound to make
an Apology to the World upon a double Score: And firſt,
for what I have ſaid in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi>'s Letter.
And upon this Account, all that I need to ſay is, that had
the Doctor not ſuffered his Letter to be Printed, I had
not Writ or Publiſhed what I have; but ſince he began firſt,
he I hope, or at leaſt the World will pardon me, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Matter of Fact ſo plainly, that they might judge of
the Sincerity and Truth of his Letter.</p>
            <p>But perhaps there are ſome, and I hope a great many,
that will be unapt to believe the Grounds of the following
Relation true; I ſay, I hope they will be unapt to believe
it; becauſe I would not wiſh them to have the ſame Reaſons
to change their Thoughts of him as I have; and that I
have fufficient Reaſon to think the Character I once gave
him, rather what I could have wiſhed him to be, than
what he is. I conceive the following Certificates, together
with his own Letter, will be ſelf-evident Arguments; I
have the Copy of his Letter writ by his own Hand, and the
Certificate ſigned and witneſſed by the Perſons whoſe Names
are Subſcribed; ſo that if any Body ſhould queſtion the
Truth, they ſhall be convinced with thoſe Papers.</p>
            <p>As for Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> all the Apology I need to make is,
That I beg their Pardon for taking Notice of his Libels,
ſince Envy and Malice needs no other Anſwer but Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
And if the Doctor takes ſuch a delight in writing
<hi>Penny</hi> and <hi>Two-penny Books,</hi> he may look out for ſome
other Adverſary, that thinks it worth his while to hearken
<pb facs="tcp:102267:3"/>
to him: I for my Part, ſhall entertain the ſame Opinion
of him as the World does, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Remarks are his
true and real Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall let the World know, that I take ſo little
delight in oppoſing ſuch Adverſaries, that for the future
(except I have great Reaſon for it) I ſhall leave ſuch as
have not the uſe of their Reaſon to confute themſelves; and
ſhall rather ſpend my time in making what Improvements
I can in the Profeſſion I have made choice of: And as Truth
and Reaſon ſhall always be the Rules by which I ſhall write
ſo far as I can, ſo if I think my ſelf upon that Score con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to oppoſe any one that may be miſtaken, I ſhall ſhew
that reſpect which is due both to their Learning and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
but if on the contrary, their Ignorance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Learned Men, deſerves ill Uſage, I ſhall leave
it to ſome body elſe to gave them their Merit, who ſhall not
think it time miſpent to anſwer them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Epiſtle with this <hi>Advertiſement,
viz.</hi> That whereas a Party of Men have imagined, that by
Vindicating the Colledge, I oppoſed them; I profeſs, that
by the Colledge, I meant no ſeparate Party, but all ſuch
Members which had not adopted that Doctrine which I
writ againſt; and except they include themſelves in that
Number, I ſhall declare that no Party ſhall engage me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Truth and Reaſon, either for or againſt any Body;
and what is the Product of that ſmall ſhare I have of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I ſhall always ſubmit to the Candid Cenſure of the
Learned; to whom I ſubſcribe my ſelf</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO
Dr. Goodall's Letter,
Dated <date>Decemb. 6th, 1698.</date> in a Letter
to Himſelf.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Muſt confeſs, it was not without a little Concern
and Surprize, that I found a Letter againſt me
with Doctor <hi>Goodall</hi>'s Name to it: I once thought,
and had I not evident Reaſon to the contrary, I
ſhould think ſtill, that Doctor <hi>Goodall</hi> was a Man of
more Courage and Honour, (as well as Juſtice, than to
deſert a Cauſe he had once engaged himſelf in; of
more Courage and Honour) I ſay; becauſe it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt both, to turn your Back upon what
you thought Juſt; and of more Juſtice, becauſe it
would be unjuſt to engage your ſelf in Encouraging
or Patronizing that, which in your Opinion was not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102267:4"/>
Approved. And give me leave to ſay, this Letter
which Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath Printed, will, I am afraid, call
in Queſtion your Judgment, as well as Honour and
Juſtice; for if in your Judgment you thought my
Book was faulty, why did you Patronize it with ſuch
Zeal? If the contrary, why ſhould you not have the
ſame Opinion now as before?</p>
            <p>At leaſt, Doctor, it had been better to have been
Silent, and much more Prudent, than to force me
to prove, what in your Letter you deny. It is a thing
I confeſs I am very loth to do, and would not, did I
not think my Reputation concern'd in it: For I am
yet ready to acknowledge, that I not long ſince,
thought my ſelf very much obliged to you; and as
Favours received from any one, ſhall with me be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Obligations of Reſpect to them that beſtowed
them on me; ſo I would be unwilling to do any thing
which ſhould look like Ingratitude to you: For I muſt
beg leave to ſay, that with me, Ties of Friendſhip
ſhall be held inviolable, if it lies in my Power; and
Obligations I ſhall ever hold as Sacred. But as the Caſe
now ſtands, the greateſt Reſpect I can ſhew you, is to
prove the Contents of your Letter in reſpect of your
Reflections falſe, without that Severity which your
Uſage of me really deſerves; for whatever you may
think, I am bold to ſay, that I ſhall make it appear
that your laſt Obligations and Favours have made
your former of very little value. Therefore to juſtify
my ſelf, and to do you no wrong, I ſhall anſwer your
<hi>Letter</hi> in the ſame Method you have writ it; firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
you thanks for the good Character you are
pleaſed to give of my other Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102267:4"/>
The Firſt Words which concern me are theſe; <hi>I—
own your Writing to me about Mr.</hi> Boulton'<hi>s Book, as a
Particular Favour, he having by no means obliged me by
his Rude and Unmannerly Reflections upon you; who I
am ſenſible are not therein treated like a Gentleman or
a Scholar. The Language and Reflections I own to be
ſuch, as no Man of good Breeding, much leſs any Cenſor
of the College of Phyſitians would paſs with an</hi> Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur.
To this, Doctor, I muſt anſwer, That as for
an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to ſuch a thing as that, I never deſired
it, for there was no need of it, it being an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to
ſuch Ridiculous Reflections on me, as you were
pleaſed to ſay at your own Table, <hi>were the Rudeſt
and moſt Malicious that ever you ſaw in your Life, and
that you thought that no Doctor in Phyſick could write ſuch
Stuff:</hi> This was your Opinion of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks;
and as for my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them, I will certify
any Body upon Oath, that you Read the greateſt part
of them whilſt I ſat by you, and that when you were
weary, I read the remaining part to you; and that
you were ſo far from finding Fault, that you ſmiled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the while; and not long after gave your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Opinion of them to a Learned Man of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> this I affirm to be true, with
as much Solemnity, as if I were to ſay it upon Oath.
But ſuppoſing you had neither approved nor diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
the thing, I leave the World to judge, whether
you have not much more reaſon to reflect on Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>
than me, he having reflected on me, who never was in
the leaſt acquainted with him, and conſequently could
not poſſibly diſoblige him; and as for me, I have only
turned his own Dirt upon him again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102267:5"/>
The next Words I ſhall take notice of in your
<hi>Letter,</hi> are theſe, <hi>As to his writing againſt Mr.</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,
<hi>I must own that did encourage him thereto, he
having ſo rudely treated the Univerſities, Colledge of
Phyſitians, and the moſt Learned Men of our Faculty,
and likewiſe Published and Defended ſuch an Erroneous
Hypotheſis, and raiſed ſuch a Dangerous Superſtructure
thereon, as I fear will prove fatal to many.—Yet
notwithſtanding Mr.</hi> Colbatch <hi>hath deſerved Ill of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>I cannot commend Mr.</hi> Boulton' <hi>s Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in the manner he hath done, which was ſo far from
my Opinion and Good liking,</hi> &amp;c. Really, Doctor, I am
concern'd for your Reputation, that you ſhould ſuffer
ſuch things to be Printed, which you could not but
think highly diſingenuous, and contrary to Truth,
if not inconſiſtent with Reaſon it ſelf: For here
you declaim againſt my way of treating Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
yet ſay he hath <hi>deſerved Ill,</hi> his Hypotheſis is
<hi>Erroneous, Dangerous and Fatal to many:</hi> Where you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
what I have done; for if his Hypotheſis be <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
Dangerous and Fatal to many,</hi> and <hi>deſerved Ill;</hi>
if what I have writ be ill Uſage, it is what you here
pronounce to be his Merit, though in the following
Words you ſay it is <hi>contrary to your Approbation and
Good Liking:</hi> Which Words, if true, it follows, that
your own Opinion is contrary to your own good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
becauſe what I have writ is according to it; and
if you fall out with your own Opinion, well may you
with mine.</p>
            <p>But give me leave to ſay, my Book is not only Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd
by what you ſay now, but was Printed and was
Writ or altered according to your good Liking: For
before I writ one Word of it, when you enourag'd me
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102267:5"/>
to it, I told you, I thought it was not worth my
while to take notice of his Books, and that I hated to
write in ſuch a manner as it was by ſome thought he
ought to be treated in; but to this you told me, <hi>I
could not handle him too roughly,</hi> or ſome ſuch Words;
and this (to put it into your Memory) you told me
as I was walking with you croſs <hi>Smithfield.</hi> Again,
you declaimed upon the ſame Subject coming down
<hi>Floulborn,</hi> where you told me, <hi>It would do the Faculty
of Phyſick a great deal of Service;</hi> which prevailed
with me to gratifie your Humour, though contrary
to my own Inclination; I then thinking your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
preferable to my own, eſpecially in a City where
I was almoſt a Stranger then, and the Temper of
which I was then unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>But you did not only approve it then, but when I
had writ but a ſmall part of it, you gave me leave to
Dedicate it to you; for though in your own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
you ſeem'd with a Smile to refuſe it, yet upon
Reading over the <hi>Dedication,</hi> you were pleas'd with
another Smile to accept it, telling me modeſtly, <hi>It
was more than you deſerved:</hi> And really I fear you
have given me Reaſon to think it ſo; yet, I confeſs,
I am heartily ſorry, if I was ſo much miſtaken in
you.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to your further <hi>Good-liking,</hi> you not

            <p>Beſides theſe Certificates, I could add Two more,
were there Occaſion, but theſe I ſuppoſe may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
to ſhew that you approved of them; beſides,
when the whole Book was Printed, I carried the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
to you, which you conſented to; nor did you
expreſs the leaſt Diſſatisfaction concerning the <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when the Book was Publiſhed, but only ſaid,

But you further ſay, you requeſted me to read the
Learned Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book, and to imitate that Learned
Author, in my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Colbatch.</hi> Truly, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you were commending Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and ſaid,
<hi>He had mauld the Unmannerly Dr.</hi> Bently, when I had
writ about half my Anſwer; but I can never think your
Judgment ſo weak, as to have propoſed it for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
Since there is no Parallel in the Caſe; for tho'
I remember you ſaid, <hi>One might ſee how a Gentleman
could manage a Clown;</hi> yet it is on all Hands agreed,
that as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is an Ingenious Man, ſo Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>
is a Learned Man, as well as the former; but Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
ſure is not a Doctor <hi>Bentley,</hi> tho' you think ſit
to parallel them, for you ſay, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath rais'd
a <hi>dangerous,</hi> a <hi>fatal,</hi> and an <hi>Erroncous</hi> Hypotheſis, but
Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> hath not; for it is not dangerous or fatal
to read any thing about <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Circumſtances ſhew there is no Parallel,
and conſequently it could be no Pattern: And I hope
you will not wrong your Judgment ſo much, as to
ſay, that when a Man runs down Learning as much as
he can, the ſame Meaſures are to be taken as if he only
erred in Criticiſms; for one Critick may make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on another in a different way, by which he
may think the World will be ſet a Laughing, and by
that means Ridicule the other: But when a Man, as
you ſay, lays down Notions of a more Dangerous
Conſequence, and which may be fatal to many, Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
may ſet Men a Laughing that underſtand the Jeſt,
but it will never convince weak and unthinking Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians;
nay, that which is Ridicule to a Judicious
Man, is not Ridicule to a Man that Underſtands not
the Unreaſonableneſs of a thing; for ſuch cannot think
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102267:7"/>
it Ridiculous till they are convinced it is Erroneous;
and though Laughter may make an Impreſſion upon
their Lungs, it never influences the Reaſon of thoſe
that think Laughter unreaſonable; and though the
Weaker ſort of Phyſitians can read a Satyr, and keep
the Subject before them in their Thought at the ſame
time, yet Laughter puts them out of a Capacity of
Thinking, and conſequently of being Convinced. In
ſhort, it may make Men Merry for a time, but it
never laſts longer than their Lungs are in a violent
Motion; whereas a Satyr where it is due, renders the
Subject oppoſed more deſpicable, and brings a Cloud
upon it, without ſetting the Readers Head a ſhaking,
and rendring the Sight inconſtant.</p>
            <p>But not to urge at preſent what might be ſaid in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Satyrs, where a Deſign is to influence the
Vulgar, and not to ſet Learned Men a Laughing, I
ſhall only ſhew you how much your Propoſition of a
Pattern was inconſiſtent not only with Reaſon, but
the Opinion of the greateſt Orators that we know of.
For <hi>Cicero,</hi> that Father of <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>pro Sext. Roſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

omnis convenire, The ſame Meaſures are not to be
taken upon all Occaſions:</hi> For as he further ſays, <hi>Haec
enim est Cauſa Nova ac Singularis, This is a peculiar
Cauſe,</hi> and therefore muſt have a peculiar Method in
managing of it. Again in his Book, <hi>de Oratore,</hi> he
ſays, <hi>Neque eſt dubium, quin Exordium dicendi, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
&amp; pugnax, non ſaepe eſſe debeat; No doubt but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an Oration ought to begin with heat and earneſtneſs.</hi>
According to which, in his Oration <hi>pro Q. Roſſio,</hi> he
falls upon a whole Body of Men. <hi>O! Societatem cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſam
&amp; indignam,</hi> &amp;c. Again, the ſame Father of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102267:7"/>
in his Book of Oratory ſays, it is the Part
of an Orator, <hi>Ut inveniat quemadmodum fidem faciat
eis quibus volet perſuadere, &amp; quemadmodum Motum eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Aninus afferat; It's the part of an Orator to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Arguments are neceſſary to gain Aſſent, and
what may move Mens Paſſions.</hi> And I leave it to any
candid Judge, whether Laughter or Satyr are more
proper, where an Hypotheſis is <hi>Erroneous, Dangerous</hi>
and <hi>Fatal to many?</hi> Whether Mens Lives are to be
made Subjects of Laughter, or rather of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern?</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the laſt Paragraph of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
You ſay, <hi>I am truly ſorry, that in the Particulars you
mention, he hath not only diſobliged me, but many others.</hi>
How many I have diſobliged by oppoſing them, I am
not inſenſible; but as for your ſelf, I can aſſure the
World, it is not by writing againſt Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> nor
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> for if it were ſo, I had diſobliged you
half a Year ago; for then you had read Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>'s
<hi>Anſwer;</hi> and it is above Four Months ſince my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
to Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> was Printed, though for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
it was not Publiſhed ſo ſoon: But you and I
have not been fallen out above Seven Weeks; beſides,
if you had been diſobliged with my Writing ſo againſt
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> by the ſame Reaſon you would have
fallen out with Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> he having writ a <hi>Two-Penny</hi>
Book with worſe Language than Mine; and if my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
to him diſobliged you, his Reflections would
have had the ſame Effect; but inſtead of that, you
are both raiſed to ſuch a Pitch of Friendſhip, that you
are got to be <hi>Reverend,</hi> and your Friend, <hi>the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
though before the <hi>Reverend</hi> fell out with me,
the <hi>Honoured</hi> was unknown to the <hi>Reverend</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102267:8"/>
But further, if my Reflections on Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> or
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> had diſobliged you, you'd have diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
your ſelf, for you did not only correct my Book,
but Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s againſt <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lmon,</hi> which hath as many
Reflections as Mine; and I am afraid that's contrary
to your <hi>Good-liking</hi> by this Time. But ſure you'll
not turn your Back on Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> and ſay it's contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to your <hi>Good-liking:</hi> No, he's a little Older than
I, and you're a little more afraid of his Reſentments:
But <hi>though Young Birds are more eaſily catched with
Chaff</hi> than Old ones, yet they are not all ſo enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but ſometimes they make ſhift to diſintangle
themſelves. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>We are to look for another Cauſe of your preſent
Obligations, and to ſeek for another Cauſe of our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out, which in ſhort was this. In <hi>May</hi> laſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the following Letters from you, writ both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that there is a Work in a certain Part of Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
which he is very capable to perform, and will be
both Reputable and Advantageous to him; but that for
ſome Reaſons you cannot as yet acquaint him with Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

                     <hi>I</hi> Thank you for your very Kind and Ingenuous Letter of
the 18th Inſtant; your Gratitude expreſſed therein,
doth highly oblige me, and you may be aſſured I will do
you all the good Offices I can:—Your <hi>Printer</hi> hath

            <p>Now from this <hi>Letter,</hi> it is plain, you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
about the Preſs; but of that enough before.
And how far you have been my Sincere or Faithful
Friend, I leave the World to judge, who have a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen
of your Sincerity in this <hi>Letter.</hi> Upon the
Receiving thereof, I came to Town as ſoon as I could
poſſibly, but too late for what was mentioned in the
former part of the <hi>Letter;</hi> which was to be taken for
a peculiar kind of Favour to be ſent for from <hi>Oxford</hi>
for nothing; whereas I writ to you the Week before
about it. But that it might not be for nothing, you got
me to Tranſlate Dr. <hi>Groenvelt</hi>'s Book about <hi>Cantharides,</hi>
into <hi>Engliſh</hi> for you, which to pleaſe you, I did. Why
you could not anſwer that Book (for you threatned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102267:9"/>
it mightily) in <hi>Latin</hi> as well as in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I will not
ſay. But this was not enough to ſend for me from
<hi>Oxford</hi> for, but you ſo tyred me with one thing after
another, that I muſt either ſpend my time wholly for
you, or you would not be pleaſed.</p>
            <p>But you will be apt to ſay, I am ſtill obliged to
you; and truly I am not inſenſible of your laſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
ſince to make Tryal of them, I only deferred
Writing ſome Unreaſonable things you deſired, upon
which the Storms roſe, and the Winds blew, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
untied the Bonds of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>But ſince I have made this Relation Publick, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be wondered, why I ſhould be your Humble
Servant ſo long, having no more Reaſon than your
ſending for me to <hi>London,</hi> for nothing almoſt; ſince to
diſappoint me, and ſerve me ſo handſomly, was none
of the moſt worthy Actions of the Phyſician to the
<hi>Charter-Houſe.</hi> That this then may ſeem leſs ſtrange,
I muſt own, that you made me ſuch Promiſes of your
Intereſt in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that I was willing to ſpend a little
time to ſee the Event; but when I ſaw you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me in that, as well as your Letter to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
I thought it high time to make better uſe of it, than
to conſume it with Dr. <hi>Goodall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have, I hope, ſatisfied the World, that
you have dealt, if I may be ſo bold to ſay ſo, very
diſingeniouſly with me; yet I was willing to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
had you not Maliciouſly done me the favour
to publiſh your Spleen againſt me.</p>
            <p>Yet I can eaſily forgive you; and am from my
Heart ſorry, that your Reaſon ſhould be ſo prevail'd
on by the violence of your Paſſion: But ſince it is ſo,
and paſt help, I hope you will pardon this Freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102267:9"/>
which you your ſelf have been the Occaſion of: And
this I will aſſure you of, though it lies in my Power
to ſay much more to your Diſadvantage, I ſhall not,
except you give me further Reaſon: And I could wiſh,
there were no juſt Cauſe given to prevent me from
Subſcribing my ſelf,</p>

            <p>THAT Doctor <hi>Leigh</hi> may be ſatisfied I am
the very ſame Man I ever took my ſelf to be,
I have, by Certificates from the Perſons who
carried my Sheets to Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi>'s Houſe (from the
Place where I have lodged ever ſince I came to <hi>London)</hi>
proved, that Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi> did correct and approve of my
Book; and that he was concerned in it, appears from
his <hi>Letter</hi> ſent to me at <hi>Oxford:</hi> And how diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
and diſhonourably the Doctor hath dealt with
me, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>But of this I have ſaid enough before; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take a View of what the Doctor hath ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt me, or in Defence of himſelf; in doing
which, I ſhall only lay down Matter of Fact, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102267:11"/>
leave the World to judge whether I have given him
his Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> in his Title, he calls my laſt Book, my
<hi>Laſt Piece;</hi> he calls my Book of the <hi>Heat of the Blood,</hi>
a <hi>Piece;</hi> ſo that all I can write in the Language of the
Famous <hi>Doctor Doctorum</hi> Doctor <hi>Leigh</hi> muſt needs be
Pieces: But I leave it to the World to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what he writes, be not more like Pieces than
Books; for in the firſt Place he writ a <hi>Penny</hi> Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me; next he writ a <hi>Three penny</hi> Book againſt
Mr. <hi>Colbatch;</hi> and now I have got a <hi>Two-penny</hi> Book
again: So that I cannot for the Heart of me, ſtretch
the Doctors Phancy, to write a Book as valuable as a
common <hi>Almanack;</hi> and it's ſtrange that all the Doctor
can ſay againſt me is not worth more than <hi>Two pence</hi>
in his own Opinion; but perhaps he hath ſqueezed
more Senſe into his Pieces than uſually ſticks in ſo
ſmall a Compaſs, and therefore I ſhall examin their
Merit.</p>
            <p>In his firſt Piece he hath made Remarks on <hi>Pigs,
Mice, Elephants, Cheeſmongers,</hi> Iriſh-<hi>Men, C—w T—d.
The Pudenda of a Salt Bitch, Duck-Shot,</hi> Roger a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly,
<hi>the Wiſe Men of</hi> Gotham, <hi>the Cuckow and</hi> Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<hi>and his</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Geeſe.</hi> And all theſe wonderful
Phaenomena hath he declaimed on, inſtead of Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me: But truly in his laſt Piece, he hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himſelf. And Page the 12th ſays, <hi>They were writ
in a Stile too light for the Gravity and Sobriety of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi>
ſo that in this, we muſt expect ſomething
like a Philoſopher; truly a happy Change: And I
hope my laſt Preſcription hath taken effect. But let
us ſee what Alterations it hath wrought. <hi>Page</hi> 5th,
he makes his Obſervations on <hi>Sportive Rattles of

unthinking Striplings:</hi> Page 6th, He ſays, <hi>a Snail will

<hi>The Weaſh-man purchaſed the Pompion for the Mare's Egg
and got never a Colt from it,</hi> and theſe are things not

Strange! how the Dr. Philoſophized when he wrote
theſe things of Weight and Sobriety, and how much
they differ from the admirable Contents of his firſt
Peice.</p>
            <p>But if this be the <hi>Dr</hi>'s Philoſophy, unenvied by me
may he phyloſophize, till he hath gathered enough to
compleat his Theory; I for my Part ſhall leave him to
hug and admire his Peices till he is weary; and ſhall
only take notice of what he further dogmatically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in my Book without giving any Reaſon for it, and
what he ſays for himſelf.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, all that ſticks with the Doctor, as to my
Books, is, <hi>That he cannot See or Taſte the Mucilage;</hi>
which I conceive to be Animal Spirits; and that the

of the Veſſels, cannot be diſcerned by <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes:</hi>
This is all that the Doctor alledges againſt my
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102267:12"/>
Books, the remaining part of his Sheet being either
Enlargements upon the wonderful Stock of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
but juſt now mentioned, or a Vindication of his
own Book.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, he tells me, <hi>I no where prove Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits to be an Oyly Mucilage;</hi> and he asks me,
<hi>Whether I ever ſaw it or taſted it?</hi> To this I anſwer,
that I have both ſeen and taſted it; and have already
proved the Animal Spirits to be an Oyly Mucilage,
in my Book of <hi>the Heat of the Blood;</hi> and therefore,
I ſhall refer the Reader thither, it not being requiſite
that I ſhould trouble my ſelf to repeat what is there
ſaid, as often as Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhall ask the Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh.</p>
            <p>And ſince he here ſays, <hi>Their Agility in Voluntary
Motion, demonſtrates that they do not move ſlower than
Blood;</hi> I anſwer, That it is no Demonſtration; for
though the Spirits move ſlowly in the Nerves, yet when
they come to be mixed with the Blood, and meet with
Particles which are of a different Temper and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they may then become Active, and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
more active than before. So the Particles of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
and Acids when kept ſeparate in diſtinct Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
have not half the Agility and Activity in their
Parts, as when mixed together; the Reſult of their
Mixture, if Volatile, being a ſtrong Fermentation,
which was in neither of the ſeparate Liquors, And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
Gun-powder be ſlowly ſqueezed through a long
pipe and out of that falls upon the Fire, yet it's Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
when worked upon by ſo powerful an Agent, is
no argument that the Corpuſcles of the Gun-powder
were in as violent a Motion before the Exploſion;
ſince it's evident that they are not; ſo that the Spirits
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102267:12"/>
may move ſlowly in the Nerves when kept ſeparate
from the Blood, yet be put into a more violent Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
when mixed with it; that Agitation being no
Argument of their equal Agility before, but a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their Mixture.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to his other Objection, <hi>viz. That
the Metapborical Glands cannot be ſeen with a Microſcope;</hi>
To this I anſwer, that by <hi>Metaphorical Glands,</hi> I mean
nothing but a Commixture of the Extremities of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
Metaphorical Glands implying no more; which
appears from what I have ſaid in my Book of Muſcular
Motion, to which I ſhall refer the Reader, it not being
neceſſary to repeat what is there, tho' Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhould
for Information ſake, ask the Queſtion again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
But that what I have ſaid there, is ſufficient to
prove, that there are ſuch <hi>Glands,</hi> I preſume unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
till what I have offered with ſubmiſſion to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
be confuted by it; and then if I cannot maintain
it, let it fall: It is Knowledge and Truth I ſhall ever
value above my own Opinion, if it be not ſo; but
if it be, I ſhall value it as Truth, and only content
my ſelf with the ſatisfaction of contributing my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to the General ſtock of Knowledge. But
to ſatisfy the World, that we are not to diſ-believe,
what I have ſaid of thoſe Glands, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee them, I ſhall add a Quotation from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Eſquire <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Works, which will ſhew him,
that there are ſeveral Truths in Nature, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
becauſe we have Reaſon for it; tho' as to Sight
they are imperceivable; for that moſt ingenious and
experimental Promoter of uſeful Knowledge, who
was a profound, and one of the greateſt of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
in his Hiſtory of <hi>Fludity,</hi> Page 189. Sect.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102267:13"/>
XX. admits of Reaſon to be proof, where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
of Bodies renders them imperceivable: For he
ſays, <hi>If it be objected, that the Various and Inſenſible
Parts of Water, and reſembling Bodies, wherein we make
the Nature of Fluidity chiefly to conſiſt, is but an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
thing, and but precariouſly aſſerted, ſince by our
own Confeſſion they are ſo ſmall, that the Particles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and more, the diverſity of their Motions, are
imperceptable by Senſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We ſhall not deny the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to be plauſible, but muſt not acknowledge it to be
unanſwerable.</hi> And the like may be ſaid for thoſe
Glands; for if we have Reaſon to believe there are
ſuch, we are not to deny what our Reaſon tells us,
becauſe it is not an Object of Sight; and that it is
the Smallneſs of thoſe Glands that makes them to be
imperceiptible by Sight is evident, ſince the beſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes
will not make the Terminations of thoſe
Veſſels viſible which compoſe them: Yet I hope no
Body will ſay, that the Veſſels have no ends, becauſe
they cannot ſee them: If then we allow what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Terminations of
the Veſſels cannot be perceived, we muſt allow that
theſe Glands muſt be Inviſible, becauſe made up of
thoſe Veſſels which are too fine to be perceived; and
that thoſe Veſſels do communicate with one another,
and conſequently make up ſuch Glands I have given
ſuch Reaſons in my Book, and alſo laid down ſuch
Experiments, that I need not to bring any more till
thoſe are deficient.</p>
            <p>Having anſwered all the Doctors Objections againſt
my Book, I ſhall conſider what he ſays for himſelf:
And Firſt, to paſs by all that heap of loud ſounding
Words, which is vulgarly called Bombaſt, or Sound
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102267:13"/>
without Signification, I ſhall briefly take notice, that
tho' I quoted Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> and ſhewed him that his
Notion of Heat was the ſame with it, as alſo that
Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> had the ſame Notion of the Cauſe of
Intermitting Fevers; and tho' I ſhewed him, that in
Dropſies, he miſtakes the Effect for the Cauſe; and
that in his Diſſertation of Mineral Waters, he only
proves what no Body denies; he thinks it an Anſwer
ſufficient to deny what is evidently true, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact: For he ſays, he did not borrow his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> neither do I ſay ſo; but he acted
the <hi>Plagiary</hi> (to uſe his own Words) or <hi>he ſtole them
from him;</hi> for thoſe Words he makes uſe on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>But he ſays Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> aſſigns <hi>Fermentation</hi> to be
the Cauſe of Heat; and that he aſſigns <hi>Colliſion;</hi> but
any Body that knows the leaſt of the <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi>
Philoſophy, would not think to come off with ſuch
mean Evaſion, ſince <hi>Fermentation</hi> implies <hi>Colliſion,</hi> and
<hi>Colliſion,</hi> which is the Effect of Motion, where it is
violent enough, is but calling <hi>Fermentation</hi> by another
Name, ſince <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Colliſion</hi> of the Parts of
hot Bodies, are ſignificatively the ſame, tho' different
Sounds.</p>
            <p>Again, he ſays, <hi>He does not endeavour to prove an
Acid in Vitriolated Waters, but that there is a perfect
concocted Vitriol;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, he
does not argue for an Acid, but for a perfect Acid,
ſince Vitriol is an Acid; ſo that to prove Vitriolate
Waters have Vitriol in them, is to prove Acid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have Acid in them; which I ſuppoſe none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
But let the Doctor diſpute the Caſe, it's a
fine eaſie Subject for him; he may tell his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102267:14"/>
ſuch Amuſing Stories; and that there is Salt in
their Porrage if he will; perhaps he may convince
them, by the ſame Strain, and Vigorous Arguments
uſed at the Well near <hi>Haigh,</hi> and the Well <hi>prope
Boulton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leſt People ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Doctor really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
he ſays very little in vindication of himſelf,
thinking if he ſhould uſe Arguments, it would make
People take Notice of his Faults the more.</p>
            <p>Therefore to divert their Obſervations, he thinks
to make a Noiſe about a <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence, and Three
<hi>Latin</hi> Words; as if convincing me there, would attone
for the whole Notions of Value in his Book, taken
from Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi> but I don't think I need to uſe any
Arguments to perſwade Phyſicians, to believe what
I have ſaid, ſince it is the generally received Opinion
that Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath nothing in his Book of his own
worth owning.</p>
            <p>But to come to his Scholarſhip, he tells me I don't
underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi> and that I muſt go to School again:
Poor good Natur'd Soul! he finds the Good Effects of
my laſt Advice, and by his Quoting of <hi>Horace</hi> and
<hi>Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. I find he hath been at School, and taken
it; and now like a ſweet Tempered Gentleman, he
would needs adviſe me to make uſe of the ſame Means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This had been a Symptom of a good D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſpoſition in
Mind, had I not been mightily prejudiced; for there
is ſcarce any Body that finds Benefit by a Medicine,
but they uſually recommend it to every Body that they
have a Reſpect for, whether they want it or not:
Whether I want it or not, I don't pretend to ſay, but
am ſure that notwithſtanding his Quoting Dr. <hi>Liſter,</hi>
I muſt tell him, <hi>pro me,</hi> is not ſo good <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>Quod
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102267:14"/>
ad me attinet,</hi> or <hi>Quatenus me refert;</hi> but he hath a
mind Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> ſhould be blamed with him, as when
Two Children fall out about their Play, the one thinks
it hard to be whipped, and the other ſaved; ſo he
muſt needs have Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> in for Two Words at leaſt;
with all my Heart, I am not againſt it; if he muſt
be blamed, when the one hath the Ferula, let the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtand by.</p>
            <p>The Doctor is not angry that I find fault with <hi>Sic
Regero:</hi> But let him not be concerned, I only think
it a mean Metaphor, and fitter to be uſed by him in
the Genuine Senſe of the Word, than Metaphorically.
But he cannot let one Sentence paſs; I carp at a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Word <hi>in proclivi,</hi> and ſay it ſhould be <hi>in promptu;</hi>
but that he may be ſatisfied in this particular alſo, I
ſhall tell him I deſigned it, as an Emblem of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity;
for I did not ſay <hi>in Proclivi</hi> was never uſed,
but I meant, that his Thoughts which were in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivi,</hi>
ought to be <hi>in Promptu;</hi> which was as much as
to ſay, they were according to the Aetymology of the
Word; <hi>i. e.</hi> Mean and Weak, inſtead of eaſie and
fluent; and I only expreſſed my ſelf ſo ambiguouſly,
to catch the Doctor; for I knew he'd fall foul upon
any Bait; and truly I had a mind to lay up a Reſerve
to Banter him; for I could not think the Doctor when
rouſed, would have ſaid ſo little in Vindication of
himſelf.</p>
            <p>But again, what ſhall I do now, he ſays I fall hard
upon Caſe; and truly his Caſe is ſuch, that I cannot
avoid it; but he brings <hi>Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Horace</hi>
and <hi>Plautus</hi> againſt me, can I oppoſe them? No, but
I can eaſily ſhew that they'll oppoſe him, for tho' he
be ſo Vigorous, theſe Quotations are againſt him: For
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102267:15"/>
               <hi>Opinioni haud Natura ſe Credidit,</hi> is falſe <hi>Latin;</hi> and
to make it appear, we are to conſider, that <hi>Cicero</hi> in
his Book, <hi>de Oratoriae Partionibus</hi> ſays, <hi>Ut in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus
Verbis, quod non &amp; Latinum; ſic in Conjunctis,
quod non eſt Conſequens V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uperandum eſt.</hi> So that tho'
Doctor <hi>Leigh</hi> hath joined Words, if the Connection
be falſe, the <hi>Latin</hi> hath no Conſequence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is culpable. And where the Senſe of Words
are not connected, the Senſe is broke, and conſequently
to be blamed. I ſhall therefore, becauſe he is ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
upon his Sentence, ſhew him, that the Senſe wants
Connection, and that none of the Quoted Sentences
will help him: For in this Sentence, <hi>Opinioni haud
Natura ſe Credidit,</hi> the Perſon is the <hi>Accuſative</hi>
Caſe, and the Thing in the <hi>Dative,</hi> where if <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
be taken in a Grammatical Signification of that
Word; it muſt ſignifie to <hi>believe,</hi> and then the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
will be, <hi>I believe my ſelf to Opinion not Nature.</hi> But
the Doctor thinks this abſurd himſelf; let us ſee then
what the Authorities avail; The firſt Inſtance in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
which he brings is, <hi>credere ſe Neptuno.</hi> The Second
is, <hi>Credere ſe Coelo praepetibus pennis,</hi> Virgil: The
remaining Inſtances are, <hi>Credere ſuum animum Alicui,</hi>
Terence, <hi>Credere uni omnia,</hi> Cicero. <hi>Libris Arcana Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>
Horace. <hi>Veritus ſe Credere nocti,</hi> Ovid. Now
in all theſe, <hi>Credo</hi> ſignifies to <hi>Commit,</hi> as to commit
ones ſelf to the Waves, to commit ones ſelf to the
Air, to commit Secrets to Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if one
ſhould ſay, <hi>I commit my ſelf to my Opinion, and not to
Nature;</hi> how incoherent would the Senſe be, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
But perhaps the Doctor will ſay, that <hi>Credo</hi>
may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gnify, I give my ſelf up to my Opinion and not
to Nature; if he does, the Senſe is not much better;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102267:15"/>
beſides, the Word <hi>Nature</hi> is uſed ſo ambiguouſly, that
I cannot tell what he gives himſelf up to, till he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
me, what he means by <hi>Nature;</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> is
by ſome Philoſophers, and particularly the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> uſed to ſignifie the Natural State of Bodies,
or their Natural Texture and Modification; but to
ſay a Man gives himſelf up to the Natural State of
Bodies, or their Texture and Modification, muſt be
nothing but Abſurdity; and let the Doctor try, if
<hi>Credo</hi> will bear any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Senſe better than
what I have mentioned, ſtill remembring to keep the
Perſon either in the <hi>Accuſative</hi> or <hi>Dative</hi> Caſe; if he
cannot, as I am ſure he cannot, the Sentence is falſe
<hi>Latin,</hi> according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> becauſe falſe Senſe, and
conſequently <hi>Vituperandum;</hi> and not only ſo, but ſince
<hi>Credo</hi> is uſed by Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> in a different Senſe from
what it is in thoſe Citations, and the Authors Quoted,
it is impoſſible to uſe the Word <hi>Credo</hi> in their Senſe,
ſo as to make Grammatical Senſe of his <hi>Latin</hi> Words;
beſides, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, there muſt be a like Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
or ſimilar Signification, to make the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
good; for it is not placing any <hi>Latin</hi> Words in
the ſame Caſes and Order, that makes them Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable,
except there be a parity of Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>But why do I talk of Reaſon to the Doctor, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more Heterogeneous or diſagreeable to his Head,
than any thing that concerns that Faculty; for my Book
of the <hi>Heat of the Blood</hi> contains nothing, but what I
hope I have given Reaſon for. Upon which Account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Doctor fell out with it, was diſſatisfied, and in ſine was
reſolved to ſhew his Wit; to which I gave an Anſwer,
which I thought moſt agreeable to ſuch a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102267:16"/>
which had ſo good an Effect, as to bring the Doctor
to a very little better Temper. But ſince I ſee he will
be a <hi>Two-penny</hi> Author, I was reſolved now to talk
Reaſon to him, finding it the propereſt Method to be
revenged on him; for if Reaſon before made him ſo
mad with me, it may have a ſtronger Influence, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied
to a weak Head.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall leave the World to judge what's
become of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Reply, and Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi>'s Letter.
As for a Letter of Mine, that he tells me of; he hath
taken a great deal of care to miſ-repreſent it, and to
make it what he would have it: But the Senſe of what
I writ was, that tho' there were a great many Learned
and Ingenious Men in the Univerſity, they were not
all ſuch, which was no Reflection, ſince it is mod cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that thoſe that are come freſh from School, or
of a ſmall ſtanding, cannot reaſonably be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Graduates in the Univerſity. And as for my
Qualifying my ſelf for a Degree in a Month, or to
perform the Exerciſe of a Day in an Hour, I do not
think ſaying ſo, was calling the Exerciſe trifling; for
I having ſtudied Five Years after I left <hi>Cheſter</hi>-School
before I came there, and having ſtudied Philoſophy
before, and read moſt Conttoverſies of Value, I do
not think it much Preſumption in me to ſay, that that
which Five Years hard Study had made eaſy to me,
was difficult to thoſe that came freſh from School:
and I preſume if Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhould be ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
now, which were to be wiſhed, he'd be apt to
ſay, the Exerciſe was eaſie; for when a Thing is
Learnt, any thing is eaſie; and I had learnt moſt of
thoſe things before; ſo that I gave my Friend an
Account how eaſie it was to me then, and how much
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102267:16"/>
my paſt Studies had made thoſe light: So that what
I ſaid, was nothing but what any <hi>Batchelour of Arts</hi> will
ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That at Four Years end they remember ſo
well what they had learnt for the Four Years paſt, that
were they to begin the Exerciſe of the firſt Year again,
they could do in an Hour, what a freſh Scholar could
not do in Twelve: And if a <hi>Batchelour</hi> at Four Years
might without Reflection ſay ſo, I hope in the Sixth
Year of a continued and hard Study, I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to ſay, I could do that in an Hour, which a
School boy could not do in Twelve.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor would needs repreſent me as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the Univerſities, that they might revenge his
Cauſe; but I here declare and ſay, that nothing ſhall
make me an Enemy to them, as long as I have the
Uſe of my Reaſon; and I ſhall ever contribute my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours in Vindication of the Univerſities,
till I have Reaſon to the contrary, which I hope I ſhall
never have; and till then, as I ſhall make it my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to make what Improvements I can in real Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
ſo I ſhall to the utmoſt of my Power vindicate
Learning, and oppoſe the Oppoſers of it.</p>

            <p>SInce the Three former Sheets were Printed, I hear
that Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi> is very angry, that I ſhould offer
to anſwer his Letter in Vindication of my ſelf: And I
am likewiſe told, that a certain Friend of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s
thinks I have uſed him too hardly: But as to the
Firſt, I muſt beg Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi>'s Pardon; for if he's
offended, he may blame himſelf for it; I thought my
ſelf concerned to take off the unjuſt Imputations laid
upon me; and if he can think well of himſelf for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
a Letter ſo inconſiſtent with Truth, I have a
better Apology to make, for laying down Matter of
Fact. As for Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> had he writ againſt me as a
Rational Man ought, I ſhould have anſwered him
with that Deference which is due from me to a
Graduate; but if he thought fit to tranſgreſs the
Bounds of Reaſon, it was but Reaſon to anſwer him in
a way he made choice of himſelf; a Method which I by
no means would have made choice of, had he deſerved
a better Character from me, than he hath amongſt
Learned Men.</p>
