            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From an Old COMMON-COUNCIL-MAN to one of the <hi>New Common-Council</hi> for this preſent Year 1682. for this Honourable City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR First buſineſs (as of all ſuch Courts) is wont and ought to be an Enquiry into the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of the <hi>Elections;</hi> elſe to make <hi>Laws,</hi> before you know whether you are the proper Perſons that are Lawfully Elected to make them, will but <hi>invalidate</hi> all you do, if it ſhall appear that there are any conſiderable Number among you that are not duly <hi>Qualified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Firſt</hi> Enquiry of <hi>Qualifications</hi> in Common-Council uſes to be, Whether there be any that are not <hi>Qualified</hi> as the Law requires, and if they be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> and <hi>named,</hi> they may be queſtioned as far as the Court thinks fit; and if not <hi>Qualified</hi> as by Law they ought, then they are to <hi>withdraw,</hi> as was the caſe of ſome worthy Members in Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Year.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Enquiry of <hi>Qualification</hi> (eſpecially if there be any Objections or Petitions) is to look into all <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndue Elections,</hi> and to appoint a <hi>Committee</hi> to hear the Complaints, and make <hi>Report</hi> to the Court, and then paſs ſuch Judgment upon thoſe Elections, as to that Court ſhall ſeem juſt and right.</p>
            <p>Under this <hi>Head</hi> there may poſſibly ſome Diſputes ariſe touching the <hi>Power</hi> of determining the Right of Election, whether it reſt in the Lord Mayor ſingly, or Mayor and Aldermen jointly; or in each Alderman in his ſeveral Ward, or in the Inqueſts of the ſeveral Wards, or in none of them definitively, or whether the ſole Power be not in this very <hi>Court</hi> it ſelf, jointly made up of Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council men <hi>in Common-Council</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled: Touching which Debates I here offer you my thoughts; thus; When the King Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues out his Writ for Choice of <hi>Parliament-men</hi> once, I never knew any <hi>City, Corporation,</hi> or <hi>County</hi> come to the <hi>King</hi> to complain of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndue Elections,</hi> and pray a <hi>New Writ;</hi> either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Sheriff</hi> hath made his <hi>Return;</hi> but the Cities, Corporations, or Counties that are aggrieved, go to the <hi>Parliament</hi> only, and to no Court or Perſon elſe whatſoever, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief according to the Merits of the Caſe; and there and <hi>no where elſe</hi> Juſtice is done.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould not theſe <hi>Greater Lights</hi> rule the leſſer, and be Precedents for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council of the Great <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Proceedings influence (many times) all the other Parts of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>ſome Affairs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhall any <hi>leſſen</hi> your Right by <hi>Petitioning</hi> or <hi>Receiving Petitions</hi> from any of your <hi>Wards</hi> in matters legally determinable no where but by this Court? I am of Opinion, that when once my Lord Mayor, hath iſſued out his <hi>Precept,</hi> he hath done all that he is to do in the Caſe: And that my Lord Mayor <hi>ſingly,</hi> and my Lord Mayor and Aldermen <hi>jointly,</hi> are bound up by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of every <hi>Inqueſt</hi> of Sworn men, who do make their Returns upon their <hi>Oaths,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient Cuſtom, the <hi>Monday</hi> after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> and not before: And my Lord Mayor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingly or jointly with the Aldermen hath no power to alter the Return of any one <hi>Member</hi> after the Inqueſt have delivered it upon their <hi>Oaths,</hi> under their Hands and Seals <hi>Indented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How unwarrantably have thoſe acted then who have deſired <hi>New Precepts</hi> for New Elections, and determined old Elections before the Inqueſt have made any <hi>Return at all?</hi> For the Return from the Inqueſt of the Names of Common-Council-men duly Choſen in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ward, is as Natural and as Cuſtomary and Legal a way for <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Common-Council-men</hi> to ſerve in Common-Council for this City, as the Return of Members to ſerve in Parliament for <hi>England,</hi> for the ſeveral Counties is legally by the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Return under their <hi>Hands and Seals,</hi> and no otherways whatſoever. For both are done by <hi>Indenture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore you are obliged to maintain the Power of the <hi>Common-Council, to determine</hi> the Right of the Returns of the Elections by your <hi>Inqueſts</hi> as well as the Parliament do maintain this Right of determining Elections tho' choſen by the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> and Returned by the Kings <hi>Sheriff.</hi> Elſe if you yield this Right to a Lord Mayor <hi>ſingly,</hi> or Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen <hi>Jonitly.</hi> Then you give the Lord Mayor and Aldermen a greater Priviledge then his Majeſty claims or exerciſes.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Qualification</hi> that may come in queſtion before you, is whether the Elections in ſome Wards were made by ſuch Electors as have Right of Electing? It is objected, that the Election in <hi>ſome Wards</hi> was over-ruled by the Votes of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men,</hi> and by the Votes of ſuch as pay no Scot, nor bear no Lot; and by the Menaces of Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were over-aw'd, and not left <hi>free</hi> in their Election as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97659:2"/>In ſuch Caſes, there ought to be a new Election in ſuch Wards, or at leaſt <hi>a Remedy</hi> provided againſt it for the future: For theſe Three things are not only contrary to Reaſon, Equity, and the Intereſt of the City, but alſo poſitively againſt an expreſs Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Common-Council</hi> made long ſince, and ſtill <hi>unrepealed</hi> and in full force; (being part of a Report from a Committee appointed to examine ſome <hi>Queſtions</hi> that then aroſe about Elections of Common-Council, and which was <hi>Confirmed</hi> by Common-Council.) Which I here recite <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as far as it relates to this Matter: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Number of Common-Council-men which are or ſhall be appointed for each Ward in this City, ought to be all</hi> FREELY <hi>Choſen every Year in the Wardmote, by ſuch Inhabitants of the ſeveral Wards reſpectively who are</hi> FREE-MEN <hi>of this City, and do pay</hi> SCOTT <hi>and bear</hi> LOTT, <hi>and by the greater Number of them, and</hi> not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Conſider well of this <hi>Ancient Precedent,</hi> and do that which ſhall be found fit for future Regulation.</p>
            <p>For if you admit of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men</hi> to be Electors, the Conſequence may be this; Such Unfree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will undoubtedly incline always to chuſe ſuch as ſhall favour Unfree-men in all the Laws that are made; and ſo in time this may Increaſe their Party to ſo great Number in Common-Council as may <hi>level all your Priviledges,</hi> and render <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men</hi> equal to the <hi>Free-men,</hi> may Perhaps ſet up themſelves, and then <hi>Vote</hi> all Free-men out: As I underſtood was the Caſe of the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. The Government of that City had been in Hands only of ſuch Majeſtrates as were the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> But the Sect of <hi>Lutherans</hi> increaſing and growing <hi>Rich,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Petitioned the Government that there might be <hi>One or Two</hi> of their Opinion admitted into the Council of Majeſtracy, but the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſtrennouſly oppoſed it as <hi>Dangerous</hi> if not <hi>Impious;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were for a long time kept out. Yet as laſt the <hi>brisk Sons</hi> of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> being Inamoured with the <hi>Beautiful</hi> Daughters of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> fell by Legal Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into their Nuptial Beds, and then made Intereſt to get <hi>one Lutheran</hi> into the Government, then <hi>Two,</hi> at laſt the <hi>Majority,</hi> and then they quickly Voted the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſhould no more be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and ſo the Government fell wholly into the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Hands, and hath ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the Excluſion of the <hi>Calvaniſts.</hi> The fatal Conſequence whereof, hath been this, that the <hi>Animoſities</hi> between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> made way for the Papiſts ſo far, that at this day the Papiſts have as many Churches in that Renowned City as the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> Oh ſad fate of Diviſions among Proteſtants! But my Curioſity leading me to inquire into the <hi>true Reaſons</hi> how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> prevail'd and got ground ſo faſt: I was informed that.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> holding a <hi>real Sacramental Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament as we in <hi>England</hi> do came neareſt to the Primitive belief of the Proteſtant Religion, as was uſed in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> holding <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in the Sacrement, which is moſt remote from the true Primitive Opinion of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Lutherans</hi> holding <hi>Conſubſtantiation in</hi> the Sacrament, which came nearer to the Papiſts Tenets then the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Opinion did; and alſo the <hi>Lutherans</hi> abounding in Ceremonies as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have Altars and Candles at their Altars as well as the Papiſts, (only the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Candles are <hi>not lighted,</hi> and the Papiſts Candles <hi>are lighted</hi>) Now the <hi>Lutherans</hi> coming ſo near the Papiſts in Opinion and Ceremonies, and having a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſuch Ceremonies, as the Papiſts have. Theſe things the People of that Citty report were the occaſion of altering the Religious part of their Government: And the Reaſon why the <hi>Lutherans</hi> inclined to the humour of the Papiſts; was partly to get the upper-hand of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and partly becauſe their Ceremonies were ſo near akind to the Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Thus we ſee the ſad Effects and Conſequences, and the imminent Danger that may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſuch whoſe Opinion or Ceremonies in Religion, Border too near upon the Popiſh Tenets, They will rather favour Popery to their own ruine, than tolerate their Proteſtant Brethren that differ from them in their Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>My deſign is not to compare our Religion in <hi>England</hi> with theirs of <hi>Dantzick;</hi> nor to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine with what expence <hi>of Blood</hi> in Flames of <hi>Martrydome,</hi> our Anceſtors in <hi>England</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our Reformation from the Superſtitions (if not <hi>Idolatrous</hi>) <hi>Rites and Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor is it my buſineſs to inquire how far our Ceremonies in <hi>England</hi> do differ from ſome of thoſe that are practic'd by the Whore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> No, no, I leave <hi>Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to <hi>Church-Men,</hi> for I am one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Eſtabliſh'd by Law:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave that matter <hi>till the Law</hi> ſhall think fit to alter it by <hi>King, Lords, and Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I only aim from my Obſervations of the alteration made in the Religious part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that City: To draw ſome advantage to the Civil part of Government of this Renowned City of <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> whereof Sir, <hi>you</hi> are newly choſen a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: And to prevent a loſs of all thoſe great Priviledges and Immunities which this City of <hi>London</hi> for Ages hath flouriſhingly enjoyed, as a lover of this City, whereof I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be a Member, I could not forbear to <hi>Caution</hi> you of the great danger you may be in of looſing all that belongs only to <hi>Free-men,</hi> if you admit <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men</hi> to be Electors of ſuch who are to ſerve in Common-Council: Remember <hi>Dantzick, Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Buſineſs of a <hi>Common-Council</hi> is to make Laws againſt the Intereſt of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men,</hi> and for the benefit of Free-men; and to take care for ſecuring the Orphans Eſtates in the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> where no <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-mens</hi> Childrens Eſtates can be <hi>Depoſited:</hi> And this City Chamber hath for Ages been <hi>the beſt ſecurity</hi> in the World for Orphans Portions, no Hiſtory can tell you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97659:2"/>
of Orphans that loſt their Eſtates in the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> and next to God I attribute it to this, that <hi>Free-men</hi> being <hi>Common-Council-men,</hi> have in all Ages made it their Care to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> and ſecure their own Eſtates to their Orphans and their <hi>Poſterities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all that they have been ſo many Ages a doing, may be <hi>undone</hi> at once; If you let but one <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-man</hi> into the Elections, the preſident of one Unfree Elector, may be a preſident for Two, for Two hundred, and ſo at laſt Vote <hi>all Free-men</hi> out of the Election. Therefore once again I ſay, remember <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be objected, why then are all Inhabitants ſummon'd to the <hi>Ward-Mote.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, it is the duty, of all Inhabitants, <hi>Free,</hi> as well as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree,</hi> (at leaſt once a year, for it is but once a year that they are ſummon'd) to appear before the Alderman, and Common-Council of each Ward, if for no other Reaſon, yet this may be one, that notice may be taken who <hi>is Free,</hi> and who is not.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it be further objected, they are Inhabitants, and have they not Right to chuſe Officers? Yes, all Inhabitants Free and Unfree, have a Right by Law to chooſe <hi>Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Scavingers,</hi> (which latter are but a kind of <hi>Surveyors of the High-Waies.</hi>) The reaſon is this, becauſe every Inhabitant has a Right to the <hi>Peace</hi> that is to be kept by the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And every one has benefit by the Conveniences of the <hi>High-Waies</hi> that are to be kept by the Surveyors; And Conſtables, and Surveyors of the Waies are Officers which the Law all over <hi>England</hi> takes notice of, does appoint and direct, and the Law, the Common and Statute Laws of the Land directs them their Duties; But <hi>Common-Council-men</hi> are not appointed by any <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Common</hi> Law of the Land, but by the ſpecial Cuſtom and Laws of the <hi>City,</hi> Enacted as Laws of the City, made in Common-Council of the City; and what have <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men</hi> to do with chooſing ſuch as are not choſe into Office, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of the Land, but by the particular Law of the City? And if you read the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Common-Council before cited, you ſhall find there, that it does only preſcribe who ſhall be Electors of <hi>Common-Council-men,</hi> it expreſly Limits the Choice only to <hi>Free-men,</hi> and to ſuch Free-men only as pay <hi>Scot,</hi> and bear <hi>Lot,</hi> and that this Choice ſhall <hi>be free</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore keep to your own Laws, <hi>Free-men,</hi> ſuch as pay <hi>Scot and Lot,</hi> muſt be the ſole Electors; and the Elected muſt be freely Choſen; do not let <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfree-men</hi> into the Election as ye tender all your Priviledges. Do not admit ſuch for Electors as only pay Scot, and will not bear Offices, which I take to be the Genuine meaning of bearing of <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have many plead Patents, and will bear no Office, not ſo much as be a <hi>Collector</hi> of a Tax, though for the <hi>King,</hi> from whom they have their Pattent; ſhall theſe chooſe whom they pleaſe to be their <hi>Aſſes</hi> to bear their Burdens?</p>
            <p>And then that the Choice may be <hi>free,</hi> don't let a Captain or any <hi>Officers</hi> ſtand and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe Men, either not to come except they Vote for them or their Aſſociates, or to threaten if they Vote againſt them, then O Sir, you <hi>Come with a Pike, I will make you bring</hi> a Musket, and to another, O <hi>you bear but half an Arms, you ſhall find a whole Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To prevent theſe <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: page creased" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> where it is found, you may order a Balloting Box if demanded, this will prevent <hi>Heats</hi> and preſerve <hi>Love</hi> among Neighbour-hoods, for then it cannot be known who is <hi>for,</hi> or who is <hi>againſt</hi> any Man.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I remember that at the firſt Common-Council that ſhall be holden in in <hi>February</hi> Annually, you are to chuſe a Committe to manage your Rights of <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priviledges at <hi>London-Derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland:</hi> this is to be done, or your Priviledges there are in danger of being loſt, if you do not chuſe ſuch a Committe.</p>
            <p>But I remember in Sir <hi>Robert Viners</hi> time, we hazarded the loſs of all thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs, rather then to loſe our Rights at <hi>London;</hi> and it was upon this occaſion; There was a <hi>Judges</hi> place then vacant in the Sheriffs Court: and the Lord Mayor had put in one <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and great diſputes hapned between the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> whoſe <hi>Right</hi> it was to chuſe: The Lord Mayor would fain have put it off and go to Election of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs in the <hi>firſt</hi> place. but the Court of Common-Council then pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſuſpecting that when that buſineſs was done, the Lord Mayor might take up his <hi>Sword</hi> and be gone, and ſo diſſolve the Court, refus'd it.</p>
            <p>I remember the Lord Mayor to induce them to ſettle the Committee, <hi>firſt,</hi> urged the danger of the loſs of all their Concerns of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> if they did not Chuſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at that time: but a worthy Member wiſely replied, we had <hi>rather loſe our Rights at London-Derry,</hi> then loſe ſo great a Right in <hi>London,</hi> as the Election of a <hi>Judges</hi> place, for the Shreiffs Court, is.</p>
            <p>And the very like caſe may happen to come before you this year, for a Judges place is now alſo void in the Shreiffs Court, by the Death of Mr. <hi>Simpſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore maintain the <hi>Right</hi> of the Common-Council to Elect a Judge to ſit there: For it is undoubtedly your Right to Chuſe one.</p>
            <p>And then be ſure Chuſe a wiſe <hi>ſober man,</hi> and a <hi>good Lawyer;</hi> and one that does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Court:</hi> You are not limitted to any <hi>Booby in a Biggin;</hi> you are <hi>free</hi> to chuſe whom you pleaſe. But have a care of ſuch a Complement from the Chair, as this, <hi>Gentlemen, I allow that your Election is free,</hi> But <hi>I recommend ſuch a one to you, who I think is the fitteſt man;</hi> and then ſome of your own Members, that deſign to <hi>Betray</hi> your Rights, may perhaps ſtand up with the <hi>ſecond Part to the ſame tune,</hi> and wheedle further thus, <hi>Gentlemen, ſeeing the</hi> Chair <hi>does not inſiſt upon it as a Right, as ſome of his Predeceſſors have done, but leaves it to us, pray let us</hi> gratifie the Chair, <hi>being filled with ſo Honourable and Worthy a Perſon, and let us ſhew our Reſpect to the Chair, by chuſing this Man, or one of thoſe Men named by the Chair, and yet our</hi> Right <hi>will be preſerved, becauſe Choſen by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuch I would anſwer, <hi>That for my part I pay as great Honour and Reſpect to the Perſon in this Chair, as ever I did to any of his Predeceſſors: But this talk of</hi> Gratifying the Chair, <hi>may</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97659:3"/>
               <hi>be a new way of</hi> SELLING <hi>the Place to One, Two, or Three, from whom the Chair may have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a</hi> Gratification <hi>(as they call it) for only</hi> Naming <hi>them by the Chair, in hopes you may be wheedled to Chuſe</hi> One <hi>of thoſe that the</hi> Chair <hi>ſeems to recommend to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore beware of theſe men that ſeek to get the place <hi>This Way,</hi> for beſides that it is a direct Violation of a Statute in force, he that will directly or indirectly <hi>Buy</hi> a <hi>Judicial Place</hi> will <hi>Sell</hi> Juſtice, Therefore to prevent thoſe Under-hand Practices (which are too often uſed) and to <hi>daſh</hi> all Recommendation of others by <hi>Letters,</hi> let your Choice be only of ſuch a man as is Nominated by <hi>Your Selves,</hi> and by no body elſe whatſoever; and then your Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Free-Choice will be an Obligation on him, and it will be a Satisfaction to all People that ſhall come to your <hi>Sheriffs Court</hi> for Juſtice, when every body may hear and know that the Judge that ſits there, did not <hi>purchaſe</hi> his Place, nor came to it by the Recommendation of any Great Man, nor by Nomination of the <hi>Chair,</hi> nor by any kind of <hi>Fraud</hi> or indirect Means, but by his own Juſt <hi>Merit</hi> and fitneſs for the Place, and by the Free (<hi>Nomination</hi> as well as) <hi>Election</hi> of Your Selves.</p>
            <p>Then will People be ſatisfied that they ſhall have Juſtice from ſuch a Judge, who obtains his Place by Merit and not by Money; which will bring both Profit and Honour to your <hi>City Courts,</hi> for Men need not deſpair of having Juſtice that have Right on their ſides.</p>
            <p>Suſpect all thoſe Men, that would tempt you to <hi>Gratifie</hi> the <hi>Chair,</hi> leaſt they may have ſome <hi>private end:</hi> For you may hazzard your <hi>future</hi> Right, by ſuch gratifying, or paying ſuch reſpect to the Chair <hi>now.</hi> For if you chuſe any Man now, upon ſuch ſuggeſtions of Reſpect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the <hi>Chair,</hi> then you give ground, for the <hi>future</hi> for the Chair to claim the ſame Reſpect; and it will be a diſ-reſpect to <hi>deny</hi> it to every one in the Chair hereafter; and ſo in time the <hi>Point may be gained</hi> from you, that the Right is in the <hi>Chair</hi> to Elect, as you know of late <hi>one</hi> did pretend, and perhaps he had no better ground, but only becauſe the <hi>Chair</hi> had that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect formerly allowed it.</p>
            <p>In truth, this <hi>Reſpect</hi> (as it is called) may be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> would never have been <hi>expected</hi> from you, but that ſome <hi>Perquiſite</hi> hath uſually attended the <hi>Chair</hi> therewith directly or indirectly before or after, yea ſometimes there have been Benefits (not to ſay <hi>Money</hi>) given for the <hi>Place,</hi> which perhaps the <hi>Chair</hi> hath not directly known of, as when <hi>Wife, Children, Relations</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> have been underhand dealt withall.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the ſureſt way to prevent all Indirect practiſes, is to chuſe one <hi>nominated</hi> by Your Selves, which pray remember as an <hi>eſpecial</hi> Maxim.</p>
            <p>Another thing I would mind you of, is, the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> that is talked of; I cannot tell what the full Intent of that <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> may be; but be ſure to take care of the <hi>Committee,</hi> that ſhall be choſen to mannage your <hi>Defence,</hi> leaſt you chuſe ſuch, who inſtead of <hi>making Legal Defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> may out of pretence of a ſort of <hi>Zeal,</hi> join and <hi>yield up</hi> what they are Commiſſioned by you to <hi>Aſſert</hi> and <hi>Maintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo pray have a care of the <hi>old wheedle,</hi> that may be ſet on foot, as formerly was done by a notable Gentleman, when the Court was (as you may remember) upon Petitioning for Sitting of the <hi>Parliament:</hi> And Arguments were offered for, and againſt it. One Argument that Worthy Perſon then urged, was thus. <hi>Oh! there is a</hi> Quo Warranto <hi>againſt the City already, about the</hi> WEIGHING <hi>and</hi> WATERBAYLIGE. <hi>And there is a Verdict againſt the City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in favour of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfreemen that have got the</hi> QUO WARRANTO <hi>in the Kings Name, and they are juſt ready to enter up</hi> JUDGMENT <hi>againſt the City. And this may be a loſs of a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which the City makes by thoſe Duties.</hi> Therefore, ſaid that Worthy Perſon, <hi>O do not provoke</hi> the Court <hi>at this time by Petitioning, and I hope we may get the King to grant a</hi> Noli Proſequi; <hi>and ſo ſtop Judgment.</hi> And this did work ſo far on you at that time that you did <hi>not Petition,</hi> and it is true there did follow a <hi>Noli Proſequi.</hi> But you will never be without <hi>Quo Warranto's,</hi> if there may be ſuch uſe made of them. But when they ſhall ſee they are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Defended by Law, thoſe Devices will vaniſh. Perhaps you may now again hear of ſuch another buſineſs, to Bug-bear you into ſomething, I know not what: But poſſibly it may be to <hi>ſurrender your Charter,</hi> and you may be told you ſhall have a <hi>better.</hi> But I hope you will have a care, and not part with the <hi>Old</hi> before you are ſure of a (<hi>New</hi> and one that is) <hi>better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I am ſure you cannot have a new one that is better, <hi>before</hi> you have a <hi>Parliament:</hi> For THIS you have already, is confirmed by ſeveral <hi>Acts of Parliament:</hi> Therefore to all ſuch Motions of laying down the <hi>Old</hi> in hopes of a Better, ſay only thus: <hi>Yes, Sir, as ſoon as we ſee a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Sir, that can confirm a better, then it will be time</hi> enough to think of laying down of this, in hopes of a better, but not till then.—No, no, defend this you have by all <hi>Legal ways,</hi> and part with nothing but what the Law forces you unto.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe any one <hi>ſingle Branch</hi> can be taken from you, keep the <hi>Reſt:</hi> If a <hi>forfeiture</hi> of a ſingle Branch or <hi>Two</hi> ſhould be pretended, yet you cannot forfeit the <hi>Whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have Proviſo's in your <hi>Charter,</hi> that a Miſcarriage of a <hi>Mayor</hi> or <hi>Sheriff<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> or <hi>Miſuſer</hi> or <hi>Abuſer</hi> ſhall not forfiet the whole.</p>
            <p>In a word, nothing but your own Act of <hi>Common-Council</hi> can <hi>Cancel</hi> your Charter, and if you do paſs any <hi>ſuch Act,</hi> then your own <hi>Memories</hi> ought for ever to be <hi>Cancelled</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, for every thing, except for <hi>perpetual Diſgrace and Infamy.</hi>
