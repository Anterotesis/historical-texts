            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may remember there was a time when the Paper Delivered
by the famous Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to the Sheriffs at the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
were by a noted Author in thoſe times aſſerted to be none
of his Lordſhips, and Charged upon one who at preſent is none
of the <hi>Least Ornaments</hi> to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But all honeſt men
were ſo well ſatisfied as to the injuſtice of the Reflection, that it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
no Credit.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, It's generally thought that you, or ſome others of your
Fraternity, are not ſo well able to excuſe your ſelves of being the Authors
of this Paper, which Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> has indeed made his own by ſigning,
delivery, and it may be by Tranſcript; not that it was impoſſible for a
Man of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Capacity to write as good or a better Paper, but the
Publick make bold to ſay that it ſavours nothing of hiſ Temper nor
Education, and really, Gentlemen, except you pretend to a Power of
working Miracles <hi>as well as of Abſolution</hi> by the laying on of your Hands,
you will hardly be able to convince the World that Sir <hi>John,</hi> who cou'd
not ſpeak good common <hi>Engliſh</hi> at his Tryal, but ſaid <hi>I Kallenge</hi> inſtead
of <hi>I Challenge:</hi> and that the Popiſh Prieſts could <hi>Diſſolve,</hi> inſtead of
<hi>Abſolve</hi> Catholicks from their Oaths, of which I and ſome hundreds
more were Ear Witneſſes, ſhould without ſomething of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> be
able all of a ſudden to oblige the Publick with ſuch a Lecture of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Obedience Politicks and Non-reſiſtance Divinity,</hi> as is to be found in
this Paper, tho really, but weak and ſilly in it ſelf; and therefore, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
theſe following Reflections are addreſſed to you, as the Real Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or at leaſt the Godfathers of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s pretended Orphan, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks
our attendance thus.</p>

               <p>Knowing that I muſt immediately give an Account to God of all my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that I ought to be eſpecially careful of what I ſay in theſe laſt hours,
I do ſolemnly profeſs, that what I here deliver is from my very Soul, with all
the heartineſs and ſincerity of a dying Christian.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, it is not doubted but Sir <hi>John</hi> might believe this to
be a very good thing, and ſo recommend it to the World, from his very
Soul, but there's not one word that he delivers it as his own compoſure,
nor does he publiſh it any otherwiſe than as men commonly do their <hi>Laſt
Will, tho drawn up by a Scrivener,</hi> yet perhaps it might be his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as far as he was capable of underſtanding it, and for the reſt, he
would truſt you who were his <hi>Spiritual Guides;</hi> but, Gentlemen, if you
will take a little pains to compare what Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Witneſſes ſaid at
his Tryal, and what he own'd himſelf to the Committee of Parliament,
with what you make him ſay in this Paper; you will find that there's but
little reaſon to boaſt of his Sincerity either as a living or a <hi>dying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> at his Tryal, when certainly he could not but have Death
in View, did ſolemnly declare in the face of the Court, that he was as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
of the things Charg'd upon him, as the <hi>Child unborn,</hi> and ſome
of them he diſown'd, as in the preſence of God, particularly his giving
Money to Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> on any other Account but Charity, or that he
ſhow'd the Captain any Letter, which he ſaid he had Writ to King <hi>James,</hi>
and yet the Captain faſtened both thoſe Particulars upon him by ſuch
undeniable Circumſtances as ſatisfied the Court, and confounded Sir <hi>John.</hi>
In the next place, Sir <hi>John</hi> own'd to the <hi>Committee of Parliament,</hi> that he
was at thoſe Meetings, where it was agreed to ſend <hi>Charnock</hi> over to
<hi>France</hi> to invite King <hi>James,</hi> to make a Deſcent with Ten Thouſand
Men, and that he engaged to raiſe 200 of the 4000 Horſe, which were
to Joyn King <hi>James</hi> at his Landing, tho at his Tryal he ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
that there was no ſuch thing diſcours'd at any of thoſe Meetings,
and that Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> invited him only to take part of a Diſh of Meat
with him—Sir <hi>John</hi> at his Tryal brought a long train of Witneſſes to
prove his having ſaid frequently, that he would live peaceably under
the preſent Government, and never be concern'd in any Plot againſt it,
and that if they catch't him in the Corn, they ſhould put him in the Pound,
and in the mean time when he made theſe frequent Proteſtations, that
he would live Peaceably under the Government, he accepted of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from King <hi>James</hi> to be Colonel of Horſe, choſe his Inferiour
Officers, and paid Mony to encourage men to Liſt themſelves under him;
and in this Paper you make him ſay, that <hi>to aſſiſt King</hi> James <hi>in the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Right, is Juſtifiable and our Duty:</hi> So that it is plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the whole Tenour of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Converſation ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
hath been far from ſincerity, ſeeing he talk't and proteſted ſo
ſolemnly againſt what he owns now to have been both his Principle and
his Practice. Then as to his ſincerity when a dying, it appears every
whit in as bad Colours. You cannot but perceive, Gentlemen, that Sir
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96163:3"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> was Guilty of Horrid Diſſimulation, in his Repeated and ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials
of his being concerned in that, which you and he do both
look upon as <hi>the Cauſe of God and Religion,</hi> yet there's not one Syllable of
his Repentance for ſuch a ſhameful denying of that Cauſe, nor does he
make the leaſt Apology for it; I need not tell you, Gentlemen, how
unlike this is to the Practiſe of the Antient Martyrs, who would own
their Religion in the face of their Perſecutors, and ſay, <hi>Ego etiam ſum
Chriſtianus,</hi> and if any of them had through weakneſs made a ſlip,
what hard terms they were forced to ſubmit to, before they could be
re-admitted into the Boſom of the Church, and if afterwards they were
honoured to Die for the Truth, they would be ſure to bewail their
having formerly diſown'd it; then pray, Gentlemen, <hi>How could you ſuffer
this poor man to Die with ſuch Proteſtations of his Sincerity,</hi> without obliging
him to leave a Teſtimony againſt his having ſo ſhamefully denied that,
which he now calls the Cauſe of God, when 'tis Notorious that he did
deny it, by appealing to God himſelf in the Face of the Court, ſaying,
<hi>God knows my Heart I am as Innocent as the Child unborn;</hi> and producing
Witneſſes to prove, that he had always proteſted he would never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in that which now you make him own to be his Duty—Certainly
you have forgot that threatning of our Saviour, that <hi>he will deny them before
his Father and his Angels, who deny him before Men,</hi> otherwiſe you durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have offered to Abſolve Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> all his Sins, without a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Repentance, for his Publick Denial of that which to you and him is
the <hi>Cauſe of God and Religion.</hi> You make Sir <hi>John</hi> to ſay in the next
place.</p>

               <p>The cauſe I am brought hither to ſuffer for, I do firmly believe to be the Cauſe
of God, and true Religion, and to the beſt and utmoſt of my Knowledg and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which I have evermore heard, do
require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Soveraign, and that as no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
ſo neither any Domeſtick Power can alienate our Allegiance.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, It is manifeſt that the Cauſe for which Sir <hi>John</hi>
ſuffered, was his accepting of a Collonels Commiſſion from the late King;
his agreeing to invite him over with a <hi>French</hi> Popiſh Army, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to Joyn him with two Hundred Horſe for his own Part, chuſing
inferiour Officers for his own Regiment, and paying out Mony for their
ſubſiſtance, and therefore if Sir <hi>John</hi> did firmly believe; that this Cauſe,
and the Cauſe of God and Religion, were one and the ſame; it was
plainly that which Divines call, <hi>Caſus Confeſſionis,</hi> wherein all good
Chriſtians cannot, without Horrour, do any otherwiſe than Anſwer in
the Affirmative, ſo that inſtead of his ſhameful denial of the thing, and
ſolemn Proteſtations of his Innocence, as to the matters charg'd upon
him; he ought to have own'd it in the Face of the Court, and to have
told them boldly, with the Heroick Courage of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that he did firmly believe it to be the Cauſe of God, and Religion,
whereof he ſtood Indicted, and that he rejoyced to be counted worthy
to ſuffer for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96163:4"/>
But, Gentlemen, we ſhall come yet cloſer to the Point, and make
it Evident, that both you, and your pretended Martyr have baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
that which you call the Cauſe of God and Religion. Sir <hi>John</hi> at
his Tryal did prove it by many Witneſſes, that he frequented the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip, and attended the Prayers in his own Family, where King
<hi>William</hi> was pray'd for, which was certainly a piece of the greateſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy
that any Man could be guilty of, for if Sir <hi>John</hi> did firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that King <hi>James</hi>'s Cauſe, was the cauſe of God, as his paper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
he did, it was certainly a mocking of the Almighty to his very
face, to Countenance Prayers himſelf, for that which was againſt his own
Cauſe. And your pretending to abſolve that wretched Criminal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a publick Repentance, for having ſo publickly diſown'd, and ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pray'd againſt that which you and he did firmly believe to be the cauſe
of God, proclaims you Traytors to Heav'n as well as to our Country;
but Gentlemen, to make it as eaſy for you as the caſe will beat, King
<hi>William</hi> has no reaſon to be angry with you, for not obliging Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Perkins</hi> to expreſs his ſorrow for being concerned in the horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Aſſaſſinating his Royal perſon, before you pronounc'd your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
over him, ſeeing you did alſo abſolve Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> without
any profeſſion of Publick Repentance for having Renounced the cauſe of
God.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall only add on this head, that you, and the reſt of
the abſolving fraternity, ſeem really to have acquir'd as much Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the Conſciences of your Diſciples, as is falſely aſcribed to
the Pope by thoſe who worſhip the Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That he can make Vice
Vertue, and Vertue Vice, otherwiſe thoſe poor deluded Creatures could
never be ſo ſtupid, as to think they ſuffered for the cauſe of God, when
they are actually puniſh'd for endeavouring to bring in a <hi>French</hi> Power,
to eſtabliſh a Prince on the Thone; who during the whole Tenor of his
Life, hath ſhown himſelf an Irreconcileable Enemy to the Proteſtant
Religion, appear'd at the head of an horrid Plot againſt it, when a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and endeavouring its ſubverſion when a Soveraign, contrary to
his Coronation Oath.</p>
               <p>As to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Knowledge and Information of the Laws of the
Land; It was very well known, and appear'd at his Trial to be ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little, that if his Father Confeſſors had conſulted either his Credit, or
their own, they would certainly have ſtruck out this part of his Paper,
but that our Laws require a firm Allegiance to our Soveraign, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
that no Forreign or Domeſtick power can alienate our Allegiance: I
believe Sir <hi>John</hi> might have ventured to ſwear it, tho he had never ſeen
a Statute-Book. For the Queſtion is not, whether we own unalienable
Allegiance to our Soveraign, but whether or not, one who has been
our Soveraign can forfeit his Title to our Allegiance? which I am
ſure, conſidering Sir <hi>John's</hi> Education and Qualification, was a queſtion
too knotty for him to reſolve.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Gentlemen Abſolvers,</hi> the following propoſitions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to your Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Lawful Soveraigns,
have either their Commiſſion from God or the People, or to ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſenſe, God and the Peoples Commiſſion to their Soveraign, is, or
ought to be one and the ſame, Gods Commiſſion to the Soveraign; both
in the Old and New Teſtament, is to encourage the Good, and to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and be a Terror to the Evil doers, as appears from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96163:4"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Rom. 13. 1. &amp;c.</hi> And certainly the Commiſſion of all people,
who are not fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> and <hi>Bridewell,</hi> than humane Society, is,
that the King ſhould make uſe of his Authority, for the benefit and
preſervation of the Community, over whom he is conſtituted Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
ſo that if he either invert his Commiſſion, or Act contrary
thereunto, by encouraging the Bad, and afflicting the Good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that he will continue to do ſo, it's plain, that in ſo doing he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acts by the Authority of God, nor the Authority of the People,
and that when they reſiſt him as Acting thus, they do not reſiſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but only the Extravagancies of an Uſurper; and that if God
ſhall think fit to Claim the forfeiture of his Commiſſion, either by his
own immediate hand, as by Frenzy, or any other Moral incapacity, or
m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diately by the Repreſentatives of the joyned people, he becomes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> diveſted of all Right to our Allegiance. Which I think is
plain from this familiar inſtance: If an Husband violate the Marriage-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and upon his Reſolution of continuing to do ſo, his Wife ſue out a
Divorce, let him pretend what he will, he has no further Right to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Wife, from the injured Matron, nor can ſhe be ſaid to be guilty of
Diſobedience to her Husband in refuſing it, but doth juſtly forſake him as a
Divorc'd Adulterer.</p>
               <p>Or to be yet more plain, you may take it thus, That whatever Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
to Govern according to God's Commiſſion, has no poſitive Divine
Right to Govern at all; and by Conſequence, the people are under no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Command to obey him; And that whatever Prince refuſes to Govern
according to the Conſtitutions of the Government which he enters upon,
and ſuch as are then agreed on, or generally ſubmitted unto by the People
over whom he is to Rule, hath no Civil or Humane Right to Govern the
People at all.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſing, That on his coming to the Throne, he obliges himſelf by
his Coronation-Oath to Govern <hi>according to the Laws of God and the Land;</hi>
and afterwards breaks his Promiſe to God and the People, and will Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them Arbitrarily, according to his own Humour, the people can be
under no Obligation to obey him, but if they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>But leſt this ſhould be miſ-underſtood, to open a Door to Tumults and
Inſurrections againſt all Governments, ſeeing it is impoſſible for any to be
ſo equally Adminiſtred, but that ſome will be diſſatisfied. It's replied,
That as every froward Humour, Fits of Paſſion, or Groſs Irregularity in
either of the Parties, is not ſufficient to diſſolve the Marriage-Contract, ſo
neither is every Male-adminiſtration, nor groſs Miſtake, or Abuſe in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſufficient to diſſolve the Original Contract betwixt King and
People; but as in the one Caſe there muſt be evident and full proof, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Alienation of Affections, and a Legal Divorce, before the Relation
can be lawfully diſſolved; ſo in the other, the breach muſt be upon the
Fundamental Conſtitution, which is like the defiling of the Marriage-bed;
the Proof uncontroverted, and the Forfeiture openly claim'd and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſc'd
by the Generality of the People, or their Repreſentatives, before the
Relation betwixt them and their Soveraign can be warrantably diſſolv'd—
And if this was not the Caſe betwixt the Late King <hi>James</hi> and his People,
when he took upon him to diſpence with the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and to caſſe
and annul thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> let the World bear Witneſs.</p>
               <p>So that in ſhort, the Power which he aſſum'd, was none of the Power
in being, and by conſequence none of the Powers ordain'd by God; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96163:5"/>
moſt Commentators agree, that by the Powers that be, to which we are

            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>In truth Gentlemen, you ſeem to have impos'd as much upon your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
in his Politicks, as you have done in his Divinity; and I do not at
all wonder, that this matter was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible</hi> to the Schollar, when his
Maſters ſeem not ſo much as to underſtand the State of the Queſtion
themſelves, but firſt Beg the Queſtion, and then take it for Granted.
For the Queſtion is not, Whether the Kings <hi>Subjects,</hi> but whether the
<hi>Kings Equals,</hi> or if you will not be angry Gentlemen, his <hi>Superiours,</hi> can
do it?</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, I ſuppoſe you will Grant, That according to our
Conſtitution, the Parliament muſt firſt draw up, and then give their
Conſent to a Law before the King can make it One; and if the Original
of this Power of the Kings be duly enquired into, it will be found to
be likewiſe the People's Creature, and ſettled upon him by their Conſent;
but however that is, this is certain, That the Parliament are the Kings
<hi>Equals</hi> as to the Legiſlative Part; And this, Gentlemen, muſt not ſound
harſh in your Ears, when the Lords, who are but one of the Conſtituent
Parts of the Parliament, are in our common Dialect, called <hi>The Peers of
the Kingdom,</hi> which is as much as to ſay in plain Engliſh, <hi>The Kings
Fellows,</hi> and in the Style of the Scriptures, and the Original Charter of
Kings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. they are plainly ſaid to be <hi>Brethren</hi> to their Subjects,
and <hi>forbid to have their Hearts lifted up above that of their Brethren,</hi> tho'
at the ſame time we ſhall not Grudge them the Title and Priviledges of
<hi>Elder Brethren.</hi> Then, Gentlemen, as to the Executive part, wherein
their Superiority over their People doth more appear, it's evident, that
herein they are alſo regulated by the Laws of their People, which is no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96163:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more then a Truſt to put the Commands of the Body in Execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the particular Members; and certainly he by whoſe Commands and
Directions I am to Govern all my Actions is my Superiour; ſo that this
Maxim will remain Uncontrovertibly True to the end of the World, <hi>That
the King is Superiour to any of his particular Subjects, but Inferiour to the
whole;</hi> For common Senſe will inſtruct you, that if the whole Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to Obey, there's no Man whoever that can Govern them, nor is there
any particular Subject who is not in a poſſibility of withdrawing himſelf
from under the Dominion of any Prince, by going into another Country;
But no Prince can ſet himſelf over a People againſt their Wills; for even
in Caſes of Conqueſt, Submiſſion is taken for an Aſſent, otherwiſe the
People would reſiſt, either till they were utterly deſtroyed, or till they
had expell'd the Conqueror; And therefore when the Alternative is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or Deſtruction, its allowed, that <hi>Salus Populi &amp; Suprema Lex,</hi>
they ſubmit not for the good of the Conqueror, but for their own good;
and thoſe very Men who aſſiſt the Conqueror, or their Offspring at leaſt,
when once they come to be Imbodied with the Conquered People, do
always join with them for Aſſerting their Antient Liberties at one time
or other, as is plain from the practice of this very Nation; which being
ſubjected to the <hi>Norman</hi> Yoak, and moſt of the Eſtates divided amongſt
the Conquerors Followers, yet the <hi>Norman</hi> Offspring join'd with the
Nation afterwards in Aſſerting their Liberties againſt the Tyranny of
the Conqueror's Succeſſors. For Liberty is ſo much the inſtinct of pure
Nature, that they are juſtly to be accounted Creatures of a Courſer than
Human Alloy, who are fond of their Chains, or do unconcernedly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them. Nay, if thoſe very Perſons who are the Advocates and
Tools of an Arbitrary Government, will but look within themſelves, they
will find that the cauſe of their being ſo, is the proſpect of their own
enjoyment of a greater Liberty ſome one way or other than they think
they can enjoy without it. I ſhall finiſh this Point with one Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more; which is, That all Civiliz'd Nations allow the Subjects a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Defending their Titles to their Eſtates by Law, againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of the Prince and his Miniſters, which is Examplified every day in
our Courts, and ſcrupled at by none of the Diſciples of Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Then, Gentlemen, let me ask you this Queſtion, Whether you
think it reaſonable that every particular Man ſhall have the priviledge of
defending his Eſtate againſt the Pretenſions of his Prince, and yet that the
whole Nation ſhall not have the priviledge of defending their Poſſeſſion
of all that is near and dear to them as Men and Chriſtians, againſt the
Prince's Uſurpation? If you object, that they may defend them by Law,
but not by Arms; It ſhall be granted, that War is the <hi>

                     </gap>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium;</hi>
but the ſame Argument which warrants one Prince to make War
upon another for Injuries Received, and not Redreſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the
Criminal Prince cannot be otherwiſe called to an account, will Warrant
the Parliament, or the Body of the People, making War againſt their
Kings, when they cannot otherwiſe have their Liberties and Properties
ſecur'd. I have inſiſted longer upon this ſubject than perhaps is ſuitable
for my preſent deſign, but I was willing to make it appear, that thoſe
who are of a contrary Opinion to your Party in this Point, are not acted
by a blind Impulſe or Brutiſh Fury, but by reaſonable Principles: And
if my Arguments be Weak, pray excuſe my Zeal to Obviate your Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Principles, which have brought thoſe Two poor Gentlemen, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96163:6"/>
many more, to their Unhappy <hi>Exit;</hi> and have oftner than once endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
the Civil and Religious Liberties of theſe Nations.</p>
               <p>As for your Diſciples ſaying, That <hi>he thinks we ought not to Depoſe our
Prince, and that when it is done, ſurely it is our Duty to aſſiſt him in the
Recovery of his Right.</hi> I ſhall only obſerve, That his Premiſes will not
bear his Concluſion; for he ought to have been as ſure, that the People
could in no caſe Depoſe their Prince, as he pretends to have been, That
it was his Duty to aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Throne when De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
but according to you, he only <hi>thought</hi> the one, but he <hi>was ſure</hi>
of the other. As for his hopes of the late King's Reſtoration, we are told
by the Divine Oracles, <hi>That the hopes of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh;</hi> and
that Sir <hi>John</hi> did both Live and Die one, his own Trial, and his Father-Confeſſors
Forged Paper make it but too too preſumable. As to his
Prayers, we have little reaſon to dread their Succeſs; He Regarded Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in his Heart, as you and he have made it plainly appear, by his
going off the World without Repentance for the horrid Crime of Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Cauſe of God and Religion;</hi> and the Almighty hath told us, That
<hi>if we regard Iniquity in our Hearts, God will not hear our Prayers.</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi>

to influence the Jury againſt Sir <hi>John,</hi> but if you had either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted

with that horrid deſign, but on the other hand it was own'd
by the Evidence, that he did not approve of it; but ſaid, that it would
ruine King <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt. So that it ſeems Sir <hi>John</hi> had not the
Conſcience to diſcover it, tho he was ambitious even at the paſſing of
the ſentence upon him; of having the Honour of being thought to
decline it. But, in ſhort, Gentlemen, Your Martyrs Reputation, as to
this point, is not ſo fair as you would have the World to believe,
for tho he refus'd to be concerned in the thing himſelf, yet its plain
that he did not abhor it in others; ſeeing he did both conceal the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

all true Proteſtants muſt look upon you, as a Synagogue of Satan,

Loyalty, Laws, and Chriſtian Principles, contrary to the ſenſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative

if their practiſe be compair'd with the practiſe of your ſelves, and

who are the very worſt of Papiſts, and that their deſign is the
ſubverſion of our Laws and Religion. And ſeeing you pretend to be Men
of Conſcience, examine the matter ſeriouſly betwixt God and your own

on you to <hi>come out of Babylon;</hi> and not to joyn Iſſue and Intereſt with

               <p>Charity is better manifeſted by Actions than Words, and truly, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
you will have much ado to perſwade the World that there can be
any thing of Charity in your Deſign, and Sir <hi>John</hi>'s, to involve your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Brethren in Three Nations in Blood and Ruine, and to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the Proteſtant Intereſt all over <hi>Europe,</hi> by countenancing a <hi>French</hi>
Invaſion; And if it were not Ignoble to rake into the Actions of the Dead,
there are many of your Martyr's Actions which might be inſtanced that
favoured nothing of perfect Charity.</p>
               <p>But the deſign of this part of the Paper is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> That you and your
Martyr may do all that you can to conciliate the good opinion of the Papiſts,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96163:8"/>
whom you and he are ſo very careful not to offend, that he muſt die with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
to them in his Mouth; but it ſeems it was not worth either of your whiles
to make the leaſt Apology for the offence which he had given to God, and the
Profeſſors of the ſame Religion with himſelf, by concealing the deſign of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Aſſaſſination, which his own Conſcience told him was ſo great a Crime, that he
was very careful of having himſelf not ſo much as thought to be concerned in it:
but this I ſuppoſe he thought could be waſht off by your Cheating Abſolution;
and truely it had been more for the credit of your Cauſe, to let this Apology a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
too, and put it upon the ſame ſcore, for it only aggravates his own Guilt,
and that of your party; for, if he had been a Man of any manner of Conſcience,
he could not have reflected ſo in open Court upon the Religion of a Prince, whoſe
Reſtitution he eſteem'd the Cauſe of God and Religion: and if he did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what he ſaid in his Defence, <hi>That Papiſts think they Merit Heaven by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proteſtants;</hi> his Conſcience muſt needs have told him, if he was really a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
that it could not then be his duty to endeavour the Reſtitution of ſuch a
Prince, who thought ſuch a Work Meritorious, and had indeed acted as if he did
firmly believe ſo, both before and after his Coming to the Throne, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
inconſiſtent with the very end of Government, as well as with the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath,
by which he was Sworn to Govern us. But notwithſtanding all the
precaution you have taken, to have it thought, that thoſe Principles are only an
Uncharitable Imputation upon the Papiſts, that Character will cleave to them, as
being founded upon better ground than your Martyrs Aſſertion, which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

are for Kingly Government as well as your Party. But this is not the only
thing wherein his partiality appears; for, as he will allow none but <hi>Jacobites</hi> the

no great Argument of his Perfect Charity; but the Matter I ſuppoſe would not
bear it, for we muſt underſtand this Exhortation to be a Perſwaſive to <hi>Jacobite</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96163:8"/>
Reflections. Don't you know that your Martyr did not only diſown, but in a manner For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear
the Cauſe of his Sufferings before the Court, at his Trial? How is it poſſible then that he ſhould
have ſo ſhamefully denied it for fear of Suffering, if he had really found ſo much Satisfaction in his
Sufferings as here you make him expreſs? Or is it ſuppoſable, if it had been ſo, that the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his having ſo unworthily Diſown'd the Cauſe of his Sufferings, wherein he had found
ſo much Satisfaction, ſhould not have melted him into Tears and Contrition, and made him Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God, and Redeem the Honour of the Cauſe, by teſtifying a Publick Sorrow for his Weakneſs in
Denying it? Sure I am, Gentlemen, this was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Practice, who made his Repentance as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
as his Denial of his Maſter; and ſeeing St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, That his <hi>Cauſe was that of God and Religion,</hi>
his denial of it was as groſs as that of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; but you don't make it appear that Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
was any thing like that Bleſſed Apoſtles. God knows whether theſe be the Words of your
Martyr or not, but ſuppoſing they are, we can look upon them as no other than the effect of thoſe
Deluſions with which you had poſſeſt his Soul, and that they were put into his Mouth on purpoſe to
ſtrengthen your declining Cauſe: In the belief of which I am the more confirm'd, by the aſſurance I
have that one of your number told him with an unwarrantable Confidence, when he mounted from

               <p>Gentlemen, We have heard of thoſe who Faſt for Strife and Debate, and I think it may be ſaid
without breath of Charity, that this Paper was Penn'd and put into the Hands of the poor Criminal
for no other end. You had taught him Lies in the Name of God, and now you put Lies in his Mouth
for a Prayer to the Almighty. Is it poſſible that you can hold up your Faces to God and call that a
Rebellion which all the Proteſtants of <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides your own inconſiderable Crew, do look upon as
a Lawful War, pour out their Prayers daily to the God of Heaven for its Succeſs, and Bleſſed be his
Name not without gracious Returns? Have you ſo little obſerved the Courſe of Providence, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
that Prince as an Uſurper, on whoſe Family Heaven ſeems to have Entail'd it, to be the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of <hi>Europe?</hi> Do you think your ſelves better Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts
then all other Reform'd Divines, who do univerſally approve his procedure, as agreeable to the
Laws of God; And is your Judgment in State Matters ſo great, that you will venture to tell Heaven
that this is a Rebellion, which moſt of the Soveraigns in <hi>Europe,</hi> and their Counſels, do approve, as
agreeable to the Laws of Nations? In ſhort, Gentlemen, your peeviſh Eccleſiaſticks have aſſumed a
Power to themſelves as great as ever was claim'd by the Pope and his Conclave; For you can Abſolve
Men from their Sins without Repentance, and Bind that upon the Conſciences of your Diſciples as
Law and Goſpel, which is directly contrary to the Tenor of both. But to return to your Prayer; Is
it not enough that you Arraign your Country as Rebels at the Bar of Heav'n, but you muſt alſo pray
for the Eſtabliſhment of a Succeſſion of Popiſh Princes, which muſt needs be attended with the Ruine
of our Religion? And will no other terms ſerve you, to pray for our Counterfeit Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Profaning what was ſaid of the Bleſſed Child Jeſus? Is that the Reverence which you pay to his
Name? But its true, Gentlemen, you make your Criminal act like himſelf: He own'd at his Trial
that he us'd to mock Heaven in his life time by praying for K. <hi>William,</hi> when he thought K. <hi>James</hi>'s
Cauſe to be the Cauſe of God; and now you make him alſo to mock Heaven at his Death, by praying
that God would Eſtabliſh a Race of Prince's amongſt us, whom the Poor Man confeſs'd, muſt by
their Principles think they merit Heaven by deſtroying Proteſtants, God preſerve theſe Nations from
ſuch a Generation of Scribes, Phariſees, and Hypocrites, as are the Tribe of Abſolvers. One thing I
had almoſt forgotten to obſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sir <hi>John,</hi> by his own Confeſſion to the Committee of both
Houſes of Parliament, made void his Exception as to the Truth of the Evidence given in againſt him
by the Roman Catholick Witneſſes, and hath made it appear, that whatever Latitude they may allow
themſelves in their Evidence againſt Proteſtants as ſuch, that yet they may be very good Witneſſes
againſt thoſe who take Indirect Methods to ſupport a Popiſh Cauſe, whether they be Papiſts or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;
and as it was well replied by the Kings Council to Sir <hi>John,</hi> their being Evidence in ſuch a

               <p>IT hath not been my custom to uſe many words, and I ſhall not be long upon this Occaſion, having Buſineſs of much greater
Conſequence to employ my thoughts upon. I thank God I am now in a full diſpoſition to Charity, and therefore ſhall make
no Complaints, either of the Hardſhips of my Trial, or any other Rigours put upon me. However one circumſtance I think my
ſelf obliged to mention; it was Sworn againſt me by Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> That I had own'd to him, that I had Seen and Read a
Commiſſion from the King, to Levy War upon the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Now I must declare, That the Tenour
of the King's Commiſſion, which I ſaw, was general, and directed to all his Loving Subjects, to Raiſe and Levy War againſt
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Adherents, and to Seize all Forts, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, may be a customary Form of
giving Authority to make War; but I must confeſs, I am not much acquainted with Matters of that nature: But as for
any Commiſſion particularly levelled againſt the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I neither ſaw nor heard of any ſuch.</p>

               <p>There's no Reaſon to doubt that this Paper was Sir <hi>Williams</hi> own Compoſure, his Education, and
the defence he made at his Trial, do neither of them give it the lie, nor is there any thing in it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96163:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which Savours of the Canting Bigotry of the other; So that I ſhall only conſider what's material
for our purpoſe in it. He pretends to a full diſpoſition to Charity, and yet complains of Hardſhips and
Rigours, put upon him at his Trial, which is not very conſiſtent with Charity; I was preſent at his
Trial, and cannot imagine what ground he had for this Complaint, if it was not that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to put off the Trial any Longer, and that he was not allowed the benefit of the New Act
for Regulating Trials in caſes of high Treaſon. As to the former, if the Government did not
think fit to allow it, Sir <hi>William</hi> had no juſt Reaſon of Complaint, he had ſufficient time allowed
him to prepare himſelf, and was treated with that Moderation and Calmneſs, which former Reigns
were ſtrangers to. The Crime he was indicted for, was one of the blackeſt that is to be met with in
any Record, and God knows that he and the reſt of the <hi>Aſſaſſins,</hi> did not intend to allow our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign any time to prepare for Death. I Remember, indeed, that Sir <hi>William</hi> alledged he
wanted ſome Material Witneſſes, but his Confeſſion of the Crimes with which he was charged, make
it evident that his deſign in that was to elude Juſtice. And as to his being denied the benefit of the
New Act, the Bench gave him a very good Reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it had not then taken place, and
that they were to govern themſelves by Law, and not to make Law, and if the equity of the thing
be conſidered, there ſeems no great Reaſon that they who are guilty of this horrid deſign, before
the making of the ſaid Act, ſhould have the benefit of it, tho the mildneſs of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath ordered it otherwiſe; and therefore Sir <hi>Williams</hi> Complaint of Rigour and Hardſhip,
was but ill founded, and may juſtly be imputed to ſome bitterneſs of Spirit.</p>
               <p>As to his declaring, that the Tenour of the Kings Commiſſion, which he ſaw, was General, and
directed to all his loving Subjects, to levy War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Adherents,
and that he neither <hi>Saw nor heard of any Commiſſion, particularly Levell'd againſt the perſon of the
Prince of</hi> Orange. It does not at all affect Capt. <hi>Porters</hi> Evidence, nor deny that he inform'd the
Captain ſo, which proves that Sir <hi>William</hi> was a very ill Man, to have put ſuch a Gloſs on the late
Kings Commiſſion, both to the Capt. and <hi>Charnock,</hi> in order to perſwade them to the Aſſaſſination,
if he did not believe that to be the Real meaning of it, however it may have been worded; And it
argues the Abſolvers to be Traitors both to God and their King, pronouncing the abſolution over Sir
<hi>William,</hi> before he had publickly begg'd pardon of that Prince whom he had injur'd, and teſtify'd his
Repentance for drawing <hi>Charnock,</hi> and others to the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> by that falſe Interpretation; It hath
been obſerved by another hand, that this Commiſſion which Sir <hi>William</hi> gives an account of, <hi>Looks</hi>
liker a Proclamation than a Commiſſion, but if it was only ſuch a General Commiſſion as he talks
of, what need was there of ſo much Secrecy, why was it not ſeen by Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and others, who
deſired to ſee it, and why was it all writ with King <hi>James</hi>'s own hand?</p>
               <p>It is plain from the depoſitions of the Witneſſes, at the Trial of <hi>Charnock, &amp;c.</hi> that a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to attack the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in perſon, and to carry him over to <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt was ſent for,
which to all Men of Common ſenſe muſt appear to be impracticable, to have been done with ſuch a
ſmall Number of Men. Beſides, when the Commiſſion, whatever it was, arrived, we find that all of
them prepar'd to Aſſaſſinate the King, and the deſign was chiefly managed by Sir <hi>Geo. Barclay,</hi> who
brought over the Commiſſion, and muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to have underſtood the meaning of
it beſt. We find likewiſe, that he brought over a <hi>Sub-brigadeer,</hi> and 16 of King <hi>James</hi>'s Guards with
him, and that they were ſubſiſted privately in Town, and ordered to be in a readineſs for the horrid
deſign, ſo that let the Commiſſion be couch'd in what Terms they pleaſe, the meaning of it is plain
enough, and all their Art cannot vindicate the late King from being the unhappy Tool, to promote
that execrable Murder: We all know what bloody deſigns againſt Proteſtants in General, and ſome
of his own neareſt Relations in particular, he has been formerly accus'd of. Nor are we to ſuppoſe
that one who makes his way to the Throne, by the Death of a Brother, would have any more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
for a <hi>Nephew,</hi> or that he who gives way to the impoſing of a Suppoſititious Son, to exclude his
own Daughters from their Right to the Crown, will entertain any Scruple at the Murder of a Son-in-Law,
whom God and the Nation have ſet up in his ſtead; and if I ſhould venture to ſay, that
Sir <hi>William</hi> hath not been Ingenuous in his Confeſſion, there's no reaſon to call it a breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
conſidering that he hath not left the leaſt Evidence of his Repentance, for the Aſſaſſination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, tho he own'd to the Committee of Parliament, that it was a Crime.</p>

himſelf, as to prompt others to do it, and to furniſh Men, Horſes, and Arms, for the Execution,
which was fully prov'd againſt him at his Trial, tho he takes no notice of it here, and does not at
all deny it. And we have very great reaſon to think, that the Late King was one of the few that
knew it, beſides theſe that undertook it, and do verily believe that they deſign'd to let as few more
know of it before-hand as poſſible, and that in all probability, was the reaſon why the Commiſſion was
