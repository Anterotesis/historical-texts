            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any be as yet otherwise minded, and have not given up themselves to God, and to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; by instructing them still with <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and <hi>waiting when God will give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.25.</note> wee will not distrust that grace of God, by which the worst one day may be wonne to consider; 1. That it is a most dangerous thing long to enjoy the good meanes of grace, and not to get grace by them. 2. That the more powerfull and profitable the Ministery is which an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man liveth under, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and damnable his estate his. 3. That the long and often refusall of Gods call, giveth the Lord just occasion to call no more. 4. That it is not the having or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Teacher that will availe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man, but a discerning of the

For as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, under God, my time, my strength, my labours in publlke and private are most due, so herein I render to you but your own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that perhaps not uncalled for by you· These lines will call upon you for 3 duties especially. <hi>First,</hi> every day to strive in subduing in your selves your personall corruptions, till you have brought downe every high thing, and thought into <hi>holy subiection. Secondly,</hi> most inwardly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>holinesse</hi> in your selves, and most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to love such as walke most <hi>holily,</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:26365:4"/>
being the likest, nearest, and dearest unto God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to see that every part of your lives aime at <hi>progresse to full holinesse.</hi> My desire of the Lord is that there may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to your perusall, a second addition of blessing and successe. My request to you all is, kinde acceptance of this my labour, as a pledge of my care over you, and of my heartie desire every way to helpe you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards your desired end. My en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and recompence shall bee your profiting and progresse in an holie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of heart and life. This is the right praise of a Preacher. And though I can promise, or presume nothing of my owne strength, which is well nigh drawne out by the painfull labours of my Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie above thirtie yeares; yet (the Lord as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting mee) my purpose and endeavour shall be to frame this latter age, and act of my life, sutable in paines to the former; so as it may be most fruitfull unto you, and usefull unto the Church, into whose trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie I have cast another mite.

               </note> that <hi>One thing is necessary.</hi> And the reason is, because it neither discerneth what this <hi>one thing is;</hi> nor what is <hi>the necessitie</hi> of it. <hi>This one thing</hi> is not one dish as <hi>Theophilact:</hi> Nor Vnity as <hi>Augustine:</hi> Nor one grace, whether faith, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hope, or charitie, as some others. But this one thing is that <hi>Christian care which every one ought to have of his owne salvation.</hi> For <hi>1. Mary</hi> and <hi>Marthaes</hi> care are here opposed. <hi>2.</hi> Our Saviour calleth it the <hi>good part</hi> chosen by <hi>Mary,</hi> whilest shee carefully used the meanes of her owne salvation. <hi>3</hi> To this is promised the grace of perseverance, that it shall never be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For as salvation is the happy part of the elect, which shall never be taken away; so neither shall this care to atteine that end in the meanes, whereby the Lord preserveth it. And it is said to be the one thing necessary; not because many other things are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: But <hi>1.</hi> It is <hi>in order</hi> before, and aboue all things necessary. Math. <hi>6.33. First seeke the kingdome of God,</hi> that is, to get into the state of grace. First in time, and in the first place: as Israel must goe forth to gather <hi>Mannah</hi> the first thing they doe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb facs="tcp:26365:6"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> This one thing is simply necessary for it selfe: and all other things only so farre as they conduce unto it. <hi>3.</hi> It is most transcendently necessary, farre beyond all other things in the world, for this alone is sufficient to make a man truely happy, and to state him in salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all they are insufficient. <hi>4.</hi> It is constantly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and perpetually while wee live; lest begining in the spirit we end in the flesh: and so loose the crowne which is set on the head of perseverance. But is it not necessary to follow our callings, to provide for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and intend our civill businesse and occasions? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes. And <hi>every one must abide in the calling in which he is called.</hi> Yea Religion binds a man to be a good husband, and to guide his affaires with diligence and discretion, that he may both main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine his owne, and be helpfull to others. But he must know, that he must first be a good husband for his soule. <hi>2</hi> That in thy most earnest, and vrgent affaires of this life, he must never forget that there is one thing more necessary than they all. <hi>3</hi> That Christ commandeth the care of salvation in the meanes to take place of the care of enterteining his owne person; and commendeth it in <hi>Mary. 4.</hi> That these two callings are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but subordinate, for a man may have great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world, and not remitt his service to the Lord Christ; neither hath any man any allowance in any earthly businesse to be earthly minded. <hi>5.</hi> That this <hi>one thing</hi> being neglected, all other things are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For what would the gaine of the whole world profite him that hath lost his owne soule? Yea, they be <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>lossefull.</hi> How doth the holy Apostle esteeme of all things <hi>losse</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> in comparison of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:26365:6"/>
in the meanes? All without a mans selfe, authoritie, wealth, favour, honor: all within himselfe, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wisedome, memory, discourse, profession, revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the most excellent gifts which the Apostle had had in abundance: all is lossfull that helpeth vs not towards heaven. And indeed the glorious excellency of Christ in the Gospell is such, as should draw all eyes from off these shadowes and vanishing contentments, to the surpassing brightnes of it selfe. The greater will prove their sinne and shame, that shall set the Moone aboue the Sunne of grace; or preferre pottage before the blessing; the Swine before Christ, and very husks before the bread in our Fathers house.</p>
            <p>Now whereas many are convinced more easily, that this care of this one thing is necessary on the Sabboth day; but there be not a few that put it off with their holy-day clothes, and are so farre from the vse of any publicke meanes in the weeke day, as that they are ready to say of such as preach or heare a weekes Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Isralites,</hi> desiring to goe into the wildernesse to worship.<note place="margin">

               </note> Moses <hi>and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, why cause ye the people to cease from their worke: get you to your worke,</hi> to your callings: <hi>much people are in the land, and ye make them idle.</hi> Therefore partly to stoppe such prophane mouthes, and partly to satisfie the inquisition of others, I shall not thinke much to give a word of direction in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; onely ayming to advance this holy care which ought never to be laid aside, but must runne through and quicken all the actions of our lives, one day as well as another; as the blood runnes in all the veines of the body to mainteine the life and vitall spirits in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

member. And first, that we may make no more sins then God hath made; nor by men, where God hath left them free: wee make it not a case of necessity, either for a Minister to preach, or for a people to heare a weekes Lecture: for which we have no such expresse commandement, as for frequenting the publicke exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises on the Sabboth day. Yea we affirme that all men must ordinarily abide, in their ordinary callings in the six dayes: according to that commandement, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour:</hi> and that some men are more straitly tyed to sticke close to their callings, as who can very hardly afford the time for a publicke exercise, without disabling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves &amp; wronging their families. But yet as the commandement on one side, doth not so enjoine rest on the Sabboth, as that on no occasion we may labour: So on the other, doth it not straitely enioyne labour on the six dayes, as that on no occasion we may rest and refresh our selves. Nay it was never the Lords intention, to allow us the six dayes for our owne worke; so as in any of them his owne worship (at least private) should be neglected. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we freed from the service of God on any of the sixe dayes, no more than on the Sabboth; because we must serve him on the Sabboth in duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mercy onely. So as when God is pleased to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the opportunitie; as where a willing Pastor calleth his people, or a willing people (ready to redeeme some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time in the weeke day) calleth their Pastour to bestowe his paines for an houre or two in the weeke, to so good a purpose as to heare Gods word, and invocate his name in prayer and prayses.

               <hi>2.</hi> That it is lawfull for a people to heare on the weeke day is manifest, in that all the people <hi>hanged on Christ daily teaching in the Temple,</hi>

For here is not only a vaine &amp; sinfull expence of precious time; but a prophane despising of the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ordinance of God, which is now as a <hi>prize in the hand of a fool,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> wanteth heart.

through these grates: but he loves him not on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, that hates him on the weeke-day. Were there any <hi>hunger</hi> after Christ, it would find the need of this bread of life on the week-day, as hunger findeth need of foode for the body on the Saboth day: hunger after Christ wold force him out of his tent to gather this Mannah in the due season of gathering, if it were every day to be had.

Were there true <hi>sence</hi> of a mans selfe, it would not suffer him to bee lesse holy any day than the Sabboth; onely it must be more publikely expressed: it would not suffer him at any time, in the middest of his earthly businesse to be earthly-minded; and much lesse to bee so wedged, and rivited into earthly distractions, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow an houre in a weeke, when God offers a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like helpe to the winding up of his heart towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

            <p>Secondly, distinguish of <hi>graces</hi>; both for their kindes and for their degrees.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the kindes of graces, wee are to know, first, that some graces are of absolute necessitie, and serve to the being of a Christian, without which salvation cannot be, as faith, hope, and love: these maine graces are like the fire of the Sanctuary, which never went out; these can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be lost quite, they may be lessened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, but can neither wholly nor finally be lost: Secondly, other graces serve to the well-being or comfort of a Christian, as sense of Gods favour, peace of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in good duties, sense and feeling of comfort in that estate: these and the like may be quite lost, <hi>David</hi> himselfe may pray, <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, Psal.</hi> 51.12.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the kindes of graces, wee are to know that some are true saving graces, as faith, love, zeale, &amp;c. which are given to such as are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, fruites of the Spirit proper to the elect, springing only in their gardens; these cannot be wholly quenched, although where these be, the Spirit may be sore grieved, as by <hi>Sampson, David, Peter</hi>: Other graces are excellent, but common, not saving, not sanctifying, tending more to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good than their salvation that have them; such as are historicall faith, justice, chastity, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: these and many the like may be quite quenched, and never remembred. As wee see in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26365:13"/>
               <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Saul,</hi> namely which had beene present with him in many common graces, <hi>and the evill spirit came upon him:</hi> and in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who had many excellent gifts, yet it is said of him,<note place="margin">Luke 22.3.</note> that <hi>the Divell entred into him,</hi> who never comes but hee makes waste of all grace.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the degrees of grace, they are foure:<note place="margin">Grace quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> 1. <hi>Election,</hi> 2. <hi>Iustification,</hi> 3. <hi>Sanctification,</hi> 4. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Of these, two are wholly laid out of our selves, two are within our selves. In the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Iustification,</hi> a man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, nor yet decay: being two simple acts of God, once wrought in him by himselfe <hi>immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; and rooted in Christ, who being the roote dies not; and no more can the living branches in him. The two latter, because they are wrought <hi>mediatly,</hi> by such outward meanes as are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike, may receive both increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: A man may fall wholly from his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, <hi>Many are called, but few chosen, Matth.</hi> 22.14. and from a great measure of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from the whole comfort of true sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, seeing nothing in his soule but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of corruption: yea from many degrees of the soundest graces, attending justification, and eternall life. Yet here some care is preserved in the heart of the elect, by the Lord, so as all sound grace is not quenched. Here the case is as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Romans</hi> warre, if onely the top of the standart were stricken off, the standart-bearer holding still the trunchion in his hand, lost nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26365:14"/>
office nor honour; but if hee lost the trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion, and suffered that to be beaten out of his hand, he lost both: So in our Christian warre, if all care in the heart be expelled, the honour and place of Christianity is lost; and then, men fall not away from their election, but they that were never elected fall away.</p>
            <p>Thus we see the meaning of this precept dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to beleevers, who have received the Spirit, (for fire cannot be quenched but where it is) that they should <hi>not quench the Spirit:</hi> that it is not to be meant of an utter extinguishing of saving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which cannot be, but not to suffer any grace to be quenched, in the brightnesse, measure, or degree of it: this fire must be so farre from being quite put out, that it must not be slackened or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened; it must be so farre from totall quenching, as they must not let it decay in part, or in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it.</p>
            <p>We come now to the points of instruction that this exposition affoords us. The first is this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Saints have all the same Spirit.</note>
               <hi>All the godly have the Spirit of God:</hi> else could he not be quenched, this fire cannot be quenched but where it is: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Ye are in the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:</hi> and, <hi>If a man have not the Spirit of God, the same is not his.</hi> Hence the godly are called <hi>the temples of the holy Ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19.</note> in whom he dwelleth as in his temples. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Prove your selves, know yee not that the Spirit of God is in you, unlesse you be reprobates.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Yee have the anoynting which abideth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Spirit being infinite, he is also in the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:26365:14"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He is one way in the wicked,<note place="margin">The Spirit in the godly and wicked, but differently.</note> as in all other things, by the infinitenesse of his essence; another way in the godly, by the presence of his grace and blessed effects. 2. Hee is graciously present both with the wicked and godly, but the former in common and generall graces, the latter in speciall and saving graces. In the former hee dwells as in the world for the good of the world, and societies of men. In the latter hee dwells as in his temples, for the perfecting of the blessed communion of Saints, both in grace and glory. In the one by grace restraining, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by renewing grace.</p>
            <p>Reasons of the point are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Members must needes have the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the head;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1</note> as a branch hath the same sappe with the roote, and as every member liveth by the same soule that the head doth. This is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles reason, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>The same Spirit that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up Iesus from the dead, shall also quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, because his Spirit dwelleth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Christs promise is, that his Spirit should supply his bodily absence. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7.<note place="margin">2</note> 
               <hi>It is meete I goe away, else the Comforter shall not come, but if I depart I will send him unto you:</hi> for greater is our comfort in <hi>Christs bodily absence,</hi> then wee could have in his bodily presence, wee must not now gaze upon his holy flesh, but the blessed merit of it. <hi>If wee should alwayes corporally see, wee could not spiritually beleeve,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> Now Christ hath carried our flesh to heaven, and opened the way by his flesh to our flesh; in our flesh makes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26365:15"/>
requests and prepareth places for us, and supplies that comfort in the meane while by sending out his Spirit to glad our hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3</note>3. This commeth to passe by Christs effectuall and powerfull prayer: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall send you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> Now he was heard in all things, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.42. But for whom prayeth he? <hi>Answ.</hi> First, for the Apostles, and then for those that keepe the word, and beleeve, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.20. <hi>He prayeth not for the world,</hi> verse 9. And for what prayeth he? <hi>Answ.</hi> For a Spirit whom the world knoweth not, neither can receive, but the elect know him: <hi>For ye know him, for he dwelleth in you, and shall be with you all, Ioh.</hi> 14.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The manifest accomplishment both of the promise and prayer,<note place="margin">4</note> proveth, that the regenerate have the spirit of Christ in them: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>And because ye are sonnes, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, which cryeth Abba, Father.</hi> Christs intercession is not a forcelesse prayer; but according to his promise he sends out the Spirit: which sending forth is not by change of place, but by manifesting his operation, in the gifts of illumination, faith, regeneration, heavenly life, sense and motion: and for the most part they are never more comforted, than when they are most afflicted, which argueth a spirituall and inward Comforter, whose joy the world cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>This puts beleevers in minde of their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and happy estate, who are become temples
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26365:15"/>
of the holy Ghost, who never comes but with a full horne and hand of blessing. The Centurion thought himselfe unworthy, that Christ in his base estate should come in his house: How much more unworthy are wee,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note> that this <hi>spirit of glory</hi> should come into our hearts? See hereby what account is to be made of a poore Christian: let his outside be never so base, yet he is so glorious within as God himselfe delights to dwell in him: As we make much even of a wooden coffer that is filled with golde, and pearles, and precious things. And if wee make so much of a man that beares about him a reasonable soule, and because hee hath Gods image on him; how much more should we make of a Christian, because of Gods Spirit? What a shame is it to thinke highly of a man for land in the field, for oxen in his stall, for money in his chest, and not for graces, yea the spirit of God in his heart? what a heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hangs over them, who account these the very offscouring of the world? against whom the very Pagans and Heathens shall rise up in judgement, who whensoever they spoyled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, yet spared their Temples, because of the honour of God: but these destroy the temples of the holy Ghost, and God will destroy them: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>Againe, this serves for the comfort of poore Christians. Art thou contemned?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> God hath more honoured thee than the world can disgrace thee. Art thou in prison? Behold thou hast the God of liberty with thee, yea in thee. Art thou
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26365:16"/>
in banishment? What care where thou dwellest, while God dwells in thee? What comfort canst thou want while the Comforter dwells in thy heart? Doest thou feare falling away? Be not dismayed, the spirit of God in thy heart will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shift his dwelling; <hi>He shall dwell with you for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.16.</note> Christ commands his Disciples, where they finde intertainment, not to shift their host: much lesse will hee ever shift himselfe where once hee enters, but thy heart shall be as the <hi>Temple</hi> was called <hi>Beth-gnolam, an house of eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, let this teach Christians to looke to their hearts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> that they may be pure and cleane for so pure a Spirit. The uncleane spirit delights in spirituall sluttishnesse; and many with the harlot provide their bed, and all things deckt for sinne and Satan: In one end he findes a gorge of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, in another a wardrobe of pride, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a stewes of uncleannesse; and there he inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth and solaceth himselfe. But Gods spirit is most pure; and although he will dwell in a poore and homely house, yet it must be pure and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Let us therefore honour this guest with the best roome, and fit our hearts for him; let us wash this roome with teares, sweepe it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, beautifie it with holinesse, perfume it with prayers, decke it with vertues, and hang it with sincerity: feare not to make it too pure, or holy, care not for the scoffes of precisenesse. When a great Embassadour is sent from a strange Country, what care is taken to provide him a fit house, and to decke it with fit stuffe beseeming
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26365:16"/>
so great a personage? Now the holy Spirit is sent as an Embassadour from the great God to thee: then prepare thy heart for him, sweepe out carnall desires and lusts, fill it with good cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it may yeeld him fit entertainment and contentment.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this teacheth men to examine their sonneshippe by the presence of the Spirit with them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> For as the presence of the soule discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it selfe by the life, so by the life of God and Christ is the presence of the Spirit discovered. Many men, while they trade in sinne, wallow in lusts, and become voluntaries to lusts, of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, railing, drinking, or any foule sinne, (under the reigne of which they are bondslaves) will yet stoutly pleade for themselves, Alas, we are flesh and blood, and what can we doe? But know (silly man) know, that <hi>flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdome of God:</hi> thou must be more than flesh and blood, or thou art none of Gods: For, <hi>If any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his.</hi> Thou maist as well say, thou art no childe of God; <hi>For, if yee be sonnes, hee sends his Spirit into your hearts, Gal.</hi> 4.6. If of Christs body, you have Christs spirit: deny thy selfe a Christian, if sinne must reigne.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the chiefe intent of this use, none we see can be assured he is the child of God, but by the presence of the Spirit. <hi>Quest.</hi> How shal I know that God hath given mee the spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption? <hi>Answ.</hi> This question is very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though some thinke they cannot know their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26365:17"/>
sonneship, others that they neede not, and so neglect it. For the possibility hereof: As hee that hath life in him, knoweth hee hath life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can stirre, feele, move, walke and goe, so here also. And as for the necessity of it, marke what the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know yee not that Christ is in you,</hi> (namely by his Spirit) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ye be reprobates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Signes of the Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</note>Now the markes of the Spirits dwelling with us are most of them inward, not discerned by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sence, as the soule in the body is not seene, or felt, but discovered by the effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Conviction.</note>The first is <hi>Conviction: Ioh.</hi> 16.8. <hi>When the Spirit shall come, hee will reproove the world of sinne.</hi> And the Spirit of God rebukes sinne in us, by working in us, 1. sence, 2. sorrow for sinne, 3. an earnest desire of mercy, 4. a loathing and leaving of sinne: All which we may see in those converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. when once the Spirit came, <hi>They were pricked in their hearts, and said, Oh what shall we doe to be saved?</hi>

               <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31. the spirit of God <hi>writes the law in the hearts</hi> of beleevers, and so brings in a new light, and yet more, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. <hi>Hee shall leade you into all truth:</hi> hee saith not onely, <hi>This is the way,</hi> but <hi>walke in it, Isa.</hi> 30.21.

            <p>By these notes examine thy selfe.</p>
            <p>So much for the first Doctrine: we come now to the second, which is, that,</p>
            <p>Those that have the spirit of God, must be carefull not to quench it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The godly must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to quench the Spirit.</note> The Text implies, that in the best the Spirit is subject to be quenched, where it shines brightest; and in the meanest and poorest Christian of the weakest grace much more: a small sparke of fire is easily quenched, and will decay, if it be not blowne up and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And the Apostle exhorteth all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Let no man fall from the grace of God:</hi> no man, rich nor poore in grace, high or low; no man, not the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> who shall fall from all grace, nor the <hi>sound Christian,</hi> who may fall from many degrees, and much comfort, but is preserved from falling by the feare of falling, and a care not to fall: for God susteines him inwardly by his preserving grace, and outwardly by the word preventing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Therefore <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.25. <hi>That thou hast
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26365:18"/>
already, holde fast till I come.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinketh hee standeth take heede lest hee fall.</hi> All which sheweth that the state of grace is <hi>lubricus ad lapsum,</hi> that is, slippery, and in danger of falling.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1</note> The Spirit comes not (wee say) with a wet finger, nor without labour and desire; he is not powred but upon thirsty grounds, nor obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without much sorrow, mortification, and cleansing of the heart; he will not dwell in a sty, nor set up his Temple in the denne of a darke and deceitfull heart. Now when a man hath with such difficulty got the Spirit into his soule, shall he by quenching him lose his labour? suffer so many things in vaine? and suddenly cast downe, what hee hath beene so long a setting up? Shall he be so foolish as <hi>to begin in the spirit, and end in the flesh, Gal.</hi> 3.3?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The spirit of God with his graces,<note place="margin">2</note> are the <hi>earnest of our salvation.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The pledge of our inheritance: Ephes.</hi> 1.14. The chiefe <hi>witnesse with our spirits that wee are the children of God, Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>By which we call God Abba, Father.</hi> Yea he is that <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> both in his <hi>nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The spirit of God is holy both in his nature and operation.</note> being the fountaine of holinesse, and in his <hi>effect,</hi> making us holy, <hi>By whom wee are sealed to the day of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> This is a Metaphor taken from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who having bought some choyce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, doe seale them for their owne, to know them againe: So the Lord by his spirit sealeth his owne, both to distinguish them from others, and to set them apart as his owne; and also to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26365:19"/>
make their election firme and sure, by setting his owne seale and Image upon them. Shall we then quench this spirit, who alone preserveth our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, peace, comfort, boldnesse with God, and assurance of our owne salvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To quench the spirit is farre more damnable than to want him altogether:<note place="margin">3 To quench the Spirit more damnable than to want him.</note> for this is Apostasie, than which nothing doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the vengeance of God against men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>If we sinne willingly after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaines no more sacrifice for sinne, but a fearefull expectation of judgement, &amp;c.</hi> And this the godly themselves can justifie, what torture they have in their soules, when they have in part quenched the spirit: As <hi>David roared day and night, and his bones consumed, Psal.</hi> 32.3, 4. And <hi>Peter went out and wept bitterly, Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> And such as now let no sorrow come neere them for their relapses, shall finde the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
            <p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Change.</hi> Whereas the spirit of God was the soule, and life, and joy of the soule; now being quenched but in part, he withdrawes himselfe and his presence, yea the joy and comfort of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that a man shall thinke him quite gone: and the joy which upheld the heart in all estates, shall now be so cleare gone as if it had never bin there. <hi>David</hi> found this change after his sinne: <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within mee:</hi> therefore in this sence the spirit was gone: Againe, <hi>Restore mee to the joy of thy salvation</hi>; therefore that also was gone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Change.</hi> Insteed of the power and efficacy of grace, all is in a wane, and goeth backward; the spirit of prayer ceaseth, the first love is fallen from; zeale decayes; watchfulnesse is remitted; conscience is cast asleepe; the ayde of the spirit greatly lost: which when <hi>David</hi> discerned, hee prayed thus: <hi>Oh stablish mee with thy free Spirit:</hi> verse 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Change.</hi> Gods children shall finde, that the spirit once quenched, in stead of the lively pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of piety formerly upheld, they are given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to their owne corruptions, to commit grosse sinnes, which even many civill men would not commit. What fearefull sinnes did <hi>David</hi> moyle himselfe in, when the spirit withdrew himselfe? the sinnes of adultery, carnall pollicy, and shifting out of one sinne into another, and falling from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

to worse? How was <hi>Peter</hi> given up to lying, swearing, and forswearing for the time, that a Iew might have beene ashamed on him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his former holinesse and gracious confession?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Change.</hi> Whereas the spirit being cherished, there was a continuall feast in the soule, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable glorious joy, now being in part quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, hee brings a racke into the conscience of Gods childe, and that conscience which before excused and justified, now accuseth and terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: the burden of which is so heavie, as all the mountaines of the world are light in comparison. These terrours of conscience were <hi>the deepes, out of which David</hi> (even hopelesse, and almost swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the pit of despaire) <hi>cryed to the Lord, Psal.</hi> 130.1.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, Most men have the spirit of God, and some motions;<note place="margin">5 Motions of the Spirit much different in the godly and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</note> but great is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a godly man and an hypocrite: in the one they are quenched quite, in the other for the most part they are cherished, and at last perfected. As for example:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:26365:20"/>First, hypocrites have knowledge as well as the godly, but they quench it, and fight against it, therefore all good knowledge quite leaves them in the end: but the godly carry their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to heaven with them: therefore the one is compared to the light of the Sunne, which last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all day, the other is like a flash of lightning, suddenly appearing, and suddenly vanishing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hypocrites may be grieved for sin, but it is onely and chiefly because of punishment, not because of offence; and they quench this griefe, not willing to torment themselves before the time: they runne into merry company and turne off sorrow, lest they should disquiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too much with such melancholy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the godly nourish godly sorrow, and never cease <hi>sowing in teares,</hi> till they <hi>reape in joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, hypocrites pretend great love to God, but it is for his goodnesse to them, not his goodnesse in himselfe; for wages, not for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but they utterly quench this love by the love of the world, or pleasure, or sinne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded on earthly things, when they faile it failes. If <hi>Saul</hi> love God for his Kingdome, when his kingdome failes, his love quaileth too: If <hi>Iudas</hi> love Christ for an Apostles place, when that place will not holde him with further cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, hee will for gaine betray his Master. But the godly love him when he crosseth them, and if he kill them they will trust in him: much water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench their love.<note place="margin">Cant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, an hypocrite hath many good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26365:21"/>
the worst man living is not without some: <hi>Balaam</hi> hath good desires, but covetousnesse quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them: <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledgeth his sinne, and his sonne <hi>David</hi> to be better than himselfe, but it was a blaze in straw, suddenly quenched. But the godly, for the most part, goe from motions to resolutions, and so to practise, many practises grow to habits, and so to perseverance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>Well, is it so? such as have any assurance that the spirit is in them, must have a speciall watch that they quench him not: Then let Christians carefully avoid the meanes of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Quest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Meanes of quenching the Spirit.</note> Which be they? <hi>Answ.</hi> Three es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. When we let grace die of it selfe: As 1.</note>I. Fire is quenched, when it is suffered to die of it selfe: so is the fire of grace quenched, 1. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we use not our graces, but let them be idle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by them procuring glory to God, nor good to men: As iron, let it be as bright as christall, cast it by in a corner, and not use it, it will grow rusty, and unprofitable; even so will grace. And the drowsie Christian, though indued with good graces, if he waxe idle, his heart shall be like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> field of the sluggard, all <hi>overgrowne with mosse and weedes,</hi> which choake the good seede. The health of the body is preserved by exercise, so is the health of the soule by the exercise of grace; the moth frets the finest garment, when it is not worne, standing water is sooner frozen than the running streame.<note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, as fire dieth of it selfe, when wee prepare not or adde not fit matter for the fewell and feede of it: so suffer
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26365:21"/>
wee our graces to decay, when wee neglect such meanes as God hath set apart for the strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and confirming of grace: the case being with the soule as with the body, which is in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all decay, and needes daily repast, or else it dies. If a man forbeare his ordinary meales, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate will decay, and vigour, and health, and life, and all: so will the Christian, if hee neglect the word, the Sacraments, meditation, prayer, watchfulnesse, and the like. Thirdly, as fire must needes die of it selfe,<note place="margin">3</note> when we take away the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell by which it should be nourished, so is it in the matter of grace: looke into the places where the word hath beene powerfully preached, but is now removed, and see if good things begun be not quite overthrowne, and if ordinarily, and for the general such people be not more profane than any other. Many thinke they can walke many dayes without the strength of a Sermon: But it was a miracle, that <hi>Moses</hi> fasted forty dayes and forty nights; and let <hi>Moses</hi> be away but a few dayes, he shall surely finde a Calfe made. Marke them that absent themselves from the assemblies of Gods people, whether they doe not wither or no, and fall by little and little into flat Atheisme. If thou keepe not thy watch in the Temple, if thou look not to the holy lights and fire, morning and evening, how will the Spirit be kept? will thy graces in so great security be still lively? While <hi>Thomas</hi> was absent from the company of the Apostles, did hee not lose that manifestation of Christ, which might have strengthened his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26365:22"/>
weake and tottering faith? and not so onely, but grew hee not into a peevish infidelity, that hee would not beleeve but upon his owne carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. When grace is violently smothered.</note>II. Another meanes of quenching the Spirit, that is to be avoided, is, when the fire of grace is violently smothered by the contrary. Sinne is as water to quench the grace of God, both our owne,<note place="margin">1. By our owne sinnes.</note> and those of others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For our owne sinnes. First, our sinnes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe choake grace; for our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which the Apostle calls <hi>flesh) doth ever lust against the Spirit:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> and by reason of this there is never a grace of God in us, but it conflicteth, and is conflicted by the contrary extreames, the feare of God,<note place="margin">A burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish heate eates out na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</note> with distrust and presumption; faith with naturall infidelity, and so the rest. Now therefore our naturall corruption must be daily wasted, and mastered, else will it be with us, as a man that rowes against the streame, if hee leave never so little, he is driven twice as farre backe as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ever he was. Secondly, sinnes in our affections doe marvelously quench the Spirit, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, that <hi>Anger gives advantage to the Divell, Eph.</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>Saul</hi> had many good motions, but cherishing his anger against <hi>David,</hi> hee lost the spirit of God, and was haunted with an evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; not onely a melancholicke humour, (as some thinke) but even an evill Angel. So for voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, a lust which while <hi>Herod</hi> cherished, hee lost all his gifts: And covetousnesse in <hi>Iudas,</hi> lost all his gifts together with himselfe. The light of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26365:22"/>
the Sunne puts out the light of the fire: and the love of the world puts out the love of God. So for carnall feare, the feare of men, of danger, of losse, &amp;c. it quencheth thousands of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, insomuch as men neither by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor yet by night dare come to Christ, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be as the cake halfe baked on the hearth, not warmed through. Thirdly, sinnes in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> speeches, corrupt communication; vile speeches doe banish and vexe the Spirit: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30, 31. <hi>Let no speech that is corrupt proceede out of your mouthes,</hi> and then it followes, <hi>Grieve not that holy Spirit of God.</hi> Therefore we must keepe our mouth with <hi>bit and bridle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 39.1.</note> and see that our words issue from the spirit of grace, and minister grace to the hearers. Fourthly, sinnes in action doe quench <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Spirit exceedingly: how did <hi>David</hi> after his sinnes of adultery and murther lose the feeling of the Spirit? for sinne blindeth the minde, hardeneth the heart, and leaveth a blot behinde it.</p>
            <p>Now among all actuall sins,<note place="margin">Three sorts of actuall sinnes more violently quench the Spirit.</note> some there bee which more violently quench the spirit than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as 1. Sinnes that are studied and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which is not a slipping into sinne, but as a pitching of a mans selfe into the sea. A woe is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> denounced on them that <hi>devise wickednesse on their beds, and in the morning practise it. Absolom</hi> for two yeares together plotted his brothers death, and at last compassed it. How can this but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely quench the spirit, whose motions all the while are resisted? 2. Sinnes <hi>repeated, doubled,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and traded in; which argues greedinesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26365:23"/>
in sinne, when men live in an evill course, purposely and constantly. These are as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated diseases, seldome cured. How often doe wee see ordinary drunkards, quarrellers, riotous persons left by God and his spirit, and now ruled by the Dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and commanded by him to outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges against their owne and other mens lives? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Sinnes against <hi>conscience,</hi> when Gods word stands as an armed man in the conscience, yet for all that the wretched sinner resists the lowd call of Gods word ringing in his owne conscience. This is an opposing and a resisting of the spirit, joyned with a wilfulnesse and obstinacy in sinne, notwithstanding all calls to the contrary: these sinnes thrust downe the regiment of the spirit, and therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth against them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keepe thy servant from presumptuous sinnes, that they prevaile not over mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. By others sinnes.</note>So much of our owne sins. The sins <hi>of others</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are a great meanes to quench the spirit of God. How doth profane company dead the spirit, as <hi>Peter</hi> in the high Priests hall! <hi>Salomon</hi> fell by the company of outlandish wives, and shall we looke to stand where he fell? The Israelites hated the Aegyptians, and yet through conversing with them learned their manners. Besides, when wee thrust our selves into evill company, we ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily say nothing at all, or nothing but what is pleasing unto them; &amp; by both these means the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is grieved and quenched. But especially if they be the sinnes of superiours, sinnes of Magistrates, they suddenly infect and fall upon the inferiours;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26365:23"/>
as sudden raines fall off the hills into the valleyes, and stand there. But especially sinnes of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, by preaching seldome, coldly or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; mens greene wood will not burne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better blowing. As also when their lives are scandalous, what will fire in preaching doe, when a man carries water in his life, and is noted with pride, covetousnesse, contention, drunkennesse, or any such foule lusts?</p>
            <p n="3">III. A speciall meanes of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is to be avoyded, is,<note place="margin">3. When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is grieved.</note> 
               <hi>To grieve the hóly Spirit of God, Eph.</hi> 4.30. Now he is grieved foure wayes: 1. By not preparing, or not preserving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our hearts as sweete and holy Temples for him; if we doe not wash, trimme, and perfume our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and sweepe out every distastfull thing, and beautifie them in most seemely manner, for so honourable a personage. If an honourable or noble person should vouchsafe to come to a meane mans house, and finde the house slut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and nasty, annoyed with filthy smells, and every way unprovided, hee would be sorry hee came into such a noysome place, and begin to thinke of departure. So if the holy Spirit of God finde our hearts a sinke full of corrupt thoughts, our speeches as noysome and filthy smells, our actions foule and polluted, he is sore grieved, and will not stay.<note place="margin">

By dishonouring him in his owne Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> can a man indure to be wronged in his owne house? But so is he, when we give way to lusts, when we follow the sway of corruption, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of the world, and forget the guest that is within, and ought principally to be pleased. Also when wee turne his gifts against himselfe, our knowledge to puffe us up, our wisedome to earthlinesse, our zeale against zeale, the word to maintaine our sinne, the sacraments to feede our hypocrisie, and the whole grace of God into wantonnesse.</p>
            <p>Againe, if we must not quench the spirit, then must we observe and carefully mark,<note place="margin">

Highly to esteeme the gifts and graces of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> spirit, and keepe them the more carefully. 2. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be so much the more thankfull for them, seeing they are so freely conferred upon us, as <hi>David,

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall I know if the Spirit be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By the application of this observation, thou shalt see whether thou art gone forward or backward, whether thou hast quenched or cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Spirit. This examination shall be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to five particular heads:<note place="margin">Rules of tryall whether the Spirit be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> in respect of 1. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 2. Good motions, 3. Good duties, 4. Sinne, and 5. the Spirits worke on thy affections.</p>
            <p>First, examine thy selfe in graces received,<note place="margin">1. In respect of grace.</note> both for number and measure.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

and practise, as one ignorant about what he may imploy his head and hands. A tree being in decay withers first at toppe, because it cannot send sappe so farre from home: so is the life of grace knowne to be in decay, if it feede not all the parts of the Christian course. Or to use our owne Metaphor: As an aged man appeares by his head, his white haires shew a decay of naturall heate and moysture: so a Christians falling from right understanding, judgement and practise, is as white haires, and argues a decay of spirituall heate and vigour.</p>
            <p>For preservatives in this case, first consider, that God expects the number of talents commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us.

               <note place="margin">For measure.</note>2. In regard of the <hi>measure</hi> of graces, try thus: If a man waver and stagger in that wherein hee hath beene constant; still he hath some faith, some zeale, some patience, diligence, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but he wants that measure which sometimes he had: now though he have an under measure in all, yet hath he quenched the spirit: Even as an olde man is knowne to be decayed, because, though hee have his whole number of parts that ever he had, yet he hath them not in that measure

of vigour, as formerly hee had them.</p>
            <p>For preservatives against this decay, first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is blamed for <hi>falling from her first love,</hi> that degree of carefulnes which once she had, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Secondly, consider that we are commanded in the Scripture, to <hi>adde grace to grace,</hi> as dayes are added to our lives, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6. yea in respect of the measure and strength of grace: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.

If in stead of fervency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in prayer thou findest thy prayer colde, dead, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, formall, interrupted with idle and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts; now the spirit is quenched, who makes us cry, and stirres up <hi>groanes which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.</hi>

If once comming to the word thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wast wont to finde it sweete, and a word of life unto thee; but now thou commest with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent heart, a slumbering and a sleepy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; oh, certainly the spirit is now quenched, who is never so sweete and cheerefull as in the word: for he thawes the benummed heart, and makes it <hi>burne by opening the Scripture.</hi> A man in a swone, if rubbing and <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> fetch him not againe, his soule is gone: the same is thy case, if the spirit of God do not revive and quicken thee. 3. In keeping the Lords Sabboths, if sometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thou couldest account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy delight, &amp; the most comfortable day of the week; but now thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally passest them over; not altogether hardened, but with colde and heavie motions, in confessing sinne, in petition, in thanksgiving: if thou be slow of heart to beleeve, heare and meditate in the word; by this know, that the spirit is quenched in thee, who worketh joy and sweetnesse in the heart, while it is in the presence of God, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the Saints. 4. If after the performing of good duties thou hast sometimes found cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, strength, and good assurance; thy selfe refreshed by them, and better disposed: but now thou findest in thee loathing, or discontentment,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26365:26"/>
no strength, or small comfort, know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the spirit is quenched; some sinne or other is as a cloud hindering the beames of his sweete grace and comfort from thee: <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.2, 3. <hi>I sought the Lord yet my sore ranne, and ceased not, my soule refused comfort, I did thinke upon God and was troubled, I prayed, and my Spirit was full of anguish:</hi> Verse 7. <hi>Will hee absent himselfe for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</hi> Consider here what a dead carkasse is without the soule, and so is all our service without the spirit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, examine thy selfe in respect of sinne,<note place="margin">4. In respect of sinne.</note> thus: 1. If some sinne which was of great burden and weight in thy estimation, doe now seeme lesse, and lesse dangerous; if sometimes thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not be comforted in the sence of sinne, and the same sinne now move thee nothing at all: thou couldst not abide cursed speaking in others, now thou fallest to it thy selfe; thou couldst not away with idle and gracelesse companions, now thou canst: now hast thou quenched the spirit. 2. If thou be apt to rush into sinne once conquered, thy strength is abated. 3. If thou be unwilling to heare any of thy sinnes reproved, the spirit is quenced, because <hi>he rebuketh sinne.</hi> 4. If the word and rodde preserve thee not from sinne, the spirit is not present in thee. 5. If after sinne committed thou doest not more hate it and sorrow for it, than before thou lovedst it, and rejoycedst in it; if thou hast not a more constant care to avoid sinne than before, yea if thou hast not a greater zeale in doing good; know for a certaine, that some

sinne in thee or other is as water cast upon the spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. In respect of the worke of Gods Spirit on thy affections.</note>Fifthly, and lastly, examine thy selfe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the worke of Gods Spirit</hi> on thy affections, thus: If thy love of heavenly things be abated, or be more to earth than to heaven; if thy joy be troubled; if thy conscience be perplexed with accusations: if there be in thee an excessive feare of death, or the like: certainly the spirit is now quenched, looke well unto it. <hi>Object.</hi> Alas! I have found my affections more fiery than now they be, I have had a great measure of zeale for God, much indignation against sinne, fervent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Gods service, joy in God, comfort in my selfe, and in good duties; but now it is not so with me, I could never attaine the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as at first: what may I thinke of my selfe? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must wisely distinguish of the <hi>diffusing</hi> of grace, from the <hi>decaying</hi> of it. In earthly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, love will be more vehement at first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause lesse diffused, but afterward is rather more extended than languishing: so it is in the heate of grace. But how may I know it? thus: 1. If thou be displeased that thou canst not get thy heart to the highest pitch of delight in grace. 2. If thou still hungrest after grace, and a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as one that hath tasted hony desireth more: so having tasted of the spirit, doest earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a greater measure of it. 3. Stickest thou to the meanes, in publicke and in private, and wilt not be driven off, still lying at the Poole where the spirit mooveth? then discourage not thy

                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Motives to stir up the Spirit of God.</note> seeing negative precepts include the affirmative, every Christian must hence be stirred up, to <hi>stirre up the gift of God</hi> that is in him, and not suffer it to decay: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. A fit lesson even for <hi>Timothy</hi> himselfe. For first, the Spirit is ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> working something in Gods children worthy the stirring up: he is no where idle, but still beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; perfecting his own dwelling. 2.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What meanes may wee use to blow up the Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Means to blow up the Spirit, 7.</note> The word of God in the publicke and private use of it. First, the preaching of the word, as it begets, so it nourisheth grace: The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ministry is instituted, and gifts given to men, not onely to lay to foundation of our happinesse, but to build us up till we <hi>meet together in a perfect body, Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. Naturall food strengthens the body by the daily use of it, &amp; spiritual food streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the soule by the continuall use of it. Those that say they know as much as they neede, or as much as the Preacher can tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; never truly saw
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26365:28"/>
their great weaknesse: for let any good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence say, if it neede not the word continually. <hi>David,</hi> a man of singular grace, yet lay fouly in his sinnes till <hi>Nathan</hi> came and stirred him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Despise Prophecy, and quench the Spirit; where vision faileth, grace perisheth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the word must be privately read and conversed in, for such is the excellency and power of it, that it transformes the minde conversant in it unto it selfe, and to be affected as the pen-men were, holily and graciously. Besides, it begets and furthers found judgement; whereas others erre, not knowing the Scriptures: and it stirres up good affections and gracious desires. Againe, the word must be meditated on in private, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, hearing and reading are to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Blessed is the man that meditates in the law of the Lord continually.</hi> And here is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall helpe; for, hearing and reading doe feede meditation, and meditation doth fasten them: Why else hath God given man a reasonable soule, but to meditate upon his word and workes? Or why else hath he set apart a whole day in seaven, especially for meditation, if it were not a notable meanes to excite grace? Or why else did our Lord take all occasions from the workes of God, to teach and instruct us, but for our example, that we should tread in his holy steppes?</p>
            <p>We see the first meanes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The Sacraments were instituted to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, which in it selfe is weake, and to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26365:28"/>
keepe in continuall memory the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us, with the meanes thereof: yea the very preparation to them includeth a speciall meanes of stirring up our graces, of repentance, of renewing our faith, of obedience, thankfulnesse, and all the meanes of growth in the covenant. And much more strength doth a good heart finde in the celebration of them. Therefore to forbeare them of contempt, argues no member of Christ: and of negligence to forbeare is to cast ones selfe into the judgement of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Prayer sets all graces on worke: as faith in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Gods promises, charity toward our brethren, hope which lookes for the performance of that we pray for; humility in confession of sinnes, and sense of wants; thankfulnesse for supplies, and leave to pray: and by exercise in prayer wee get the spirit of prayer: <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Our Father will not deny his Spirit to them that aske him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Company, or commerce with the godly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doth exceedingly sharpen our graces. One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lights another, and one sticke of fire kindles another. A lesser sticke may kindle a billet: so the strongest Christian may receive furtherance from the weakest. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> chap. 1.12. And when <hi>Silas</hi> came, <hi>Paul burned in the Spirit.</hi> But how can one coale alone by it selfe keepe it selfe glowing? Yea evill men have become better for good mens company: <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe among the Prophets will prophecie. And shall the wicked in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies abet and further one another in evill, and shal not good men in good?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:26365:29"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Observe the first motions of Gods Spirit, and the ayme of God in his wayes with us,<note place="margin">Motions of the Spirit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</note> and follow them. For the first the prodigall sonne is a good example: he had a motion and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, he remembred the estate that he was in, and the estate that he had beene in, and the estate of his fathers house; and in no case suffers this motion to die, but followes it, surely I will starve here no longer, but resolves to goe to his father and goes. Many kill good motions in the rise of them: many follow them to purposes and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, but there they die; few follow them to practise. So in Gods wayes with our selves: If he make our estates prosperous, and advance us in the world above others, what is his ayme but that we should be eminent instruments of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Many purpose when they come into great places of Magistracy, or any preferment, to doe much good every way, but they suffer this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to die, and never follow their resolution un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. So what is the ayme of God in crosses and tryalls, but to excite and exercise our graces? which while we suffer to lie still, God takes us in hand, and mooves us, and shakes us by the north winde of afflictions to blow our ashes and dust from us. Therefore in every trouble let us follow this ayme of God, and make account that every of them is the Lords bellowes to blow up our graces: so shall our afflictions, yea our sinnes themselves bee as the smithes water on coales to heate us the more.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Let us exercise diligently our <hi>generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:26365:29"/>
of Christians. In our selves let us practise piety, and keepe on worke the grace received; for the Lord recompenceth the practise of grace with the increase of grace: No man used his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent but with gaine. And to others let us exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise friendly admonition, exhortation, reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and loving chastisement of such as are under our charge. For first, every Christian is a debter to every one, and all gifts are given for the body. Secondly, the nature of grace is as fire, which will fasten and kindle where ever it can find mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thirdly, the recompence shall be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, as the meale in the barrell, and the oyle in the cruse, the more spent the more increased. The <hi>speciall calling</hi> also feedes all graces, and calls for the practise of them, as of piety, and justice, patience, and charity, and the rest; yea is indeed a schoole of all vertues.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Propound wee still to our selves an higher pitch, and a further degree of grace than as yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> we have attained, consider how farre wee are short of perfection. Thus did <hi>Paul</hi> stirre up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>I forget those things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and reach forth to those things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</hi> Men are never rich enough (they think) have never money enough, so long as any are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, this makes them bestirre themselves to gather still: But a little grace is enough, yea a small measure is thought excesse and too much. The <hi>Pharisy</hi> lookes to such as in his conceit are behinde him, and then hee is not such a one, or such a one. But we must set before us the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26365:30"/>
and to imitate the best things in the best men: and not onely men, but the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to the Church the example of Christ that unerring patterne: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</p>
            <p>Now to stirre us up both to avoid the meanes of quenching the Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motives.</hi>
               </note> and to use the meanes of quickning the Spirit, 1. Let us consider, that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must be countable for all our graces, and all the meanes of grace: our Master is an hard man, and in the day of account will not call onely for his owne, but for the whole tale and number: and the evill servant, that brought the owne talent, but not the number, was condemned. Therefore neglect no meanes of well-doing. 2. Cherish the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Spirit and his graces for the blessings hee brings with him, even all the fruites of the Spirit, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, consolation, holinesse, happinesse. If while the Arke was in <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> house, he was blessed for it, which was but a signe of Gods presence; how much more blessed shall that heart be, that entertaines himselfe? Cheare the Spirit in thy heart, and he will cheare thee. 3. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will vexe the Spirit, the Spirit will vexe him. If the hypocrite quench him, and grieve him, he utterly departs and leaves, and gives over that party unto death. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit went, and the evill Spirit came upon Saul:</hi> and <hi>the Divell entred into Iudas.</hi> Of them that by Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie so farre provoke the Lord, it is most true, <hi>Their latter end is worse than their beginning:</hi> better for them they had beene heathens, yea dogges; better for them that the Spirit had never given
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26365:30"/>
them the least common grace, better they had <hi>never knowne the way of truth</hi> and righteousnesse, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. And if the godly quench him by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, or any sinne, hee will hide himselfe till they know what they have done. <hi>Object.</hi> What matter? he will come againe if I be Gods: no great harme if he goe for a while. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thou maist deceive thy selfe in thy reckoning, and thinke he dwells in thee as one of the elect, when he is in thee but in some common graces: and then he goes quite away at length, and never comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: And likely it is, that thou art such an one, in whom this deceit discovers it selfe, who canst be content he absent himselfe: when as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord, take not thy holy Spirit from mee, Psal.</hi> 51.11. 2. Suppose he will come againe to thee that art the Lords, yet hee will not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine so freely, but thou shalt know to thy cost what thou hadst, and what thou hast lost; and shalt shed teares, and sigh, and cry, and learne how to prise him before he come againe: See <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.6. 3. Perhaps hee will neuer come with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant blessing as hee did before, and thou shalt never attaine thy first love, thy first joy, and the comfort thou once hadst; yea thou maist passe all thy daies in griefe to see how much thou wantest of thy selfe, and to consider of thy decayes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceive not thy selfe, watch thy heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and entertaine the good Spirit whilest thou hast him, lest he depart in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; and thou be left to lament thy losse.</p>

               <hi>teaching,</hi> which stands in right interpreting of Scripture, giving the right sense, raising sound doctrines, and beating downe contrary errours. Secondly, <hi>exhorting,</hi> which is the applying of doctrines to the use of edification and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These were distinguished in the primative Church into seuerall offices, of Doctors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, because of the abundant gifts then given, and the indistinct multitude of beleevers, not brought into distinct congregations: but now for the most part they are confounded into one. For the proofe of these parts of Prophecy see, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. <hi>He that prophecieth, speaketh to men, for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for exhortation and consolation.</hi>

               </gap> properly signifies basely to account of a thing, and esteeme it nothing worth, and of no reckoning; which indeede is all one with despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it. And the Apostle intendeth when he saith <hi>(Despise not)</hi> that they should not onely not loath and contemne the word, but honour it, highly esteeme it, heartily love it, yea sincerely follow it.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1</note>One reason hereof is in the Text: By faithfull preaching, the Spirit, and his graces, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are quickned and cherished, as by it they are begun and continued. 1. The Ministery is the chariot of the Spirit, whereby he rides gloriously into the hearts of the elect. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>While Peter spake, the holy Ghost fell upon them which heard
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26365:32"/>
his words.</hi> 2. Prophecy is that which inciteth and provoketh us in our dulnesse, and quickens us to the faithfull imployment of such gifts as are given us by the Spirit. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.11. <hi>The words of the wise are like goades, and nailes, fastened by the masters of assemblies:</hi> As goades, to pricke us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when wee grow dull and sloathfull in the practise of piety and vertue; and as nailes, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten us to the sound love and obedience of the truth, when we grow either wavering, weake, or weary; for so the Apostles by preaching confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Disciples at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 14.22. So <hi>Ieremy</hi> calls the word of the Lord <hi>a fire shut up in his bones, which warme and heates our colde and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hearts,</hi> and quickens our graces; as the two Disciples, whose <hi>hearts glowed in them while Christ opened to them the Scriptures.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 24 32.</note> 3. Prophecy is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Edification</hi> in the knowledge of God and Iesus Christ, in faith, in godlinesse, love, zeale, repentance, newnesse of life, and all the heavenly vertues. For <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which containes admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and reprehension; both which are speciall good meanes to awake and quicken us, when coldnesse and carelesnesse creepe on us. And for <hi>Consolation,</hi> for seeing it is the portion of the Saints, <hi>by many tribulations to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 14.22.</note> they have great and continuall neede of matter of comfort and strength, the which being onely to be had from the conduits of comfort in the Scriptures, and from the gracious promises conteined therein; what a forcible argument is this to make us highly esteeme, and joyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note>2. The gift of Prophecy and faithfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that precious gift which our Lord Iesus, when he left the world, bestowed on his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>For the gathering together of the Saints, for the worke of the Ministery, for the building up of the body of Christ.</hi> Now with what safety can any man despise so great a gift of so deare a friend, which hee was so carefull at his last departure to commend to his friends; to so gracious a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and end, as to gather them from under the wrath of God, and from the dispersed and lost estate of the world? whereas without vision or prophecy people are lost, or (as the word is) na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, exposed to Gods wrath and their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18.</p>
            <p>Nay more; the Lord in this one gift offers a whole mint of mercy to be divided among belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. He offers us <hi>life</hi> of grace in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>the word of life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20.32.</note> and <hi>the word of grace, Ioh.</hi> 6.33. <hi>the word that I speake unto you is spirit and life.</hi> He offers us <hi>light</hi> of grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without the shine of which glorious light of the Gospell, men sit in darkenesse and shadow of death; having their understanding darkned, and strangers to the life of God through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them. Hee offers by it <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> with himselfe, and in our owne consciences, and therefore it is called a <hi>Ministery of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Acts 10 36.</note> and the Gospell of peace, whereby God through us beseecheth men to be reconciled</hi>: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:26365:33"/>
us <hi>faith</hi> by this gift of Prophecy, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary meanes by which we attaine that precious gift of gifts: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Without hearing, no faith. Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>The word of faith which wee preach.</hi> Lastly, he offereth us by it, <hi>the end of our faith, even the salvation of our soules,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. and therefore it is called <hi>a word of salvation, Acts</hi> 13.26. Now what great and unspeakable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse were it to despise so great salvation, to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise the word of life, of grace, of light, of peace, of faith, and the end of it which is salvation? for it is the ingraffed word, able to save soules: <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Manifold is the evill that overtakes a despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Prophecy: 1. He is destitute of the Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> who hath no being, no delight to be there; as the connexion of the precepts witnesseth. 2. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being neglected, piety is lost, and men prove profane persons: this was a brand of <hi>Esaus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanesse, that hee cared more for a meales meate, than he did for the blessing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. 3. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise thou prophecy, thy prayer shall be despised, and all thy service is abominable: <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. and chap. 1.28. <hi>Because I have cryed (saith the Lord) and yee would not heare, yee shall cry and not be heard.</hi> 4. It ties and fastens sinne on men, yea and heapes up judgement; for first, it nourisheth ignorance, a maine supporter of Satans kingdome: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it resisteth faith, by refusing the onely and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of it: thirdly, it barreth out repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, because this is the meanes of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and change of heart and life: fourthly, it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26365:34"/>
makes sinne farre more sinfull, because here is a refusall of mercy and grace offered by prophecy: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22 <hi>If I had not come and spoken, they had not sinned; but now they have no cloake for their sinne.</hi> Fifthly, the refusall of prophecy provoketh the Lord to give up men to vile affections, to worke all uncleannesse with greedinesse, because they <hi>received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.10. Lastly, it tyes on judgement as fast as sinne, and wraps the despiser in the curse of God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How shall we escape, if we neglect,</hi> (much more) <hi>despise so great salvation.</hi> Consider the threatnings, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. <hi>Beholde ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: Beholde, I will worke a worke in your dayes which a man would not beleeve</hi> for the terrour of it: out of <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.5.</p>

                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>This serves to reproove, 1. <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> who pretend the Spirit, and despise prophecy; they have the Spirit to guide them, and therefore neede no preaching. 2. Those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <hi>Atheists</hi> at home, who despising the Spirit of grace, and the word of grace, live as without God in the world. Many who have <hi>Iacobs</hi> voice, professe in word better things, yet prize the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Christ as a thing of nought. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be casting up some account, or reading some history, or walking in the fields, or visiting some friends, or perhaps going to a play, than to a Sermon. Are these the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the sonnes of God, and not rather the profane sonnes of profane <hi>Esau?</hi> What can hee tell me (saith one) which I know not? As if thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:26365:34"/>
could priviledge thee to despise Prophecy. And what thinkest thou? These <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had knowledge as well as thou, for they were <hi>taught of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.9. yet must not they despise Prophecy, and wilt thou despise it? We see not (saith another) but that all this preaching doth breede barrennesse, as an immoderate raine, and brings preaching into contempt: As if the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of prophecying did priviledge the profane heart to despise it. The Israelites made just such another reason, <hi>Oh wee have nothing but Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, Mannah, and our soule is weary of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> and yet by their owne confession, if they loathe this <hi>Mannah,</hi> they must have nothing else to live by, they shall surely die, and their blood be upon them. <hi>Object.</hi> Wee see not that this preaching doth any thing but breede conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among Preachers and hearers. <hi>Answ.</hi> As if, because a bad stomacke turnes wholsome meate into bad humours, therefore good meate must be despised: and because mans nature (spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-like) turnes wholsome doctrine into poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, therefore wholsome doctrine may be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised. Many other allegations the Divell puts into the mindes and mouthes of men, against Prophecy, because he knowes by preaching, his kingdome <hi>falls like lightening, Luk.</hi> 10.18. But those that feare the Lord will abhorre them. 3. Others are reprooved, who can be content to heare the word read, and thinke themselves in good case if they can reade the word, or good bookes at home, but despise prophecy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26365:35"/>
which what else is it but to reject Gods wisedome in his owne meanes, who hath set us apart to pray men in Christs stead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God? The conversion of men was never committed to mens owne private reading, no nor to the ministery of Angels; no nor Christ himselfe, undertooke to convert the world, by his owne industry, but left his Disciples to doe greater things than himselfe: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.12. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Gods meanes, and thy owne shall never succeede. Besides, will not any say, that hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands better by interpretation of things, than by bare reading? Yes, any but grosse malice, and wilfulnesse. 4. Others will heare the word, not read onely but preached, and yet despise Prophecy, because they despise the practise of that they heare; as <hi>Herod.</hi> That which a man cares not to keepe, hee despiseth. <hi>Blessed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it, and doe it.</hi>

But have them in singular love for their workes sake, as our spirituall fathers begetting us unto Christ. Wee see how the Prophets of the olde Testament were esteemed even of Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; as <hi>Ioash,</hi> though a wicked King, finding <hi>Elisha</hi> ready to die, fell on his face, and wept, and cried, <hi>My father, my father, the horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof,</hi> 2 <hi>King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But alas! the calling of <hi>Prophecying</hi> it is like <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, who was like a withered branch, and a roote in a dry ground, no beauty, no favour to desire it, the carnall man sees no good in it; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Christ hath magnified it in his owne person.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Priests in the Law might not determine and judge of cases as they list, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11. 2.

Fathers themselves never challenged this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and exemption, as indeede there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should; for themselves have erred in many Doctrines, some of which they retracted, and some they never retracted: Besides, they wrote many truthes which are not extant, and many things are extant in their names which they never wrote; and many things are true which they never thought on.

than that people ought judicially to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Doctrine of their Pastors before they give it entertainment, as afterward we shall more clearely proove.<note place="margin">

            <p>And why?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because there shall alwayes be false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Church, who shall easily misleade us into errour, if we <hi>try</hi> them not.

Oh they dare not goe to God but by Mediatours, Saints and Angels, they must use much bodily affliction in chastising and whipping themselves: as <hi>Baals</hi> Priests did, so doe they. And their speeches shall be as faire and insinuative as their behaviour:<note place="margin">The locusts have faces and haire like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> Oh they seeke nothing but to winne soules, to convert their Countrey-men; they venture their lives for the Catholike Church; the soules of their deare Countrey-men are dearer to them than their owne lives: And thus with <hi>faire and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring speech they deceive the simple, Rom.</hi> 16.18. They flatter with Princes and great men, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves great. <hi>Ahab</hi> must not be offended, but <hi>goe up and prosper,</hi>

shut up, and fed with bread and water of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because he cannot flatter.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Constancy.</hi>
               </note> they shall pretend such zeale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, for their false and hereticall doctrines, as that they shal boldly die for their opinions.

               <hi>but the cause makes a Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore seeing false Teachers come so many, so armed with pretence of simplicity, of depth of learning, of authority, of miracles, of humbling themselves, of faire behaviour toward others, of constancy even to the death; had not such as would not be deceived by them, neede <hi>try</hi> both them and their doctrines by that which onely can direct them, namely, the light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>

In the same field where good wheate is sowne, some tares may be cast unawares, as the Parable shewes. All is not fire from the Altar that seemes so to be: Much heate is from mens owne Spirit, and not from Gods. Therefore doctrine even from the best must be tryed. <hi>Samuel</hi> an excellent Prophet may follow his owne affection, and speake rashly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. hee looked on <hi>Eliab,</hi> and said, <hi>Surely the Lords Anoynted is before mee:</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:26365:44"/>
but the Lord wished him not to looke on counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp;c. and so checked his errour. The next Prophet to <hi>Samuel</hi> that we reade of, was <hi>Nathan</hi> a worthy man, yet he also was deceived; and was like to have deceived <hi>David:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Goe and doe all that is in thy heart,</hi> for the Lord is with thee: But the same night the Lord caused him to retract it. Now if the extraordinary Prophets might sometimes nod (as we say) and not looke so neere to their message as they should: much more may Evangelicall Prophets, whose message is not so immediate as theirs: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. <hi>The spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets:</hi> and verse 29. <hi>When one prophecyeth, the rest must judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As there be many errours and heresies, so also are there many offences in the world to try us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3.</note> and it stands us in hand to try them, if wee would not be overturned by them: for all the falls of Gods servants proceede from hence, that they lay aside this triall of things which are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or done. Whence was our greatest and first fall from happinesse, but that <hi>Eve</hi> tryed not the counsell of the Serpent, nor <hi>Adam</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of <hi>Eve</hi>? whence are many great ones wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped daily into the gulfe of Popery and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme, but because they are willing to trust before they try? They are carried away with the glister of the golden cup of her abominations, but never try the wine in it. Was ever errour or vice taken into the heart or hand,<note place="margin">

               </note> into affection or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in his owne shape? no, but in the likenesse of some vertue, or profit, or pleasure; they all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26365:44"/>
come masked and painted, and appeare not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves till they be tried and uncased, but in the triall appeare such friends as betray us with a kisse.</p>
            <p>Our soules are proner to any evill than to the least good;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4.</note> 1. because the <hi>flesh is ever lusting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. 2. Besides our owne evill imaginations, the Divell is ready to drive us forward: and 3. the world will ever bee encouraging us in evill. But in any good thing we rowe against the streame, and doe (as it were) an unnaturall thing, offering violence to nature. To what good purpose would the Israelites have parted so easily with their eare-rings, as to make a Calfe? If the Iewes who were so forward to bestow their corne, and wine, and oyle, and wool, yea their golde and silver on <hi>Baal,</hi> to maintaine false worship, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.8. had they beene moved to have beene halfe so liberall to the true worship of God, what excuses and whining should the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet have heard? But in <hi>Baals</hi> honour, if their golde and silver were too little, they would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord their sonnes and daughters, and sacrifice them to Divells. At this day: If men be moved to any matter of charge towards Gods worship, toward the poore, or good purposes, they will be niggardly, pinching, and grossely base: But let their lusts call on them, let play, cards or dice, bowles or carnall fellowship, invite them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, they can freely enough drop shillings, or crownes, or pounds perhaps and peeces. Had we not neede then to try diligently the things wee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26365:45"/>
lay hands on, seeing our inclination is so averse and alienate from every good thing? If wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our choises in generall, wee shall finde by tryall, that the hastiest assent is never safest. And it would prove safe for us (as our Proverbe is) to looke before we leape, to try before we trust; and to proove and examine things before wee give them entertainment.</p>
            <p>I come now to the uses of this Doctrine.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>The first is an use of reprehension to many sorts of men, who hereby are found culpable.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, those are here reprooved, who upon a prejudicate opinion despise all preaching: Oh these Preachers are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and we know not who to trust, we will let all alone, till they agree together. How is this to <hi>try all things?</hi> Or who is so absurd as to conclude thus in civill things? because some men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in buying a commodity, will wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vowe never to buy any thing? Because some wares are bad, will we buy none at all: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some are crafty Merchants and couseners, shall we trust no man that is of good credit and report? What man will refuse all silver and golde, because some be copper peeces and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit? Or what an awke and unreasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is this; There be many slippes in met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, and therefore I scorne the touch-stone? nay rather, therefore thou shouldest use it.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, this serves to confute not onely the

Popish, but also the Protestants implicit faith,<note place="margin">Protestants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith.</note> which is to take up Doctrines and Opinions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Tryall</hi>; and this indeede is a senselesse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and infidelity: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Every man must be ready to give account of his faith,</hi> and therefore must be able to expresse his owne faith. <hi>Salomon</hi> records it as a part of extreame folly to be so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. <hi>A foole beleeveth every thing,</hi> that is, rashly gives credit, and hearkens to every Deceiver: <hi>But a prudent man takes heede to his steppes,</hi> that is, examineth and weigheth what he heareth, and what he doth before he undertake it. And <hi>Iob</hi> makes this the chlefe office of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chap. 34.3. <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth tasteth meate.</hi> Let us seeke judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and let us know among our selves what is good. And what difference is there betweene a wise man and a foole, but that the foole wants judgement, followes his fancy, and is led by his senses, and appearances without tryall?</p>

Not all things without tryall and discretion, (for then it should rejoyce in unrighteousnesse:) but after it hath tryed them. 4. Nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to charity that is agreeable to wisdome, but with the judgement of charity there must goe a judgement of prudence.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Our Proverb is, A man may tell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney after his father, not in distrustfulnesse, as if he suspected he would deceive him, (for this were against duty, and charity) but in wisedome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he may unwittingly deceive; and this is held no disparagement to his father: no more is it to our spirituall fathers. 2. The truth loseth nothing, but rather gaineth by being tryed; because it is more approved and justified than before: as gold is no whit prejudiced, but purged and refined by the fire.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, this Doctrine reprooves the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous courses of many men, some of whom are unwilling to <hi>try</hi> any thing at all; others <hi>try</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but not by the right rule: some in great matters nearely concerning them, purposely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from all examination; as those in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. they are <hi>willingly ignorant</hi> in matters both of judgement and practise, thinking that while they hood winke themselves, they may the more freely entertaine whatsoever makes for their pleasure, profit or preferment: some controversies they dare not looke into, for feare the light should make them losers. Some practises they would neuer bring to the tryall: it is death for them to haue their usuries, their affected games, their strange fashions meddled withall, or brought to the touch-stone: they would stoppe both their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26365:46"/>
eares, or wish there were no tongue to touch their darling sinnes, for feare they should be brought to dislike such profitable and pleasurable sinnes, which to lose were to part with their hands and eyes. These persons resemble that gluttonous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite, who covered his tongue with a skinne, that he might swallow any thing though never so hot: they have covered their consciences with a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red skinne, that they may take downe any thing insensibly without examination.</p>
            <p>But here let us consider,<note place="margin">Motives to bring all things to this tryall, 7.</note> 1. what an expresse commandement we have for the duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Proove what is the good and acceptable will of God:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Proove what is pleasing unto God: Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man proove his owne worke. Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us search and try our wayes.</hi> 2. How <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will it stand with wisdome to be curious in trisles, and in every outward thing be it never so small, and yet neglect the greatest? Wee will <hi>try</hi> our meate, our drinke, our money, our mettalls, our beasts, nothing shall come into our hands <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryed:</hi> But onely in the greatest things, appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God and good conscience, we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carelesse. 3. There is nothing wherein a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> may be so dangerously deceived, as in matters of this nature: To be deceived in counterfeit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or golde, to be deceived with false evidences and titles of land, is a great oversight, but nothing in comparison of this: the deceit here is in things eternall, touching our rights and free-hold in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 4. Never had any man such dangerous cheaters about him to deceive him, as wee have,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:26365:47"/>
for their number, power and subtilty, all cunning enough to worke upon our simplicity. Satan will surely sift and <hi>try</hi> us, hee will <hi>winnow us as wheate, Luk.</hi> 22.31. The world and all sorts of wicked ones lye in ambush to entise us: Our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull <hi>Delilah,</hi> our owne flesh, which is the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and most powerfull over us, is most treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous against our selves. Every occasion without stirres up inward corruption. We had need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>try</hi> every thing offered unto us, lest we take from these cheaters a boxe of counters for a box of gold. 5. God observes and commends such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> carefully <hi>try</hi> doctrines and courses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <hi>To the Church of Ephesus write thus, I know thy workes, and that thou hast examined them which say they are Apostles, and are not, but hast found them lyers.</hi> 6. This is necessary to comfort our owne hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> in the many <hi>tryalls,</hi> and scornes of evill men, who will be ready to turne all our glory into shame, and all our religion into hypocrisie; and all our godly indeavours into precisenesse and faction. We had neede <hi>try</hi> our wayes by the Rule, that we may be able to outstand their imputations, and contemne their contempt, and scandalous fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. So long as we holde our Rule, we shall be ever able to appeale unto God, and holde our <hi>innocency till we die:</hi> let it be faction, let it be schism, yea heresie, we shall boldly say, <hi>In that way which they call heresie, we will worship the God of our fathers, Acts</hi> 24.14. 7. There is a day of <hi>tryall for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> things, and a fire which shall try every mans worke of what kinde it is,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Let the fire of the <hi>word</hi>

goe before the fire of the <hi>world,</hi> let that <hi>try</hi> which is stubble, hay, and chaffe, and which worke will abide. There is a Iudge who one day will strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine what men now passe so slightly; and he will judge our wayes then as the word now judgeth them. If we would in <hi>tryall</hi> be approoved then, we must now have our courses approoved by the same <hi>word</hi> which <hi>shall judge us at the last day, Iohn</hi> 12.48.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this Doctrine reprooves such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> would walke by a rule, but not the right rule. And these are diverse according to their diverse rules.<note place="margin">False rules of tryall are sixe.</note>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26365:48"/>
them: But they see no reason to forsake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to hate father and mother, to part with their profits, their lands, liberties, or lives; and they never thought them wise men, that for such conceits would so easily part with so precious things. And what is the reason, but because they never <hi>became fooles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 18.</note> 
               <hi>that they might be wise,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their religion is not now regulated by the proper rule of religion, but of corrupt and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reason cannot be a right rule. 3 Reas.</note>Against this use these considerations: first, how can corrupt reason be a perfect rule, being made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> so crooked as it is, and so contrary to the straight rule of the Scriptures, and the greatest resister of conversion? <hi>Nicodemus</hi> cannot see how an olde man can be borne againe, and so disclaimes the Doctrine of Regeneration: the blinde eye of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason puts no difference between the light of the Sunne and darknesse; nor the blind <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane</hi> betweene <hi>water of life</hi> and <hi>well water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, naturall reason is too short a rule, and how it can it be a perfect rule, because, not onely made so crooked as it is, but, seeing if it were entire, it is not able to comprehend many Mysteries of the faith, and of the Gospell that must be ruled; reason, if entire, yet it is too short for such mysteries as are above reason: faith, though it goes by the way of reason, yet it goes farre beyond reason. And no marvell, for reason cannot reach many secrets in <hi>nature: Eccles.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Thou knowest not the way of the winde, nor how the bones grow in the wombe.</hi> Who ever gave a reason
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:26365:48"/>
of the Loadstones drawing iron? of the fig-tree taming a wilde bull? of the little <hi>Remora</hi> fish that aresteth a ship passing swiftly on full seas? of the dying of the corne in the earth before it can live? and much more must it grope as in the darke, and shut up it selfe as an owle eye against the shine of mysteries in grace: How absurd and contrary to reason is the creation of all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? nature cannot beleeve it, but <hi>faith must, Heb.</hi> 11.3 The conception of a Virgin without hand of man: The resurrection of dead bodies almost infinitely transmutated: That life must be fetched out of death; heaven out of hell: that losses for Christ is gaine; that not kisses but kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are love; that death is advantage: Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers laugh at these things, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. So the life of reason is cleane contrary to the life of faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the rule must goe before the thing ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but reason must be an attendant to follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> faith, not an usher to goe before: for the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertnesse of reason is the raiser and feeder, and ever hath beene the mother and nurse of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and heresies. Carnall reason raised up <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphits,</hi> who conceive of God every way as a man; brought Images into the Churches; hatched that monster of Transubstantion, and all Popery. And whence are our new <hi>Pelagian</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions quickned in the profound mysteries of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and predestination; but because we must with our candle drowne the light of the Sunne, and receive into our spoone the deepe sea and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26365:49"/>
Ocean? The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gives faith unto that which reason cannot reach, and cryes out, <hi>Oh the deepnesse!</hi> but proud reason must be a straine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Paul,</hi> and must comprehend all this deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the slat and shallow of it selfe. Thus wee see the unfitnesse of this rule, reason must know her place, and not presume to checke or prescribe to faith; if <hi>Hagar</hi> will contest with <hi>Sarah,</hi> shee must be cast out of doores.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. The way of forefathers.</note>2. Some make the way of their fathers the rule of their religion and courses; as the musled and misled Papists, who depend on their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,<note place="margin">Ruth 1.16, 17.</note> as <hi>Ruth</hi> upon <hi>Naomi,</hi> there is no intreating of them to depart, where they are gone thither will these, where they dwell there will these, where they die there will these, and there they will be buried: likewise the olde Idolaters, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.17. who would <hi>still offer sacrifice to the Queene of heaven, because their fathers did so:</hi> the case was over-ruled by the former ages. So the Papists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse knowledge, will heare no Sermons, come to no Church, because their forefathers did no such thing:<note place="margin">This can be no sure rule.</note> which is altogether absurd. Against which consider, first, how absurd it is in religion; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what is this else, but to <hi>consult with flesh and blood</hi> in the matter of our faith, which <hi>Paul</hi> in the matter of his religion refused to doe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16? <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately I consulted not with flesh and blood, &amp;c.</hi> hee held it unmeete and absurd in the matters of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to conferre with men. Secondly, it is absurd in reason, as if a sonne were bound to pull out his eyes, because his father was blinde; or hee must
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26365:49"/>
poyson himselfe, because his grandfather was so. Thirdly, it is attended ever with a seduced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conscience, the very prop of false religion, and studde of superstition; as in blinde Papists and Iewes: for come to these blinde seduced consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and demaund of them thus: why will not you goe to Church, or take the oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or the like? Oh (say they) my conscience will not suffer mee: just as the Iewes conscience would not suffer them to <hi>goe into the Common Hall, lest they should be defiled, Ioh.</hi> 18.28. yet in the meane time their conscience could suffer them to accuse, arraigne and condemne the innocent Son of God: They made great conscience of putting the thirty silver peeces into the treasurie, but none at all of giving thirty peeces to betray Christ. So these conscionable Catholikes make no conscience of Treasons, of Equivocations, of blowing up of Parliaments, and the like. And what a rule is that which Turkes and Infidels can truly alledge for their religion? who suck in their impious Alcoran with their mothers milke from their forefathers? which the Samaritanes alledge for their mixture? <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.20. <hi>Our fathers worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in this Mount.</hi> And this all limbes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ alledge for themselves; which a man may frame unto, and be without all religion. As these bragge of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and of bones, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes of Saints and Martyrs: But for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, of religion, of holinesse and a good conscience they quite cast off. Fourthly, this is contrary to the rule which calls us from our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26365:50"/>
to it selfe: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.18. <hi>I said walke not in the statutes of your forefathers, but walk in my statutes and judgements, and doe them:</hi> and he complaines of that stubborne and rebellious generation, that set not their hearts aright, and whose spirit was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not stedfast with God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.8. Fifthly, the Rule notably directs us in points of imitation.<note place="margin">Rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning imitation of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It teacheth us that the rule of religion, is not the foundation of any forefathers but of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It teacheth us to dististinguish of fathers; some were carnall, some spirituall; some were inlightened and zealous, some blinde and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious: and wee must not admit any our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in religion, but such as had God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the true Church their Mother, that said unto wisdome thou art my sister. Thus farre the good Kings followed <hi>David,</hi> and so did <hi>Timothy</hi> his Grandmother <hi>Lois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It teacheth us to distinguish betweene that our forefathers have done, and what they ought to have done; and wee may follow them in all that they ought to doe, not in all they doe: Thus in looking on our Ancients must wee heede what the <hi>Ancient of Dayes</hi> hath warranted. The Iewes now goe on in their blaspheming of Christ, as their Predecessours did, but they ought not; and Papists they imitate their Ancestours in horrible idolatry, blindnesse, cruelty, but they looke not what they ought to doe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To inquire whether wee may lawfully doe what our Ancestours might lawfully doe: The
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:26365:50"/>
ancient Iewes might lawfully Sacrifice, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; but their posterity (though they doe) ought not: still wee must looke to our owne warrant. Our Ancestours were in the darke, wanted the light which we have: it is lesse safety, more shame and danger to us to walke as in the darke than for them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It affoords us wisdome to discerne between the things wee receive from our forefathers. A wise man would be willing to enjoy his fathers lands, goods, plate, jewells, yea his good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and vertues; but he would be loth to receive his hereditary diseases, goutes, stone, blindnesse, vices and shamefull blemishes: so it is here. But foolish and superstitious sotts as <hi>Israel</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not onely borrow their jewells and wealth, but carry away their biles, botches, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, Idolatry calves and all corruption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some make humane lawes the rule of their life. Why come many to Church,<note place="margin">3. Humane Lawes.</note> but because the Law of the Land calls them to it? not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Gods Law, nor in conscience perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any duty. Why is that horrible sinne of swearing so rise every where, and that by no small oathes, as it hath much adoe to be kept out of the mouthes of some Professouts? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lawes of the Land (at least in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) take no hold on it? Gods Law runnes so straight against it <hi>Sweare not at all,</hi> (not by little oathes, faith and troth, not in matter of truth, not by good things, not by small things:) and, <hi>The Lord will not holde him guiltlesse that taketh his name
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:26365:51"/>
in vaine:</hi> that a good heart would tremble at an oath. But generally this is no sufficient rule to bindmens tongues to their good behaviour. Why is biting usury growne to so great and ordinary a trade, that a number of trades and tradesmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve themselves into it, but because Gods Law is cast aside, and men sticke to the Law of the Land, which indeed allow it not, but supposing Vsurers to be cruell, enacts a Law against their cruelty? What is the reason that men abstaine from Adulterie in the act, but not in the eye, in the tongue, in the heart, but because they walke by mans Law? their outward man is bound by an outward Rule, but they have cast into a corner this Rule which would bind their thoughts and enter into all the corners of their hearts. And why else doe men abstaine from actuall murther, but not from murtherous speeches and thoughts, but that the law of man bindes their hands, and rules them, but the Law of God rules not their hearts? And the like might be said of a number of sinnes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had a law, forbidding any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to consecrate or set up any God which was not first approoved by the Senate. For <hi>Tiberius Cesar,</hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:26365:51"/>
say of these legall Christians, whose Religion reacheth not beyond the Scepter, Truth shall not be Truth, nor God God, unlesse it please men so to enact it, and God must be beholding to man to let his word stand as a rule.</p>
            <p>Against all which know that all humane lawes are imperfect rules, as all men be,<note place="margin">Humane lawes imperfect rules 4 reasons.</note> but our rule must be a perfect rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> they neither can discover all sinne, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the knowledge of sinne is by Gods Law; nor give rules for fulfilling of all righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are not internall, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> externall obedience: but the perfect rule must binde the soule and conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they are alterable, and abrogable, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their makers bee, and as occasions rise; but the rule must be perpetuall, and endures for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the rule must not onely rule man in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but in the state of Glorification shall serve to shew the conformity of glorified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their obedience to the perfect will of God their Creatour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some walke by the rule of crooked and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, which as so many Lords,<note place="margin">4. Crooked and corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> enact so many new lawes, but all contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and law of God; <hi>Herod</hi> will not part with his <hi>Herodias</hi>; and <hi>Ahab</hi> casts away the rule, because it is a troubler of his estate: <hi>Micaiah</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prophecies good unto him. And so is it in all such as hate to be reformed. The Vsurer hath found a trade to live by, his meanes come in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily and richly; now he weighes the matter in his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:26365:52"/>
owne ballance, and shunnes the ballance of the Sanctuary; he cares for no bands betweene God and him, so he have sure bands of the borrower. The Shop-keeper cannot live unlesse he sel wares on the Saboth day; and every man must live by his calling: Now this base covetous affection ruling the heart, the Law of God for the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Saboth must not rule and order such persons. So what harme is it (say some) to play a game or two at cards on the Saboth day? will nothing but damnation serve for such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? they like no such rule, it is too straight and strait; they must have a Lesbian leaden rule, that will yeeld a little in the laying, and not stand so straight and stiffe against their lusts. Our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Gentlewomen will say in generall that the Scripture is the rule of good life, and care not greatly if they give a little countenance to the truth: but bring this rule close unto them, and tell them that it calls them to amend their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to stoope to the simplicity of the Gospell; to leave off their strange apparell, their vaine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, their idle complements, their service of pleasure, and unfruitfull spending of their time: now they storme against the rule, and the hand that holdes it; here is a rule indeede that would make them as despised, as he is despised of them that calls them from their vanities. Our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in generall holds in judgement the Scripture as the rule, and that they ought to tie themselves to this rule; but when this rule would tie them to instant teaching, to carefull walking as examples
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:26365:52"/>
to the flocke; to prepare the people as a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin for Christ; oh, it tyes them too strait, their conceits and gifts call them to higher things, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires withdraw them; as for diligent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they leave that to the inferiour sort that have nothing else to tend, and no livings to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them.</p>
            <p>But shall the word be a rule to our judgement, and not to our practise? Shall it be a rule for us and for our rights, and shall it not be a rule for our duty and office? Let all men know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <hi>first,</hi> what a judgement of God it is to give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> up men to walk after the lusts of their own hearts as is noted of the <hi>Gentiles, Ephes.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rule chargeth us to affect all things in God and for God, nothing above him, nothing against him, nothing like him: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to feare the departure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the rule as the greatest evill, because that is onely simply evill.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some depend upon the persons of some great men whom they reverence,<note place="margin">5. Admiration of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> and holde in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. What? are not such and such, great men, and learned men, in high degrees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments? yet they doe thus and thus, they are of another judgement, and practise too, and if it were not right they would not doe it. And so they dangerously compare themselves with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, digest their oathes, vanity, pompe.</p>
            <p>But consider, <hi>first,</hi> what a plague it is for great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> men to be carried along by flatterers, who rivet them in their wickednesse by applauding them: As <hi>Dionisius</hi> the Tyrant, had flatterers about him,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:26365:53"/>
who like dogges would licke up his spittle, and commend it to him to be as sweete as Nectar. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> no example can make that good which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the rule judgeth evill. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> all persons must be tryed by the rule, not the rule by any person: Even the Apostles must be followed so farre as they goe by rule, and follow Christ, no further. This is the difference betweene the Papists and us, they receive no Doctrine, no nor the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but so farre as warranted by Fathers and Councels; we receive no Fathers nor Councels, but so farre as they are warranted by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">Rom: 3, 4</note> For, <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyer.</hi> Is this our judgement, and shall we slippe from it in our practise? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> there is no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> way to lose the truth than to walke by this rule of examples. If truth had gone by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who would not have taken part with 400 false Prophets, men in great favour with the King and Queene, all against one poore <hi>Micaiah,</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Kings enemy? yet he alone held the rule. This was the cause that puld all the <hi>Iewes</hi> into the guilt of Christs death, they admired their Rulers and Rabbies, as great and learned men, having the key of knowledge, and so easily and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to that fearfull sinne, which the Sunne was ashamed to beholde. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> in all imitation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> men we must follow the light side of the cloud, not the darke side: for why are the falls of Saints else recorded, but to shew that all examples are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> defective, and measurable by the rule. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the onely perfect example of our rule, was <hi>Iesus
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26365:53"/>
Christ,</hi> whom we must follow: we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be perfect, not as <hi>Abraham, Moses, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, &amp;c.</hi> but as our heavenly Father, whose ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute perfection shineth in his Sonne, who is the ingraven Image of his Fathers person. Now as the best picture must needes be that which is drawne from the lively face, rather than that which is drawne out of another picture; so must this which wee take from <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himselfe, who was the true idea and counterpaine of our Rule here described.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some make Successe their rule,<note place="margin">6. Successe.</note> and walke by that; as they that say, If my course were not good, God would not blesse me as he doth; and if I sinne, God would not be silent: or if I sinne, and God be silent, he either sees not, or regards not, or will spare me, and I shall ever escape rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning. Whereas, <hi>first,</hi> the rule telleth us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>These things hast thou done, and I held my peace; but I will reproove thee, and set thy sins in order before thee.</hi> And <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.2. <hi>The same event is to the good and the bad, to him that sweareth, and him that feareth an oath.</hi> Many runne to witches and sorcerers, and thinke it warrantable from the successe, they finde some reliefe and some help, and God would give no such successe if it were unlawfull. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is just with God, that such as runne to the Divell, shall meete with the Divell to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delusion. Others runne to stage-playes and enterludes, because they teach some good les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and may edifie as well as Ministers by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Oh profane mouthes, who have cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26365:54"/>
the rule, which is farre from sending them to the stewes to learne chastity, or to Atheists to learne religion; or to learne vertue and good manners in the schoole of vices, where things are expressed and acted which <hi>ought not to be named among Christians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this rule telleth us, that Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall not violate his justice, nor forbearance is no payment, hee will not beare the sword in vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> no man easily forgets his owne name; the Lord will not forget his justice, but must returne to every man according to his owne workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as thou hast thy time, so surely will God have his, when thy measure is heaped up, and thy Epha is full; although thou maist thinke with <hi>Agag,</hi> the bitternesse of death is passed, yet the Lords sword will come and hew thee in peeces.</p>
            <p>Against all these crooked and distorted rules, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Scripture shewes, <hi>first,</hi> that Christianity is no ranging course, or a running at randome, but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> life led by rule. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this rule is expresly set downe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>So farre as we are come, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by one rule. Thirdly,</hi> there is a promise to all that walk according to this rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as walk by this rule, peace shall be on them &amp; mercy, and on all the Israel of God</hi>; that is, the rule of Gods word, which is to Christians as the pillar of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> cloud and of the fire to the <hi>Israelites. Fourthly,</hi> it is evill to them that forsake this rule: As <hi>a sonne
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26365:54"/>
left unto himselfe, is the shame of his Father:</hi> So the sonnes of God running their owne wayes, and despising the counsells of God, are a shame to their Father, a reproach to their Fathers house the Church, a dishonour to their profession, and ruine to themselves.</p>
            <p>The second use is an use of instruction:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> If wee must <hi>try all things,</hi> then must we learne to get wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, rightly to apply the rule to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which is to be regulated: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring spirituall things with spirituall:</hi> for to <hi>try</hi> is nothing else but to apply the rule or touch-stone to the thing to be <hi>tryed.</hi> And when I speake of wisdome, I meane that spirituall wisdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>the spirituall man comparing spirituall things with spirituall, discerneth all things.</hi> This man led by the Spirit, acknowledgeth Christ, and followes him in all things; takes faith his companion, and sets in his eye Gods glory the end and scope of all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Can you helpe us to some directions or Rules, by which we may be guided in this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is the onely difficulty now to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Treatise?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, and these Rules are of two sorts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Generall, Preparative.</hi> 2. <hi>Speciall, Practicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generall or preparative Rules to applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are foure</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must be industrious to know and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures in their right sence of them; whether <hi>historicall</hi> and litterall, or <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall</hi> and figurative: For this is to have our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26365:55"/>
Rule at hand, and in our hand; without which it must be with us as with the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> of whom our Lord said,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.29.</note> 
               <hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> And because true Scripture is not in <hi>words</hi> and silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but in the <hi>true sence</hi> of it; wee must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to rest in the words without the true sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of them. The Papists heare our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour saying of the Sacramentall bread, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and sticking to the words, and applying them without the sense, runne into infinite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities and errours on one hand; and so the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> on the other. Against both which wee may not unfitly mention one of the two rules of <hi>Augustine</hi> in his bookes of Christian Doctrine; <hi>Si praeceptiva locutio videtur flagitium aut facinus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August de Doctr: Christ. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>aut utilitatem aut beneficentiam vetare, figurata est:</hi> It is not a proper but a figurative speech, which seemes either to injoyne a thing unlawfull, or to hinder a lawfull. So this speech of our Lord, <hi>Vnlesse ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drinke his blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 6.53.</note> 
               <hi>ye have not life in you,</hi> seemes at the first to impose on us a kinde of cruelty, therefore it is figurative: So <hi>Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we would be fit for this tryall, we must lay up and hide in our hearts such Scriptures as wee understand, that they may be neare us to serve our severall uses. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> professeth that hee had <hi>hid the word</hi> in his heart, that he might not sinne against God: And <hi>Mary</hi> was commended, that <hi>shee pondered all the sayings</hi> concerning Christ, and hid them in her heart. A Carpenter or Mason whose worke is squared or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:26365:55"/>
laid by rule, is never without his rule in his hand, or at his backe: so should it be with Christians.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must absolutely submit our judgement to the word of God without reasoning or dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though it be never so difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous unto us: for, what is else the use of a rule, but to rule? <hi>Abraham</hi> left his owne Countrey, and went he knew not whither, at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. One would thinke this were folly in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that the Scripture acquits him, and saith, he did it <hi>by faith.</hi> And in a more difficult commandement, <hi>hee rose earely,</hi> went three dayes journey to kill his onely sonne whom he loved, and reasoned no cases, but went. Good <hi>Moses</hi> would weigh the word of God in his owne ballance, fixing his eye rather upon the impotency and impossibility of the meanes, than upon the strength of Gods word which cleaves the hardest rockes: therefore he <hi>sinned in striking the Rocke,</hi> when God bade him onely speake to it, and for it was barred out of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We must ayme at an absolute conformity betweene the <hi>whole</hi> word and our <hi>whole</hi> man. This Rule takes place above all mens rules and lawes, which rule the outward man, but this the inner man; the soule and the conscience, the heart and the will, yea the affections and thoughts, which in regard of mens lawes are free: but <hi>the word captivateth every thought, and brings it into subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5. It rules the whole outward man also, our speeches and actions, even the least, our lookes and behaviours, our callings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:26365:56"/>
our sports and recreations: and as <hi>David</hi> saith of the <hi>Sunne, Psal.</hi> 19.6. <hi>there is nothing hid from the heate and discoverie of it,</hi> so nothing in man is exempted from the rule of the word. We must therefore bring our practise thereto, and thinke it not enough to be a rule in it selfe, unlesse it be a rule to us also: And lay this for a ground in our soules, that there must be a proportion betweene the rule, and the thing ruled.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the speciall rules for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Rule: And they concerne,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrines,</hi> 2. <hi>Actions and Practise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rules for the <hi>Tryall</hi> of <hi>Doctrines</hi> are sixe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.3. Keepe the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words which thou hast heard of mee.</note>First, all Doctrines must be brought to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of faith, and squared thereby: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whether wee prophecie, let us prophecie according to the analogy of faith.</hi> By <hi>analogy of faith,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle meaneth the measure of faith and Doctrine, which is indeede the holy Scripture:<note place="margin">1. All sound Doctrine must agree with the analogy of faith.</note> the heads of which Doctrine, or the summe of which faith is contained in the Creede, the Decalogue, and the Lords Prayer. If any Doctrine agree not with these, which are the key and rule of faith, it is unsound and to be rejected. As for example:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that the bread in the Sacrament is turned into the very body, flesh, blood and bone of Christ, which was borne of the Virgin: We hold the cleane contrary. Now bring this Doctrine to <hi>the analogie of faith</hi>; that teacheth, that Christ was born of the Virgin, true man, with a true humane nature like ours in all sinne
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:26365:56"/>
things, sin onely excepted, visible, circumscribed, palpable, in one place only at once, as is ours: that teacheth, that he ascended into heaven in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and there fitteth at the right hand of God untill his second comming, and therefore cannot be really and locally in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Romish Doctrine teacheth; that a man may merit by his good workes, remission of sins and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life; they establish the merit of mans workes in the matter of justification: we utterly exclude them. Bring we this Doctrine to <hi>the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith:</hi> The ten Commandements say, <hi>The Lord sheweth mercy to thousands that love him and keepe his commandements:</hi> If the reward be given by mercy,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> then not for the merit of the worke done. The Lords prayer teacheth us to pray for forgivenesse of debts; and therefore we are farre from meriting. The same prayer teacheth us to pray for every morsell of bread: Is it not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to thinke wee can merit the kingdome of heaven, if we cannot merit a morsell of bread? The Creede beleeves remission of sinnes; now the law of workes and the law of faith are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as fire and water in matter of justification, for faith leaneth onely upon Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Romish Doctrine teacheth a man to doubt of his salvation, and that no man can be assured of it without speciall revelation, it were presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: We holde the cleane contrary; A man may be assured by a speciall faith. Bring it now to the Canon. Our Creed teacheth us to beleeve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, to beleeve our selves to be true
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26365:57"/>
members of the Church, and life everlasting to belong unto us: (for else we beleeve no more than the Divells doe:) so as every one must <hi>give all diligence to make his election sure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. and <hi>to know that Christ is in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. This is the first Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ioyneth the two Tables together.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> all sound Doctrine tyeth the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles together: for as the two Tables stand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation one to the other; so that Doctrine must needes be unsound, which combineth not justice with piety, and with faith, charity. This Rule is taken out of <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.5. If a man have wronged his neighbour, either by open robbery, or secret defrauding of him, hee must come and <hi>offer to the Lord for his trespasse,</hi> and he shall be forgiven; but on this condition, that he bring the whole summe which he hath defrauded, and adde a fifth part more unto it, and restore it to the owner the same day that he offereth for his trespasse. According unto which our Saviour wisheth to <hi>leave the gift at the Altar, and goe and be first reconciled to our brother, Matth.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The Lord rejects all sacrifices abstract from mercy, Esay</hi> 1.12. <hi>What have I to doe with the multitude of your sacrifices, while your hands are full of blood?</hi> and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>Will ye steale, and murder, and commit adultery, and yet come and stand before me in this house wherein my name is called upon?</hi> And our Saviour reprooveth the grosse conceit of the <hi>Pharisies,</hi> who taught the people, that if they did give oblations to the Church, though they releeved not their poore parents, yet God was well pleased with them: This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:26365:57"/>
tryed by this touch-stone, was found coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.5.</p>
            <p>Hence we inferre, if any Doctrine be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to men, it is false and unsound: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <hi>First,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaineth a Monkish life, wherein their cloystred persons must leave the societies of men, and sequester themselves from all companie to give themselves to fasting and prayer. Bring this Doctrine to this tryall, and we shall finde it most unsound; because God is served not onely in the duties of the first Table, but also of the second; and this kinde of life is against the light of nature, and the good of all societies, both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and family; all which claime part in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man: and is a thrusting of men out of their callings, in which they are commanded to abide, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Luther de votis Monasticis</hi> prooveth, It is against the whole first Table; As placeing confidence in it: As setting up a will-worship: As taking Gods name in vaine by an unlawfull vowe, &amp;c. So against the whole second Table: 1. Impeaching the honour of parents, and exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves from civill authority, so against the fifth Commandement. 2. They eate not their owne bread, against the sixth Commandement. 3. They raise <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> from their ashes, against the seventh Commandement. 4. They live in idlenesse, and are unprofitable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the earth, contrary to the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. 4. They beare false witnesse of the merit of single life, against chastity and holy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:26365:58"/>
wedlocke, contrary to the ninth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 6. They teach, that burning is no sinne, as <hi>Pigius:</hi> But a condition under which <hi>divina bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas et sapientia,</hi> that is, Gods goodnesse and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath put us, as under hunger and thirst: cleane contrary to the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. who saith, <hi>It is better to marry than to burne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In cases of trespasse, the same Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points auricular confession, and canonicall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in which they must give oblations, and satisfie the Church: But if it were sound Doctrine, it would appoint reconciliation and restitution to the parties wronged; which is the least part of their thoughts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The same Church appoints a great number of fasts and penances for offences: But so long as they <hi>fast to strife and debate, and smite with the fist of wickednesse,</hi> anathematizing and cursing Prince and people, excommunicating all such as walke not in their rules; yea patronizing and pardoning cut-throat villaines sent from them to murder Christian Kings, and blow up Parliament hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; all the world sees these are not the fasts which God hath chosen. This Rule condemnes all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitisme which is the rebells Catechisme; But we must distinguish Popish Sinonimaes: between excommunicating out of Churches, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating out of Kingdomes: betweene keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and keyes of the kingdomes of the earth: betweene absolving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from sinnes, and absolving of subjects from duties: betweene fishing of men, and fishing for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:26365:58"/>
kingdomes: betweene teaching of soules, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bodies: betweene power directive, and power coactive: betweene ministration, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: betweene the sword spirituall, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. This Iesuiticall confusion of phrases hath beene the confusion of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The same Church hath a long time challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a power of the keyes, of binding and loosing, over all other persons, but wickedly changed the Ecclesiasticall power, into a meere Civill power, to the great mischiefe of the world: for thereby they doe unjustly and tyrannically take upon them to depose Kings and Queenes from their regency, to deprive them of their Crownes and Scepters, to free subjects from all oathes of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and binde them to become their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners where ever they can take them at advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And all this by the power of the keyes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The same Church hath ratified by decree, that the vowes of children undertaking their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious orders shall be in force; and, that close and clandestine marriages made betweene children, without all consent of wise and carefull parents, are allowable and indissoluble. Which Doctrine,<note place="margin">

               </note> brought to this Rule, is proved most prejudiciall to the power of parents given them in the fifth Commandement, which injoynes children to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Parents,</hi> especially in matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such as are their marriage and choyce of their callings.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some Divines have undertaken the defence of some kinde of usurie, especially to the rich, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:26365:59"/>
so have animated some in that course. But this Doctrine brought to this <hi>tryall</hi> will not holde, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is such a consumer of mens estates, and so uncharitable, as the Lord would not admit of it in <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> but among his enemies whom he would have quite consumed. Besides, men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their distinction: for God in the case of usurie distinguisheth not betweene the rich and poore of <hi>Israel,</hi> but betweene the <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> betweene strangers and brethren. The poore indeede are mentioned, but onely thus: 1. Because they have most neede to borrow. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are most liable to wrong and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. 3. The commandement of Loane is made especially for their good. 4. Vsurie on them is a more grievous sinne and crying, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Object.</hi> But if it were unlawfull, God would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it to the stranger. <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The morall Law forbids it to all. 2. It is by God dispensed with by a Iudiciall, for the hardnesse of the hearts of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for the unjustice of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who exacted it on the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and for the overthrow of the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> The word is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.20. not <hi>Lemicro</hi> but <hi>Lamicro, extranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> were destroyed, all usury was afterward ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely forbidden: <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.8. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome on Lev.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">

               </note> In the Law usurie is forbidden onely to brethren, but in the Prophets to all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely: and in the Gospell much more, because
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:26365:59"/>
all are now brethren. So much for the second Rule.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in all doubtfull Doctrines,<note place="margin">3. That is the true Doctrine which giveth most glory to God.</note> that is the truth which gives most glory to God, and least unto any creature: for as God in all things intends his owne glory most, (which is the maine end of all his courses) so doth his word, which after a speciall manner resembleth himselfe. This word so propoundeth all the frame of mans salvation from the lowest staire to the highest, as God may have his glory in all: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29.31. <hi>That he that glorieth might glory in the Lord:</hi> and that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That no flesh might glory in his presence.</hi> To apply this to particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaines a Doctrine, that Saints departed are to be invocated, as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours (though not of redemption, yet) of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. Wee affirme the contrary according to the Scripture. Bring now this point to this <hi>tryall,</hi> whether gives more glory to God, and lesse to the creature; we, who affirme him to be a <hi>God hearing prayer,</hi> who onely <hi>knowes the hearts of the sonnes of men,</hi> and is omnipresent to heare, and omnipotent to helpe, (all which are incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attributes of the Deity:) or they which against the Scripture robbe God of this part of his honour, and bestow it on creatures which are not capable of it? <hi>Isay</hi> 63.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The same Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:26365:60"/>
the justifying of a sinner before God is required not onely an imputed righteousnesse, but an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall righteousnesse, which are workes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which makes a man of just more just. Wee in this Doctrine of Iustification utterly exclude humane merit. Now bring this different Doctrine to this Rule: Whether gives more to God, and lesse to the creature; that Doctrine of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith onely, which utterly takes from man all that hee can thinke of to justifie himselfe withall, and ascribes the whole worke of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from first to last unto God: or that Doctrine which puffes up man in conceit of some righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in himselfe, and takes from the Lord this honour to be <hi>Hee that justifies the ungodly?</hi> And this is the Rule, to which the Apostle brings the same Doctrine to be tryed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27, 28. <hi>By what Law is boasting excluded?

In our whole courses let one Preacher come and call men to a diligent study of the word, or to a strict observing of the whole Saboth, let him seeke to pull out of mens mouthes their owne words, out of their hands their cards, or cuppes, and injoyne them a constant sanctification of the Lords rest; let him call them to the often recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, and strict preparation to it: let him call them to circumspection against the least sinne, to zeale and profession in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: oh what a tedious and irksome Doctrine is all this! Now farewell liberty, sports, and all good company; what a precise fellow have wee gotten to make fooles of us, &amp;c! Let another Preacher (as some such there be) come and tell us, A man may doe well enough without so much preaching, and what should private men meddle so much with the Scripture? That to spend the Saboth so religiously and strictly, is Iewish, and not so necessary: That men may take some liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to play and recreate themselves on the Saboth day: That it is not good to be overforward in religion, for that were to smell of purity, and be too strict, yea <hi>wise overmuch:</hi> That Ministers may doe well, and winne their people by being good companions: That men be men, not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor God so strict in so small matters: Here's a man indeede that winnes the spurres, hee carries Townes and Countries after him: Here is a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher <hi>for our people,</hi> as was once said of the <hi>Prophet that prophecies of wine and strong drinke.</hi>

            <p>The sixth and last Rule for <hi>tryall</hi> of Doctrines,<note place="margin">6 That is the soundest Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that most soundly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed consciences</note> is this: That Doctrine which most soundly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth distressed consciences, is the soundest, and to be embraced. For the end of all Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. is, <hi>That we through patience and comfort might have hope:</hi> and the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8. saith, <hi>The testimonies of God rejoyce the heart.</hi> The reason why God hath given learned tongues, is, to <hi>speake words of comfort to the weary:</hi> And most excellent is that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16.<note place="margin">Isay 50 4</note> 
               <hi>Peace shall be to him that walkes by this rule, and mercy, and upon the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God.</hi> The Gospell is a word of peace, and glad tidings of salvation. And therefore that Doctrine which brings the most welcome mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to a distressed conscience, is the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, most agreeable to the Gospell. To make some application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We teach, that a man may be certaine of his salvation in this life by an ordinary and speciall faith; because faith assureth the soule of pardon of sinne, and present favour of God, and brings in comfort, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. Iesus seeing their faith, said, <hi>Sonne, be of good comfort, thy sinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee:</hi> it brings <hi>peace, and boldnesse with God, Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. it brings in <hi>joy of faith unspeakable and glorious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. But the Papists, and some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26365:65"/>
our selves hold there can be no such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of salvation, but conjecturall and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deceitfull. Bring this Doctrine to this Rule: A poore soule afflicted in conscience, sees nothing but Gods wrath, and hell ready to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, hee is afraid of damnation which hee knowes he hath deserved: whether hath more comfort, for a Papist to tell him of the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love of God, here is an emplaster and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but you must not be so presumptuous as to apply it; all this increaseth the torment: or for him that brings the emplaster, to say, here is the unspeakable love of God, the unsearchable grace and merit of Christ, here take and apply it, holde the comfortable possession of Christ, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteth and entitleth you into the unchangeable love of God? Here the heart rests not in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster, but in the application of it: Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is like an emplaster to a broken bone, but kept in the pocket.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What uncomfortable Doctrine is it, that they teach us to seeke life in the Law, which is to seeke life in death, <hi>because of our weaknesse? Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there were a Law that could have given life, righteousnesse should have beene by the Law, Rom.</hi> 8.3. The Sonne of God supplyed <hi>what was impossible to the Law by the infirmity of our flesh.</hi> What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Doctrine then is it, that wee must place our hope in our owne righteousnesse, and that the Gospell is nothing else but a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law than <hi>Moses</hi> was? Surely if we ground our joy in our selves, it shall be like that of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:26365:65"/>
dancing before the Calfe of their owne making, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.16. as short and unsound.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What an uncomfortable Doctrine is that of falling away from grace, and out of Gods favour? What comfort can I have of my faith and hope, if of a true childe of God to day, I may become a childe of the Divell, and be cast into hell to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? What <hi>glorious and unspeakable joy can there be in such a perswasion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> but rather a desperate feare of finall rejection? No, it is the continuance of our joy that makes it so unspeakable: and this is the sure anchor of our hope, that Gods love is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,<note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> and he <hi>preserves us by his power to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> saying as <hi>Isaac, He is blessed, and hee shall be blessed, Gen.</hi> 27.33. and as <hi>Pilate</hi> in Christs super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>What I have written, I have written, Iohn</hi> 19.22. His Decrees are as the <hi>Lawes of the Medes and Persians which cannot be altered, Dan.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Whom he once loves he loves to the end, Ioh.</hi> 13.1. and also upholds them to love him to the end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What an uncomfortable Doctrine is it to a wounded soule, that he must come upon paine of damnation once in a yeere, and confesse all his sinnes to a Priest, against whom hee hath not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? hee must confesse a debt to him to whom he owes nothing, and to him who cannot remit it? Which is so farre from being an ease to a wounded conscience, as that it is indeede a very racke and gibbet to it. For, how can he confesse all his sinnes, which himselfe cannot <hi>understand?</hi> Certainly if <hi>no man can number his sinnes,</hi> no man can confesse them. <hi>David</hi> confessed to God,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.12.</note> and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:26365:66"/>
obtained remission, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.5. The Prodigall went from his father, and returned to his father, and confessed, and was received againe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. How full of uncomfortablenesse is their Doctrine concerning the Word and Sacraments, the speciall meanes ordeined for our strength and comfort? For the Word: <hi>If thy word</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) had not beene my comfort I had perished in my trouble.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 129, 92.</note> But Popish Doctrine takes away the word from the people, which is wisdome to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, sight to the blinde, light to them that are in darknesse, and life to the dead. What a dismall thing is it for a souldier to be sent to the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a multitude of powerfull and deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but first bereave him of all his weapons?</p>
            <p>For the Sacraments: If their Doctrine be true, that the efficacy of the Sacrament depends on the intention of the Priest, who can know when it is effectuall but himselfe? What man knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he receive the Sacrament, or no, or whether the Sacrament doe him any good, seeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the Priests intention?</p>
            <p>So much for the application of Rules unto Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>Now to the Rules applyable unto practise.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> Rule respecteth God, three wayes: 1. from his word, 2. in his presence, 3. for his glory.<note place="margin">All actions must be done, 1. By vertue of a word.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. For the word of God wee must labour to bring to every one of our actions, 1. A <hi>precept</hi> or commandement, calling for obedience: <hi>What
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:26365:66"/>
I command, that doe onely:</hi> else will be said, <hi>Who required these things at your hands? Isay</hi> 1.12. 2. A <hi>promise</hi> confirming us in our obedience; for, as the former gives us a calling and leave, so this gives successe. If thou beest in Gods worke, thou art under his protection, and maist boldly pray for a blessing promised. 3. A <hi>threatning,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine disobedience, if thou beest either negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in well-doing, or doing that thou shouldest not. For all these, see one instance, <hi>Genes.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Noah</hi> in making the Arke, 1. had a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Make an Arke:</hi> 2. A promise, <hi>Enter into it, and be safe:</hi> 3. A threat, <hi>All that enter not shall be drowned.</hi> God is the first mover in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and he must be the first mover in all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As every action must be undertaken by his word, so also it must be done in his presence:<note place="margin">2 In Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> 
               <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch walked with God, Gen.</hi> 5.22. <hi>David set the Lord alwayes before him, Psal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Moses</hi> by faith <hi>saw him that is invincible, Hebr.</hi> 11.27. This will feare us from sinne, as the Iudges eye curbes a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour; and quicken us in good duties, because our Masters eye is still upon us: and comfort us in troubles for well-doing, because our Master is with us to save us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As by his word and his sight,<note place="margin">3. For Gods glory. 1 Cor. 10, 30</note> so must I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake every thing even the smallest, for his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: Whether I eate, or drinke, or whatsoever I doe, I must therein make my selfe serviceable for his glory. This caveat will hinder all things, which would any way dishonour God. <hi>Moses</hi> will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:26365:67"/>
not leave an hoofe behinde him at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, because hee lookes at Gods glory. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> for Gods glory seemed to neglect his owne safety and life, chap. 6.11. <hi>Should such a man as I fly? Who being as I would goe into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to live? I will not goe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> Rule respecteth the action it selfe to be done: and this both for substance and for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every action for the substance of it must beseeme the Gospell: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Onely let your conversation be such as beseemeth the Gospell of Christ:</hi> our actions must not onely be squared to the rule of the Law, but to the profession of the Gospell. This rule is of large extent, and appliable to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action: and a man should say thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, VVhat? is this action honourable to my profession? is it a peece of my generall calling of a Christian? The Gospell is an holy Gospell, and I professing it must <hi>passe all my time in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of holy conversation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15.17. Doth this action savour of holinesse? The Gospell is from heaven, and heavenly, and my <hi>conversation,</hi> if I professe it, must be <hi>in heaven, Col.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Doth this action relish of heavenly-mindednesse, and of a conversation without covetousnesse? To joyne practise with profession, beseemes the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: otherwise, to speake well of religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worke of it, is as if an hungry man should speake of meate when hee hath nothing to eate. Liberall sciences are for contemplation, Divinity and Christianity for practise. We must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:26365:67"/>
our selves to see our duties in our places, as we see Citties in a Mappe which we were never acquainted with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every action must be done well,<note place="margin">Every action must be done in due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</note> in due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: for in things, which in themselves are not sinnes, much sinne lyeth in the undue and unfit circumstances of them. See an instance: Is it not lawfull for a King to number his people, both in respect of tributes, and levying of armies, to impose on them oathes, and services of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? Yes:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>David</hi> sinned in numbring the people, how</note> But circumstances made this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and sinfull in <hi>David.</hi> 1. Because he did it in pride, to know his power and strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause. 2. Because it was in fleshly confidence, on the multitude of his armie. 3. Because it was in idle curiousity, hee would know that which God would not have knowne, who had promised they should be innumerable. 4. Because he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that word and commandement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12, 13. That when the people were numbred, <hi>every one should pay halfe a shekel lest they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:</hi> and so many wayes sinned.</p>
            <p>Againe, is it not lawfull for a parent to bewaile the death of his Sonne, especially if violent and untimely, who seemes to be taken away in his sinne, without any testimony of repentance? Yes: But some circumstances made it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable for <hi>David</hi> to testifie so great sorrow for <hi>Absoloms</hi> death, as <hi>Ioab</hi> wisely signifies, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.5. for although he had just cause to mourne for <hi>Absolom,</hi> because himselfe had beene indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and wanting in his education: and besides,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26365:68"/>
though he knew by <hi>Nathans</hi> Ministry, that his sins had brought him into this strait, wherin he could hardly tel whether to overcome or be overcome was more miserable; yet by exceeding in sorrow at that time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Davids</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> culpable, 4 reasons.</note> 1. hee seemed not to be so thankfull unto God as he should for victory against sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons. 2. He preferred a private affection before the publike safety. 3. He shewed unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to the army, by whose power and perill himselfe and his kingdome was in safety, he sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the faces of his servants which saved his life. 4. He thought not of the danger of sudden insurrection and present rebellion, which <hi>Ioab</hi> well perceived, verse 7. So as it was lawfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately to mourne, but not with such excesse and testimony as was joyned with offence of his people, with neglect of his owne danger, and with the hazard of publike peace.</p>
            <p>But let us now see <hi>David</hi> who had failed in not observing circumstances, notably graceing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe againe in such accurate observance of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as made him refuse a very lawfull action when the circumstance so required. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17. Being marvelous desirous to drinke of the water of the well of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> three mighty men brake into the host of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and drew water, and brought it to <hi>David</hi> to drinke. <hi>David</hi> now had power and neede to drinke it,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Dauid</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to drinke the water of <hi>Bethelhem,</hi> 3 reasons.</note> but would not, but powred it out upon the ground before the Lord. 1. Because he would testifie his thankfulnesse to God, who had both given him such men, and also preserved them. Hee is not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26365:68"/>
proud of them, neither ascribes the happy event to their power or fortitude, but to God. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (in great wisdome) hee would not have his subjects rashly to thrust themselves into such dangers. He feedes not their rash confidence, but wills them (in effect) to be diligent in avoiding of danger. 3. He would not satisfie his owne desire by the extreame perill of his subjects, but if they by such an hazard overcome their enemies, hee will overcome himselfe, he will shew how deare his subjects lives are unto him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Rule respecteth the Agent:<note place="margin">Every action must be done by a due agent</note> in whom three things are requisite. 1. Hee must be a good man, a good tree, else there will be no good fruit. 2. The person must be pleasing in this particular action: and that is, when it is done by faith: for <hi>whatsoever is not of faith, is sinne, Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> Let the action be never so indifferent, never so small, yea never so good, if I doe it with an erroneous or doubtfull conscience, it is sinne to me. 3. Hee must in doing any thing containe himselfe within his speciall calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Let every man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in that calling to which hee is called.</hi> For many things are wel done, out of duty and office, which same things are sinfull, done without just war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and calling. Let a thing be never so just, if it be done out of a mans way, it loseth the beauty and justice. <hi>Absolom</hi> had justly deserved death, but <hi>Ioab</hi> slew him unjustly, because hee was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>David</hi> to spare him. Now <hi>David</hi> had the power over his life, so had not <hi>Ioab. Elijah</hi> calls for fire from heaven against his enemies, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:26365:69"/>
justly, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.10.12. But if the Apostles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54. they shall justly be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; because even the best examples are not to be followed without divine vocation or calling.<note place="margin">How <hi>Elias</hi> did well in calling for fire from heaven, and not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stles. Two Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> For the difference betweene these holy men lay in the matter of their calling. <hi>Elijah</hi> knew what spirit he was off, being stirred up by Propheticall instinct, and was certaine of Gods will: but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Disciples <hi>knew not what spirit they were of,</hi> being stirred by an humane spirit lusting after revenge,<note place="margin">Luke 9, 45.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> against the will of God. Besides, <hi>Elijah</hi> had a singular spirit, and speciall vocation to revenge on Gods enemies: But the office of Christ and his Apostles, was, to save sinners, and bring them to repentance.</p>
            <p>To preach the word is <hi>a worthy worke,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. but for a shoo-maker or an artizan to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, is base and unworthy. To baptise the childe of the beleeving parent is most necessary and fit: but for a woman, or a midwife, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person is neither necessary nor lawfull.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Rule concerneth our brother, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom in all things we must expresse two vertues.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Charity and brotherly love.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Care of his edification.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Rule of charity is in that precept, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22, 39.</note> Then looke what I would not (out of sound judgement) have him doe to me,<note place="margin">To love our neighbour as our selves, how.</note> I must not doe to him: not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him what I would not have offered to my selfe. The meaning of the Rule is, that I must embrace every man with the same kinde of love
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26365:223"/>
wherewith I love my selfe, although I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bound to the same degree. For suppose that I be in danger with another friend, I can save one of us two, and but one, here I must save my selfe, and not him. <hi>Object.</hi> But wee desire in this case, that the other should save us, and not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and therefore doing as wee would be done unto, wee should save him, and not our selves. <hi>Answ.</hi> That which we justly desire to be done to us we must doe to others: but this is an unjust desire in this comparison: for God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned degrees of men for degrees of love; first our selves, then the houshold of faith, first our owne families, and then others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> had baked a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle floure for her selfe, and she bestowed it on <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> when it would not serve them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. She certainely knew the meale should serve both her selfe and her sonne, and also the Prophet, partly by divine instinct, and partly by <hi>Elijahs</hi> words. 2. She had experience by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that the oyle and floure wasted not, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, as <hi>Elijah</hi> had spoken, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.16.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In doing any action in the sight of others, I must have care that I be so farre from scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, that I must edifie my brother. For suppose a thing be in it selfe indifferent, or lawfull; yet if I cannot doe it but I must offend him, I must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>I will never eate flesh while I live, before I will offend my brother.</hi> And, <hi>Let all things be done to edification, Rom.</hi> 14.21.</p>
            <p>But this Rule must be understood with these
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:26365:224"/>
cautions: 1. It must be a <hi>weake</hi> brother: 2. to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare indifferent things, not necessary duties: 3. forbeare onely for a time, till he may be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted if he will: 4. in such indifferent things as the life stands not in; our forbearance may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire our life or health, for then it loseth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
            <p>If now we shall apply many of our actions to these and the like Rules, we should see the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of them, which yet we esteeme straight enough. See it in some instances.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Men in losses and extraordinary crosses seeke out (as they say) and commonly and boldly runne to the witch or cunning man, and the losing witch is thought a publike good, or commodity to the whole Country where he is. But lay this action to these Rules or any of them. 1. Gods word prohibiteth and threatneth it. 2. For Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: thou hast runne from God to the Divell, and renounced God by depending on Satan for helpe. 3. For Gods glory: thou couldst not more dishonour him than by so doing. 4. For the meanes: thou hast renounced lawfull meanes, sanctified by God, and hast used such as for all worldly gaine should not have beene used. 5. Doth it beseeme the Gospell, or a beleever, to runne in post hast to Satan? Is it because <hi>there is no God in Israel?</hi> Did <hi>Saul</hi> ever doe so till God was gone from him? 6. For thy selfe the Agent: thou art a plaine infidell, yea worse than an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell; there being no cure but by faith in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell: thou hast runne out of thy calling, hast cast
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:26365:224"/>
off the yoake of God, and by the hand and helpe of the Divell hast avoided the hand of God for the present; to the scandall of thy brethren, and the wounding of thine owne soule.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Many addict themselves to many sports and recreations on the Saboth day: <hi>Oh the Saboth was made for man, and not man for the Saboth, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 2, 27.</note> But bring this to the forenamed Rules: 1. Where hath God commanded it? Sure we are hee hath commanded the sanctification of the Saboth day, which is the whole and parts: Is this to sanctifie a day to the Lord? 2. Whether maketh more for Gods glory, in whose sight we are, Saboth-dayes duties, or recreations? whether dare wee pray rather for blessing and successe upon? in which have we more comfort, and would have God to finde us in? 3. Whether beseemes a Christian better, who is commanded to cease from his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling and lawfull vocation, because they destroy the Saboths rest, and much more sports and play lesse necessary? whether is recreation for rest, or labour? Whence wee conclude, that howsoever on the Saboth wee may and must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yet our rejoycing must be that of the <hi>Iewes, Nehem.</hi> 8.12. that they <hi>understood the Law,</hi> namely in things spirituall and holy.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Others worke, and thinke they may, in their callings, in the morning and evening of the Saboth: as some of our tradesmen and shop-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Bring this common practise to this Rule. 1. Gods word is expresse, <hi>Thou shalt doe no manner of worke, Ier.</hi> 17.21. 2. Hast thou God in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:26365:225"/>
he rested from <hi>all</hi> his worke. 3. Doth it beseeme that profession which is heavenly? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it of heavenly contemplation, or base earthlinesse? 4. Art not thou runne out of thy way, seeing thy calling on the Saboth, is, wholly to cease from thy calling, and doe no worke but workes of mercy, and such as serve to preserve the Ministery and Gods worship. 5. Is not the example as wicked as the action, and the hurt to others more than the advantage to thy selfe? 6. The Psalme for the Saboth directly meetes with this objection, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.1. <hi>It is a good thing to praise the Lord in the morning, and to declare thy truth in the evening and in the night season.</hi> 7. <hi>If a man plow and thresh on the Saboth day, hee is counted a profaner of it, an Atheist, and so he is:</hi> and why not hee also that labours at the racke, or in the mill, or the boate? Alasse the profanesse of our dayes, that he that is drunke, diceth, cardeth, or sweares on the Saboth is counted honest and religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and those that passe their Saboth worse than beasts (which though they can do nothing to sanctifie their rest, yet doe they nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it) are applauded, whilest conscionable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of it are scorned.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> For resorting to stage-playes, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of places of idle resort and unlawfull games: which, would men bring to the Rule, they should not be so frequented as they be. 1. Gods word is,<note place="margin">Eph. 5, 3.</note> that such <hi>filthinesse ought not to be named</hi> among Christians, much lesse acted: and that we ought to <hi>passe away all our time in feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:26365:225"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. 2. God is there present to take <hi>account of every idle word:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2, 36.</note> and there is the passing of nothing but idle and hurtfull words, against God and man; and an holding of mens eares to them many houres together. 3. Wouldest thou willingly he should take thee at a play, or at cards or dice, when hee comes to judgement? 4. For one speciall circumstance; Are not men there in <hi>womens apparell,</hi> contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.5. 5. For thy selfe, thou art neither in thy generall nor in thy speciall calling, and therefore art out of the way of Gods protection. 6. For thy brethren: as thou maintainest the Players, or gaming hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or alleyes in an unlawfull calling, so thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendest others by thy example; especially if thou beest a Master or Magistrate that abettest such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and unlawfull courses, thou sinnest by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, against duty, and decorum. Oh let un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts so spend their time, and not thou who shouldest punish and represse them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> The last instance concerneth our fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selves in our apparell and behaviours, both to the strange fashions of other countries, or the fantasticall fashion of our owne. 1. Gods word is, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.8. <hi>I will visite the Princes and the Kings children, and all such as are clothed with strang apparell.</hi> How hath God visited the late strange fashion and coulor of <hi>yellow ruffes,</hi> both in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viser and first wearers; on which God hath cast speciall reproach, that in scorne not only chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-sweepers, but hang-men in their office taken it up: which yet some will not be warned by?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:26365:226"/>
2. Whether doth thy conscience tell thee, that thou art assured,<note place="margin">

And whether darest thou say, thou glorifiest God by them? Art thou sure thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is neither erronious nor doubtfull? 3. For the circumstances: hast thou an eye to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne thy profession, with thy body? Or doth it beseeme the profession of holinesse, to runne through all lightfashions?

               <p>For the former: It is not enough lightly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our courses, no nor yet so judicially as to finde out the truth, if we goe no further: as many who please themselves, and feede their eyes with reading, and their mindes with meere speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but cleave to no sound opinion, but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and unsettled in all their wayes.

               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:26365:69"/>For the latter, we must <hi>try every thing,</hi> but not <hi>lay hold</hi> on every thing, and not catch whatsoever comes next to hand, as many are ready to <hi>keepe</hi> and <hi>holde,</hi> but it is chaffe in stead of good corne, and drosse in stead of golde: as many curious and dainty hearers, who are as men having ill sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, which cast up wholsome and strong meate, and <hi>hold</hi> nothing but fruite and trash, which feede and increase the humours there already: So wholsome and savoury Doctrine is rejected, and a few fine sentences, savouring of wit or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, fetched any where but from the Scriptures, are held, and nothing else in comparison: Which is with the Prodigall Sonne to feede upon huskes in stead of the bread of his fathers house.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Theeves and robbers will meddle with no beggars, but where they have hope of a booty: Satan and his agents lye most in ambush against such as embrace the truth, and follow the thing that good is; there is the treasure of truth, the wealth of grace, and a booty which Satan would faine finger: He makes many on-sets to this purpose; and if we keepe not our ground, (here called the <hi>keeping of good</hi>) hee pulls us from our <hi>hold,</hi> and easily surprizeth and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to the contrary evill. We had neede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so much the more watchfully to <hi>hold that which is good,</hi> as our adversaries are watchfull to robbe us of all our goods.</p>
               <p>And, were it not that wee had such enemies without us, our inward and bosome companion, our owne corrupt nature is ever soliciting us, and drawing us aside; for were we of our selves incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to <hi>hold good things,</hi> the Apostle might have spared a number of the like precepts to this: But

It is the evidence of thy salvation, and of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints: How carefully doe men keepe their Evidences, &amp; lock them up safe in the surest chests they have, because if they lose their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, they may easily lose their lands? So lose thou thy part of the word, thou losest thy part of heaven. Shall men be wise to keepe their Deedes and conveyances of lands and leases so safe as no man shall cousen or cheate them of them, and whatsoever casualty comes, these shall be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for; and can it be wise or safe for any to bee carelesse in keeping the word, his evidence for heaven, without which he hath no tenure, nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance (out of his idle conceit) to one foote in heaven? 2. Wholsome Doctrine is the staffe and

support of a man in the way to heaven: A lame man, if he hold not his staffe, falls downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and if the word directs us not in our duty, and supports us in temptation, wee fall quite away. 3. The sound doctrine and truth of Gods word is a notable preservative in dangers, so farre as it is held unto. A man in perill of drowning will catch and lay fast hold on any meanes of safety, and will lose his hand before hee will lose his hold: Every Christian is in this world as on a dangerous sea; the Church is the shippe, in which is salvation, represented by the Arke; the <hi>anchor</hi> is <hi>faith, Heb.</hi> 6.9. the mast is the crosse of Christ; the prosperous winde is the Spirit of God; adverse windes tossing and tumbling the Church, are persecutions, tryalls, temptations, afflictions; the fraught, graces, good conscience, hope, love, and the like; and the haven is heaven.

to be the <hi>Pillar and keeper of truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. for there in the Church fundamentall truth fitteth as on a rocky foundation: And every good man is a part of that good ground, described <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15. who with honest and good hearts heare the word of God and <hi>keepe it.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. No man but desires comfort when he most needeth it, especially in the houre of death:<note place="margin">4</note> Now there is no surer way to provide and lay up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for these seasons, than by carefull keeping the truth.

               <p n="5">5. It is not enough for a man that expects fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture salvation, to heare,<note place="margin">5</note> know or professe the truth, unlesse he <hi>abide and continue in it.</hi> Hence saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Whereby yee are saved, if ye keepe what I have preached unto you.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tyeth blessednesse not to those that <hi>heare the word of God,</hi> but to <hi>them that keepe it, Luke</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>This serves to confute the Schoolemen, who have turned all Divinity into questions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> even the Articles of religion and fundamentall points are turned into <hi>Vtrums,</hi> and a questionary Divinity, from which no edification, no proficiency in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be expected. These be most of them <hi>vaine bablings, and oppositions of science falsly so called,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. As vaine as if a man should dispute whether the Sunne be risen at noone: And yet in Popish Schooles and Churches he is not thought
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:26365:72"/>
a teacher of any worth, who is not a <hi>Quodlibetary,</hi> and prepared to dispute <hi>pro et con</hi> of the least <hi>apex</hi> or <hi>iota</hi> in Divinity: So as nothing can be so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or grounded but they must call it into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and boldly dispute and propound opposite reasons: which is farre from this precept of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is good.</hi> A farre safer way they might learne of the Turkes, who suffer not a word of their <hi>Alcaron</hi> to be called in question under paine of death.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this reprooves many of our ordinary hearers, who are farre to seeke in this precept. 1. Some come and heare much good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine, but <hi>hold</hi> little or none of it, but are like the tunnell that takes in the liquor at one end, to let it out at the other; so many take in the word with one eare, and let it out at the other: yea some that seeme to take some content and delight in the word while they heare, keepe as little as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whom wee cannot compare fitlier than to the sive in the water, so long as it stayes there it is full of water, but take it out it keepes never a drop; so many longer than the Church holdes them, they hold nothing for an after-use. For how comes it to passe that many men are so gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of many principles of religion (some not knowing at 60 yeares of age whether Christ was a man or no) wherein they have beene often instructed, but because they thinke it enough to heare, and not to keepe? How have many lost many worthy things in which they have beene greatly strengthened and comforted, but because
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:26365:72"/>
they made no conscience to keepe what they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have? 2. Some can heare and seeme to keepe something, if they can carpe or catch any thing, either to feede their owne corruption, or to heape their displeasure upon the head of their teacher. <hi>Ahab</hi> could remember that <hi>Micaiah</hi> never prophecyed good unto him. Oh such a man spake many yeares agoe against our government, he tolde us of our trades, buying and selling, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of rackes and vatts on the Saboth day; hee was busie with our fashions and habits, our games and recreations; hee speakes inconsideratly and uncharitably: And a great deale such they can holde and mutter some foure or five yeares after, as if they were spoken but yesterday. But aske such men, what was the text of the last Sermon you heard but two dayes agoe? you put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a study, and after a long pause and rubbing their memory, they will perhaps tell you they doe not remember. These men are like the boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poke, which lets out the finest flowre, and if there be any bran or huskes, will be sure to keepe it: And most opposite to our rule, because they catch and hold not that which is good, but that which is worst and most hurtfull. The proud man will hold his fashions, and the foole his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though you bray him in a morter, and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious his errour, if it will adde but one cubit to his height and state in this world. 3. There is a kinde of Academicall and Skepticall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who notwithstanding all their hearing are unstaid and unsettled in their judgements and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:26365:73"/>
courses, such as holde all things in suspence and question, that they may admit of any thing that may make for their profit or preferment: who walke not certainely in wisdomes way, for that doth <hi>try all things,</hi> and <hi>keepes that which is good:</hi> and how can he hold any good thing that holds not the rule of good, which is the word?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rules of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good. 1 Vpon tryall.</note>The first is in the Text: <hi>Hold</hi> Doctrine after examination, when we have tryed it to be good and sound, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and art perswaded thereof:</hi> for the very keeping of good is not acceptable, except it be out of faith and sound judgement. The Pharisies thought they did God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice not onely in their devotions, but in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges and murders of the Saints, but all our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice must be reasonable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Rule, <hi>Hold onely the good:</hi> for the extent of keeping reacheth onely to good,<note place="margin">2 Hold onely good.</note> because many keepe some good, but some evill also with it. The <hi>Iewes</hi> will worship God in the Temple, but keepe their high places and altars too. Papists will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Christ, but not part with <hi>Moses,</hi> they will worship God and Christ, but Idolls too. Many Protestants will serve Christ and Mammon too;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:26365:73"/>
would walke in the Spirit, and in the flesh both at once; and thinke themselves excused, because they hold some good, although mixed with some evill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Rule. <hi>Hold all</hi> that is good:<note place="margin">3. Hold all that is good.</note> Some will not sweare or curse often and ordinarily, but sometimes; nor by great oathes, but ordinarily by smaller: but the rule is, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> Some will sanctifie some part of the Lords day, but if they hold all good, they must sanctifie the whole day as the Lord did. Magistrates will hold some good, and looke to civill peace and justice; but if they did hold all good, they would looke as carefully to duties of the first table, to Gods part as well as their owne. When Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sters are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in doctrine, &amp; careles in life, they hold some good, but not all. Private men that carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves soberly and civilly, and are fully content with the name of honest men, holde some good; but they reforme not their family, nor walke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously in the midst of their houses; and so are farre from holding all good.</p>
               <p>This is in matter of practise: So in matter of judgement. The truth and every part of it is our birth-right, saith <hi>Cyprian:</hi> wee must not lose a foote of it, but hold the least truth. Many hold fast the maine grounds and articles of religion, but in things of lesser moment are altogether regardlesse: as Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> thought at first that the cause of the Sacrament was rather to be dissembled than suffered for; but considering bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hee must holde all that is good, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:26365:74"/>
happily suffered in it.</p>
               <p>Nay we must not onely hold truth in sense, but even the words wherein the Spirit of God hath conveyed it to us, not departing easily from them: for wee shall finde what great mischiefe hath oppressed the Church by taking liberty to depart from the very words of Scripture, and in stead of them using other improper speeches to expresse the same thing. As for example: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers used to expresse the Pastors of the Church by the name of Priests: whereupon the Romish Church builds and backes her order of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Doctour <hi>Fulke</hi> in his sixth chapter of his defence of the translation against <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> hath these words: It is a folly to thinke that a sacrificing office externall can be established in the new Testament, which never calleth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> or Priests.</p>
               <p>They often call the Table of the Lord an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and the celebration of the Supper a Sacrifice; and gave a reasonable good sence: but had they kept to the words of the Scripture, they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented much mischiefe springing thence. For the Romanists make advantage of their speeches, wrested out of their sense, to set up that blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrine of the sacrifice of the Masse.</p>
               <p>And the word <hi>Masse,</hi> what Papist knowes whence it comes, being neither <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> nor <hi>Latine,</hi> nor taken from any other language of any Nation, but raked out of the bottomlesse pit, without all signification, unlesse it agree with our English word [<hi>masse</hi>] that is, an heape, a lumpe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:26365:74"/>
a chaos of blasphemies and abominations.</p>
               <p>The like of the word <hi>Pope,</hi> a strange, unknowne and mysticall name, the learned Papists knew it not, but confounded themselves in the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of it: some from <hi>Pape</hi> the interjection of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, some from <hi>Papa,</hi> which <hi>Latine</hi> children used to call their fathers by, answering to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dad: some from the <hi>Romane</hi> abbreviation of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> expressed by <hi>pa pa</hi> and a pricke betweene: some from the <hi>Siracusans</hi> word <hi>Papas</hi> signifying a father. Such follies and ridiculous and childish dotages are they faine to wander in, to seeke and finde their holy father the Pope, who as himselfe is a beast rising out of the earth, in whose forehead is written MYSTERIE, so his name is mysticall, and from men, not from heaven, not from the Scriptures: yet is the name as ancient as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and used by the Fathers. Wherein we may see how dangerous it is (as <hi>Beza</hi> observes) to decline from the word an hayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth, and not to hold all that is good, even the least. An arrow set a little awry at first makes a great errour before it fall at the marke. How happy had it beene if the ancient Fathers (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise godly and learned men) had held them to the very names, termes, and proper words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather than by departing therefrom have opened a flood-gate to Antichrists delusions? who as Satan creepes in the darke, and getting in his toe will shove in his bulke: for, give sinne an inch, it will take an ell; and so of the Man of sinne.</p>

As that famous souldier <hi>Cynegrius</hi> held the shippe, first with his right hand, till that was cut off, then with his left hand, till hee lost that too, and last of all with his teeth, till his head and body were severed: So let us resolve every one with himselfe, That which I see to be good, I will holde it so long as I live or breathe, my hands, my heart and soule shall cleave unto it, I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to heaven with me.</p>
               <p>The second thing proposed,<note place="margin">Meanes of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is good, foure.</note> is the meanes of holding that which is good.</p>

               <p>The <hi>former</hi> are 1. Presumption of our owne wisdome and knowledge.

               <p>The <hi>latter</hi> are, 1.

               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. Meanes.</note>
                  <hi>II.</hi> Provide and furnish the soule with helpes to <hi>hold that which is good.</hi> These helpes respect, 1. Intention, 2. Attention, 3. Retention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Intention must must bee cleane and sincere: we must not heare for envie, as the <hi>Pharisies</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Paules</hi> time, nor for newes as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor for gaine or curiosity as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> but to <hi>receive (as babes) the sincere milke of the word, to grow</hi> in grace thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:26365:76"/>
shall be the better furthered by premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the force, use and efficacy of the word, that it is <hi>the power of God to salvation, the incorrupt seede, the word of life,</hi> the instrument of faith, the <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> the bread and water that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Attention must be used: <hi>Acts</hi> 8.6. the people of <hi>Samaria gave heede to the things that Philip spake.</hi> This attention is a keeping of the heart and affections to the word deliuered. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. when <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>Lydia attended,</hi> and the Lord opened her heart: When Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, all the peoples <hi>eyes were fastened upon him, Luke</hi> 4. Attention is the doore by which the word enters. It is much furthered by a due esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the word: Thy word (saith <hi>David</hi>) is wonderfull, therefore my soule keepeth it. Men will attend to their learned counsell, when their free-hold is in question: so here, conceive aright of the word as a matter of life and death, a matter that concernes thy inheritance in heaven, thou wilt carefully attend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Retention must follow. In the body there are two nutritive powers, one Attractive, to draw meate into the stomacke, the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, to hold it there till it be turned into nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment: so in the soule. And, if the former draw too little, the latter holds little, and so the body pines: and if the former draw too much, that the body is not able to hold it, the body pines still: So here, the soule must be still drawing, but it must also forcibly holde it, till the soule be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:26365:77"/>
Now this Retentive faculty is streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by 4. meanes: 1. Meditation, cleane beasts chew the cud, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11 2. Consider the workes of the Lord: <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.1. Meditate in his Law both day and night: The acts of God must be in the mouthes of them that feare him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. and 39.3. while <hi>David mused,</hi> his heart was <hi>warmed. Phil.</hi> 4.8. whatsoever things are honest, just and pure, thinke on those things; men have therefore evill thoughts, because they nourish not the good. 2. Conference: which is a whetting of holy les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons both on our selves and others: <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. the <hi>Iewes</hi> are commanded to conferre of the word early and late. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for comparing the Apostles doctrine with Scripture. 3. A full purpose of heart to practise good things: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have sworne to keepe thy law:</hi> and 50.16. <hi>Why takest thou my word into thy mouth, and hatest to be reformed?</hi> 4. Fervent and constant prayer, which is the key of knowledge, gets the hearing eare, and the soft heart; it is a key to open the coffers of God, out of which we may take those treasures which are not from our selves, but from above our reach.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">3. Meanes.</note>
                  <hi>III.</hi> Chuse sure and safe places to hold good things in. First, in memory: we must remember good things we heare: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Take heed to thy selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently, that thou forget not the things thine eyes have seene. Psal.</hi> 119.16. <hi>I will not forget thy word:</hi> and ver. 93. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, because by them thou hast quickened me.</hi> Secondly, keep them in the faith of thy heart,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:26365:77"/>
else all is unprofitable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. for that onely gives them rooting in our hearts, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Keepe them in the midst of thy heart:</hi> then shall they be as alight in the lanthorne, shining through every part of thy life. This was the coffer that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> locked up the promises of God in, and held them fast without reasoning, though it was difficult and seemed impossible: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. and <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>I have hid thy word in my heart.</hi> Thirdly, keepe it in the affections of thy soule; love earnestly the word of God and all good things: for the things that wee like not or affect not we care not for keeping. The great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, to <hi>love the Lord with all thy heart.</hi> And every Christian ought to appeale to the Lord himselfe as <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, <hi>Lord, thou knowest that I love thee, Iohn</hi> 21.16. And the tryall of our love to him, is, to <hi>keepe his commandements,</hi> chap. 14.15. Fourthly, keepe them in the practise of thy life and whole conversation: 1. By professing good things; as Christ himselfe <hi>professed a good profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before Pontius Pilate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6, 13.</note> 2. By promoting all good causes to thy utmost power. 3. By maintaining and defending all good things and causes. 4. By suffering for good things, and every way giving testimony, and setting seale to them, if neede be with thy dearest heart blood.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> If we would hold good things,<note place="margin">4. Meanes.</note> let us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and arme our selves against theeves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 1. Our owne carelesnesse: Many times we care not to understand the things of God; vanity of minde, worldly lusts, and desire of riches,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:26365:78"/>
partly take up the roome, partly choake good things, so as they are neither received, nor held.</p>
               <p>But if we understand not, let us not be ashamed to enquire and seeke out till wee doe understand. 2. Satans slynesse, who steales the word and good purposes out of mens mens hearts strangely, even while they looke on and consent. Doe as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> who drave away the birds that troubled him in sacrificing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11. so doe thou drive away these ravenous birds that are sent by Satan. 3. Temptation and persecution: Much ground keeps the seede till the heate of persecution comes, and in persecution falls away, and loseth the word in temptation: we must arme our selves against the tryalls of the truth, and having obtained to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, we must also get of God strength to suffer for his sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Motives to holde that which is good. 5.</note>The third generall proposed, is, Motives to hold that which is good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider how little we have kept here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of all that wee have heard. If a man lay coyne or jewells in a chest, and afterward come and finde none in it, he will presently conclude, certainly a theefe hath beene here; so may wee in these losses, certainly the Divell hath beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> here: Looke to it more narrowly. 2. This is all the commendation of a Christian, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I commend you, that you keepe the ordinances as I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> A good husband will keepe and save his stocke, yea and increase it. 3. Keepe them and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they will keepe thee, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Forsake not wisdome, and she shall keepe thee:</hi> Hold
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:26365:78"/>
them, and they shall uphold thee; love her, and she shall preserve thee: keepe them safe, and they will keepe thee. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.26. <hi>If the Sonne set you free, ye shall be free indeede,</hi> that is, from errours in doctrine, and corruptions of life. So long as we keepe the word, we cannot fall quite away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the seede of God abideth in us. 4. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is no such losse in the world, as to lose the good things that thou seemest to lay hold on: Losse of wealth, of honour, of children, is nothing to the losse of spirituall good things. A man had better lose all the seede he sowes upon his ground, than the good seeede sowne in his heart. Better for a man to lose all the joyes and pleasures of the world, than the joy of his salvation. Better to lose all the labour of his calling, and put all his gaines in a broken bagge, than lose what hee hath wrought in his generall calling. Therefore suffer the word of exhortation, 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Looke to your selves that ye lose not the things you have done, but may have a full reward.</hi> 5. Let us consider that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is more necessary for us than for any, seeing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans aime and scope is to make great places and townes more backward, and carelesse to hold good things, than others: Hee sets his throne in great places, because he knowes that thence wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse shall be plentifully derived into the Country round about, as tradesmen doe their wares. Wee for example sake must labour to know, love, and obey the truth, that Gods throne may be set up every where, that our godlinesse and obedience may come abroad, and provoke
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:26365:79"/>
others: Let it be said of other great places, that pride, pleasure, and profit choake the word, and that there is but a forme of godlinesse without power: Let us stirre up our selves to our first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, our first diligence in receiving the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. <hi>Object.</hi> No doubt but we shall keepe good things. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You are indeede that which you are in <hi>tryall:</hi> You hardly keepe them while you have good meanes, what would you doe if the meanes were gone? 2. What if <hi>tryall</hi> should come, as wee may justly feare it? could wee then stand? Oh now lay a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, provide for it, that thou faint not in the day of adversity.</p>

us to the true sense of the words, which requires of us to runne as fast away from whatsoever hath any shew of evill, as if it were evill in it selfe: for the same word is used, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Abstaine from fleshly lusts:</hi> and in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.3. the will of God is, that ye <hi>abstaine from fornication:</hi> All noting, that we must avoid the least shew of evill with the same care that wee doe the greatest evill it selfe: and even all shews, as making conscience of all.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the action or evill it selfe, whether it be an evill of doctrine or manners, as all false doctrine, heresie, superstition, and all sinnes of all sorts, which stand not in conformity with the law. This is not so much aymed in the text. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the leaders, incentives or moovers of our selves or others unto any sinne: so <hi>Eves</hi> looking on the Apple, was not in it selfe evill, but so farre as it drew on her appetite; yea her conference with the Serpent, and <hi>Adams</hi> with her in that subject or argument, should have beene avoided. This first peeping or appearance of evill in our selves, or whatsoever we may lay as a stumbling blocke in the way of another, though it be not evill in us, nor in it selfe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an occasion of evill to another, by this precept
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:26365:81"/>
we must shunne and fly from it. <hi>Paules</hi> eating of flesh was lawfull in it selfe, and lawfull to him; but rather than hee would offend his weake bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will never doe it while the world stands: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21. he will remove that which seemeth and appeareth evill to another.

               </gap>, the consequents of actions are to be considered; and in things which be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that may be done or not done, we must sometime forbeare lawfull things if wee suspect evill consequents. It was lawfull for <hi>David</hi> to walke upon his gallery, but had hee foreseene the consequents, he would doubtlesse have beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise occupied. It was lawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to have circumcised <hi>Titus</hi> as he did <hi>Timothy</hi>; but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying an evill consequent, that hee should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the errour of the Iewes, who held circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision as necessary to salvation, he would not doe it: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. It was as lawfull in it selfe for him to make a vow, shave his head, and purifie himselfe at one time as at another, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.18. yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he inveighes against these observations as beggerly rudiments, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. and will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any of them, where hee might confirme any in their errour or obstinacy. All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples teach us, either warily to doe or leave undone things which are liable to misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here remember, that in all lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duties, let all the world misconster and be offended, wee must yeeld absolute obedience unto God, though to the world it appeare never
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:26365:81"/>
so evill. Christ himselfe in his doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation was so generall an offence, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him blessed that was not offended in him. He must preach himselfe to be the bread from heaven, though it offend the <hi>Iewes, Iohn</hi> 6. He will heale the paralyticke, though they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> must preach against <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> though all the Court be offended. <hi>Daniel</hi> will pray three times a day, though it cost him his life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all indifferent things we are to avoide all appearance of evill and scandall, with these limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> so they be not in things simply necessary to life, in these things wee must not forbeare if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be offended. If one take offence that I eate bread, or drinke beere, I must doe it, because life is maintained by foode, but if I can be without it and live, I must respect my brothers weaknesse; as to abstaine this or that flesh, this or that wine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the like in things simply necessary for my calling: But a thing of indifferency may not put me out of my way, I must hold my calling, I must preach the Gospell. This is a necessary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imposed; and good of this nature must be done, though a shew of evill to some be annexed to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in these things of indifferency, we must abstaine from appearances of evill, and things that carry an evill colour; if we be <hi>nostri juris,</hi> and the things be left to our free liberty and disposing. But if higher powers restraine our use of liberty,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:26365:82"/>
and determine and limit us, then we are overruled by lawfull authority in things subjected to it, and them, in these things of indifferency wee cannot avoide all things wherein some may conceive an appearance of evill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in these things, we are not alwayes to avoide things wherein some conceive offence and appearance of evill; but for a time till such igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and weake persons may be taught: we may not offend weake ones, by undue exercise of our liberty; but if they bee wilfull and will not bee taught, we must peremptorily stand to our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So did the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>For I testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to every man that is circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. <hi>A man that is an hereticke, after the first and second admonition, reject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the proofe of the point: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. When the Lord forbade our first parents the evil and sinne of eating the forbidden fruite, hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids also the appearance, <hi>Yee shall not touch it,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the occasion. In the Law not onely the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son legally polluted was uncleane,<note place="margin">Levit. 15.17.</note> but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touched him, the garment which he wore, the bed on which hee lay, the seate on which hee sate, and whatsoever he touched: All which did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but enforce on them a care to avoid all appearance, and all occasions of uncleannesse. The truth whereof Christians also in the time of the Gospell must hold themselves bound unto, who (<hi>Iude</hi> 23.) are commanded to <hi>hate even the garment spotted by the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:26365:82"/>1. Because the Lord hates all evill,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> and all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is commended for hating the doctrine of the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, which I also hate,</hi> saith the Lord. See how pleasing our conformity of affections with the Lord is, in whose eye the least evill is hatefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And herein we testifie our love unto him: <hi>Yee that love the Lord, hate all that is evill</hi>; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all true hatred of evill must be from the love of God, especially of the chiefe good: and as our love is in degree, so is our hatred; fervent love, earnest hatred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a chiefe part of repentance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> and of the nature of sound grace, not onely to hold that which is good, but also to shunne and fly evill of all kindes: yea when good is not so present, with Gods children as they desire, to hate evill is ever present with them: yea they hate the evill which they themselves doe, and that vehemently,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the phrase, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Abhorre evill.</hi> And he that out of the worke of grace, and out of conscience abstaines from one evill, will abstaine from all, even the least: as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>I hate all vaine inventions, but thy Law doe I love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The wisdome of a Christian is, to avoid the appearances, and the beginnings of evill,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> and give no way to it: as <hi>Salomon</hi> counselleth to stoppe the passages of waters at the beginning, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. As rivers, so evils come out of a little hole, but make their way, and swell, and become broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till they become almost boundlesse. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hee that cares not to avoid the appearance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:26365:83"/>
of evill, by little and little commeth to esteeme of the evill and the appearance alike. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember to <hi>give no place to the Divell, Eph.</hi> 4.27.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4</note>4. Here is a difference betweene a sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and an hypocrite: the worst man that is can avoid evill in extreames, but hee cares not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for appearing and petty evils, if hee can carry them cleare away. This hyocrisie the Lord detecteth among the <hi>Iewes, Esay</hi> 65.4. they would both eate of the polluted flesh, &amp; <hi>the broth of it was found in their vessells.</hi> A sound Christian will not meddle with the broth, and much lesse the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane meate; hee knowes the broth is uncleane too: the least sinne is infectious and contagious. The difference then is this: One loves the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good more than goodnesse it selfe; the other hates for the evils sake the very appearance of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fruite of this dutie commends it to our care.<note place="margin">5</note> 1. It commends our feare and zeale for God, which riseth up against all sinne. As by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we hate all serpents, yea the picture of an ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viper; so grace raiseth up the spirit against sinne indifferently, and all resemblance of it. 2. It is excellent for the satisfying of a mans owne conscience; for suppose a thing be never so good, yet if it appeare to me evill, I sinne in doing it, and must avoide it, because it appeares to me so. 3. It commends our charity, which respects the conscience of our brother, and is as loth he should fall by our hand, as by himselfe. 4. It is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:26365:83"/>
of our profession, and the glory of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when men cannot justly challenge us with appearances of evill; for wicked mouthes are stopt, and we adorne the holy profession of God; which must needes suffer in us, if wee avoid not shew of evill, both for the safety of our good name, and a good conscience.</p>
            <p>We must be so far from loving &amp; liking any evil,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> as we must utterly dislike it, be disparate and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from it, whether in Doctrine or manners.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> In Doctrines,<note place="margin">Evill in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</note> which have but a shew of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, we must abstaine and reject them as carefully as manifest false Doctrines; for wee may easily suppe up poyson and heresies, if wee can digest Doctrines which carry some shew of evill in them. As for example:<note place="margin">Heresie of <hi>Nestorius.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Nestorius</hi> a wicked he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke, and (as <hi>Evagrius</hi> calls him) <hi>officina blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiae,</hi> a very shoppe of blasphemy, did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish but separate the two natures of Christ; and made one Christ not of two natures, but of two distinct persons: one the Sonne of God, by which person all his egregious and miraculous workes were performed; the other the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> by which without the Sonne of God, he wrought all those actions of infirmity, as eating, drinking, sleeping, weeping; and the union of natures being dissolved, for one Christ he gives us two, but neither profitable for us. Hee holds that wee are saved by the flesh not of the Sonne of God, but of the Sonne of man, and that the flesh not of the Sonne of God, but of the Sonne of man is vivificall and quickening.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:26365:84"/>
Now this negative makes it apparantly false; from which we must not onely abstaine, but also from such speeches, as although they may have a right interpretation, yet carry a shew of evill: <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gr.</hi> It is a true speech, that we are saved by the blood of the Sonne of man, but we must abstaine from it, because of the cognation of it with <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his heresie, and say plainly, <hi>by the blood of God,</hi> as the Apostle speakes, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. or of Christ God and man we are saved. To say we are saved by workes, may be truly explained, but better to abstaine from it,<note place="margin">From evill in workes.</note> because it hath an appearance of Popish merit. To call Evangelicall Ministers Priests, may be truly expounded, but it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to avoid such phrases of speech,<note place="margin">From evill in words.</note> because of the shew of Popish Sacrifice and Priesthood. The words of heretickes (saith one) are to be feared:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>In</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               </note> wee must keepe the words of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: so say we of the faith of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">In manners.</note>
               <hi>II.</hi> In practise and behaviour we must shunne such things as carry evill shewes. The Iewes in their course of life must not onely not goe into uncleane houses, but must not come neere them; and Christians are commanded not to touch any uncleane thing. Therefore all such are here to be reproved, as think all Christianity stands in this, if they doe no unlawfull things, and so runne headlong, never looking <hi>quàm malè colorata sunt,</hi> what evill shewes they carry. Magistrates, who whatsoever they see president for, in their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, venterously undertake it; and so referre
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:26365:84"/>
their authority to private use, forgetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be publike men. Ministers, seeking their owne not Christs, they may be idle non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, cast up their calling, and turne (excepting their habit) meere secular. <hi>Paul</hi> refused lawfull maintenance at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to avoid suspition of mercenary and covetous affection in preaching. Christians in private converse must shew dislike of all appearance of evill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> avoid all filthinesse and suspition of it, as is said of <hi>Cesars</hi> wife, such as are minced oathes, adulterous lookes, needlesse company with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> put no coulours upon sinne, to digest it easier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I may company with such and such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to winne them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou art liker to lose thy selfe by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of infection, if without calling thou frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test loose company. 2. Thou art liker to lose than to winn them by intimate familiarity, which is fitter to harden them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> thou art in way to lose thy owne repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; as being a favourer of them and their courses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But I may weare this and that fashion of apparrell, my heart is humble, and I detest pride.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If it were so, thou wouldest avoid the shew of evill in overcostlinesse and excesse of attyre, a lowly heart, and a lowly habit goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But we may straine at gnats, and small things are not to be stucke at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Little sinnes have great consequents: Secondly, they commonly draw greater after them: Thirdly, many little sinnes proove pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and pernitious: Fourthly, none are little, if the shew of them be not little, as our text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In service. To be present at idolatrous service, is an appearance, yea a kinde of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idolatry: And where all idolatry is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, all shew and appearance of it is forbidden also. Besides, wee must shew in our appearance our hatred of the very appearance of evill. <hi>Quest.</hi> May not a man be at idolatrous service, and keepe his heart to God? <hi>Answ.</hi> No: 1. God is but one, man is but one, and there is but one faith; and God requires the body as well as the soule, because <hi>they are both his.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> 2. It is a deniall of Christ, a dissembling of religion, a betraying of truth, where we ought to professe it; an approbation of idolatry, an hardening of the enemy by presence and silence. 3. The very practise condemneth it selfe: The man holds consent of heart evill, then be must hold appearance of consent evill too. 4. It is a reconciling of abhorring natures, light and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:26365:85"/>
darknes; God and <hi>Belial,</hi> the Temple of God, and the Temple of idols. An impossible disioyning of the soule and body, as if the one could be in heaven, and the other in hell. <hi>Origen</hi> said he could not bend the knees of his body to God, and the knees of his heart to Satan: Yea it is a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the true God, who is a Spirit, not in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, but in spirit and falshood. 5. The justice of God is upon such persons for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, if a man give up his body, hee commonly gives up the heart to infection, and defection: And after in the great judgement will judge him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to things done in the body.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> The body is a member of Christ, and must not be prostitute to an harlot.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By <hi>faith</hi> in that place the Apostle meanes a perswasion in things indifferent, and not the doctrine or practise of religion: And the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this; If thou beeft in thy selfe perswaded a thing is indifferent, use thy liberty to thy selfe, <hi>have faith with thy selfe,</hi> but boast not of it to the offence of another: and faith is oppressed where it is not expressed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The man of God was there, 1. At Gods commandement necessarily. 2. Not to approove their idolatry, but manifestly to improove and exclaime against it. 3. God would have him by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:26365:86"/>
an externall signe shew his detestation of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he was not forbid to pray, but <hi>not to eate a morsell of bread there.</hi> 4. He did not dissemble with idolaters, but confessed plainly against idolaters. Now all the case is cleane contrary.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the example of <hi>Naaman</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.18.19.) any whit serve their turne: For 1. hee was but in the beginnings of conversion. 2. Hee confesseth it a sinne, and beggeth the Prophets prayer against it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verba Elisei sunt tantum dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is abeuntem, non concedentis postulatum.</hi>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether may we bring a childe to be baptized of a Popish Priest?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No; it is an appearance of evill: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1. There is corruption of doctrine. 2. Hatefull and hurtfull Ceremonies. 3. A profession to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that doctrine. Their Church is a false Church, yet here a man professeth that himselfe and his childe are members of it: for Baptisme is a signe of profession. 4. It is an hardening to Gods enemies; for it makes the Papists boast, and say, if our Baptisme be good, why joyne yee not with our Church? 5. We must depart from all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Antichrist: <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, come out of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> If a Popish Minister doe baptise a child, must he be rebaptised?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No: there is a difference betweene go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Priest at first, and new baptisme from one: for baptisme once administred, if the true
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:26365:86"/>
forme be kept, must not be repeated, though there be no ground to seeke it there, being an offence both to weake and strong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Zeale of God cannot abide any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion with idolaters in their idolatrous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and fashions: for communion of rites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth sects, as much as communion of appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell confoundth sexes. Whence the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self apointed al his own ceremonies, so as in them (as well as in doctrine) there might be set up a wall of partition betweene the <hi>Iewes</hi> and all ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens. 1. The Heathens almost eate nothing but swines flesh, having sacrificed some of the kinde: Gods people of all other must abhorre this, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.5. 2. The Heathens reserve portions of their sacrifices: therefore there was a speciall law, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>burne with fire the residue</hi> of the Paschall Lambe, than reserve any whit of it untill next morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.20. 3. The Heathens make their pates balde, shave the lockes of their beards, and make cuttings in their flesh: therefore Gods people must not doe so. 4.

               </item>
               <item>2. What is the <hi>peace</hi> here meant.</item>

            <p n="1">1. This is not an idle epithite, but well fitted
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:26365:94"/>
to the matter in hand; because our Apostle had in verse 13. exhorted them to <hi>peace among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and hath in all the precepts hitherto dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them how to uphold both <hi>outward peace,</hi> vers. 14, 15. and <hi>inward peace,</hi> from the 16. to this verse. And he notably in this title confirmes their faith, and strengthens their prayers, that so long as they aske nothing but things pertaining to the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church, and the peace of every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>the God of peace</hi> will surely grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly, What peace is meant.</hi> Peace is threefold:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Externall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Internall.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Externall,</hi> which is nothing but an outward prosperity and tranquility in our outward estate; and this is, 1. In the <hi>Church,</hi> when it hath rest from heresie, schisme, persecution, and tyranny, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. this is called <hi>the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> which we must <hi>pray for, Psal.</hi> 122.6. 2. In the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> in the peace whereof we have peace, when we are free from civill warre within, and forreine enemies without, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.7. 3. In the <hi>family,</hi> and speciall places where we live, which is a private agreement with all sorts of men, good and bad, so farre as may be: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Have peace with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Internall,</hi> and spirituall, and this is the sweet quiet and comfort of conscience, rising out of our assurance of our attonement with God through Iesus Christ, and out of remission of sinnes by his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:26365:94"/>
blood, which <hi>peace passeth all understanding, Phil.</hi> 4.7. and in which the Apostle placeth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Eternall,</hi> which is the perfect rest, peace, joy and glory that the Saints shall enjoy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Esay</hi> 57.2. <hi>Peace shall come,</hi> but it is when <hi>we sleepe in our beds,</hi> called <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>life and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Apostle here aymes especially at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde of peace, which is a steppe and degree to the third.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>third,</hi> why is he called <hi>the God of peace?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Answ. First,</hi> because hee hath the fountaine of <hi>peace</hi> in himselfe, <hi>peace</hi> in him is as in a fountaine. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as the Author and communicatour of all peace unto us in all kindes: As 1. In <hi>Church,</hi> the peace of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> must be begged of him, he stills all warres, and maketh all stirrs in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to be husht and gone. And it is hee that makes men dwell together in one house. 2. He is authour, and the God of eternall peace; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life is the gift of God. 3. After a speciall manner is he the God of internall peace, the peace of conscience, at which our Text aimeth, which is a quietnesse of minde and conscience through our reconciliation with God. <hi>First,</hi> because hee sent his <hi>Sonne:</hi> 1. To merit it for us, when wee lay in the horrour of an accusing conscience; who is therefore called in himselfe (<hi>Esa.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> and in respect of us, <hi>our peace.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ambrose</hi> expounds here <hi>the God of peace</hi> to be Christ himselfe. If it be asked, how Christ merited our peace, the Apostle answereth, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:26365:95"/>
2.15, 16. <hi>He made peace by slaying hatred on the crosse,</hi> by his perfect obedience overcomming and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing whatsoever God might hate in us. 2. To preach and publish this peace, and invite men unto it: And that first in his owne person, <hi>Esay</hi> 61.1. <hi>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, to preach good tidings to the poore, to binde up the broken-hearted, to preach liberty to the captives, &amp;c.</hi> And how this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was accomplished, see <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. Secondly, in the person of his Ministers Christ preacheth peace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Christ came and preached peace to you which were farre off. Object.</hi> Why? Christ never preached to the <hi>Ephesians. Answ.</hi> Yes hee did in the persons of the Apostles, and so now in the Pastors and Ministers of his Church to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> end of the world. <hi>Secondly,</hi> because hee sent his <hi>Spirit</hi> to apply and <hi>seale</hi> this peace onely in the hearts of his elect, therefore it is called a <hi>fruite of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22. and <hi>the Spirit cryes in our hearts, Abba, Father:</hi> chap. 4.6. He workes faith in the heart, and so <hi>we have peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>and bold accesse to the throne of grace, Eph.</hi> 3.12. This is that creating Spirit, which <hi>creates the fruit of the lippes to be peace, Esay</hi> 57.19. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God doth not onely command and commend to us this peace, but approoves and delights in it, and no where else; but there he sets up his throne and dwelling, his Temple is in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of peace: his Disciples must onely abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sonnes of peace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. and much more doth himselfe.</p>
            <p>How we are to looke upon God in our prayers.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:26365:95"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> in all our prayers we are to behold him a God of peace:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> labour to see him reconciled unto us.<note place="margin">In all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers behold God a God of peace.</note> And 1. this beholding of God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled gives us assurance of obtaining whatsoever is good for us. 2. The sence of his infinite essence, and power and presence with us confounds us, unlesse the sense of his grace and favour susteine us; and hence our Lord taught us to begin our prayer with this title, <hi>Our Father.</hi> 3. Our chiefe unhappinesse were to be neare God, if hee be not at peace with us; for our God offended is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire.</p>
            <p>Then wee must beware of sinne which is the breach of peace betweene God and us;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> especially before prayer let every one that calls upon the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee must acknowledge our happinesse to consist in our peace with God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Make peace with him, and thou shalt have prosperity, Iob</hi> 22.21. If they of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> made so much of outward peace, that they by all meanes desired it of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>; and if the <hi>Iewes</hi> having by <hi>Felix</hi> obtained outward peace and quiet, acknowledged it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all places with all thankes: much more should wee for spirituall, inward and heavenly peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> in our prayers we must labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God in such Attributes as may streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith in our speciall suites: Behold him not onely the God of all grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. but of this and that particular grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To this end the Scripture denominates him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:26365:96"/>
from particular vertues, that in the want of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we may resort to him confidently, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture stileth him the God of <hi>love,</hi> the God of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> the God of <hi>hope,</hi> the God of <hi>all consolation, of wisdome, &amp;c.</hi> that in our want of any speciall grace, wee may cast our eye upon these titles or Attributes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures are stored with many names and titles of God, that we might so conceive of him affected to us in our prayers, as hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himselfe to be.</p>
            <p>Doe wee begge the accomplishment of any promise: come to him in the name IEHOVAH, who gives being as to all things so to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>Doe wee pray for any thing, but see many things stand in the way of our good, publike or private: now come to him in the name of EL, <hi>a strong God,</hi> who can quickly bring mountaines to plaines, and effect by a mighty power whatsoever he will.</p>
            <p>Lacke we any blessing, and are destitute of all meanes and comfort; now come to him in the name of of EL-SHADDAI, <hi>I am God All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> and that is meanes enough.</p>
            <p>Findest thou thy selfe beset with severall wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses, and armies of wicked Angels in high places, and invironed with temptations or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: now come to him in the name of EL-TSEBAOTH, <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> who hath armies of Angels to set round about the tents of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: this name of the Lord is an assured strength, when the righteous fly unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:26365:96"/>Hast thou received any blessing, or promise, now come to him in the name IAH, as wee are commanded, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. who is thy good Lord and bountifull benefactour: If the Apostles had neede thus to encourage their prayers, much more wee.</p>
            <p>Whosoever would have true peace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> All peace must be from the God of peace.</note> must have it from the God of peace; as he that would have water, must goe to the well or fountaine. <hi>Iob</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy selfe with God, be at peace with him, so shalt thou have prosperity.</hi> The Apostles in all their salutations pray for <hi>peace from God, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because God himselfe and our Lord Iesus challenge this peace to be their owne prerogative to give, neither can it be had elsewhere.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> For the former: as God is called <hi>the God of peace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so this peace is called <hi>the peace of God, Col.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. as whereof he is the sole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. For the latter: our Saviour saith to his Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi> Where he <hi>first,</hi> challengeth it to be his owne, having clearely purchased it. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> his owne to give; men may wish peace, but he can give it: men wish the peace of God or Christ, he gives his owne. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that this peace cannot be elsewhere had: [<hi>not as the world giveth,</hi>] plainly distinguishing his peace from the worlds, both in the gift, and the manner of giving. The world, 1. gives a kinde of peace, but that is a false peace, mine is a true
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:26365:97"/>
peace. 2. That is a peace in externall things, mine in internall.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the peace of Christ and the peace of the world in 6 things.</note> 3. That is temporary and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, mine lasting, yea everlasting; <hi>For your joy shall none take away from you.</hi> 4. That is given most to wicked men, for the world loves her owne; but this is given onely to beleevers, being a fruite of faith, against whom the world bends all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 5. That peace is against Gods glory; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the worlds peace is the keenest warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, the very foment and cherisher of lusts and impiety: This peace is for God and his glory, and a warre against sinne, a cherisher of grace and piety. 6. That peace ends in destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though men <hi>cry peace, peace, &amp;c.</hi> This is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for salvation, and for the fruition of perfect peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this peace is onely Gods to give, so is it onely the portion of the children of God, who are called <hi>sonnes of peace:</hi> this is <hi>onely childrens bread,</hi> and <hi>must not be cast to doggs, Matth.</hi> 15.26. And it is a gift of promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Peace shall be to all the Israel of God.</hi> Such onely as have God for their Father, and the Church for their Mother, have right unto this, and that because they be sonnes: <hi>Esay</hi> 54.13. <hi>Much peace shall be to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that is, of the Church: and because they be beleevers, for this peace is the fruite and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded companion of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercie of God in Iesus Christ for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne. <hi>The wicked man hath none of this peace of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 57.21.</note> because he hath not mercy nor grace with the God of peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:26365:97"/>The seate and place where this peace resteth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> prooves plainly that it is a proper and peculiar gift of God, and that is the heart, soule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which none can reach but God himselfe: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, The peace of God must <hi>take the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the heart:</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which passeth all understanding, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, shall preserve your hearts:</hi> A military word, taken from souldiers that come in to ayde an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; so this peace shall bring ayde to the heart, and strengthen it, when Satan, and sinne, and temptation, and persecution lay siege to it. And who else can revive the heart, but he that made it? Who can reach comfort to the conscience, but the Lord of it? Who can say to the soule, I have pardoned thy sinne, but the Lord the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom it is committed, and so pacifie it? Who can worke faith in the heart, but the Spirit of God? and who can preserve this gift there, being by so many enemies surprised, but the hand that creates it, <hi>by the power of which we are preserved to salvation?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>Then are wicked men most unhappy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing estranged from the God of peace, can have no true peace. <hi>Esay</hi> 57.21. <hi>The wicked are like the raging sea, that cannot rest, whose waters cast up myre and dyrt: there is no peace to the wicked man, saith my God.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Their outward prosperity deserves not the name of peace, it is at the best but a truce with God. 2.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The question is the more necessary, because every quiet conscience is not a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and every peace in the conscience is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from <hi>the God of peace.</hi> A dead peece of flesh, pricke it with a needle, it feeles nothing: So that is a dead conscience, which feeles no sinne, nothing at all: but that is a pacified conscience, which is alive, and indeed feeles sinne, but forgiven, and apprehendeth God not onely offended, but now againe pacified.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. A dead man is quiet enough, makes no noyse, or motion: So a dead conscience may be still; but sound peace of conscience is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and hath joy and refreshing in it, as a man at a feast: it rejoyceth that it hath gotten a sweete glimpse of light and favour from God: it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in that it hath got a sight of Iesus Christ, and in that happy present condition it hath by him obtained. These are sound causes of peace and quietnesse.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Sound peace from <hi>the God of peace,</hi> hath sound fruites and effects as well as sound causes. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may be quiet, because for the present it hath no enemy disturbing it, and no molestation, because the strong man hath carried all away: But a good conscience is therefore peaceable, because it is strong and stirring in temptation, it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth, and hath prevailed against temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A bad conscience may be quiet because of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the darknesse or senslesnesse of it: for it neither sees nor feares any danger; it sees not the offence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:26365:99"/>
of God by sinne, nor feares his wrath and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation though never so justly deserved: But sound peace of conscience sees the offence of a Father, and feareth now transgression more than damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A sleepy conscience may be so much the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> more quiet, because it can secure it selfe from the worlds enmity, which hateth nothing but the light: It can avoid persecution, and sleepe secure (as we say) on both sides. But sound peace of conscience sheweth it selfe most in greatest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and persecutions, and makes the Saints sing in sorrow, and rejoyce in suffering for the name of Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in prison, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles <hi>rejoyced that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Iesus, Acts</hi> 5.41. Here is the peace of Christ himselfe, which, when the world by all meanes, of persecution, and indignities, seeke to interrupt it, (as in our head himselfe) yet none can take it away: whereas light persecution sends packing the peace of hypocrites, who are soone unsettled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If <hi>the God of peace</hi> have possessed thee with this sweete peace, make much of it, preserve it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> do nothing to disturb or forfeit this happy peace, or to provoke God to withdraw it.</p>
            <p>Rules of furtherance herein.<note place="margin">Meanes of maintaining true peace.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Beware of security: peace is maintained by an expectation and preparation for warre. Many are the examples of them, who by a secure peace have lost peace and all. Therfore preserve in thee a feare of not offending God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:26365:100"/>2. Beware of falling into any grosse actuall sinne. How did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> disturbe their peace by foule sinnes? And daily experience shewes, that the godly are often by Gods just correction for sinne, sometimes inwardly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times outwardly, as men set on a racke; or in an hell of horrours and sorrowe till they undoe by repentance some foule offence: witnesse the 32 and 51 <hi>Psalmes:</hi> especially presumptuous sinnes prevaile against our peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Prepare and arme we our selves against temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for Satan if he cannot hinder us of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, will surely give us as little peace in the way as he can; and therefore hee will and doth often terrifie Gods people with hellish temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which he brings them so low, that they see nothing lesse than peace of heart: sometimes they be as men in a swone, who live, and yet know not they doe live. Therefore how had wee need keepe on our armour, to keepe our peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doe all duties sincerely and uprightly: <hi>Marke and behold the upright man, his end is peace, Psal.</hi> 37.37. Be it never so weakely or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, yet doe things uprightly; humbly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of thy selfe, and heartily in respect of God, approving thy selfe to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Suffer all affliction and hard measure joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for well-doing and good conscience, rather than lose thy peace: So did the Saints of God <hi>suffer joyfully the spoyling of their goods, Heb.</hi> 10.34. and so did our owne Martyrs.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note>5. This is a comfort for Gods children, as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:26365:100"/>
Christ intimates, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>My peace I give unto you, let not you hearts be troubled:</hi> Their <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>God of peace:</hi> for the godly heart will say, you speake of peace which is the onely portion of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but alas! who have lesse peace than they? Sure I am (will some say) I have so many and so great afflictions in the world, that I can scarce stand upright under them; what may I thinke of my selfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Is thy expectation of a peace out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in outward things? if so, where hath God promised thee such a peace, without exception of the crosse? 2. Is thy lot and portion other than the Disciples of Christ, or Christ himselfe? had they this outward peace? No, <hi>In the world</hi> (saith he) <hi>yee shall have tribulation, but in mee ye shall have peace.</hi> 3. Whatsoever or how great soever thy afflictions be, thou hast <hi>the God of peace</hi> with thee, and for thee, yea and in thee, and shalt not want a strengh to deliver thee out of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but were my trialls onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from the world, I could rejoyce; but Satan molests me and disquiets the peace of my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by such strong and violent temptations as wound my soule; and by such motions and thoughts as seeme to be brought out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let not thy heart be troubled; thou maist be at peace that Satan is thy enemy, thou art not yet in his power. 2. Thou maist have peace, that thou seest and sorrowest for the uglinesse of these temptations, and outstandest the violence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:26365:101"/>
of them: thus they shal be thy exercise, but not thy sinne. 3. Thou hast a <hi>God of peace</hi> whom thou ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, this <hi>God of peace will shortly tread Satan under thy feete, Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But neither the world nor the Divell could hurt me without my owne sinne: but that which grieves my heart, my owne sinnes doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disturbe my peace, and grow to such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and strength, that I doubt I shall lose it quite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Sinne indeede is the great trouble-house and enemy to peace: But 1. know this to thy comfort, that no sinne shall destroy peace, but that sinne which hath peace. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that of the Prophet, <hi>Esay</hi> 54.10. <hi>The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines may fall, but Gods covenant of peace shall stand.</hi> This <hi>God of peace</hi> hath made an everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peace, and that must stand.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>the God of peace,</hi> then godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse makes not any man unpeaceable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 6.</note> or turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; though the world condemne the godly as authours of dissention, and the world would be quiet were it not for them. But indeede the cause that they are unpeaceable in the worlds eye, is, because they will not lose their peace, nor offend <hi>the God of peace,</hi> nor exchange the peace of <hi>God</hi> and good conscience with the peace of the world. But let such as love this <hi>God of peace,</hi> labour to shew themselves sonnes of peace, and shew this worke of <hi>God</hi> in their love of peace, to which they are called, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. shunning as rockes brawlings, and contentions, and fury, and fiery affections, with all pevish and sowre behaviours.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:26365:101"/>
And if for not running with the world, and for standing for the <hi>peace of God,</hi> they shall bee accounted unpeaceable, <hi>the God of peace</hi> will justifie them; and they shall take their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies booke of accusation, and binde it on their shoulders, and weare it as a crown on their heads, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.36, Now to the petition.

            </list>
            <p>For the first: Sanctification is the abolition of our naturall corruption,<note place="margin">Description of sanctification.</note> and the renovation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Gods image in beleevers by the Spirit of God, begun by grace in this life, and perfected by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Here wee have foure things to be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the Authour of this grace; <hi>God</hi> himselfe:<note place="margin">1. Authour.</note> 
               <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.8. <hi>I am the Lord that sanctifieth thee.</hi> And
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:26365:102"/>
especially or more immediatly the Spirit of God, whose peculiar worke it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is called <hi>the Spirit of sanctification, Rom.</hi> 1.4. and it selfe <hi>the sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. 1. Because it is an effect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who is the immediate worker of it. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a signe and note of the Spirits presence, even as the beames argue the presence of the Sunne.</p>
            <p>And good reason: for 1. in the beginning of this worke man is meerely passive: for what can a dead man doe to his owne quickning and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. 2. Who can repaire nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, but the Authour of nature? who can bring backe Gods image but he that at first made man in it? This is to be borne of God, and who begets the childe but the father? 3. Our Apostle goes to God for it, from which Ocean all streams come.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. The Subiect.</note>Secondly, the Subject of this grace; the elect onely: for this worke is peculiar to such as shall attaine the perfection of it in glory. It is true there is somewhat like sanctification in the hypocrite and reprobate, some work of the Spirit, by which they are said to be sanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and 10.29. But wee must know, that sanctification is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: 1. <hi>Externall,</hi> in outward calling, outward profession of Doctrine, and administration of the Sacraments: the very best of which is generall illumination, and some slight reformation: and this is common to reprobates. 2. <hi>Internall,</hi> a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall renovation, or a change of the whole man,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:26365:102"/>
raising up the heart to holinesse, by which graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke the true Christian is separated from all the profane and hypocrites of the world: therefore 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. hee calls the beleevers <hi>elect to the sanctification of the Spirit:</hi> so as this is a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification appropriate to the elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>forme</hi> of sanctification:<note place="margin">3. The forme.</note> And that is, 1. in putting off of corrupt qualities. 2. In bringing in new and inherent holinesse, which daily changeth the beleever into the image of God: as <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Seeing yee have put off the old man with his workes, and put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> This new quality, created in the hearts of the elect, by the Spirit of God, whereby they can in some measure truly hate and forsake sinne, and truly love the Law of God, with an indeavour to keepe it, is the very being of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>processe</hi> of sanctification:<note place="margin">4. Processe.</note> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in grace here, and not perfected till hereafter in glory: Which is added, 1. to distinguish it from justification, which is perfect in one act. 2. To note the toughnesse and strong heart of sinne, which is slowly weakned here, and never here perfectly subdued: for in the most perfect <hi>the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. 3. To shew, that the matter of sanctification, is, to be in perpetuall motion, as a living water: <hi>Hee that is righteous, must be righteous still, Rev.</hi> 22.11. 4. To shew, that sound holinesse never gives over till it attaine perfection; perfection is a fruite of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:26365:103"/>
in grace: <hi>The way of the righteous shines more and more untill perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> For the second: What it is to be sanctified <hi>throughout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These <hi>Thessalonians</hi> were already san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and therefore the Apostle prayes, that they might happily proceede to full sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. This full sanctification is partly in this life, partly in the life to come: the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth both, the former first as a way to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The <hi>through</hi> sanctification in this life is the imperfect sanctification of parts, the other is the perfect sanctification in degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Through san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in this life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it consisteth.</note>The <hi>former</hi> is, 1. in respect of the whole rule of sanctification, which is the Law of God, when a beleever can truly say with <hi>David,</hi> that hee <hi>hath respect to all the commandements, Psal.</hi> 119.6. and 18.22. for <hi>all</hi> his lawes were before mee, and I did not cast away his commandements from me. 2. In respect of all sinnes: it is a through change from all sinne; not a turning out of one sinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, nor a turning from all sinnes save one, as <hi>Herod</hi>; but an hating of all appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, yea of darling and bosome sinnes, yea of right eyes and hands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. 3. In respect of all gifts of sanctification, which the Spirit gives in part to every beleever, not onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, love, which are eminent, but other inferiour also, as patience, meeknesse, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, peace, with every other fruite of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 4. In respect of all the parts of the man, in which the Spirit of God putteth forth this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:26365:103"/>
worke: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to be faire in all parts, eyes, hayre, teeth, lippes, temples, &amp;c. the sanctified person must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wholly perfect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>latter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Through san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in the life to come wherein it stands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>i.</hi> full and through sanctification in the life to come, stands in the perfection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and in these particulars. 1. An utter abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of sinfull flesh. 2. A perfect freedome from all the causes and workes of repentance. 3. Perfect and speciall communion with God, and Christ, and good Angels, and elect men. 4. Perfection of all graces, both in kinde and in measure. 5. A perfect exercising of our graces in glory and happinesse. And all this our Apostle seemes to ayme at in the last words, where he mentions the comming of Christ, in which he shall attaine through and full sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>For the third: What be these parts mentioned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 
               <hi>spirit, soule, body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some by <hi>Spirit</hi> understand the third person in Trinity, as <hi>Ambrose:</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is here meant by spirit</note> Some a third part of man: But the Scripture speakes but of two, namely a body and a soule; and <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, the spirit and the soule differ, <hi>non secundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> essentiam, sed potentiam,</hi> not in essence, but as divers faculties. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the spirit understand the whole man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, so farre as hee is opposed to flesh; the man considered not according to the parts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but according to the parts of grace: So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> said, <hi>Spiritus est donum quod jam per bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismum accepistis,</hi> the Spirit is the gift of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:26365:104"/>
in baptisme: for, keep this gift (saith he) and both soule and body wil be unblamable. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is not unfit: yet I take another to be fitter; thus: It is common in Scripture for our better apprehension of our duty to distinguish those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which God hath put in the soule of man, that we might take notice of the worke of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in the severall faculties. There be two parts of man, a soule and a body. Of the soule there are two noble faculties, under which all the rest are comprehended: 1. the <hi>spirit,</hi> 2. the <hi>will,</hi> here called the soule by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the whole for the part. By <hi>spirit</hi> in this and all places where the spirit and soule are mentioned together, is meant that noble and eminent faculty of mans soule, called the understanding or minde: the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers call it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the leader and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of all other parts and faculties, and the most noble of all. Vnder this is the conscience inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which being renewed is called also by the name of Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The spirit witnesseth to our spirits:</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Be renewed in the Spirit of your minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The other superiour faculty, but not so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is that whereby we doe will, affect, or desire that which wee understand and conceive to bee good. This they call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, under which is comprehended the will and affections. So these words are used elsewhere, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.46. <hi>My soule doth magnifie the Lord, and my spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. <hi>The soule of Ionathan was knit to David,</hi> that is, his heart, affections, desires.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:26365:104"/>3. The <hi>body</hi> is that part of man, which is the house of the soule, consisting of flesh, bones, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and the like.</p>
            <p>Now then the whole man is sanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, 1. When the minde, thoughts, cogitations,<note place="margin">The whole man sanctified throughout, how.</note> and conscience, are pure and holy, wisely to think and meditate, and guide safely, by wise discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things profitable and pertinent. 2. When the heart, affections and desires are rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and given up to the guidance of right and renewed reason, when a sound heart and a sound minde meete together. 3. When the whole body as the soules instrument is in all the members of it obedient, to act and effect good actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dictate of right reason, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of renewed will; when the members are weapons and servants of righteousnesse: Or more briefly, when the spirit thinkes nothing, the will affects nothing, the body effects nothing contrary to the will of God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This question brings us to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the fourth thing in the Text, How a man may be said to be <hi>blamelesse in spirit, soule, and body,</hi> in this life. Whereto we say: No man ever attained to this unblameable perfection of degrees in this life, except the first <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the second <hi>Adam,</hi> who had sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all parts and degrees: for <hi>Paul</hi> a most holy man after regeneration confesseth how farre hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:26365:105"/>
was from perfection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. But a man regenerate may be said to be blamelesse, and <hi>throughly renewed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of his relation with Christ his head, <hi>who is made to him sanctification,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and in whom hee is perfectly holy and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Thy Beauty was made perfect by my Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of open and grosse crimes, which might impeach the honour of his profession:<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. In respect of Christian indeavour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation, when the beleever labours and aymes at full sanctification in all his faculties and parts: for sanctification produceth holy motions in the soule, and holy actions in the body. See it

               <hi>First, the spirit, i.</hi> the minde and understanding of a sanctified man is indued with a sound and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct knowledge of heavenly things, and he still indeavours to a further measure: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.33, 34. <hi>Teach mee, give mee understanding, &amp;c.

his person and worke acceptable: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.28. <hi>My Lord, and my God. Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God.</hi>

It is <hi>calme</hi> and peaceable; it blameth not, nor accuseth seth it selfe, but giveth good witnesse, first, that the person may be assured of his reconciliation with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and 8.36. And secondly, that he walketh with God sincerely: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, even the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that in simplicity and good sincerity wee have had our conversation in the world.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If our heart condemne us not, we have boldnesse with God.</hi>

            <p>The second faculty, called the <hi>soule</hi> here, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> in both which this worke of sanctification is begunne, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>will,</hi> when being renewed, it is now subject and pliable to God in all things: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will now is present with mee</hi>; not onely in doing, but in suffering, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. in suffering it can <hi>commit the soule to God in well-doing as unto a faithfull Creatour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>affections:</hi> herein is a change, being guided and carried by the minde and will renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His love is not the olde carnall love, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and the world, but a new affection, <hi>Love out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfained,</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:26365:106"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. His hatred which was against God and his Saints, is now against the haters of God, and things which God hates, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.21. His joy which was sensuall and earthly, is now delightfull in doing the will of God, yea in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We rejoyce in tribulation.</hi> His sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which was for worldly losses, crosses, &amp;c. is now for sinne, and for the afflictions of Gods people: His delights which were in carnall profits, pleasures, corne, wine, or prosecuting his lusts, are now in <hi>Gods countenance,</hi> in <hi>Gods Law,</hi> in <hi>Gods house,</hi> in <hi>Gods Ordinances,</hi> the Word and Sacraments, and in <hi>Gods children</hi> above all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as those that are <hi>excellent on earth.</hi> His desires are answerable: what ever his former desires were, now he desires the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>pleasing</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> pardon of sinne, softnesse of heart, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant fruition of the meanes of salvation, with a blessed successe of them: Hee desires the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Zion,</hi> the salvation of the <hi>Israel of God,</hi> and the comming of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to his full redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how a sanctified man profiteth and prospereth in the whole inner man.</p>
            <p>But fire within will breake out, and so will grace which is like fire, and the body shall be a weapon of righteousnesse, his outward actions shall be done in an holy manner, his whole life is changed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the matter of his actions; Gods word is the rule of them all: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.35. <hi>Direct me in the path of thy commandements, for therein is my delight.</hi>

Thirdly, with cheerefulnesse, <hi>delighting greatly in his commandements, Psal.</hi> 112.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man wisheth in his heart: <hi>The Lord loves a cheerefull giver.</hi> Fourthly, with courage and stoutnesse: <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17. <hi>We are not carefull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For the end: first, hee will approove his heart to God, and lookes not so much to men; for his <hi>praise is not of man, but of God.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. ult.</note> hee desires to please God in that hee doth: <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 4. respect, in which a beleever may be called <hi>unblameable</hi> even in this life, is, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and gracious acceptation.

            <p>And thus we have expounded this worthy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Apostle: The summe and substance whereof is this; that God by his Spirit, who onely can raise the dead in sinne, would bestow this grace, not belonging to the wicked, upon these <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> by which they putting off all the corrupt qualities of nature, might by a new created quality in their hearts, grow up in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, standing in knowledge, true righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and holinesse. And because they were already sanctified in part, hee prayeth that they may goe on to through sanctification, both here and hereafter: for the present, that they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine full holinesse, in respect of all sinne which they must forsake, and of the whole law and word which they must set before them, in respect of all gifts, principall and lesse principall, and of all parts and faculties, here expressed to be <hi>the spirit, the soule, and body:</hi> that thus they may be <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi> in respect of relation with Christ their head, in respect of grosse crimes and reigning sinnes, in respect of Christian inchoation, of the Lords acceptation, and of perfect consummation of whole sanctification at the comming of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:26365:107"/>In that the Apostle prayeth for <hi>through</hi> sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and enumerateth the parts, in which it is, and desireth they may be kept <hi>blamelesse</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them, we learne, that</p>

            <p n="3">3. Sanctification is a continuall act and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in grace so long as we live;<note place="margin">3.</note> because it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a returne to our first estate and image, to which wee cannot possibly attaine till death. And therefore if wee would proceede to the glory of the Saints, we must proceed in sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:26365:108"/>
to the full measure of it: for glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is nothing but the end and perfection of sanctification.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God hath set apart many excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meanes for the perfecting of this his owne worke;<note place="margin">4.</note> by all which if we rise not to full holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we shall frustrate him of his end. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture is <hi>able to make the man of God perfect to every good worke,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. the holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Word and Sacraments are able both to beget and strengthen faith,<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> which <hi>purifieth the heart</hi>; holy meditations, conference, prayers, with promises of blessing and successe, if wee rightly use them: all these witnesse to us, that the Lord would have us to be still adding what is lacking to our graces, and rise up to full assurance and holinesse; and as those that are planted in the house of God, to be more fruitfull and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in our age.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The necessity and utility of this practise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it on all the godly.<note place="margin">5.</note> 1. In respect of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of their hearts, and a number of beloved and darling sinnes, against which all care, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and strength is too little. 2. In respect of the steine and soyle of sinne, which is like a crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dye, hardly fetched out of those that are the Lords: for when the sting of sinne is gone, and the guilt of sinne is taken away, and washed in the Kings bath,<note place="margin">Zech. 13.1.</note> even <hi>the fountaine of the blood of the Sonne of God, opened to the house of Iudah and Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem for sinne and uncleannesse:</hi> yet is there a staine of sinne left, which remaineth to be washed with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:26365:109"/>
the fountaine of water, (for <hi>Christ came by water and blood</hi>) this fountaine of pure water is the grace of sanctification, which is as the flood <hi>Iordan</hi> to wash the soules leprosie, which stickes faster than <hi>Naamans</hi>; so as we had neede wash <hi>seven times,</hi> that is often, yea continually; and yet for all that it shall be with the faces of our soules, as with the faces of our children, the dyrt shall sticke till it be washed off, and being washed, soone growes foule and dyrtie againe. 3. In respect of good duties, wherunto we shal ever be unapt &amp; unready, further than by profiting in sanctification wee are kept in a readinesse: For as a man in fetters and irons cannot doe any service to his Prince, till his fetters be knockt off; so here, our corruptions and lusts are heavier, and presse us downe harder than a thousand chaines; onely the grace of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification unties us, and gives us liberty in good duties. 4. In respect of finall perfection, which is not attained in justification, but by sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is true, that justification heales the wound, but sanctification shuts the skarre; justification brings pardon, but sanctification brings peace: neither was there ever any justified person, who had received the first fruites, but hee longed for his full harvest in perfect sanctification. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being justified, presently attained not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but laboured hard towards it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. And an inseparable note of a justified person, is, that he longeth, waiteth, and sigheth, to put off all corruption and misery, and to put on fulnesse of grace and glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>We that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine thus prooved unto us, serves for the reproofe of sundry sorts of people.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> those are reprooved,<note place="margin">

Therefore deceive not thy selfe, sanctification begins in the understanding and minde, but goes on to renew the thoughts, the desires, affections, speeches and whole life.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> such are reprooved as thinke civill life to be holinesse,<note place="margin">Civility is farre from sanctity.</note> and content themselves with it as sanctification: the world generally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this shadow for the body, and this image and

livelesse carkasse for the life and being of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; betweene which there is as great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as betweene a man and an ape.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Sanctification is most conversant, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefull in religious duties which concerne God, and his worship, and his owne salvation: this is the <hi>one thing necessary, Luke</hi> 10. and <hi>the good part,</hi> yet will it not be negligent in the workes of his speciall calling. Civility is most in things for the naturall and civill life, there is his spirit, his soule, his body, and all; and yet he must not be an Atheist, he must sometimes doe religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but how seldome, or how coldly, tediously, and of custome?</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Sanctification labours against the roote of sinne, kills it in the birth, blasts it in the budde, draines the fountaine, and renewes the spirit of the minde; the eye of it spares no sinne, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voides the sinnes of the time, of the trade, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and darling sinnes, pluckes out eyes, and cuts off hands. Civility makes no great matter of the rooted and originall sinne, it would stoppe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:26365:110"/>
some foule issues, but it is loath to meddle with the fountaine; it would not be noted for great sinnes, foule adultery, manifest theft, noted ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drunkennesse, &amp;c. but some gainfull or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable sinne it cannot be without: and as for smaller sinnes, as idlenesse, vaine talking, evill speaking, gaming, lesser oathes, and the like, hee takes no notice of them, nor is ever humbled for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Civility may cover sinne, but cures it not; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it may wrappe a clout on a wound, but layes no plaister on it: But sanctification is healing as well as cleansing, as was shadowed in the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning leprosie, which was then pronounced to be cured, when the uncleannesse was confessed, and went no further.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sanctification is busie both to stocke up sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and enlarge the stocke of grace, to get more strength against corruption, more power to obey God in all things; it markes the increase of grace, and is thankfull for it; it conscionably useth meanes of repairing graces decayed; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes daily warre against the reigne of sinne, and riseth to full sanctification in a most glorious vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and conquest over it. Civility lets sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to see if it will die it selfe, it is too pittifull to kill it: It is afraid of too great a stocke of grace, because it is afraid of mortification; it knowes a man cannot dye without paine, no more can the olde man; it observes as little increase as it cares for: it holds it no conquest to get victory over secret lusts, and so continues a willing slave unto them.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:26365:111"/>6. Sanctification in all the good it doth, &amp; in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the evill it abstaines, hath a pure end, and aymeth to please God, with the displeasure of men, and deniall of his owne corrupt heart, will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Civility cares more for the offence of such men as in whose favour he would live, than the offence of God, is more strict in mans lawes than Gods; must not displease or deny himselfe, hath more care to be thought good, than to bee good.</p>
            <p>And thus wee see, how civill men who seeme to themselves to outrunne others to heaven, are quite out of the way, and never set foote in the path of holinesse that leades to happinesse: A civill man seemes a sheepe of Christ by his fleece, but his liver is rotten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> those are here reprooved, who thinke this Doctrine needlesse, perhaps impossible; they meane not to be Saints till they be dead, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looke after full sanctification till they come to heaven; and so they frame their lives as if it were absurd to thinke we could be Saints upon earth. But no Saint on earth, none in heaven, such as shall attaine perfect sanctification in heaven, are described to be such as must be written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the living in <hi>Ierusalem, Esay</hi> 4.4. Thou must be such a one as must feele the power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, renewing thy soule, body, and spirit, by which if thou findest not a mastery of all corup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet thou shalt finde a weakening of them all, and a desire and indeavour to subdue them all, with some successe: so as this full sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:26365:111"/>
shall be thy ayme, and so as it shall come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every day more than other.</p>
            <p>Lastly, those are reprooved, who seeme to come to some measure of sanctification, but either fall backe, or rest in these beginnings, caring for no increase in spirituall things. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at all in such standing: for 1. Saving grace is alway growing: 2. As covetous men never think they have golde enough, so Gods children must and doe thinke they have never grace enough.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us stirre up our selves to grow up in holinesse;<note place="margin">

            <p>To helpe us herein we will somewhat at large consider three things.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> in God thinke 1. of his <hi>will,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.3.<note place="margin">1. Of God.</note> 
               <hi>This is the will of God, even your sanctification.</hi> We ought to follow God, if he should call us through hell it selfe, much more in the sweete practise of sanctification, which hath a happy fruite. 2. Of his <hi>promises,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Seeing we have these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of flesh and spirit, and grow up unto full holinesse.</hi> All the promises are made to the practisers of holinesse:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:26365:112"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart.</hi> 3. Of his <hi>glory,</hi> which thou oughtest by all thy endeavour to promote, being the end of thy life, and of thy selfe: but herein especially is our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>glorified, when our light shines before men, Matth.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Of thy selfe.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in thy selfe consider these things: 1. In thy <hi>creation</hi> thou receivedst a soule, a body, faculties and sences, with parts and members from him, and in him thou now livest, movest, and hast thy being; and canst thou doe him too much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in them? Doth any man build an house, but he will looke to dwell in it? Doth any plant an orchard or vineyard, and not looke for usefull fruites to himselfe? Thy selfe art Gods house, thy soule Gods garden, and doth not hee expect not onely fruite of holinesse,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.8.</note> but <hi>much fruite?</hi> 2. In thy <hi>redemption:</hi> the end of which was not onely to deliver thee from the condemnation of sinne, but from thy <hi>vaine conversation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not onely from the guilt and punishment, but from the service and corruption of sinne; and sanctification is an inseperable companion of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. 3. In thy <hi>life</hi> and present estate: thou art a Christian, and professest Christian religion, which onely prescribes the rule of holy life, whereby thou must walke; thou must life like a Christian, that hast communion with Christ, <hi>that walkest in the light as hee is in the light,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. that hast the Spirit of Christ, which perfecteth daily his owne worke, and beautifieth his owne dwelling. 4. In thy <hi>death</hi> and future
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:26365:112"/>
estate: remember thou must die, and onely holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart and life shall attend thy soule, when all things else shall leave it; and <hi>without holinesse thou shalt never see God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. If death shall leave thee unholy, the last judgement shall so find thee. So therefore live now, as thou maist ever live hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Of the grace it selfe.</note> meditate on the grace and worke of holinesse it selfe: 1. what a difficult worke it is, and therefore thou must goe seriously about it; oh the worke of mortification is a painefull work, a man cannot die without paine, no more can the olde man; sinne hath a strong heart, and is loath to die: and therefore as to die is no dallying mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so he that meanes to dally in this businesse, shall never happily proceede in the degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. 2. What an excellent worke it is: for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shall be daily <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. which is not in respect of the nature and essence of God which is incommunicable, but in respect of the most excellent and precious qualities and gifts, bestowed by the Spirit of God on those that are regenerate, wherein we shall be like unto our heavenly Father, and grow up to the similitude of Iesus Christ till he shall be all in all unto us.</p>

            <p>Wee see the <hi>Meanes:</hi> Now wee come to the <hi>Markes,</hi> whereby wee may know, whether wee grow up to full holinesse or no.</p>

His sanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture healeth our corrupt nature. 2. The infusion of morall holinesse into our natures, peculiar to the elect, a receiving of his fulnesse by meanes of union. 3. Separation from the common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the world, unto speciall service; this is made a marke of such as are made partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, to <hi>fly the corruption which is in the world through lust,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.

The <hi>body</hi> is altered, first, in respect of the members, when the same that the flesh most abused, doe most glorifie God in some speciall manner. <hi>Zachary</hi> by his mouth sinned in distrusting God, therefore so soone as hee could speake, with the same mouth hee glorified him. So the woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. that had abused her eyes, haire, and lippes, to wantonnesse, now takes them from Satan, to wash, and wipe, and kisse her Saviour Christ. So in Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that hand that subscribed was first burnt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in respect of the outward fashion there will be a change: if the body have abused meate and drinke for surfetting and drunkennesse, if garments and apparell for pride and wantonnesse, if sports and recreations in excesse or for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, you shall see even in the outward man a checke of all such excesses, and a manifestation that they be not the men they were before sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

This love and measure of it we may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> know, 1. By striving not onely to preserve the measure of holinesse received, but to grow daily to the measure that is wanting, accounting that as yet he hath not attained, <hi>Phil</hi>: 3.12, 13 <hi>I count not my self that I have attained, but one thing I do, I presse hard to the marke, &amp;c.</hi> Keepe still in thee a thirst after the water of the well of life, and Christ will give it thee freely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. A tast of that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, makes a man long after his fill. 2. By a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and constant using the meanes of increase. A worldly man, because hee loves wealth, and money, will take great paines for it, and be labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the meanes. Now <hi>faith purifieth, Acts</hi> 15.9. therefore a godly man labours still for the increase of faith: the <hi>word sanctifieth, Iohn</hi> 17.17. a property of <hi>Saints</hi> is, they are <hi>humbled at his feet to heare his word, Deut.</hi> 33.3. see <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. When we envie not grace to another, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, and love it because it is Gods image, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.30. <hi>Hee must increase, but I must decrease. Moses</hi> the more grace himselfe had, the more hee wished to others, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Enviest thou for my sake? yea I would all Gods people were Prophets.</hi> 4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> True love of holinesse longeth, and wayteth, and sigheth to put off all the corruption of sinne, and attaine that perfect happinesse, wherein is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of holinesse. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Wee that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the first fruites of the Spirit, sigh in our selves,

               <note place="margin">4. Detestation of evill mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in 6 things</note> or dislike of opposites of holinesse; which as it increaseth, so doth holinesse also. Now this is manifest, 1. In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> carefull avoiding things which quench, shake, or hinder grace and holinesse: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.18. <hi>Hee that is begotten of God, keepeth himselfe, and the evill one toucheth him not.</hi> 2. By rising into greater dislike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of corruption, without seeking base extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to say, this is a little sinne, or a small sinne; no, every sinne will swell as a toade in his eyes. 3. By crying out on the <hi>law of the members rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> against the law of the minde, Rom.</hi> 7.23. 4. By complaining of secret and lesser evills, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> were never wont to trouble him. 5. By ceasing from particular and beloved sinnes, as <hi>Ephraim</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> said to his idols, <hi>Get you hence, what have I to doe with you, Hosea</hi> 14.8. my house is taken up alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, here is no roome for you. 6.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:26365:117"/>
to thy former love and liking of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. Disposition to good tryed by 5 signes.</note>The fifth <hi>Marke</hi> is <hi>Disposition</hi> to good duties: this is an argument of soundnesse of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. When thou canst ever set the Lord before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thee, walking with God, contented and glad to have him witnesse and judge of all, both inward sincerity, and outward innocency. 2. When in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all the workes of thy calling thou seekest not so much thine owne things, as the things of Christ, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. 3. When in the sober use of all Gods creatures thou art led to the contemplation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Creatour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.1. 4. If when thou hast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any good duty in any good measure, thou rest not therein, but labour more earnestly to doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it better. 5. If when thou hast either omitted or slightly performed any good dutie, thou be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and so bewailest that which is past, as thou makest it up in duties behinde.</p>
            <p>Now if these be the markes of proceeding in sanctification, how rare is this duty? 1. Where is the man that takes up this order of God, that begins this worke at the spirit of the minde, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that God being a Spirit begins his chiefe worke in the Spirit, and the law the rule of holinesse being spirituall, especially requireth inward sanctity. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Ierusalem, wash thine heart,</hi> first, loathe sinne inwardly, and then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Many will mend their lives, but let their hearts alone: which is all one as to cut off a waste bough, and not to strike at the roote; to seeke to draine a streame, but not meddle with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. 2. Where is the man, that having changed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:26365:117"/>
his understanding from errour to truth, changeth also his will from evill to good? Here many faile, who see what is good and approove it, but themselves are as bad as ever they were. 3. How few refine every part of their life, and bring all the members within the whole rule? who can say, I hate all the evill which I loved, and all the good which like a swine I trampled under feete, offered in the meanes, I now in some measure imbrace and practise? I was intemperate, now sober; wanton and foule, now chaste and pure; a great swearer, now I tremble at an oath: and so in the rest. One that is a foule monster still, may reforme some things, yea many things, yea most; but to come to through sanctification, casts off many: some are just, not mercifull; some have care of honesty, not of godlinesse; some are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in some company than in other:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.6.</note> 
               <hi>few have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to all the commandements.</hi> 4. How many be there, who have made some faire offers of <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Spirit, but have ended in the flesh?</hi> They made men beleeve they had the substance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and would goe through the businesse, but end in meere ceremony, nay scarce that, but are haters of holinesse. Better it had beene for them that they had never beene inlightened, never washed, never purged, than forget they were cleansed. <hi>Now let him that filthy be filthy still, and let him that is holy be holy still, Rev.</hi> 22.11.</p>

               <hi>I. Motive.</hi> Consider, that whatsoever thou

castest thine eyes upon, it calls upon thee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in thy sanctification. If thou lookest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to God, the further thou proceedest, and the greater measure of sanctification thou attainest, the more thou art like him, and the more is he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.8. <hi>In this my Father is glorified, that ye bring forth much fruite.</hi> If to the Angels, these holy and ministring spirits incessantly expect his charges, and unweariably execute the same: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they are joyfull witnesses of thy profiting in grace and holinesse: for if they rejoyce at the first peeping of holinesse in thy conversation, how joyfull will they bee when it proceedeth to perfection in conversation? If thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest round about thee to thy brethren, thou must bee so farre from offending or scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, that thou must be ready by all good offices to helpe them, to edifie them, especially by a godly and zealous example: these must behold the shine of thy light, both for the glorifying of God, and their owne direction and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at least thou must be <hi>blamelesse in the midst of a naughty generation, holding out the word of life, Phil.</hi> 2.14, 15.

            <p>Lastly, if thou lookest as low as hell, there thou shalt see the Divells and wicked Angels as busie as bees to promote their kingdome, and to pull all men, yea even thy selfe into their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and condemnation: And should not this adde courage to thee to set up the kindome of God with all thy power, every where, but especially in thy selfe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. Motive.</hi> Consider why God hath elected, called, justified us, whereas he might have left us in our common masse, and passed by us as well as a great part of the world, as good every way as our selves?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Election.</note>
               <hi>First,</hi> he hath <hi>elected us, that wee might be holy,</hi> and that not in a small measure, but also <hi>unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before him in love, Eph.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>God hath predestinate us to be made like the image of his Sonne:</hi> How and wherein? <hi>Answ.</hi> Partly in humility, partly in holinesse, that as hee by an humble and holy life went on to his glorie, so must we.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> why or to what hath God called us, but unto holinesse? 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.7. <hi>God hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to uncleannesse, but unto holinesse,</hi> yea unto full holinesse, that as obedient children we should resemble our heavenly Father, who is holinesse it selfe: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye also in all manner of holy conversation, because it is written, Be yee holy as I am holy, Levit.</hi> 26.6. Now the word <hi>(as)</hi> signifies not an equality in measure, which we can as little attaine, as a spoon can containe the Ocean; but onely a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or resemblance in our nature renewed and made obedient to the rule. 1. He is <hi>throughly</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without want or sinne: so must thou strive to be. 2. He is holy at all <hi>times,</hi> in the day, and in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:26365:119"/>
the night: so thou must never lay aside thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, neither on the Saboth, nor on the weeke day or night. 3.

He is holy in his <hi>word,</hi> in his <hi>workes,</hi> in all his <hi>wayes</hi>: so must thou in thy words, workes, and whole conversation. Heare this thou that hearest the Gospell, which is Gods voice calling thee to holinesse: Leade henceforth a profane life at thy perill: He that calls thee is holy;<note place="margin">Heb. 12, 14.</note> the calling is to holinesse, yea to conformity in his owne holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: aime at it, else thou shalt never partake of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> thy justification tells thee, that Christ dwells in thee by faith,<note place="margin">Iustification.</note> and that thy heart is built up to be an habitation of God by the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Now the blessed Spirit cannot dwell any where but in a Temple dedicated unto him, where the olde man is daily put off, and the new man put on daily; where the power of sinne is daily weakened, and the grace of holinesse daily getteth power and strength; for Gods Spirit will not dwell any where, but as the Master of an house, as a ruler and commander: Neither can any attaine the comfort or sense of his justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by the undivided companion of it, which is sanctification: and as this growes, so ariseth the measure of sense and comfort of this present happinesse: for <hi>he that doth righteousnesse, is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III. Motive.</hi> Consider what thou art, namely,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:26365:120"/>
a Christian: in the very name thou professest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, and consequently to <hi>walke in the light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>as hee is in the light.</hi> A Christian must adorne Christian profession by Christian life and conversation. A Christian, called so of Christ, must shew in his whole course, that hee is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Christs <hi>annoynting,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.20. 1. Shew thy selfe a Christian <hi>Prophet,</hi> by profiting in the knowledge of God, and instructing others in the same. 2. Shew thy selfe a Christian <hi>Priest,</hi> who hast received the annoynting, by <hi>offering thy selfe an holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
               <hi>acceptable, living, and reasonable sacrifice.</hi> Offer thy prayers, and the sacrifices of prayses, those <hi>calves of thy lippes.</hi> Offer the sacrifices of almes and mercy; for <hi>with such sacrifices God is well pleased, Heb.</hi> 13.16. Offer thy life and dearest blood a sweete sacrifice for the chiefe and high Priest of our profession, if God call thee unto the same. 3. Shew thy selfe a Christian <hi>King,</hi> by raising all thy power against thine enemies, and aduersaries of salvation; by defending and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thy Christian liberty, in which thou art set; by ruling over thy selfe, and keeping a strait hand and authority over thy lusts and affections; make them subjects: by carrying thy selfe as a King, with clemency, meeknesse, liberality, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring and judging every thing according to the Lawes of Christ enacted in the Parliament of heaven. What? a Christian, and an epicure? a Christian swearer? a Christian adulterer? a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian gamester, lyer, &amp;c. <hi>quàm malè conveniunt?</hi> how harsh is this to the eare of men, of God much more?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:26365:120"/>
               <hi>IV. Motive.</hi> Consider, that hee that is once truly good, growes from good to better, and so is best at last. Our Saviour plainly prooves, that he who hath the least measure of sound fruite, his fruite shall increase: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch that beareth fruite, the Father purgeth it, that it may beare more fruite.</hi> And this is the property of such as are <hi>planted in the house of our God, to flourish in his courts, and be more fruitfull in their age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea 6.4.</note> which is cleane against the course of nature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.13. Such therefore as seemed to come on, but within a while their <hi>righteousnesse is as the morning dew,</hi> or fall backe and wither; who are worst at last, (as evill men must be) were never good. Were they ever good, that are so soone remooved to another Gospell, even in dayes of peace, to whom Christ was preached, of whom professed, into whom they were baptized? or what hath bewitched them to such apostacy? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. Were they ever good, who in stead of reading, prayer and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons formerly frequented, are growne to cards, dice, drinking, swearing, and a distaste of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preachers and sermons? Were they ever good that hate goodnesse, or to heare of fulnesse of holinesse, or of their owne idlenesse? Alas empty tubbs! here was never any thing but a sound, no soundnesse at all.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V. Motive.</hi> Consider how wee are affected in inferiour things, and shame our selves for want of the like affection for the increase of better things than they. 1. We never thinke our grounds, our orchards, our gardens, our cattell fruitefull
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:26365:121"/>
enough: If a man have a peece of land that brings forth but a small croppe, he will be at paines and cost to make it more fruitfull: Alas! shall wee have more care of our grounds than of our hearts, to make them fruitfull and yeelding to the laud and praise of the great husbandman? Or thinke we our hearts lesse barren than the worst condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ground? Let this provoke us, if we have gotten our hearts to bring forth thirty folde, to labour them till they bring sixty fold, and let them not rest there till they yeeld an hundred fold. This Christ commends to us in that good ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.8. This the Apostle calls for, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.1. <hi>to exceede more and more.</hi> 2. In the matter of money and wealth:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Aristoph. in Pluto.</hi>
               </note> how doe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre themselves to adde to their gaines, to make one pound five, and from five to ten, and so adde hundreds, and rise to thousands, sucking profit from every thing insatiably as the horse-leach? How thrifty husbands, 1. forecast to get, and plod to increase their stocke? 2. Carefully save that which is gotten, avoiding expences, &amp; much more excesses? 3. Having got a good portion, yet still desire and seeke more? for hee would have none before him in wealth, if hee had his minde. 4. Lay out part or whole of that he hath, for a greater gaine? Should not wee be now as thrifty for our soules as for our bodies? Is not a stocke of grace better than a stocke of goods? Who but a doting worldling would not thinke wisdome better than wealth, and a graine of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse better than a talent of earthly happinesse?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:26365:121"/>
Is a graine of grace so precious, and is not an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of it worth our sweate and labour? Why doe wee not as thrifty Christians awaken our dull spirits, to forecast with the wise Virgins to get such store of this oyle, as to carry us through to the wedding chamber? Should wee neede to be stirred to save that which wee get so hardly, avoiding the expences, and sinfull exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which eate out our stocke, and prodigally waste our estate in grace? Why stand wee still, having found a little veine of golde, namely of grace much more precious than golde, and not holde on our labour to finde the rich mine which it leadeth unto? Why doe not wee with the wise Merchant resolve to lay out our whole estate for this pearle? Or should wee hide our talent in a napkin, and not lay it out, or employ it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by use and returne it increaseth? It would grieve a man to see so many good husbands for the world, to be such starke unthrifts for their soules.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI. Motive.</hi> Consider we the meanes that God hath affoorded us for our growth in sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 1. Gods readinesse and care to fit us for the duty, so as no want is in him: for while hee pleaseth to continue any meanes unto us, hee shewes his readinesse (though wee faile in using the meanes) to bring us to the end; seeing hee supplieth meanes of growth, he is ready in them to adde more grace. This blessed meanes is the sweete liberty of the preaching of the Gospell, by which he offereth to make our hearts of evill
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:26365:122"/>
good, of good better; he offereth by it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worke faith where it is wanting, but to adde to faith that which is wanting to it, and so to bring it to certainty and assurance. So also the assistance of his Spirit in prayer:<note place="margin">1 Thess. 3.10.</note> Spirituall guides and Pastors: and the example of the godly as a cloud going before us. Why should we frustrate God and our owne soules of the end of so happy meanes? 2. Our owne reckoning and account, which will bee expected answerable to such meanes: <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. <hi>To whom more is given, of him shall more be required:</hi> so to whom God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords <hi>more meanes</hi> of holinesse, hee expects <hi>more fruite</hi> of holinesse. Never any Nation, never any Age was before us, no nor neare us, in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meanes: Never had our fathers that light, that constant Ministery, those encouragements, those precepts, those many examples which we enjoy: they counted the crummes of our table li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall fare. To heare the prayers read in English made them weepe for joy. To have a peece of Scripture translated was the hazard of their lives. We reade of some that did give a whole loade of hay for a few chapters of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in English. Two or three could not conferre together of any good thing in those tyrannous times, but they might have scaped farre better for felony. Yet oh the holinesse, the honesty, the zeale and grace of those godly men, whose crowne is, that they were as farre afore us in grace as wee are before them in meanes: If ever Age could blush, ours might be it. And as the Land in generall, so this

               <p>That Christians must not onely labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a full measure of grace, but also to keepe it. So it is as commendable to keep our selves blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as to make our selves blamelesse.<note place="margin">

No watch is sufficient against that subtill Serpent, that windes himselfe into us insensibly; every faculty as an eare, and every sense as a window lets him into us, to come in and spoyle us: and therefore it is necessary wee should labour to keepe that we have gotten.</p>

Excellent and precious things are to be kept most charily; mens gold, silver, jewells, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are carefully kept, but their lives much more, because they are precious unto them. But of all treasures, our <hi>spirits, soules, and bodies,</hi> are of most incomparable value, nothing so worth kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as this. <hi>First,</hi> what a precious blood was shed for to redeeme them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if these be lost, what price can recover them? what shall a man give for the recompence? Nothing but the blood of Christ; tread that under foote nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it: a treasure must be kept most carefully: but a godly mans heart is a good treasurie, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out good things.

               <p n="4">4. The necessity of keeping our selves blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is exceeding great.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note> 1. If we looke upon our selves in our naturall inclinations to soyle and blacke our selves: or whether we looke upon our <hi>whole,</hi> or <hi>parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the whole frame of mans heart is evill, the whole naturall <hi>spirit imagineth evill continually, Gen.</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> and for the parts: 1. The <hi>conscience</hi> is darkened, by the blacke darknesse of ignorance; and impured by a thousand sinnes of most ugly hue. 2. The <hi>thoughts,</hi> which in the day of Gods appearing shall either <hi>accuse or excuse, Rom.</hi> 2.15. are naturally vaine, roving, and stragling from God. 3. The <hi>affections,</hi> which are of great force to good or evill. If they be sinfull, they are as wings to carry us as slaves to the most barbarous and unnaturall evills, and ever pulling us aside to the world and lusts: As <hi>Cain</hi> to hate and murder his innocent brother: <hi>Cham</hi> to lay open his fathers nakednesse: <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray the most righteous Sonne of God. But if they bee rightly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are powerfull instruments of excellent duties, and as wings to carry us to the high pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of Christianity. All excellencies have beene brought out of the strong affections of grace.</p>

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:26365:124"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Looke upon our selves in the presence of grace, the cleanest house will gather soyle if it be not daily swept; the brightest vessells take rust, if not often scoured and oyled: enemies chased will turne head againe, trees lopped will grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, nature expelled returnes againe, fire quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched will kindle againe: and therefore all watch is little enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Looke on our selves in that to which we are called and set apart by grace, to be sonnes of God, Temples of the Spirit of God, mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for God and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to come into us and suppe with us. How carefull are we to cleanse our houses from all filth, when we are to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to an honourable friend; whom wee are sure will be ready to pry into every corner, as the Lord will surely doe when hee commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>This serves to discover the generall errour of men, who, if they had innocency it selfe, could not stand by themselves without watchfulnesse, yet can keepe any thing better than themselves, their horses, their swine, cattle, their money, their wares; but very few thinke they neede to be so carefull to keepe themselves. They keepe no watch over their thoughts, they are free; nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their words, words are but winde: nor did they ever see their soules, and therefore care not to keepe them. How carefull are wise men to keepe themselves out of the lurch of the law; lest by word or deed they should forfeit any of their outward estate, much more their liberty, lives,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:26365:124"/>
&amp;c? But how carelesse are the same men of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themselves out of the lurch of Gods law, and out of the actions which forfeit the whole estate of grace, the liberty and life of their soules. And yet, 1. Is not thy charge straighter to keepe thy soule than any thing else? 2. Is any thing so exposed to robbers and spoylers, so many, so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, so resolutely bent to mischiefe thee? 3. Is any losse so irrecoverable, so irrepairable? 4. Can any thing thou keepest so fast doe thee good, when thou hast lost thy selfe; whatsoever thou most carefully keepest else, that thou receivest not for thy selfe, but for others: and wilt thou fondly save all for others, with the losse of thy selfe? Alas! our folly, that needes so many warnings and motives for the keeping of our selves.</p>
               <p>Be we incited to keepe our selves blamelesse.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> Wherein observe, 1. The generality. 2. The time. 3. The order. 4. The rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for the <hi>generality,</hi> our Apostle saith the <hi>whole man,</hi> consisting of <hi>soule, body</hi>; and the whole <hi>spirit, soule, and body:</hi> for <hi>bonum est ex causis inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, malum ex quolibet defectu,</hi> if any part be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, the whole is blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> keepe all or none: God will have all or none; no polluted part shall get into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, hee will have no part of a divided man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Saints tooke themselves bound to keepe all. Above all <hi>David</hi> will looke to his <hi>heart,</hi> and looke to his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and hee will have an eye to his <hi>will, I have vowed and will performe:</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:26365:125"/>
and then to his <hi>mouth,</hi> he will <hi>keepe that as with a bid and bridle:</hi> and to his <hi>wayes, Psal.</hi> 39.1. Then he will lift up his <hi>hands</hi> to the Law, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine his <hi>feete</hi> from every evill way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The danger of not looking to the whole: a thorne in the foote may fester; a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene in one part is deadly: one poyson in the body, one part without armour is the ruine of the whole.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2</note>2. For the <hi>time.</hi> We must <hi>now</hi> keepe our selves. Men thinke they can never be Saints till they come to heaven, and professe they cannot bee blamelesse here: But our Text saith, we must be blamelesse <hi>till</hi> the day of Christ: Neglect thy selfe for the present, and give thy selfe lost for ever; sowe now to the flesh, and reape corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">3</note>3. The <hi>order.</hi> First the inside, <hi>spirit, and soule,</hi> and then the <hi>body.</hi> First wash the inside, saith our Saviour; get faith which is a purifier, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christs righteousnesse: for, 1. Can wee draw <hi>a cleane thing from that which is uncleane, Iob</hi> 14.4. or sweete fruite from a bitter roote. 2. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan lyeth closest here, as a serpent in thickets. 3. It is the most compendious way, to damme a streame in the fountaine; to quench the fire in the sparke, else if it live within it will kindle and flame, on tinder or tow: where the disease begins, there must begin the remedie. 4. God lookes out of what treasurie good things come; if not out of the good treasury of the heart, if not from a pure heart, if not from faith, all is sinne: hence the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:26365:125"/>
workes of unregenerate men, as good in shew, and beautifull, are rejected; because they flow not from a pure fountaine, and mites with the heart put to them weigh downe many glorious workes. 5. Distinguish thy selfe from the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, he washeth the outside, <hi>Pilate</hi> washeth his hands, not his heart, as if sinne stucke onely in the fingers ends: the harlot wipes her mouth, and it was not shee.</p>
               <p>But wee are to know that the Lord is as well angry with intentions, and inward impurity;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> as with outward enormities. And therefore let us labour to keepe, first, our <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>soules,</hi> and then our <hi>bodies</hi> unblameable.</p>
               <p>Here we will somewhat largely consider cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine directions for each of them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Directions for the <hi>Spirit.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Labour to have <hi>a right spirit renewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, Psal.</hi> 51.10. Now to a <hi>right spirit</hi> there goe five things. 1. <hi>Illumination,</hi>

The Agent is God alone, who gives light to the blinde, who takes away the vaile, and makes the scales fall from <hi>Paules</hi> eyes in his conversion. The companion is sound conversion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. the turning of the heart to the Lord, and the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the vaile joyned; and the signe of it is,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:26365:126"/>
a base estimation of the world with the profits, pleasures, and preferments of it, the pursuing of which makes most men so blame-worthy in the day of Christ. 2. <hi>Poverty</hi> of spirit, which stands in the sense, sorrow, shame, and hatred of sinne, and cannot stand with selfe-wisdome, or high-mindednesse, or a proud spirit puft up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, whom God resists: but <hi>a contrite spirit</hi> is acceptable, and <hi>the poore in spirit are blessed,</hi> and blamelesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. 3. <hi>Purity</hi> of spirit, which is attained by daily bringing in and increasing of the graces of the Spirit, as faith, love of God, sincerity, charity, mercy, meeknesse, &amp;c. these fruites of the Spirit argue cleannesse of spirit, though it were formerly never so foule and blame-worthy: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Decke the minde with graces.</hi> 4. <hi>Spirituall worship, Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Whom I serve in my spirit:</hi> not bodily, formally, hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, coldly, but with my whole heart, in sincerity and fervency. This fervency is a motion of Gods Spirit, inflaming the spirit of the beleever with great love of God, and hatred of whatsoever hee hateth. And where this spirituall worship stands up in the Spirit, downe must <hi>Dagon</hi> goe, and all the idols that men have set up in their hearts, downe goes the externall and carnall worship of civill men, who (what ever they pretend) respect not in their spirit the worship and service of God, but their owne pleasures, ends, and praise, and that in their most slightly duties. 5. The <hi>testimony of the Spirit,</hi> that thou art the child of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. This testimony is sure, when the Spirit of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:26365:126"/>
God renewes our spirits, and upon firme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing grounds makes us able to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, working sound tranquillity in our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through our union with Christ, boldnesse and confidence towards God, fervent love of God, constant obedience, with other fruites, not common or competent to hypocrites. This testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony sealeth up our acceptance, yea the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of children: The spirit that wants any of these is not a <hi>right</hi> or <hi>renewed spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> labour (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

               </p>
               <p>The companions of this purity of conscience are two. <hi>First,</hi> a frameing of conscience to the rule of the word, which is a torch-light for the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:26365:127"/>
direction of it: for, the conscience being the eye of the soule, must be lightsome, not erronious, blinde, or doubtfull. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a studie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the purity, and himselfe unspotted before God and man, and no man hath purity of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that wanteth this care.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. Clearing his master.</note>2. It must be a <hi>clearing</hi> conscience, taking the Masters part against all accusers. It selfe is not blamelesse, unlesse it can justly pronounce the Master blamelesse. And this is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> when it beares witnesse concerning our <hi>sinnes</hi>: 1. That there is no sinne we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but we have repented the same. 2. There is none committed, but wee hate it, wee purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and keepe a watch that it be never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> when it witnesseth concerning our <hi>persons,</hi> that we are now righteous and justified by faith in Iesus Christ: of uncleane blackmores we are washed and made white in his blood, and sonnes of God; who of an enemy is become a friend and Father to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when it witnesseth concerning our <hi>graces</hi>; that as by the former wee are freed from the guilt of sinne, so we are now freed from the power of sinne, and are no more servants of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, but now our conscience tells us we are in part sanctified: that the evill wee doe, wee hate; and love the good wee doe not: and that in the inner man we delight in the Law of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> when it witnesseth concerning our <hi>course</hi> and actions, that now they are wrought
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:26365:127"/>
according to God, by the warrant of his word, and because he hath commanded so to doe them. Happy is that man that his conscience tells him, that his will is now framed to Gods will; and in regard of Evangelicall obedience, which stands in true purposes and endeavours, hee may say, since the time of his calling unto the grace of the Gospell, with the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have lived in all good conscience untill this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It must be a <hi>peaceable</hi> conscience, in that hee hath done or not done: it is at peace with God,<note place="margin">3. Peaceablenes</note> and with it selfe. This is when it excuseth the person aright both for his person, and for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>First,</hi> for his person, as now reconciled, justified, accepted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> his actions, as having a true desire and endeavour to please God in all things. Now the conscience being truly peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it riseth up to be truly joyfull, which makes the heart merry and cheerefull, as a continuall feast: neither wants he any good cheare that hath it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15. Nor wants hee good company that hath a good conscience, he can rejoyce alone, without all other company or comforts. The heart is held up in absence of all worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and in presence of all worldly evills, and none can take away the joy of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, but with this difference: 1. A bad conscience hath some scratch on the outside, and sometimes a deeper gash, and an incurable wound, but it never goes on to godly sorrow, as a good conscience doth. 2.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> a good conscience watcheth to all good duties, and occasions, desirous to please God in all things, and at all times, according to the conscience enlightened. This pure, clearing, peaceable and waking conscience, is necessary to an unblameable and renewed spirit.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> seeing the true evidences of the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and holy temper of the spirit,<note place="margin">To purenesse of spirit are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired holy thoughts.</note> are holy and well guided thoughts, wee must carefully looke to our <hi>thoughts and cogitations.</hi> Here 1. Choose them so as thou be sure thy heart be a receptacle of holy thoughts:<note place="margin">1.

And if thou hatest them, put away the evill of your thoughts: and <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his thoughts,</hi> knowing that evill thoughts are as damnable as evill actions: <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. pray if thy thoughts may be forgiven; which implies guilt. Some thou shalt finde wandering, roving thoughts, which must be taken up as vagrants, and corrected, lest as <hi>Dinah</hi> thou be defiled and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:26365:128"/>
corrupted with fleshly lusts; passe them away quickly. Some other thou shalt find idle thoughts but unnecessary: send them away, harbour no idle thoughts, nor yet cast them out without cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and disgrace. Some are perhaps lawfull, but lesse necessary, put these of till another time, that the more necessary may take up the roome. Some are unruly thoughts rising up against against God or men, thoughts of infidelity, of revenge, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable thoughts against Gods servants and ordinances: all such disordered and proude thoughts must be brought into the subjection of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Watch them well, being so infinite,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>To enforce this watch, know, it differenceth from an hypocrite: <hi>First,</hi> an hypocrite can watch over words and actions in respect of man, but a godly man watcheth over his thoughts; onely the true sanctified man makes conscience of the tenth commandement, for the government of his thoughts and desires. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it differenceth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:26365:129"/>
from a wicked man, who dare not act many evils, but none so foule, but hee dare insatiably minde and contemplate them. Here is a difference; whereas wicked men are most carelesse of their thoughts; the godly have most complained of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and then have beene most truly comforted in them, whiles the conscience of thoughts hath beene a true triall of their since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

O how might the minde be fed and ravished with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations! what sweetnesse might a man swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and season the dayes of his vanity withall, if he would minde heavenly things, and thinke on the way thither? Is it not a description of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent beleevers, to <hi>thinke on his name? Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the most necessary &amp; profitable thoughts are, 1. to thinke often of our sinnes, both to call to minde some sinne past unrepented; as also to prevent some sinne thrusting in. 2. To thinke on good duties, to excite to some duty neglected, and to apprehend occasion and season of some offered unto us 3. Of the vanity of this life, and our departure hence. 4. Of Gods comming to judgement, and our finall account and reckoning. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.22. <hi>To them that thinke on good things, shall be mercy and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:26365:129"/>Now whereas some thinke thoughts free; and others conceit liberty, and impossibility, and most no necessity of this guiding the conscience and thoughts: To them I say, <hi>First,</hi> as thoughts be so are words, and actions: out of the heart commeth thefts, adulteries; therefore rectifie these. <hi>Secondly,</hi> good thoughts are evidences of the Spirits presence, being his immediate motions, wee of ourselves not able to thinke one good thought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God will call them to strict account, and in judgement make inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after them, <hi>their thoughts shall accuse or else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse one another, Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> even good thoughts are recompenced: <hi>David</hi> had but a thoughts to build the house of God, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded it with building him an house, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing him a kingdome, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <hi>I thought I would confesse my sinne, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavest me all.</hi> The Prodigall thought to returne, and his father thought to meete him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>memory</hi> must be made and kept <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> unblameable. And that is two wayes:<note place="margin">To a pure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is required a sanctified memory.</note> 1.

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Directions to keepe the soule unblamable. Every man may holde himselfe bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and charged by God with the safe custody of his owne soule under God: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Take heede to thy selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently.</hi> A man would be loath to forfeit a joynt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by heedlesnesse: how carefully doe men looke to their eyes, heads, hands, and every member, and the least part of the body, and yet more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the whole body; and this nature teacheth every man: But is not the soule that better part, that calls for so much more care and circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and this grace teacheth us to keepe our soule above all; for if a man lose his soule, what recompence shall he give for it?</p>
               <p>Now because that in the soule is included, 1. the heart, 2. the will, 3. our affections, all these faculties in the soule must be kept safe as the soule it selfe, and layes upon us a necessity to watch them narrowly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for the keeping of thy heart the precept is,<note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:26365:130"/>
keepe that sound; so the soule, the heart, desires, and choyces, are to be chiefly intended, for thence are the issues of life or death. And indeed according to the well tending or neglect hereof the constant course of holinesse is either furthered or hindered. Besides, nature in the framing of mans body begins with the heart, and the liver, and other inward vitalls, and comes last to the face and other outward parts; teaching us the method in grace where to begin our frame: keepe the heart well and unblameable,<note place="margin">Rules to the keeping of the heart.</note> and all will be well. And for this end observe some rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I. Keepe it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> therefore if thou wilt keepe thy heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, thou must keepe it <hi>humble,</hi> it must be an humble and contrite heart that God will not reject, and a broken heart is a sacrifice of Gods delight: the soundnesse of the heart is the through breaking of it; the plow of the law must rend up the fallowes of our hearts, and fit it for seede: this must helpe both the rotting and rooting of the weedes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4. This is called a melted heart in <hi>Iosiah</hi>: for as golde can never be approoved and purified before it be melted, no more can the heart till it be a melted heart. It is called the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of the heart, with circumcision not made with hands, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. wherein the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne of the heart is removed, sinfull flesh, and beloved lusts are wounded, the party put to paine, and made sore as the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> in parting with a peece of his owne flesh.</p>
               <p>This exercise of painefull mortification of sinne is the entrance into possession of a good heart, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:26365:131"/>
the grounds of all soundnesse in religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they onely prove unsound and rumous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion who never were soundly humbled, nor traded in selfe-deniall, as that building, when the foolish builder would not be at paine to diggge deepe whereby to lay a firme and sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">II. Keepe it clean.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> then see thy heart be not onely an humble heart, but a <hi>cleane heart: Blessed are the pure in heart, Matth.</hi> 5. striving after inward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as well as outward: For these an hypocrite can resist, an hypocrite can wash the outside, and may seeme to others to be pure and blamelesse: But an heart desirous to free it selfe from blame, deadly hates naturall pollutions, filthinesse of heart, vile thoughts and lusts; and because it cannot be cleane without faith, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purifier, it labours for the increase of faith in the meanes, to apprehend Christs merits and holinesse. And because the word is a meanes of purifying and cleansing the heart, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.9. and Christ saith they are all cleane by the word, he will shew himselfe in embracing the word, in heeding of it, and framing himselfe according to the rules of it, and apply his heart unto it. And because a fusty vessell is not fit for sweete wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he will still and still be cleansing his heart, that it may be capable of the word. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by nature the heart is foule, and doth every day contract some filthinesse, wash it with the blood of Christ, and get neare unto Christ to have part in his holinesse, and get the beesome
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:26365:131"/>
of the Law to sweepe it daily; and by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of repentance and mortification, daily part with the uncleannesse of flesh and spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> see it be a <hi>single</hi> and <hi>sincere heart,</hi> called a <hi>true heart, Heb.</hi> 10.22.<note place="margin">III. Keep it sincere</note> 
                  <hi>Let us draw neere to God with a true heart,</hi> void of guile, of deceit, of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation: with such an heart as <hi>Nathaniels</hi> was, commended by Christ, <hi>a true Israelite in whom was no guile.</hi> This is the heart of Gods delight, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. Now you shall know the single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this, it is not one heart, in one estate,<note place="margin">To know a single heart.</note> in one company, and another in another; but the same in sicknesse and health, on the Saboth and on the weeke day, the same in tryall as in peace: but if there be any difference, a single heart will be better in a bad age, and most carefull among a most carelesse generation: true grace is like light, it shines brightest in the darkest roome, and like fire hottest in the coldest and sharpest weather.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You shall know a good heart by this, it cares rather to bee good than seeme so, it is more carefull to have grace than seeme to have it, it doth not onely abstaine from evill but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. True godlinesse and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart consists in the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it doth not onely forbeare the sinne it loved, but loathes it, as the sicke stomack-doth loathe that meate most, that it once sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited on, and what once cast up, it ever hateth it.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> in matter of <hi>obedience</hi> both active and passive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Active,</hi> If the Law require duties to be done to God or man, there God expresseth his will: frame now thy will to such duties, be they never so difficult, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in sacrificing his sonne; never so dangerous, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in praying to the God of heaven, even under the sentence of death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Passive,</hi> in any crosse or affliction upon thy selfe, or others: when God reveales his will, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine thy will with his, as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I held my tongue, and spake nothing, because thou (Lord) didst it.</hi> There must be but one will betweene God and a faithfull soule, betweene Christ and a Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How may I know my will thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, renewed, freed, and framed to God?</p>

               <p n="1">1. In respect of it selfe: it will not runne before,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:26365:134"/>
but will waite upon sanctified knowledge, and renewed reason; it will not inthrall the light of the minde to inordinate desires: it will be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving still what is <hi>the good and acceptable will of God.</hi> It will resolve and purpose that so long time as it is in the flesh, to <hi>walke after the will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou shalt know it in regard of sinne. 1. It is resolute in resistance of sinne, and the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for although the will renewed admit sinne, in respect of corruption, yet it selfe is in great part set against sinne, that it willeth it not fully, it purposeth not to sinne: as <hi>David, I vowed I will keepe thy judgements</hi>; it hath a fast purpose to cleave to God: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.104. and <hi>hates all the wayes of falshood.</hi> 2. When it yeelds to sinne, it is with griefe, it doth not sleepe in sinne so but that the heart waketh. So the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. he even hateth sinne while he is a doing of it, <hi>I hate that I doe.</hi> 3. After sinne it riseth timely by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: if he fall into sinne <hi>he hardens not his heart, Prov.</hi> 28.14. he wills it not neither before nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is a strugling and a reluctation in him against it: and thus you may know the will right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of good duties: it will not onely be well-doing, but chearefull in well-doing, he doth good duties willingly, freely. There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in doing one and the same action betweene a good man and a wicked man: the worke of the will renewed is not onely to take opportunity to doe good, but seeke opportunity to doe it; it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:26365:135"/>
will not doe good of constraint, but will doe it with willingnesse; he will doe it cheerefully, as a good Pastour feedes his flocke not by <hi>constraint,</hi> but of a <hi>willing minde,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Why should wee thus looke to our wills?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. First,</hi> the state of Christianity is rather a willing, than a doing the will of God: thou that canst doe no more, wouldst thou doe lesse? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> no greater plague can befall a man, than to be given up to his owne will, the holding to a mans owne will, is the losse of the will and soule too. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as thy will is pleased with the sinne, so it shall be revenged in the sorrow of it: that will of thine that will not be compelled to obey, shall be compelled to suffer: all the plagues of sinne by a just recompence are laid upon the will, as his sinne was a resistance, and renouncing of the will of God: for in hell no sinner shall ever obtaine what hee would, but shall ever sustaine what hee would not. Thus God brings the wayes of the wilfull sinner upon his owne head, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. To keepe the soule blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions must be narrowly watched.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to keepe the soule blamelesse we must narrowly watch all our <hi>affections,</hi> wherein the soule moves it selfe every where: for man by his fall hath lost, not his affections, but the holinesse and rectitude of them; for now man naturally hateth the Lord and his image, in his word, in his servants, and graces, he feares and flies what hee should most joy and delight in, that is, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; he joyes in swallowing the pleasures of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:26365:135"/>
sinne, the baytes of his perdition; hee is angry and impatient at God himselfe, as <hi>Ionas,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a rageing madnesse causelesly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperately on any occasion. And therefore we must fly to the grace of regeneration which doth not abolish affections, but the disordered moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, and restores them towards their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall rectitude and goodnesse. Where this worke of grace is not, and where the spirit hath laid no bridle upon the affections, no marvaile if that soule runne riot into all unruly lusts, and make it selfe blame-worthy, and guilty every moment of foule sinnes. Yea where this grace is, care must be to preserve it even in every affection, the least disorder of any of which is enough to impure the soule and leave it under blame.</p>
               <p>Now the rules of keeping the affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable: and then for the reasons.<note place="margin">How to keepe the affections unblameable. Rules.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> To keepe thy affections unblameable, thou must labour (seeing they cannot be unblameable if they be not good in the rise) to get a good rise for thy affections, a good motion must be from a good mover, labour to see who is the mover of thy affections, whether the Spirit of God, or the wicked spirit, or thine owne carnall spirit. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent are those affections that are moved by the Spirit of God, as when feare, anger, love, joy, griefe, are 1. grounded on just causes, 2. guided by the rule of renewed reason, for the Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver moves but according to the word: 3. tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in ordinate measure, now they become servants of grace. Whereas if thy owne carnall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:26365:136"/>
spirit move them, contrary to the word, for their subject, object, manner, or measure; now they turne enemies to God, and to thine owne soule.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Be sure they be carried upon right objects onely, set thy affections where Gods Spirit would set them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Right obiects of affections.</note>Here first, the proper object of love is God himselfe; and not for his gifts but for himselfe: and of Iesus Christ, whom if any man love not, let him be accursed; and that not as a Iesus onely but as a Lord: And then the things of God, wee must covet the most excellent gifts, and with <hi>Mary choose the better part,</hi> even our part in the Gospell and word of Christ: and then entirely love the friends of God, all our delight must be in the Saints that excell in vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the object of our anger is sinnes, not persons, nor so much the sinnes of others, as our owne which are nearer us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the object of our joy, is pardon of sinne, Gods favour and countenance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. It is wrong placed when it is in the creature, not in the Creatour, when in the gift, not in the giver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the object of our patience, is evills of punishment which we must patiently suffer, but not evills of sinne as <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> of our feare the true object is God, more for his goodnesse than greatnesse; more for his mercy than justice: <hi>Mercy is with thee to be feared, Psal.</hi> 130.4. more lest we offend him than
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:26365:136"/>
be offended by him: And so in the rest. What a businesse now is it to keepe our affections upon allowed and warrantable objects?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> In these best objects, see they be most vehement and intense. To doe this observe these rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> bestow on the best things the best affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: thou must love the Lord thy God with all thy soule, all thy heart and strength; nay more, thou must delight thy selfe in the Lord, which goes beyond love, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.4. delight thy selfe in the Lord, make him thy chiefe, seeke God himselfe, the peace of God, the favour of God, the glory of God with most fervent affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> love and affect all things in God, and for God, and God onely for himselfe; thou must love nothing like him, much lesse above him, and least of all against him: in all his creatures, in all his actions, in all his gifts labour to taste his sweetnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.8. true love of the word is to love God in his word, the true love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is to love God in our neighbour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> get your affections more to heaven than earth, as an higher and more noble object, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2. it is not enough to affect heavenly things unlesse thou doest it with the chiefest of thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things below,</hi> that is, comparatively: for two Masters cannot be served with like affection, we must seeke spirituall and heavenly things simply and absolutely, as being simply good, and to be affected and asked, whatsoever become of other
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:26365:137"/>
things; but temporall and earthly with condition and limitation, as being but conditionally good at the best.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IIII.</hi> Hate the worst things most. The worst thing of all is sinne, it is simply evill, and so is nothing else: wee must then hate sinne more than punishment; sinne simply and directly resisteth Gods glory, so doth not punishment, makes for it it in the manifestation of his justice. A wise man should rather chuse hell than Gods offence. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for nothing so much as thy owne sinne, count nothing so shamefull as that, and thy selfe for it; feare the evill of sinne more than the evill of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because evill of sinne is more evill.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Rejoyce in nothing so much as in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne, the righteousnesse of Christ, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and that thy name is written in the booke of life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. Get Gods image into thy affections, frame thy affections to God, for matter, manner, and measure, to love or hate most where God loveth and hateth, for so doth the man after Gods owne heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God loveth his Sonne Iesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all men and Angels, so must then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian esteeme Iesus Christ above ten thousand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God loveth his word dearely as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, being a resemblance of himselfe in all his Attributes; so must thou love the word as God himselfe, nothing so dearely, nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>Oh how love I thy word, all the day long it is my delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God loveth the congregation and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:26365:137"/>
of his people, the places of his worship, he layeth <hi>the gates of Zion above all the habitations of Iacob, Psal.</hi> 87.2. so must thou dearely love his house, and the place where his honour dwelleth, esteeming <hi>one day there better than a thousand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God loveth his Saints so dearely that he will not dwell in heaven without them, so must thou love the Saints dearely for the image, and in imitation of God.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the Lord hateth every sinne with an infinite hatred, yea his <hi>soule abhorres it</hi>; so must thou avoid and hate every evill way, even <hi>all the wayes of falshood,</hi> yea the appearance of evill, and the very <hi>garment spotted by the flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He hateth the society and congregations of wicked men, they shall not come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; so must we hate the company and society of wicked men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hee hates wicked and false doctrine: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou hatest the doctrine of the Nicholaitans which I also hate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hee hates the wicked manners and fashions of men, though never so much approved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded amongst men: so must thou <hi>hate the works of them that fall away, they must not cleave to thee, Psal.</hi> 101.3. Thou that <hi>lovest the Lord, must hate all that is evill, Psal.</hi> 97.10.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Bring thy affections often before God, appeale to God and his word for the right carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Lord, thou knowest I love thee.</hi> thou knowest I love thy word, thy servants,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:26365:138"/>
thy house, thy glory: So Lord thou knowest I feare thee; as <hi>Ioseph feared to sinne against God:</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah, I feare God.</hi> Lord thou knowest I hate sinne, and sorrow for nothing so much as sinne: and then bring them often to the rule of the word to confine and bound them. The word tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the measure of our love to God is without measure, but the measure of all our love to other things is, so farre as it may stand with the love of God <hi>in summo,</hi> that is above all, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that all earthly joy is with reference to God our chiefe joy. The word will measure our anger, and confine it to a small time, <hi>the Sunne must not goe downe on our wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.26.</note> it alloweth us to be angry, but not to mingle our sinfull corruption with it. Doe this the rather, because our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be presented before God one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Examination of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules.</note>Now let us examine our selves, and try our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by these rules before named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Aske we our selves, what it is wee love or hate, whether our affections are set on the right objects, and carried towards God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst evill as they ought to be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hath the Spirit carried us not to a dislike, but to an utter hatred of all sinne: none is so bad but hateth some sinnes. The prodigall hates co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse: The Iew can hate a Samaritane, and mixt worship: The Pharise can say, I thanke God I am no extortioner, no adulterer: But just hatred excited by the Spirit is generall of whole kindes against all that is called sinne; as the lambe hates all wolves, and we hate all serpents none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:26365:138"/>
The Law bound the Iew to hate all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to touch none, but that defiled onely the body: the least of this uncleannesse impureth the most precious soule of man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit never raiseth hatred of evill, but out of the love of good to which it is contrary. Aske we our selves then, whether doe we love or hate that which we may lawfully love or hate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God loveth or hateth it; for many can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like many foule evills, and yet be farre from good. Many can forbeare evill because the law of nature proclaimes against it, the law of men condemne it, rulers punish it, shame attends it, a gracelesse man can doe it. So to love religion, love the truth because the law favours it, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome embraceth it, and for the present it is the safest; all this is but pollicie, an Atheist can doe it. But grace embraceth truth, because it is so, &amp; because the Truth himselfe honoureth, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and prospereth it, and commendeth it to our love and trust.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the manner, doe wee love and hate as God loveth and hateth, as he loves not vices for persons sake, so hee hates not persons but vices. Wee know what workes are hatefull to God, but not whose persons belong unto him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must hate the workes of them that fall away, but shew all love to their persons still.</p>
               <p>All which discovers a great deale of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Many hate sinnes in another, and not the same sinnes in themselves, and this is the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:26365:139"/>
hatred of the person and not of the sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> many seeme to hate evill, but not out of love to goodnesse, some say they hate Popery, but are farre from the love of the truth; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like grosse profanesse, drunkennesse, adultery, but have no affection to true godlinesse, hatred of evill is joyned with cleaving to good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> many hate most where God most loves, as persons for grace sake: and two sorts of men are the butts of the hatred of this age.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Zealous and godly Ministers, because their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> life and doctrine reproove evill mens workes: <hi>Ahab</hi> hateth <hi>Eliah, Hast thou found mee O mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?</hi> the more they love, the lesse they are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for a Minister to hate mens sinnes, or to speake the truth, doth it deserve such hatred? If we should love mens sinnes, wee should hate their persons, and if we hate not our brothers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, we could not wish his good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A generation of men who are so precise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they will not sweare, nor be drunke, nor game away their time, they are Iewishly strict in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Saboth; so zealous as they cannot abide the sent of Popery; they repeate sermons, pray in their families, cleave to the Scripture, in all things so curious and nice, they will touch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is uncleane. But are these hated of God? Nay are they not in singular favour with him? 2. Are not their workes objected against them, the workes of God imposed by God upon all Christians upon paine of damnation? as to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:26365:139"/>
hate swearing, to be strict in the Saboth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Popery, to be frequent hearers of the word, to set up Gods worship in the family, to cleave to the Scriptures, and get out of the way of evill men? In this way which they call heresie, must we worship God. 3. All this zeale against zeale is kindled not with a coale from the Altar, but fired with a flame from hell, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19. <hi>Because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. How generall is the hatred of grace, by gracelesse men that pinch and reproach good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? zeale they call distemper, sorrow for sinne is but melancholy, and next to madnesse; love of the word is but precisenesse, and more than needes; love of good men but faction and partiality; hatred of every evill worke but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; holinesse a kinde of heresie, purity, hollownesse, and all that is nought. How unlike is the world to God and Christ, who commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded shewes of goodnesse in the young man; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quenched smoking flaxe, but kindled it and enflamed it: and whosoever hateth grace in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, first hates it in himselfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How generally doe we love and cherish in our selves what the Lord hateth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> hath hee not specially manifested his hatred against an outward forme of religion, severed from the power and life of it? <hi>Esay</hi> 1.14. <hi>My soule hateth your feasts and new Moones,</hi> his owne institutions, because they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from faith, truth, and inward holinesse?
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:26365:140"/>
But how generall is the profession of religion without power? prayer of words not of spirit? hearing without conscience of doing? washing the outside when all is foule within?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> how great indignation hath he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against people unfaithfull in the covenant, as a jealous husband hates the wife of his bosome that playeth false with him? <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.8. yet how universall is our unfaithfulnesse to God? the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of grace? the slighting of the meanes? the Apostacy and turning backe of the kingdome from God? So as we see how our affections are swerved from the rule, and what great neede we have to be stirred up to a more carefull watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our affections.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> how powerfully they draw us from Christian duties; as, how they interrupt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 7.</note> which was the Apostles argument betweene man and wife: an heart troubled with passions cannot be familiar with God, nor behold his face no more than a man can see his owne face in a troubled water. Consider how they hinder the powerfull working of the word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Therefore lay aside all malice, envie, &amp;c. and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word:</hi> A full vessell can receive no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; sweete water in a fusty vessell is but lost: seede cast among thornes commeth to nought: how they unsettle the heart in grace, pulling it off from confidence in God, love of the truth, from exercise of grace, from the joyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:26365:140"/>
of the Spirit: For as no man can see the beames of the Sunne when the heavens are covered with clouds; so cannot the soule discerne the shining beames of Gods love when it is clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with passion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> how potent are unruly affections to draw us from our duty, so suddenly and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe they carry us into many sinnes; how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly are great professours snatched into the love of the world, and so become Apostates as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Demas?</hi> How doth the love of the world draw on a number of sinnes, and drowne men in lusts and perdition? How suddenly was <hi>David</hi> snatched into foulest sinnes not watching his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? How was <hi>Peter</hi> pulled from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and promises by inordinate selfe-love to the deniall of his Master?</p>
               <p>Acquaint thy selfe with the difficulty of gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the affections aright,<note place="margin">II. Difficult to guide the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections aright</note> for though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour thinke it the easiest thing in the world, yet the whole power of nature cannot reach it: for what a divine wisdome is required, holily to temper the affections, and keepe them even: To temper faith and feare, that they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feare not: to mingle love and hatred, that they entrench not one another; to holde the ballance even betweene <hi>Moses</hi> zeale, and <hi>Moses</hi> meeknesse: to contend for faith, and not be contentious: to be couragious and bolde, and yet suspitious and alwayes fearefull: to be christianly patient, and not stoically insensible: The same Spirit must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford this wisdome that appeared in the shape of a dove and of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:26365:141"/>
                  <note place="margin">III. Necessity of well ordering our affections.</note>Consider the necessity of this care and carriage of our affections: 1. In beholding the numbers of occasions which daily thrust in upon us, to thrust them besides their right objects, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall us in pride, unjust anger, envie, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, carnall love, feare, &amp;c. And were there no such outward occasions, who feeles not the spirit in him lust after envie, and after the world, and after all forbidden fruites? so as all care is too little wisely to watch and prevent the continuall disorder of the whole man by his affections. 2. What great necessity is it that wise Christians difference themselves from common men: it is a great weaknesse to corrupt our affections by the provocations of wicked men; to shoote in their bowe, to doe as they doe. But the godly must be different from them, not feare with their feare, nor joy with their joy, nor kindle anger by theirs, nor curse when they curse, but blesse and pray, nor walke in their way: for as wilde beasts cannot hurt him that keepes out of their walke, so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men cannot seize on us to wrong us, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into their way and walke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">IV. Comfort in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections well guided.</note>Consider the praise, the comfort of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties. Yea, <hi>First,</hi> that the practise of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it selfe stands in affection and desire, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian perfection is in affection, not in action, much lesse speculation and contemplation; and hence receives his denomination, <hi>Iob</hi> 28.28. <hi>The feare of the Lord is wisdome.</hi> All wise and religious wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is included under the affections: of the feare of the Lord to the duties of the whole law are all comprized under the affection of <hi>Iob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.8, 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:26365:141"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the comfort of these duties riseth out of the affection rather than action. Art thou a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister? whether is thy comfort more to speake of good things than to affect them? what if thou hast Angelicall abilities to discourse of faith, love, zeale, hatred of evill, and thy selfe scorne and hate these things when and where thou seest them? <hi>If I had all gifts and want love,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) I were nothing; knowledge puffeth up, but it is love that edifieth.</hi> Art thou a hearer, and wouldest have comfort of hearing, what doest thou affect in hearing? to censure the Preacher, curiously to feede thy judgement, or to enable thy discourse, this will not doe it: But to heare with pure intentions, of feeding the soule, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties to get our hearts sanctified, our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions whetted, our obedience bettered, and to get the power of godlinesse, and the power of the life to come within us, all which the Lord knowes is the intent of a very few.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the acceptance of these duties is more by the affection than the action; and the action without the affection is as a body without a soule: yea where the action was gloriously performed, the Lord still wanted some proportion of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as in many of the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi> Such a one did such and such good things, but not with all his heart and affection; and then all the labour is lost, the reward perisheth, and thy expectation is frustrate. And in the feeblest actions of his children the Lord sees a good compensation made of the defect, by the sincerity of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:26365:142"/>
                  <note place="margin">V. The sweet fruit of diligence in this duty.</note>Consider the fruite of this care worth all our labour in it: for, <hi>First,</hi> As one disordered affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction drawes on another, pride begets anger, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger begets envie, and envie begets hatred, and so murther: So one good affection begets another, love begets feare, feare begets humility, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a fruitfull mother of many vertues: So good affections beget good actions, good actions good habits, good habits a good unblamable life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this care settles and fastens the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon solid objects and comforts, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our joy, love, feare, desire and delight be God, the fruite is internall and eternall, this <hi>joy none shall take away.</hi> But the wicked mans heart in laughter is sorrowfull, and for continuance is as of thornes crackling under the pot, and so are all affections displaced on wrong objects, so they lose both affections and objects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> looke what way we will, the well gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our affections seasons our lives with much sweetnesse.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Looke at God, it holds Gods affection to us: how well is the Lord pleased when our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and affections are conformable to his? How acceptable is our obedience to him when wee are holy as hee is holy, mercifull as hee is mercifull; when we walke in love as he hath loved us? when his affections are the rule of ours, and so are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to his will, for all his affections flow from his righteous will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It holds Gods presence with us in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had fallen
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:26365:142"/>
from her first love, and yet a little sparke was left, shee hated the doctrine of the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> which he hated, and therefore the Lord will not remove the Candlesticke, at least if shee recover her affection. And this is our case, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is wonderfully fallen from her first love; and why doth the Lord spare our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke, and holde up our light, and peace, and the Gospell, above all Countries about us? surely though wee are fallen from our first love and zeale, yet a little sparke of love is left in some poore despised ones, which holds life and soule in us; and some hatred of <hi>Romish Nicholaitans:</hi> for by the blessing of God, the body of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the lawes, and doctrine of the kingdome, hates the doctrine and workes of the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi>; and for this weake affection yet God spares our Candlesticke. But let us quicken our hatred more, for as our first love is in great part gone, so if our hatred of evill goe to, all is gone, God shall see nothing to spare our Candlesticke.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It holds us with God in the sweete fruition of his ordinances, it kindles and keepes in us love, feare, zeale in his service, which is the life of our service and soules: and in all these the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is more respected than the action. It holds us fast to the truth. What is it but zealous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will make us buy the truth at any rate; what is the truths keeper but love; what else but love makes us labour for it, suffer for it, die for it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Strong and earnest affections to God make
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:26365:143"/>
us profitable to men, provokes us to mercy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, beneficence, helpefull to all that neede us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It makes us enjoy our selves, <hi>by patience wee possesse our soules,</hi> love holds God in possession; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity makes us possesse our brethren, and patience puts us in possession of our selves. Sanctified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions uphold the heart with joy unspeakable and glorious, and leade a man happily to an happy estate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The well guiding of affections begins the life of heaven upon earth; for the life of heaven is when the soule so cleaves unto God, as to become like him, when wee shall never love any thing but what he loveth, nor hate but what hee hateth, and this perfection wee must begin even here upon earth.</p>

                  <hi>III.</hi> Now after the spirit and soule, we are to consider these directions by which the body and outward man may be kept blamelesse.

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for <hi>conversation,</hi> that is, either <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publicke,</hi> and in both, a Christian must set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a patterne of godlinesse: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be holy in all manner of conversation,</hi> in Gods house, thine owne house, in thine owne closet and privacy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.2. <hi>David walked wisely in the midst of his house. Isaac</hi> in the field alone meditates and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. yea the women must be in such

behaviour as becommeth holinesse, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.3. Rules for conversation are

                     <item>1. <hi>Generall.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Particular.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The generall rules are five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glorifie God in your bodies and spirits,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God must be glorified in our bodies.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are his,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. And then we glorifie God in our bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> when we consecrate them to his service, leading an holy and godly life, that as he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we be also holy in all manner of conversation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.6. to be holy to the praise of the glory of his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> when wee outwardly acknowledge and publish the glory and majesty of God, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him the calves of our lippes, the sacrifices of praise, and telling what hee hath <hi>done for our soules, Psal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>he that praiseth me glorifieth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when by our holy conversation wee invite others to glorifie God, when <hi>men seeing our good workes glorifie our heavenly Father, Matth.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p>And the reasons of the precept are strong.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our bodies they are his, by creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and preservation; and should not every workmanship serve to the use of the workeman? should not the thing bought with a deare price be usefull to the buyer?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are not onely his, but his Temples.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The law of nature commands the Temples of God to be kept pure and cleane: the Heathens would with great charge decke the Temples of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:26365:144"/>
their gods; though some that would goe for Christians care not how Gods house lieth: their kitchins and stables shall lie handsomer than Gods house, if they can hinder it in themselves or others. Now our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost; and where should God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and praised, and receive oblations, but in his owne Temple?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. To sinne against our owne bodies is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sacriledge against the house of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely to spoile Gods Temple of the holy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and vessells that were laid up in it: And he that <hi>destroyes the Temple of God, him will God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.17.</note> and one way or other will the Lord testifie his wrath against his owne sacred Temple so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned: Christ will whippe buyers and sellers out of his Temple; and if they returne hee will overthrow the Temple it selfe, and a stone shall not be left upon a stone. How suffered the Lord <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the holy City to be burnt, the Arke the most holy place to be carried captive when they were profaned? Doe thou robbe God of that glory which he expecteth in the Temple of thy body, his hand will be against thee in severity. And as the more holy the place profaned, the more wrath brake out: so the more profession of holinesse thou makest, if thou glorifie not God in body and spirit, the more severe shall bee thy ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ierom</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Paulinus</hi> tells him that from the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, those most famous and priviledged places above
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:26365:144"/>
all other were most profaned and rejected by God. So as in the very place of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection there was erected an image of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> On the hill where the Crosse was set up was erected a marble statue for <hi>Venus,</hi> goddesse of lust. In <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> famous for Christs birth, was set the grove of <hi>Adonis,</hi> where the women at a set time every yeare were wont to lament <hi>Adonis</hi> the Parra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Venus.</hi> Even these places of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ, of his passion and his birth, the Lord makes them eye-markes of his judgements. If God spare not the most holy places, if profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; upholde his glory in the Temple of thy body, else his jealousie will not spare thee.</p>
               <p>The second generall rule, is, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> heede thou give not up thy members weapons of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to sinne, but of righteousnesse to God.</hi> The Apostle speaketh to those that are regenerate, who are said to doe that which Gods grace makes them able to doe: And <hi>first,</hi> drawes their eyes backe to the state of nature and corruption in which lately they were, while sinne reigned in their mortall bodies: to which as to an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, 1. they yeelded obedience, 2. tooke up weapons: that is, their owne members, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of body and minde in the defence of sinne, as resolute subjects to that commander. <hi>Secondly,</hi> and then drawes them to doe as much now for grace, unto which they are called, as they did for corruption while they went freely after the motions and commands of sinne. <hi>Give up your members weapons of righteousnesse.</hi> The Apostle
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:26365:145"/>
implies that every regenerate man stands in a pitcht field, wherein the Commander or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is grace or righteousnesse, the quarrell is for God, his glory, his cause joyned with our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the weapons are our owne members, which we must give up to righteousnesse. That is, <hi>First,</hi> we must take new commandements from grace, as the souldier depends on the mouth of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for his direction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we must frame to ready obedience, be the service never so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult or dangerous. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> stoutly and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously fight against sinne, as formerly before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation we did for sinne, and acquit our selves like men. And good reason: for, 1. Kings are maintained and held up in their throne, <hi>First,</hi> in peace, by the ready obedience of their subjects: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in warre, by their willingnesse to fight for them: If subjects will doe neither of these, the King must fall. So whatsoever profession we make of grace, if thus we withdraw our members from the rule, from the quarrell of grace; grace is deposed from his reigne, and sinne stands in his state and power. 2. Weapons and Armes are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in defence of the King and Country, and the friends of the King and Country, but not against them; it is high treason for a subject to take up Armes against his Prince, none will doe this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King or his friends, but robbers and common enemies: So it high is treason for a man to imploy the members of his body against <hi>Grace</hi> his Generall and Commander; and therefore the Apostle exhorteth us to give up our bodies and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:26365:145"/>
members as weapons of righteousnesse, being called unto grace, let the whole outward man follow the commands of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in our whole course and conversation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> labour to expresse Gods Image, not contenting our selves to get it into our nature onely, but also into our conversation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Walke not after the flesh but after the Spirit.</hi> Men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves while they content themselves with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed presence of the Spirit, while there is no walking after the Spirit, which is a going after the Spirit as a guide and leader of their speeches and actions: for that man who must be freed from the condemnation of sinne, must be freed also from vaine conversation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. The power of sinne must be beaten downe in the life, and vanities of life and pleasure must be suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which still thrust in upon them that professe the teaching of grace, who sometimes are carried after carnall delights, strange apparell, lightnesse of carriage, dancing, gaming and excesse of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which the spirit should have mortified, and brought in a cleane contrary course prescribed in the word, and exemplified in the examples of the Saints; but especially in that unerring patterne Iesus Christ himself, who was led by the Spirit in every motion, even the least. For thinke we that the Spirit renewes us onely within and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? doth he make us beleeve as Christians, and not live as Christians? doth the sappe and juice of a tree onely quicken it within, and not cause it produce fruites outwardly? Thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:26365:146"/>
the Spirit of Christ, if it be not unto thee life unto righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. that is, make thee lively and active in all the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Faith is not as a light under a bushell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>shew mee thy faith by thy workes.</hi> Grace is as a light in a cleare lanterne which from within en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth without.</p>
               <p>Now the rather must we labour for renovation without as well as within: 1. Because flesh and blood unrenewed shall not enter into heaven. 2. The disorder of the outward man and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers argue a sinfull and disordered soule, seeing the body is but a servant of the soule, and doth nothing but by the Masters direction and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; an evill eye issueth from an evill minde, and a corrupt tongue moveth according to the abundance of the heart. 3. No outward deformity is comparable to this of sinne in the members, which makes the body to God indeed vile and contemptible, as a dead and loathsome corpes is to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to keepe the outward man blamelesse beware of all unchastity and impurity of body; and on the contrary, watch unto chastity and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill honesty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. <hi>The body is not for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for Christ the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</hi> That is, the body is ordained for the Lords use, and ought to be imployed to his glory. <hi>And the Lord for the body:</hi> to redeeme and sanctifie the body as well as the soule; and consequently to rule the body and command that as well as the soule, being the Lord of the body as well as of the soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:26365:146"/>And the same Apostle saith, the body is a member of Christ as well as the soule: <hi>Shall I take a member of Christ and make it a member of an harlot,</hi> verse 15? Can any thing be more oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious unto Christ than to transforme him into an harlot? Can any thing derogate more from his glory and majesty, or be more contrary to his most holy nature?</p>

                  <note place="margin">How Christ is magnified in our body.</note>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By keeping the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treasure of the knowledge of God, and the attendant graces in these earthly vessels: as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God.</hi> 2. By holding out the word of life,<note place="margin">By profession.</note> and carrying the name of Christ in an holy undaunted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant confession and profession in the place where thou livest, as <hi>Paul</hi> did through the world. 3. By expressing in this frail body,<note place="margin">By action.</note> not the doctrine only but the life of Iesus Christ, conforming thy selfe to his blessed example, in humility, holinesse, charity, piety, patience, and other vertues; that all men may see and say, surely this man is a member of Christ, he lives the life of Christ, he resembles the patterne. 4. In this weake body of thine carry about the mortification of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,<note place="margin">By passion.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. suffer afflictions for the name of Christ, and <hi>beare in thy body,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>the markes of the Lord Iesus, Gal.</hi> 6.17. fulfill in thy body the rest of the sufferings of Christ, carry the badge of a true Disciple, yea if God call thee, offer up thy body and life a thankfull sacrifice, not in life onely but unto death, if thereby thou maist mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Iesus Christ. Thus did the faithfull Saints and Martyrs, offering themselves, the sweetest sacrifice of all others: Yea our Lord himselfe comming into the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. said, <hi>Burnt offerings thou wouldest not have,</hi> (that is, now after
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:26365:147"/>
the comming of Christ) <hi>but a body hast thou given me,</hi> that in this my body I might offer that expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice, of all which the other were but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: Even so say thou, Burnt offerings God calls not for, but he hath given me a body to offer unto him, and give up unto him in life and death, in way not of a Propitiatory, but of an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risticall sacrifice of praise, thereby to magnifie his name. 5. Thou magnifiest him in thy body, when thou magnifiest him in his body; as when thou admirest the graces of his servants, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest his members, delightest in them that excell in vertue, helpest and releevest the poore Saints; all which he taketh as done to himselfe.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>generall</hi> Rules, now of the <hi>speciall,</hi> for speciall parts.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> for the eye to keepe it unblamable: We must watch it well; for you must know that of all the sciences there is none so quicke a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the heart and soule as the eye, by reason whereof it requireth a strait watch. God hath given to the eye power to see every thing, but cannot looke into it selfe, and therefore hee hath given to man understanding that he may looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe by the directions the Scripture doth afford us, which be of two sorts, and both of them within that in <hi>Iob</hi> 31. that because the eye is a most swift messenger unto the soule, and most slippery, as <hi>Iob, make a covenant with thine eyes not to behold vanity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Covenant must be made with the eye.</note> And because all thy watching is too little for so quicke a member, pray the Lord that he would <hi>turne away thine eye from beholding vanity, Psal.</hi> 119.37.</p>

eyes full of <hi>spirituall</hi> adultery, gazing upon Popish pictures and images which they hang up in their houses as alluring harlots, corrupters of the heart, which is an opening of the doore to idolatry, and a signe of a man willing to be deceived.

And shall Christians onely looke on these things as they, to make our selves inexcusable? shall we looke upon the Sunne, and not on him that made it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us fixe our eyes on the workes of God in and for his Church, for the strengthening of our faith and confidence; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23. they that saw the workes of Christ, <hi>Many of them beleeved in his name, seeing the workes he did.</hi> For the Lord doth nothing for or against his Church, but according to his truth revealed in the word; the Lord doth no worke in his Church, either of judgement or of mercy, but they are as it were the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of the Scriptures: and therefore all the workes of God that wee can behold in or for his Church doe notably stirre up our faith in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath allowed us our eyes to behold our brethren, to behold their graces, to see their

The <hi>Iewes</hi> eye beholding the brazen Serpent was a watery and mournefull eye, because hee was stung by the Serpent: so ours much more, whose sting and paine is mortall and inward. And can we beholde any creature, and not see in it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse prints and markes of our owne sinne, which still must adde to our griefe?</p>
               <p>And for others. Good <hi>Lot was vexed daily to see the uncleane conversation of the Sodomites:</hi> and <hi>Davids eye gusht out with rivers of teares, because men kept not the word, Psal.</hi> 119.126.

This is by heavenly conversation, and constant expectation of our Lords returne to take our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; we should long after Christ, and the place of his abode, there should our hearts be where our home is, our house, our husband, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our eldest brother, even Christ himselfe is.</p>
               <p>Thus to order our eyes, consider <hi>first,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> danger of a neglected eye, in <hi>Eve:</hi> shee saw the fruite was good, and forgot the commandement. <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife cast her eye immodestly on <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and said, <hi>Lye with me.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> an evill eye is made a signe of an evill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heart, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.22. out of an <hi>evill heart commeth an evill eye:</hi> and if the eye be evill, the body is darke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a man that gives his heart to God will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> give his eye too, for God calls for both, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My sonne give me thy heart, and let thine eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in my wayes.</hi> And if thou give him not both, he cares for neither; and if thou give him not thine eye as well as thy heart, thou wilt lose thy heart quickly: the adulterous woman will steale away thy heart, though thou seemest to give it to God, if thou watch not thine eye.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The heart cannot possibly be kept in good state without diligent observation of the senses, no more than a Citty can be defended where the ports and gates are cast open. And as in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a gate of a Citty, diligent care must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whom they let in, and whom they let out: So in keeping this sense we must know, 1. when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to shut it, 2. when to open it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> we must keepe shut our eare against the voice of the tempter, that Satan and sinne enter not by this wicket; <hi>Eve</hi> not doing this, death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into her soule and all ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> wee must keepe out the entising and alluring of sinners, which are as the <hi>Syrens</hi> songs: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. <hi>My sonne, of sinners entise thee, consent not.</hi> And take heede of evill rotten and poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full communication, let no evill corrupt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication passe through thine eares; for evill words corrupt good manners, and the want of learning this counsell is the bane of all modesty and civility in this age: for this corrupteth first the heart, and then the conversation; it is like
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:26365:151"/>
fire cast into a barrell of gunpowder, that sets all on fire presently. A Christian must neither speake filthy language, nor heare it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> keepe out reproaches, slanderous and reviling tales, whisperings against the good names of our brethren: for what difference is there betweene carrying of Satan in the tongue, or in the eare? A good man will not slander with his tongue, nor receive it into his eares. <hi>David</hi> sinned in the ease of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> by meanes of slanderous <hi>Ziba,</hi> whom he should have driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with an angry looke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> wee must not heare or give heede to false doctrine, errours, heresies, and libertine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions contrary to truth received: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3.8. <hi>If thy brother, thy owne sonne or thy daughter, or the wife that lyeth in thy bosome, or thy friend, which is as thine owne soule, intice thee secretly, saying, let us serve other Gods, &amp;c. thou shalt not consent unto him, nor heare him, neither shall thine eye pittie him, nor shew mercie, nor keepe him secret, but thou shalt even kill him, and thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.7. Beware of this itching eare, which comes to Church rather to censure the Preacher than it selfe: as <hi>Herod</hi> having <hi>Iohn</hi> before him, sought some miracles to please his curiosity, but sought not grace for his salvation, and departed and left <hi>Iohn</hi> as he found him; as the beasts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane went out of the Arke, uncleane came they in, and so they went out. They sinne against this rule that desire novell doctrine, forsake the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

path and simplicity of received truthes, and runne into new and strange conceits and confused errours, troubling with the faith of men the peace of the Church, and happy proceedings of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> especially beware of hearing Gods name blasphemed by oathes and cursed speeches, or his religion or profession, or servants disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured without our defence: A godly heart is carefull neither to sinne himselfe, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the sinnes of others. In a word, in all the speeches we heare, remember <hi>Iob</hi> 34.3. <hi>The eare tryeth words as the taste tryeth meates,</hi> to let no words goe downe into the soule which are not wholesome: else we are justly blame-worthy by neglecting this sence.</p>

To keepe our eare open to private admonition, exhortation, and reproofe of godly men, knowing that the rebukes of a friend are better than the kisses of an enemy. 3. To keepe our eare open to the cry of the poore, and their complaints in hard times: <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Hee that stoppeth his eare to the crie of the poore, himselfe shall crie and not be heard:</hi> a mercifull eare is like unto Gods.</p>

Our Gentry and Nobles, that neede not worke for themselves, ought with good <hi>Dorcas</hi> to labour in making garments for the poore. This is Gods way of plenty, prosperity and abundance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as idlenesse is the Divells anvill, on which hee forgeth infinite mischiefe; he that is not in Gods workes, is fit and active for the Divells worke.</p>

Remember <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.22. A furious man, and so a furious woman abounds in transgression: the sinne of rigorous Masters and Parents, whose rage often cares not to maime and wound servants and children, or dull their senses by immoderate punishment, and multiply threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, oathes and imprecations, and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:26365:153"/>
such fierce and mercilesse men are out of the way of Gods mercy. Therefore let all labour for a meeke and quiet spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware of a foule hand, a hand soyled with foule iniquity, deceit, fraud, cousenage,<note place="margin">3. Foule.</note> and still abides unwashen. Thou canst lift up no hands acceptably to God but pure hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. yea sacrifice and his owne ordinances, if done with hands full of injustice and cruelty, they are rejected. Holinesse becomes the holy God, and that both within and without. Many like the Pharises wash, and wash often, but their hands are never the cleaner, they make a shew and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of repentance and sanctification, but forget that ever they were washed: <hi>Pilate</hi> washeth his hands, and presently goes to condemne Christ. Numbers of men contemne Christ in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, his Ministers and members, and come to Sacrament, and seeme to wash and all is well. This is but to put on a faire glove, the hand is as foule as it was.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beware of a profane hand, seldome lifted up in prayer and praises:<note place="margin">4.

of the poore members of Iesus Christ: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the commandement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Thou shalt not shut thine hand from thy poore brother.</hi> A number of mens hands are like the dry and withered hand of him on whom Christ must worke a miracle before he could stretch it out as the other. Behold the judgement of God on many withered hands, which never stretched out their hands, nor can, to any mercifull reliefe, or any religious or holy purpose, to uphold the service of God. Men of many thousands scarce cast in two pence to the most needfull contribution: whereas the property of a vertuous woman, (much more of the godly man) is to stretch out the hands to the poore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.21.</p>
               <p>Thus wee see how a Christian may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others in conversation, both generally and specially.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Watch warily the tongue an unruly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note>Now for the <hi>tongue:</hi> The rules of direction are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> consider to what purpose God bestowed speech upon man,<note place="margin">I. God ordained it,</note> and no creature else: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To glorifie God above them all, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">1. To glorifie him.</note> and praises: with the tongue we blesse God, and make it our glory, by upholding Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and resisting that which is contrary to it. How is this perverted? When wee reproach his word, or workes, or speake against his Saboths, his servants, his Ministers, his profession; or sweare idly, vainely, or falsely.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. To edifie men.</note>2. To edifie men, our speech being a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall instrument of humane society, and in respect
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:26365:154"/>
of our brethren, for the communion of Saints: this is one principall end why God hath given us tongues, that we may not onely pray for our selves, but for our brethren. By the tongue wee blesse men, wee pray for them, wee instruct them, comfort them, admonish, and rebuke them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Speech is the instrument of reason and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the interpreter of our owne mindes,<note place="margin">3. To interpret our owne mindes.</note> and the utterer of the truth of our hearts; and therefore must be moved by reason and wisdome in expressing the grace of our hearts, and the goodnesse of our treasures within: as sweete wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe argue a sweete fountaine; and wholsome and pleasant fruites a good tree. <hi>Salomon</hi> calls good speech the fruite of the mouth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.14. comparing a good speaker or tongue to a good tree, farre beyond all other trees in the fruite: they bring forth fruite to others, this to a mans selfe; the good man shall eate good things by the fruite of his mouth: they bring fruite once a yeare, this all the yeare; they bring forth one manner of fruite, this all kindes of tastefull and usefull fruite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> avoide all abuse of the tongue,<note place="margin">II. Avoid care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> by which so necessary and excellent an instrument of humane society is perverted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware of a <hi>swearing</hi> and a cursing tongue,<note place="margin">1. A swearing tongue.</note> accustomed to impious speeches against God. Shall the same tongue pray to God, and vainely sweare by God? Shall it blesse men, and curse men too? The Heathens could not abide him
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:26365:155"/>
that could blow both hot and colde: Much lesse will the God of heaven endure him that out of the same fountaine sends forth both sweete water and bitter.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. A lying tongue.</note>2. Beware of a <hi>lying</hi> and deceitfull tongue, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering crafty and guilefull words: <hi>Psal.</hi> 52.4. of the wicked man it is said, <hi>Thou lovest all words that may destroy, oh thou deceitfull tongue.</hi> How did the Divell use a tongue otherwise than in lying and deceiving? for when hee speakes a lye, he speaks his owne, saith Christ. And God will destroy all them that speake lyes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.3. because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more contrary to his nature, being truth it selfe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">3. A flattering tongue.</note>3. Take heed of an oily and a <hi>flattering</hi> tongue, that can sooth and smooth, and justifie an evill man in his evill: <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.5. <hi>A man that flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his neighbour, spreades a net for his steppes,</hi> as a fowler layeth in waite, to bring the bird into the net, and holde him in it: implying that this flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is the Divells invisible net, by which he cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and holdeth men fast in the snare. For what man will not delight in any base lust, when hee shall not onely not feare reproofe, but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and graced in it?</p>
               <p>But of all flatterers, none is so serviceable to the Divell as a flattering Minister, who brings whole flights of foolish birds into the snare, and holds them fast to death.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">4. A slanderous tongue.</note>4. Beware of a <hi>slanderous</hi> and <hi>smiting</hi> tongue, of which, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Let us smite him with the tongue,</hi> because blowes and strokes hurt not, nor
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:26365:155"/>
wound a mans body, more than the slanderous words hurt his name. The slanderer is a monstrous creature; for a tongue he hath a sting, for words he carries swords in his mouth; his breath is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull and loathsome as gall of aspes; yea hee carries a fire in his mouth set on fire from hell. One compares the slanderer to the butchers mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, hee lies still in the shambles, hee waites for the blood of the beast, his mouth is ever bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>But especially when he slandereth godly men in their godly wayes, hee lies in the Divells sinne, who is an <hi>accuser of the brethren, Revel.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>And hee is often paid with his owne coyne, that as hee sits as a moth fretting the names of others, his name is wounded and gnawed on by others: Whereas by the same overruling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, a man chary of anothers name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming through his hands, hath his name often defended and tendered passing through the hands of others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beware of a <hi>wanton</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> tongue, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to unseemely and ribauldry speech,<note place="margin">5. A filthy tongue.</note> full of corruption, both in the speaker and hearer: the one making no conscience of foule words easily comes on to foule actions; the others good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners easily corrupted by evill speeches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Say not with thy selfe, Though I sometimes speake foolishly and merrily, yet my heart is good, I live well and honestly for all that. I assure thee thy heart and tongue are both of one consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:26365:156"/>
and thou that saist thou art so honest of thy body, but neglectest thy tongue, carriest a world of wickednesse about thee still in that little member.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">III. Vse meanes to keepe thy tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable: 4 Reasons.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> use the meanes to keepe thy tongue unblameable. For, <hi>first,</hi> it is a little member, but unruly, and as hard to keepe as a Citty without walls. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by thy words thou shalt be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or condemned. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> all thy religion and profession is in vaine, if thy tongue be unruled. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a wholesome tongue is the tree of life. How carefull will an husbandman be to preserve a tree of delicate and precious fruite? Such a tree is a well governed tongue. But if a man had the least sprig of the tree of life, by which hee were sure to thrust away diseases, paines, sicknesse, death, and preserve himselfe in an happy, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, undying and immortall estate; oh how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully would hee tend and charily watch it? But <hi>Salomon</hi> commends a well ordered tongue to that whole tree of life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.4. for the fruite of a long and comfortable life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What are these meanes?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Foure meanes.</note>
                  <hi>Answ. First,</hi> set a watch before the doore of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thy mouth, and resolve with <hi>David</hi> not to offend with thy tongue: <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I purposed and vowed with my selfe to looke to my wayes, and that I sinne not with my tongue:</hi> and that man that will not sinne with his tongue, must set a strong watch before the doore of his mouth. And consider here, <hi>first,</hi> it is too much for a Christian to lodge corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and filthinesse in his heart; and yet if some
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:26365:156"/>
uncleannesse will still hide it selfe in those deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corners, choake it there, let not the tongue utter it, nor the mouth vent it to the poysoning and infecting of others. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that a thought may be corrected, but a word once spoken is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable; and therefore wisdome will examine every word first before it passe out of the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> take lawes for our lippes from God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and put them on our tongue: <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. the godly woman, <hi>the law of grace is upon her tongue,</hi> the word of God is the bound of her tongue and speeches, both for matter, manner, measure and end of her speeches.</p>
               <p>A man cannot learne a forreigne tongue, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greeke, Latine, French,</hi> unlesse he be taught the elements, or observe the rules of speech. Now to speake gracious speech is not our native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it is the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to which wee are naturally strangers, and can never get it of our selves, unlesse wee acquaint our selves with the rules of it in the word of God. Who can speake familiarly with God, savourly of God, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly with men, without Gods owne teaching in his word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> labour to get a good heart, for <hi>out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, Matth.</hi> 15.18. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.23. <hi>The heart of the wise gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the mouth wisely:</hi> for as the shop is furnished out of the ware-house, so the mouth with speech out of the heart. Whence it must follow, that the want of good and savoury speech argues a barren and naughty heart. To speake the language of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:26365:157"/>
                  <hi>Canaan,</hi> be a <hi>Iew</hi> within, get a wise, pure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted heart, and then thou art one of the people of a pure language, 3 <hi>Zeph.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> accustome thy selfe to good and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> speech, flowing from grace in the heart; that all thy speech may be the issue of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, holy affections of love, joy, zeale, desire of godly sorrow, &amp;c. and tending to the praise of God, and to the exhorting, instructing, counselling and comforting of men: as the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to <hi>Peter,</hi> let thy speech bewray thee a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Christ, a good Christian: see the matter be good and pertinent, the manner seasoned and bounded with godly discretion, and the end ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to minister grace to the hearers.</p>
               <p>The reason of this rule is, <hi>First,</hi> because cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication slippes in for want of better communication which might have prevented it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> no way so expedite to breake off a bad habit, than by frequent contrary acts which will grow habituall and familiar.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the directions for keeping the outward man blamelesse. If any thinke them not so necessary to be insisted upon, or taken up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into his practise, let him remember: 1. That the heart is never renewed unlesse the outward man be reformed. 2. It shall one day be said to him, <hi>Why takest thou my law into thy mouth? Psal.</hi> 50.16. why professest thou religion and salvation by Iesus Christ, <hi>and hatest to be reformed?</hi> 3. The time hastens, wherein <hi>every soule present shall be judged by that hee hath done in the body, be it good or evill,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOw we come to the second petition of this most excellent prayer, which is for finall sanctification, and perseverance in their grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived unto the end, which he calls the comming of Christ.</p>
               <p>This is the fifth time the Apostle mentions the comming of Christ, in this Epistle; for in the end of all the five Chapters you shall meete with it: to note,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> That a Christian should never set the second comming of Christ out of sight; as being a strong meanes to keepe him in a generall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or readinesse to be found such a one as may carry the title of a good and wise servant.</p>
               <p>But in this place perswading to full and finall holinesse it is most fitly mentioned,<note place="margin">Consideration of Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming hath all incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to godlinesse.</note> as having all encouragements, and answering all objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because this comming of Christ brings a recompence of reward to such as are exercised, and holde on in holinesse: the meditation of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must therefore bring forward the Apostles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> many are the troubles and reproaches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of such as resolve to holde out in the way of grace and holinesse; and therefore hee would sweeten as with sugar these bitter pills: by holding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes the second comming of Christ, who shall then giue a righteous sentence, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit them, on condition they persevere in their godly beginnings.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whereas there is no greater enemy to sanctification than sinne and corruption; those that would hold out to full and finall holinesse, must carefully watch against all sinne: which they shall easier resolve upon, who holde this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ in their eyes, seeing he therefore commeth to judge and revenge all sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to uphold them in the strife against sinne: for whereas after long combate the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde little conquest against spirituall enmities, and this often makes them faint and weary, and ready to give over: The Apostle in great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome holdes before their eyes that day, unto which if they holde fast their grace, they shall obtaine full victory over all their sinnes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know more, neither the corruption nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> to adde courage to their labours and endeavours for increase of grace: for whereas by all their diligence and care in well-doing, they can attaine no great measure of grace, and that little which they have, is often clouded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruptions, and sometimes interrupted: they might be much discouraged, if they should not be held on in expectation of the day of Christs comming, wherein they shall attaine the full measure of grace and holinesse which they strove for, and reape the full harvest of their labour and painefull seede-time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Is there any doubt but that the godly shall be kept unblameable till that day? or is it possible they should not persevere to finall sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? and if they shall, what neede the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle pray so earnestly for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Perseverance in grace is twofold:
<list>
                     <item>1. Continued,</item>
                     <item>2. Interrupted.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The children of God having the seed of God, which is the true grace of sanctification by the Spirit; doe sometimes lose many gifts of the Spirit, (as wee have heard) and sundry wayes quench the Spirit, so as they hold not a continued perseverance in the measure, degree, sense and comfort of their holinesse: yet they lose not all the gift of regeneration at such a time, nor fall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> wholly, for the seede remaines; but persevere by an interrupted grace, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, finally: though they fall from their first love, and some degrees, yet are they restored; and finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unblameable in the day of Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they are built upon a rocke, against which the gates of hell cannot prevaile. The Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> resembling the Church, was made of square wood; a square lay it any way lyes firme. So the Saints abide firme in temptation, saith <hi>Augustine.</hi>

                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:26365:159"/>2. Christ hath <hi>prayed that their faith should not faile, Luke</hi> 22.32. hee hath prayed for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance: <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.15. <hi>not to take them out, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them in the world:</hi> and verse 26. <hi>that they may be one with Christ and God.</hi> So as if God and Christ himselfe be stable in their happinesse, so are they.</p>
               <p>By vertue of this prayer <hi>it is impossible the elect should be deceived, Matth.</hi> 24.24. And by vertue of it though <hi>Peters</hi> or any other beleevers faith may be foyled, it cannot quite faile. His faith may be wounded,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The promises of Christ are yea and Amen, for he is the <hi>true and faithfull witnesse,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. who hath sealed and ratified them by his blood. But hee hath promised that the elect shall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere: <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will make an everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them. Esay</hi> 54.10. <hi>The mountaines may remove, and the hills fall downe, but my mercie shall not depart from thee, nor my peace fall away, saith the Lord that hath compassion on thee:</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. <hi>None shall plucke them out of his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The promises on Gods part are firme, but we faile in our condition, which is that wee repent and beleeve, and never depart: for though the Lord <hi>marrie himselfe for ever in truth, mercie and compassion, Hosea</hi> 2.19. yet wee may depart, and the bond is broken on our part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If the bond be broken on our part, then the Lord marries us not for ever. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:26365:159"/>
of marriage use not to be conditionall, but simple and absolute, else they are no binders. 3. All conditions required in us, the Lord both workes and maintaines: Christ performes all conditions in his Church, he <hi>makes</hi> her, <hi>cleanseth</hi> her, <hi>saveth</hi> her, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. 4. If the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from us, we shall not depart from him, for then we depart from him, when his grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from us. And therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Vphold me Lord, and I shall be safe:</hi> and as hee hath promised not to depart from us, so he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to put his feare into our hearts, that wee shall not depart from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Though none can take the sheepe of Christ out of his hand, yet they may cease to be sheepe, and may of themselves stray away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If once sheepe, they are <hi>never pluckt away</hi>; therefore never cease to be sheepe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To these sheepe are <hi>promised eternall life</hi>; therefore so long shall they be sheepe, even for all eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fathers power is above all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therefore suffers nothing to make them of sheepe no sheepe, for then they might be plucked away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though themselves would fling out of the fold, being foolish and straying, yet have a good shepheard, and by him are preserved in grace to salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even this prayer in the Text is a prayer of faith, and therefore the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> must perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. A prayer of faith argues both the presence
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:26365:160"/>
of the Spirit, whose voice the Lord cannot but heare, and the voice of a childe whom the father will not repell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But if the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> shall persevere till the comming of Christ, why doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle pray so earnestly? it seemes very needlesse, nay rather such earnest petitions seeme to make their case very hazardous, and imply they may fall away.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Prayers for perseverance imply not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny possibility of falling away, but plainely shew, (which the Apostle aimes at here) that assurance of perseverance makes no godly man secure or profane, but implieth a condition of unblameable walking, and preserving himselfe unspotted of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. They teach us to depend on God for the last grace as well as the first, and give him the praise as well of our perseverance, as our entrance into grace: for he gives his Spirit into our hearts, <hi>that we should not depart from him.</hi> Contrary to the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which teacheth, that God gives us the first grace, by which wee become good, but wee merit a second grace, by which of good we become better.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. All such prayers as this teach us to joyne the end and the meanes together as God doth. It is not in vaine to pray not to fall away,<note place="margin">Not in vaine for them that shall persevere to pray for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance.</note> though the elect cannot fall away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because it is an obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">2</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> a testimony that we depend on his
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:26365:160"/>
strength and promise for perseverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that wee looke to attaine the gift in in Gods owne meanes of conveying them;<note place="margin">3</note> of which prayer is one of the chiefe. Would wee not want grace, wee must not be wanting in prayer?</p>
               <p>They are farre wide that conceive prayer and perseverance repugnant, for they are subordinate and assistant one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We finde the Saints praying that the Lord would <hi>not take his holy Spirit from them,</hi> that he would <hi>create a new Spirit in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Not because the Spirit is either quite taken away, or quite gone.</p>
               <p>But <hi>First,</hi> because he is taken from them, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in respect of his existence, but of his operation, for he is not so powerfully working.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> not in respect of the saving gift, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the measure, degree, and comfort of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Spirit where once he is, is not quite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> gone in respect of himselfe, but in their sense and apprehension. Now this is no good argument: They feele him not, therefore hee is not there; no more than a man in a swoone can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded dead, because he discernes not his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and lastly, by prayer wee retaine the Spirit, and the renewing grace of the Spirit, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in respect of sense and existence, prayer being Gods meanes to keepe the Spirit from departing from us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This and all such prayers for perseverance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> being prayers of faith are therefore so much
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:26365:161"/>
more earnest, because wee know that God will grant us the grace prayed for. Hee will never pray, that beleeves not that God will grant his prayer.</p>
               <p>But the Saints therefore pray because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to speede. <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.42. knew it would raine, and tolde <hi>Ahab</hi> so; yet hee goes and prayes for it. Christ knew his Father would glorifie him, yet he prayes he would so doe: hee well knew none of his Disciples should perish but <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet he prayeth to that purpose. And this is not in vaine, but a performance of worship to God, a possessing of grace in a right title, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, and a sweetning of the mercy which wee have gotten by prayer and prevailing with God.</p>
               <p>The Apostle implies in Christs comming, that Christ is now absent from us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> 1.</note> that is, in respect of his body, hee is not present in earth, neither circumscriptive, nor diffinitive, nor repletive: for then he could not come to us, if hee were with us already. True it is that Christ is <hi>spiritually</hi> present with his Church to the end of the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise of his spirit and grace.</p>
               <p>Christ is also sacramentally present:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ratione signi,</hi> hee is represented in the signe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ratione objecti,</hi> for he is the present object of our faith whereby wee behold and partake him being present in the word of promise. But <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> he is not present, neither in the Supper nor any place where the Supper is celebrated, nor in the bread.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:26365:161"/>1. Because Christ professed when hee was to ascend, that hee was to <hi>leave the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and goe to the Father, Ioh.</hi> 16. but the bread is in the world, therefore Christ now ascended is not in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee expresly denies that hee should be with us on earth after his ascension: <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The poore yee have alwayes with you, but mee not alwayes.</hi> If they fly to their old shift of invisible conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>quoad statum humilitatis,</hi> that is, in respect of his humility; Christ spake without any such limitation, <hi>Mee yee shall not have alwayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Our high Priest is gone with his body <hi>into the heavenly Sanctuary,</hi> and if hee be not there,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> hee ceaseth to be our high Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. If they say he is on earth, but not visibly, what should an invisible high Priest do in earth, where all Priests were ever visible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Even the bread in which they say he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent corporally,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note> is a signe and argument of his corporall absence, because it must be received in memory of him. Now memory is of a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and therein we declare the Lords death till this his comming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>And here we may note also, that Christ will come againe according to his body:<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. This is the way of the just, which is as the light that <hi>shineth more and more untill perfect day,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Prov.</hi> 4.18. Looke as the Sunne rising is brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and brighter, and still dispelleth mists and darknesse before it, till it come to high noone, which is the perfect pitch of the day: so where the Sunne of righteousnesse riseth in the heart, there is a daily profiting, and proceeding in the knowledge and feare of God; a walking from strength to strength, from faith to faith, till they attaine the highest pitch of grace in this life, and that talnesse in Christ, which shall be most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely confirmed, and perfected in that brightest and highest light and life of glory to come. But the hypocrite is not so, he hath some light, some little oile in his lampe, but onely enough to make a flash, or sodaine blaze; but not enough to carry him into the wedding chamber: sometimes hee
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:26365:163"/>
will wash and repent, but hee soone forgetteth that hee was washed: sometimes hee will have good words in his mouth, some good actions now and then in his hand, and seeme very good, but all his righteousnesse is as the morning dew.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Perseverance is a gift never divorced from faith, though sometimes it may be disturbed by fits, yet at length it shall set the crowne on the head of true piety; for truth of grace is blessed with continuance: because,</p>

This was signified by the good ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. distinguished from all the other three, that it brings <hi>fruit with patience,</hi> when the best fruits of all the other came at last to nothing. And this grace differenceth between such as formerly nothing else in shew did distinguish: for let an hypocrite set forth never so faire, and hold a place of profession, and forwardnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God, yet at the last hee shall prove like the unhappy passenger, that hath see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:26365:163"/>
to saile prosperously all his voyage, and no danger threatned him, yet at the length suffers shipwracke, and is cast away at the mouth of the very haven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because perseverance approoveth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> soundnesse of our calling, and gifts given us, and so affordeth us the comfort of our present estate in grace. It is well said of one, <hi>In princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio delectatio,</hi> but <hi>in fine probatio.</hi> Which telleth us, that a man at the first may rejoyce in the light for a season, and in the taste of the word, and the powers of the life to come may be very sweete; but all the proofe and tryall is at the end: the end shewes who bee called according to <hi>meanes,</hi> and who are called of <hi>purpose.</hi> What one said of true vertue, wee may apply of true piety: <hi>Verae pietatis est non caepisse, sed fecisse; nec fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse, sed perfecisse.</hi> Whereas of hypocrites may be said that to the <hi>Galathians, Yee did runne well, who letted you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what comfort is there of temporary faith, which giveth over when there is most neede of it? What use of that illumination that leaveth us in darknesse at the last? What were the foolish Virgins better for that oyle and light, which failed them before they came to the wedding chamber?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because Satan lieth in waite especially for our perseverance, his chiefe scope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is to sport himselfe in the apostacy both of the wicked and the godly. Sometimes the wicked

               </p>
               <p>Time was when in the beginnings of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell our fathers received it with love, joy, zeale, diligence, and most earnest affection: <hi>The violent tooke the kingdome by force.</hi> But now how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are we fallen from the love of the Gospell, and turned religion into formality, and policie? Time was when men hasted out of Popery as fast as the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Then was ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry cast out, then was not onely the uncleane flesh, but broth hated: then were godly men bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie at worke to lay the foundation and grounds of Religion: then were Gods worthies worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thankfully received, and esteemed, and the restorers of Religion duely honoured: then men used their peace to edification, and growth in grace, and in the comforts of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>But what doe we now? have not many among us changed our hatred of Popery to the hugging and cherishing of it? Doe not wee generally not
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:26365:165"/>
onely looke backe, but runne backe to Popery, as <hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> See not we Idolatry, and the Breaden god, and the Altars, Vestures, and Priests encroach upon us, which cost so much precious blood of Martyrs to cast out? Doe not some question now the grounds of Religion, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our Catechisme, which Turkes dare not doe? and begin to determine that the differences betweene us and the Papists are not so great and substantiall? In stead of honouring Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, the restorers of holy Religion, have not some of our pulpits, presses, and discourses dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and such as stood more stiffe against Popery. Are there not they that mingle not a little leaven, but abundance of poyson of Popery, and father it upon our Church? Are not the numbers of Papists increased upon us, notwithstanding all the lawes against them? that these sonnes of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are growne in number and strength almost too great for us? Oh who can without heart-sorrow compare our selves now with our selves then; as the olde men wept, when they compared the second Temple with the first?</p>
               <p>Will not wee yeeld this generall Apostacie? let him that runneth reade it in the effects of it. For,</p>

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:26365:165"/>
and why doth the Lord thrust us from his care, but that we have thrust our selves from his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why are we fallen from the honour of our Kingdome, and the ancient glory of our Nation, but because we have not set up nor held up the honour and kingdome of God amongst us, and therefore hee hath cast downe the honour of our Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why is our peace within our selves distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by many discontents among all sorts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have not allowed the Lord a peaceable dwelling among us as in times past.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Why cannot wee now peepe out of our coasts, but become a prey to a base despisable company of robbers and theeves? and why doth not God goe out with our navies, our armies which returne home with losse and dishonour? but that the sentence is gone out as against <hi>Israel, Iudg.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Yee have served other Gods, I will save you no more: Goe and cry to the Gods yee have chosen, let them save you in the day of danger.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. Coldnesse in profession, lukewarmnesse in religion, denying the power of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A generall scorning of the profession of grace. Oh that ever it should be said in time to come, that after 60 or 70 yeares of the Gospell, it should be attended, or rather chased out with such generall scorne of faithfull Preachers, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:26365:166"/>
professours of true religion, as no age of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell can patterne.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The deluge of drunkennesse, which hath drowned our Land, and is risen 15 cubits higher than ever, which was sinne wont to be covered formerly with ragges, now with silkes.</p>
               <p>Whence are all these, and many other hainous profanations of manners, but from our Apostacy from God, from his covenant, from his word, from the profession of holy Religion?</p>
               <p>Oh that wee could consider the state of revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters worst at last, that wee would returne to our first love, and workes, before the remooving of our candlesticke, and before our spuing out.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. For personall Apostacy. This may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to many men, who have desisted from good and hopefull beginnings, who have rejoyced in the light for a season, who seemed to have beene washed, &amp; to have got out of the filthinesse of the world; begun to reade the Scripture, set up Gods worship in their families, to keepe some watches
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:26365:166"/>
with God, but are fallen backe to the world, or wallow in some lusts, as if nothing were worth forsaking but Gods wayes.</p>
               <p>Let these consider, 1. How lightly they offend the Majesty of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>If any withdraw himselfe, my soule shall have no pleasure in him.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a military word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> souldiers who recoyle and leave their standing, in whom the Captaine delights not: no more in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian fight can wee by retiring and recoyling please our Captaine: But the Martiall law for such is in the text, <hi>They withdraw themselves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Better it is not to begin in a good course, than to desist, and breake off. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>It had beene better not to have knowne: the latter end is worse than the beginning</hi>: for they lose all their labour, all their hopes, all they have wrought, all they have suffered, all is in vaine to them. As a man having made a long voyage, and sailed prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously many hundred miles, but bringing his shippe within sight of shore, and thrusting into the haven, suffered wracke in the havens mouth: this man hath lost all his gettings, his wealth, his journey, his labour, sufferings, his life, himselfe and all. Oh never content thy selfe with good <hi>beginnings in the spirit to end in the flesh:</hi> Oh foolish <hi>Galathian,</hi> wilt thou <hi>suffer so many things in vaine?</hi> The Lord rejects that blossome that never comes to fruite, as the husbandman cares not for that blade that comes not to ripenesse. Nay never content thy selfe with a faire progresse in grace,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:26365:167"/>
at any time to desist: For if a righteous man at any time forsake his righteousnesse, all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer righteousnesse shall never be remembred; and he that loseth the last of his dayes, loseth all the former. What were a man the better if hee had all grace in the highest perfection of it, and fall from it? nay what careth Satan if a man had attained whole sanctification, not onely in part, but in degrees, if it be not continued in? <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, the more holinesse he lost, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was his sinne and unhappinesse. Nay the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven, what better were they for their absolute Angelicall happinesse, when they left their first habitation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Relapse into a sicknesse is farre more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the disease, and to relapse into sinne is to relapse into the most dangerous sicknesse of all, and farre lesse curable than any. This incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable estate our Saviour aimes at <hi>Luke</hi> 9.62. no man that puts his hand to the plow, &amp;c. from this relapse they fall into that sin, that unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The very season of our present times aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates this sinne of falling from the grace of God, that makes it most inexcusable. What? to fall away so willingly in dayes of peace? of meanes? of protection? in dayes of the honour of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? What? to fly as a wicked man when none pursues? in a land where truth and peace kisseth each other? where is neither danger, nor losse, nor enemies neere? so cowardly to part with truth, and fall from it to Popery? What defence?
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:26365:167"/>
what excuse is left for this sinne? It were too much in times of persecution, in <hi>Marian</hi> dayes, in the midst of those light fires, in the house of inquisition, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> or in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> where <hi>Manasseh</hi> makes the streetes runne with the blood of the Saints: But in the time of peace, in the Sunshine, in the triumph of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to decline, and depart, this hath no excuse for the sinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:26365:168"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>motives</hi> to excite us to the meanes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Lay a sound foundation.</note> first be grounded, then settled and stablished. A good beginning promiseth a good ending.</p>
               <p>Now to a good beginning are required three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humility of soule, 2. stability of purpose, 3. sincerity of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Humility layes a low and a deepe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in the exercise of sound mortification: the most that fall off from their beginnings are such as have but sleighted the matter of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and would not be at the paines and cost of deepe digging their hearts by serious humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This our Saviour expresseth in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.48. The sound Christian is that wise builder, who builded an house, and digged deepe, and laid the foundation of it on a rocke, so as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther floods nor windes could shake it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Stability of purpose is a settling of the heart to follow goodnesse, and hath in it two things: 1. for judgement, 2. for practise.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A resting in the knowne truth, and not as reedes to be shaken and carried away with every puffe of false and vaine doctrines, or strange opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, contrary to the truth received; the sinne of this unstable and libertine age, in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers specially of our youth, leave the assemblies, and creepe into corners to learne another doctrine from teachers in the twilight, against the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:26365:168"/>
of God, against the law of God, against the ordinances of God, the word and Sacraments as now preached and administred. I seldome have observed any such shuttle hearers, but have in the end come to nought, and even to open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanesse, because they never laid a sound founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but were alwayes busie questionists, ready to turne all religion into <hi>

               <p n="2">2. A resolution in practise, whatsoever come of it, never to be carried away with the errour of the wicked, nor the sinnes of the age, times, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor the corruptions of his owne heart; all which are violent streames which a resolved Christian must rowe hard against. This was it which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> require of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Antiochians, Acts</hi> 11.23. <hi>that with full purpose of heart they would cleave unto God,</hi> both in judgement and doctrine, and in life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. This was the settled resolution of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>I have inclined my heart to performe thy statutes alwayes, even to the end.</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sincerity of heart is necessary: which 1. casts out all sinne by repentance, sparing none, never so gainefull: 2. hath respect to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God. A deceitfull heart cannot hold out in good, duplicity of heart suffers not a man to continue, for hee is <hi>unconstant in all his wayes, Iames</hi> 1.8. This is when men looke to have their joy in this world, and with God in the world to come, when the end of their whole

course is not sincere, but they embrace goodnesse so farre as may stand with their owne estate, or the disposition of the times, or constitution of the kingdome, and no further. Ayme at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into grace, know that hee onely hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun well, that hath begun in truth.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> Wee must arme our selves against all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of perseverance, and such things as plucke men away from love of truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware lest our hearts be <hi>hardened through deceitfulnesse of sinne, Heb.</hi> 3.13. Sinne is a sly thing of the Serpents brood, especially the sinne of our nature easily seduceth and deceiveth us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. The Apostle complaines that it deceived him: for the sinnes of heart and nature lull men asleepe in some actuall sinnes in which they lie securely, and so grieve the Spirit, weaken grace, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der holinesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Love not the world, nor the profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and pleasures of it too well. <hi>Demas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the truth, to embrace the present world. Iudas</hi> by the same corrupt affection fell from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.41. Many chiefe Rulers belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ, but durst not confesse him, because of the <hi>Pharises,</hi> for they loved the praise of men more than God. Oh, that we did not so cleerely see the strength of this lett in these dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so many baulke the way of holinesse, and fall backe almost to open profanesse, because they neither see many men, nor great men yeeld ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or countenance to such strict courses.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:26365:169"/>2. Shunne lewd society, and familiarity with profane persons, if we would not fall from our owne stedfastnesse, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. there is not more strength in any infectious pestilencious ayre to poyson the body, than in this poysoned ayre to kill the soule. Society with gracelesse men is a very blasting of grace; fire is not more apt to burne, than we to learne their wayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The labour and paines of holinesse and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification makes many weary of the good way; but consider it is not in vaine to serve the Lord, and there is profit in walking humbly before him, thy paines shall be abundantly recompenced; a small measure of holinesse, with an upheaped measure of happinesse. Every man will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to swallow much paines for a little earthly profit, and is the state of heaven worth no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Persecutions drive many away; much seed which comes up faire, when the sunne of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ariseth, withereth away.

               <p>Many heare holinesse reviled and spoyled of her vaile and value, they heare this sect every where spoken against, and would as farre forget themselves as <hi>Peter,</hi> to heare that voice, <hi>Thou art one of them,</hi> and perhaps renounce Christ, and profession and all: for if even the very Disciples of Christ, and all they, leave him and fly when

               <p>And for this end, <hi>First,</hi> let the word of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be deepely rooted in our hearts, for this is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preservative from declining: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.102. <hi>I declined not from thy statutes, for thou didst teach me.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> this is a true signe of a true friend of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who loves at all times, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. not onely in prosperity, but in adversity; yea this is the praise of a true friend: sound love to Christ is a sparke of Christs love to us, of whom is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1. <hi>Whom he loved he loved to the end.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas, I cannot goe so fast in the good way as sometime I did, nor so stedfastly; I could heare more fruitfully, pray more cheerefully, keepe my times with God more carefully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my sinnes more feelingly than now I can.</p>

               <hi>Who will also doe it:</hi> That is, Hee will finish and perfect his gracious worke begun.</p>
            <p>The first Argument prooving their perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is from the nature of God, <hi>Hee is faithfull.</hi> Here are two questions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why the Apostle mentions Gods faithfulnesse in this place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To bring to their mindes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of perseverance, and holde it before their eyes: for Gods faithfulnesse ever hath respect unto some promise. Now this promise of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is in <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my feare into their hearts, that they may not depart from me:</hi> and <hi>Hosea</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will marry thee for ever unto me in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And in this promise they must seeke their stedfastnesse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To assure them that his prayer for perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was a prayer of faith, and grounded upon Gods promise; for no other prayer can have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort or assurance. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14. <hi>This is the assurance, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us. Matth.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Whatsoever yee aske, if ye beleeve, ye shall obtaine it.</hi> And thus hee teacheth both them and us to frame our prayers, if we would speede in our suites, namely to looke at the promise before we pray.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To set God before them in such a manner, as they may apprehend him not onely true in himselfe, in his word and promises; but one that will not frustrate the faith and hope of such as waite and depend upon him, but will carry them out to salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:26365:174"/>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> How must wee conceive God to be faithfull?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">God is said to be faithfull foure wayes.</note>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God is said to bee faithfull foure wayes:
<list>
                  <item>In himselfe,</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Hee is faithfull <hi>in himselfe,</hi> by an uncreated faithfulnesse and truth it selfe, by one eternall and simple act;<note place="margin">Differences between faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in the Creatour, and in the creature, 4.</note> and differeth from all created truth and faithfulnesse, and truth in the creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> because this is the Ocean and full foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, from whence all the faithfulnesse and truth in men and Angells issue and streame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this is the rule and measure of that; and the nearer that their truth comes to this, the more compleate it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this is unchangeable in the Lord, in whom is no shadow of change: whereas in the creature it is changeable. The Angels that fell were faithfull, but soone changed: <hi>Adam</hi> by creation was faithfull to his Creatour, but soone changed and departed from it. But the Lords faithfulnesse is unchangeable as himselfe is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> whereas that in the creature is at least comparatively imperfect in part, and weake; in God himselfe it is in most high perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is most faithfull in all his <hi>decrees,</hi> for the counsells of the Lord must stand, and must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be executed, both for manner, and times, and all circumstances as hee hath decreed them: <hi>Esay</hi> 14.24. <hi>The Lord hath sworne, Surely as I

have purposed it shall come to passe.</hi> See verse 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hee is faithfull in all his <hi>wayes and workes,</hi> which all of them are according to those decrees most holy and righteous. <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his workes.</hi> As for example:</p>

            <p>In the worke of redemption, we have <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full high Priest in things concerning God, Heb.</hi> 2.17. who faithfully performes all his office, both in expiating of our sinnes by one perfect sacrifice in earth, and now interceding before God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>In the great worke of our justification, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him <hi>just and faithfull to forgive our sinnes if wee acknowledge them,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. for God is so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he cannot but justifie beleevers, having said that <hi>hee that confesseth his sinnes, and forsaketh them, shall finde mercie, Prov.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>In the great worke of protection and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church in earth, <hi>He is faithfull and true that judgeth and fighteth righteously, Revel.</hi> 19.11.</p>
            <p>Yea and in heaven, his faithfulnesse upholds their eternall happinesse, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have beleeved, and hee is able to keepe what I have committed to him against that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Hee is faithfull in all his <hi>words and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> because,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They be the issue of a most faithfull and righteous will, void of all insincerity and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:26365:175"/>2. Never was word uttered by him, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared both the thing in it self, and as it was in the minde of him the speaker.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every word of his resembles his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. As, <hi>first,</hi> his <hi>commandements</hi> are all just, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true and pure as hee is; yea the rule of truth and faithfulnesse to us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> his <hi>predictions</hi> all of them are faithfully accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many thousand yeares after: as, Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation in the fulnesse of time: The Scepter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Iudah,</hi> thousands of yeeres after the prediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> his <hi>menaces</hi> and <hi>threatnings</hi> are most faithfull and true. The olde world found them so after an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares warning. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> overthrowne 40. yeares after our Saviour foretolde, that not a stone should be left on a stone. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> are most sure of accomplishment, and his faithfulnesse shines in them all. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a sonne promised in his youth, God accomplished it in his age. <hi>Israel</hi> had a promise of departing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> after 400 yeares, and the same night went out with all his armies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Hee is faithfull that hath promised.</hi>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> whose most righteous will is the rule of all his wayes, <hi>Psal:</hi> 145.17. And because himselfe
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:26365:175"/>
is absolutely holy, yea holinesse it selfe, hee must be holy in all his workes, as a light in whom is no darknesse; from which image of God so soone as the Angels themselves fell, they delighted in lies, falshood, and all unfaithfulnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2</note> because hee is most perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in perfection, a nature most simple, in which can be no composition, much lesse contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. Now if the Lord should be unfaithfull, he must be changed from himselfe, and so denie himselfe, which the Apostle saith he cannot doe, and be God.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3</note> his most pure and holy affection makes him most faithfull: his <hi>love</hi> to his children suffers him not to disappoint them in any of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; his just conceived <hi>displeasure</hi> against sinne and sinners suffers not one word of threatning to fall to the ground: his <hi>zeale</hi> to his owne glory makes him magnifie his truth and faithfulnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Want of wisedome</hi> to foresee something, which if it come to passe doth disappoint us, &amp; lay all our plots in the dust. But he is wisdome it selfe, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing all things, and forecasting all things, and ordering them so, as nothing shall crosse his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or promise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Weaknesse</hi> or impotency may hinder us in effecting that wee verily purposed or promised. But strength is his, nothing can resist him: <hi>Is any

            <p n="1">1. It is a property of Satans broode to love lies, whereof he is the authour, whose first sinne was, not to stand in the truth: if wee would be like unto God, wee must hate the Divells quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, especially wherein hee is most contrary to God.</p>

               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:26365:176"/>2. God hates lying, so as hee rangeth it among most monstrous sinnes, that wee also should so hate it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. and 22.11. and fly it as a most hatefull and enormious offence.</p>

Alas! that in the dayes of such light, men should be so light and false in promises, so unfaithfull in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and covenants, that words and bands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most are but winde, as if mens honest words should be as sure as bands onely in dayes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and superstition; or as if the word of truth had chased away true and faithfull dealing among the professours of it: or as if Christian faith and fidelity could not live together in the same world, nor in the same age. Doth nature teach a man to be ashamed of a verball lie, and doth not grace much more of an actuall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we must be faithfull in our actions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> wayes, and in both our callings both generall and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:26365:177"/>
speciall. Be faithfull in thy profession of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, lurke not as an hypocrite among the Saints, carry no treacherous purpose to save thy selfe by denying or betraying the truth; give it thy heart, hand, and tongue, and life, if it require it: beware of a politique profession, never let thy practise disagree from thy profession. Consider, Christ <hi>professed a good profession before Pilate,</hi> and sealed it with his life and death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. and wilt thou so nourish any secret fraud in thy heart contrary to thy profession? and <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>Timothy,</hi> hee had made a good profession and a faithfull <hi>before many witnesses.</hi> And this is a most necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we know not how soone we may be called to it, therefore learne it betimes, that we may be like our heavenly Father in faithfulnesse, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in times of prosperity, but in times of tryall; for a Christian man is that indeede which he is in tryall: let us shew our selves to bee that wee seeme to be.</p>
            <p>Then in thy speciall calling be faithfull: Christ was a <hi>faithfull high Priest in things concerning God, Heb.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Moses was faithfull in all the house of God as a servant, Heb.</hi> 3.5. So it is required of every Minister or dispenser of the secrets of God, that hee be <hi>faithfull,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. the steward of Gods house must be faithfull to his Lord, and to his family. It is not great pompous titles that commends a Minister, but his faithfulnesse: <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.17. <hi>A faithfull Messenger is health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in thy private calling deale faithfully with all men, and in all things, both great and

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In friendship be faithfull: God is most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> to his friends, in prosperity, in adversity, in life, in death. Be faithfull especially in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Gospell, specially aiming at holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as the Lord doth; and to draw thy friend along to heaven with thee, and helpe him out of sinne, else a sorry friend art thou. But how farre we from this, among whom it is so hard to finde a faithfull friend, who in civill things will sticke to a man in adversity? Where is to be found the friendship of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among Heathens we reade of a <hi>Daman</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> of a <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> of an <hi>Euryalus</hi> and <hi>Nysus,</hi> of an <hi>Achates,</hi> who was a faithfull friend to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and would not leave him in danger. But few such are to be found among Christians, among whom faithfull friendship is degenerated into pollicy and flattery. The Heathens could say that they used not fire or water oftner than friendship; would Christians could say so of faithfull friendship: and yet they seeme to pull the Sunne out of heaven, who would take faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes from friendship in the lives of men. Would to God that Christians had not forgotten these naturall principles. We all professe our selves to be of the family of Christ, would it were with us as in that, that but one of twelve were unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God and their friend. But wee see the

In communicating to thy brethren be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, lay out thy Lords talent faithfully, as a wife and faithfull servant, whom the Lord may make ruler over his house, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.42. Hast thou much? many talents? be faithfull in much, and thou shalt finde much faithfulnesse in the Lord. Hast thou little? be faithfull in that little, and thy Lord shall make thee ruler over much: when it shall be said, <hi>Well done good and faithfull servant, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 25.23.</p>
            <p>Oh that men would remember the doome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the evill servant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Cast the unprofitable servant into utter darknesse.</hi> Why was he judged so severely?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because an hypocrite comes among the good servants, and receives some talents.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having his talent, hee hideth it in the earth, earth eates him up and buries him alive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is unprofitable, hinders his Lord, and makes him a loser, and doth no good to others; all which makes the sentence as just, as severe, and certaine.</p>

                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note>2. This faithfulnesse of God is the ground of all true religion, and hereupon must the whole frame and all parts of it be laid.</p>
            <p>This appeares in five instances. 1. In all the doctrine of faith. 2. In all the practise of faith. 3. In all the prayers of faith. 4. In all profession of faith. 5. In all perseverance in faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. Al the doctrine of faith is grounded on Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
               <hi>First,</hi> we must ground all the doctrine of faith, all, the articles of faith, all our judgement and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:26365:178"/>
opinion in matters of faith upon this faithfulnesse of God; and this by holding fast in them all the <hi>faithfull word, Titus</hi> 1.9. for that onely is the true religion, which is wholly grounded upon his word, who is unchangeable in truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>How could we beleeve all the Articles of faith, which are unconceivable, and impossible to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if we ground them not upon Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his word? How should we conceive that the heavens and earth were created of nothing? that the Sonne of God should become man? should be borne of a Virgin? should by dying overcome death? by descending into hell should deliver from hell?</p>
            <p>How should wee beleeve that our bodies cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with corruption, and wrapped in deaths gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, should rise againe to eternall life? which Article the <hi>Sadduces</hi> mocke at? if wee should not apprehend them as the word of him that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true?</p>
            <p>Contrary hereto, the maine pillars of Popery are set upon the unfaithfull words of men, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, Traditions, Popes: Whereas, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyer</hi>: Be he Father, or holy Father, further than hee speakes according to the faithfull word. Nay <hi>if an Angel from heaven speake otherwise, let him be accursed, Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Popish Church is so farre from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging this faithfulnesse of God in the Scripture; as it never found a greater resister
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:26365:179"/>
or opposite among the sects, and opposite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in the world: For, bring in either Iewes or Turkes, or any kinde of heretickes more vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods faithfulnesse in the Scripture, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists shall not be the worst.</p>
            <p>But did ever any of them accuse the Scripture to be a nose of waxe? the authority of it to be no better than <hi>Esops</hi> Fables, without the Churches determination? to be a leaden and a Lesbian rule? to be a seed-plot of heresies, and they to be heretickes that stand to the voice of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Doe not they call the Bible the booke of heretickes? doe they not burne the Scriptures, as sometime did wicked <hi>Asa, Antiochus, Maximinus?</hi> Have they not burned Christian men for having them? Let any such furious heretickes against Gods faithfull word be brought in if they can: But certainly Papists must carry the bell above all other in the world, for standing opposite to the faithfulnesse of God in the Scripture, and be the most hereticall, as who shut the doore against the truth, according to <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> rule, <hi>Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum haereticissimi, qui claudunt januas veritati. Chrysost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. All our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith must be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Gods faithfulnesse.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> on this ground wee must lay all our practise and obedience of faith: Both in respect of the object of faith, and the manner of mans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the object: We must therefore beleeve <hi>the whole word</hi> of God, contained in the Law and Gospell, because it is of the nature of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, immediatly flowing from that eternall truth
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:26365:179"/>
and faithfulnesse conceived in the minde of God who is unchangeable. This is the argument of the Scripture: Because by faith we give him the honour of truth, and we set our seale to God that <hi>he is faithfull, Ioh.</hi> 3.33. And thus he also honours us to give witnesse to his faithfulnesse: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, not mingling the word with faith, we <hi>make him a lyer,</hi> (namely, so farre as wee can) because we beleeve not the record that the Father witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of his Sonne: and this is the ground why we must beleeve the Scripture to be the word of God, because wee doe beleeve it to be true and faithfull as he is faithfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the act: because Satan himselfe beleeves historically the Scripture, and acknowledgeth Gods faithfulnesse in it, we must specially apply the parts of the word to our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>promises,</hi> all which because he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he will performe to a thousand generations; not onely beleeving them true in themselves, but even to us, else wee deprive our selves of them, seeing he promiseth nothing to unbeleevers. Yea not onely beleeving and applying them; but on the same faithfulnesse of God grounding the hope and expectation of all those promises which thy faith hath already apprehended: For what is it else but this faithfulnesse in God that makes our hope never leave us ashamed? Where had <hi>Sarah</hi> strength to conceive and bring forth a sonne, being past age, but because shee <hi>counted him faithfull that had promised? Hebr.</hi> 11.11. That is, she knew that whatsoever God had promised,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:26365:180"/>
he would faithfully performe: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Let us keepe fast the profession of our hope, for faithfull is he that hath promised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> we must also beleeve his <hi>threats,</hi> for though he use sometimes lenity and patience to vessels of wrath; yet his faithfulnesse suffers not the least jote of them to be unaccomplished. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The just Lord is in the middest of her, early, even early will he bring forth judgement, and will not faile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath the faithfull Lord covenanted wrath with the sinner? Hearest thou his word let fly plagues as thicke as haile against the transgressours, and thinkest thou to escape? Was his faithfulnesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet impeached, and shall it be so for thee? Hearest thou that a large booke of curses comes flying into the house of the swearer, and darest thou sweare? and into the house of the thiefe, and darest thou be unjust? Surely if God have not lost all his faithfulnesse, thou shalt certainly finde it: this is the act of faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the <hi>manner</hi> of obedience of faith: when the eye of the soule is once lifted up to behold this faithfulnesse of God, it will bestirre it selfe with diligence in well-doing. By this argument the Apostle inciteth the <hi>Iewes, Hebr.</hi> 6.10. <hi>God is not unfaithfull to forget the labour of your love:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42. The giving of a <hi>cup of colde water</hi> hath promise of a recompence, and his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will make it good. No just Prince can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the faithfull service of his subject: <hi>Ahashue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh</hi> at length remembred <hi>Mordecai</hi> his good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:26365:180"/>
much more will our God who is faithfull. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.15. Wee reade of a <hi>poore man who by his wisdome delivered the Citty, but hee was forgotten in that Citty.</hi> But God because hee is faithfull is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so forgetfull of him that doth good in the world.</p>
            <p>Vpon this ground we must lay all our prayers of faith; so our Apostle here in the Text:<note place="margin">III. All our praiers of faith must bee grounded on Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note> for Gods faithfulnesse onely gives us confidence of obtaining our suites. Our owne unfaithfulnesse in the Covenant might choake us in our suites, and stoppe our mouthes, and cover our faces with shame: But it is Gods faithfulnesse that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershores us, seeing his promise hath bound him to be found of all them that seeke him truly. Therefore <hi>Daniel,</hi> 9.16. in the name of the Church having disclaimed all their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, bindeth God from all his displeasure: <hi>Lord according to all thy righteousnesse let thy wrath be turned away from thy Citty and Sanctuary.</hi> This will answer all the objections wee can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our owne prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am unworthy to pray, or be heard, and my prayer is as unworthy as my selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> True, but Gods faithfulnesse gives worthinesse to both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But my sinnes hinder good things, they are a partition wall, and stoppe my prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Begge remission of sinnes, beholde <hi>hee is faithfull and just to forgive thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I have no comfort of my prayer, nor deserve any.</p>

               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:26365:181"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Cast thy selfe on this faithfulnesse of God, trust thy selfe with him, <hi>Commend thy selfe unto him as to a faithfull Creatour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But I see no meanes or way of escape or deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Pray as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Deliver me oh Lord according to thy righteousnesse:</hi> that is, that faithfulnesse whereby thou defendest thine owne children according to thy promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But I see nothing but present death on every side, and am even cast on my death-bed, creeping into the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now behold this faithfulnesse and be safe; it will make thee in peace and silence to commit thy selfe wholly to him in life and death: <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me oh Lord God of truth.</hi>

               <note place="margin">IV. All sound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith must be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Gods faithfulnesse.</note>Vpon the same ground lay a sound profession of faith. Sound profession stands in two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A constant profession of truth.</item>
               <item>2. Pure and upright conversation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To uphold both these, behold Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Is God so faithfull in his word and promises; let us then boldly confesse, and constantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his faithfull word. 1. Because it is of the nature of God, truth and faithfulnesse it selfe: Why should wee be ashamed to holde out this faithfull word, as many Politicians be? what neede a man be ashamed of the truth? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what <hi>Truth</hi> hath said, <hi>Hee that is ashamed of me in my sayings before men, I will be ashamed of him
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:26365:181"/>
before my Father and his holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How dare men fall off from the truth of the Gospell to Popery or profanesse after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it? what change is in the truth, that they should change their mindes and turne from it? Have not we <hi>a sure word of the Prophets</hi> and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. which is as immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as God himselfe is?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How venterously doe men goe on in their sinne, notwithstanding the light of the word, checking their consciences, reprooving their wayes, as if some part of the faithfulnesse of it should be abated to them? Is it not an eternall word that endureth for ever as God doth, of which not one jot can be any more diminished, than the very essence of God himselfe can? How dare wicked men come unto the hearing of the word, professing obedience, and listen with such attention, as if they would catch the word out of their teachers mouth: but their contrary course in all their actions plainly witnesseth, that they take no more good, nor no more expression of it in their lives than if so many bruit beasts came to Church, void of all understanding. Certainly if the word be true which they heare and professe, either must they be as men dead in their tombes, who understand not nor beleeve any thing; or mad men, that beleeving it runne so wickedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How desperately doe numbers resist and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the true and faithfull word? as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> resisted <hi>Moses,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. so be there in every
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:26365:182"/>
Congregation resisters and adversaries. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> having a great and effectuall doore opened, yet found many adversaries, yea the greater doore open, the more adversaries. And how can it be other, seeing 1. it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of truth to beget hatred: Never was the Sunne so beset with clouds, as this word with enemies; and all the reprobates in the world fight against the light, as the Priests and people, <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> and all, persecuted and crucified Christ the faithfull witnesse and teacher of his Church;<note place="margin">Revel. 3.19.</note> so it is not to be marvelled if true tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that stand in the roome of Christ meete with adversaries proud and stiffe, and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wronging them in their names, in their meanes, devising base and unworthy shifts to binde their owne hands from their good, as void of reason as themselves be of conscience and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: But their comfort is, (which the Lord armed <hi>Ieremy</hi> with) they shall fight and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, for truth is strongest, and that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In sound profession is upright conversation, and this also is upheld upon consideration of the Lords faithfulnesse. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God All-sufficient, walke before me and be upright:</hi> hee hath given his word for our safety and welfare in this way, and he never broke with his children. Be there never so many discouragements, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and difficulties in this way of uprightnesse, his faithfulnesse and truth shall be thy shield and buckler, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:26365:182"/>Vpon the same ground of Gods faithfulnesse wee must lay all our perseverance in the faith;<note place="margin">V. All our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Gods faithfulnesse.</note> so our Apostle in the Text layes his ground of prayer for perseverance upon the faithfulnesse of God: and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. hee doth assure the perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Saints from the same ground: <hi>God will strengthen you to the end, that ye shall be unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the day of our Lord Iesus, for faithfull is hee by whom ye are called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This faithfulnesse of God will answer all obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against perseverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Alas! I am plunged in the pit of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with such foule and violent temptations, as I shall never be able to holde out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now looke upon this faithfulnesse of God, waite a while: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, and will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able:</hi> but with every temptation will give an issue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Alas! were I faithfull, God would be faithfull enough; but I am unfaithfull in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and start aside continually.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But mans <hi>unfaithfulnesse cannot make him unfaithfull,</hi> he hath promised that he will support the Saints, and <hi>put under his hand,</hi> that they shall never be removed, nor utterly cast downe: and mans faithfulnesse is not the cause of his perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but Gods faithfulnesse, who gives his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that they shall never depart from him: they beare not the roote, but the roote beares them. The seede of God keepes them that they commit not sinne, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. they preserve not their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:26365:183"/>
but their graces preserve them; they cannot comprehend him, hee can comprehend them, and by his power preserves them to salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But alas! he is so long absent from my soule, that I must needes faint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Canst thou not discerne his presence, yet behold his faithfulnesse that will not suffer him to be so farre from thee as thou thinkest; God is within call if thou pray to him; but if thou canst neither call nor pray, yet groane and sigh after him, for the Lord heares the very sighes of his servants: <hi>O Lord, my sighes are not hid from thee, Psal.</hi> 38.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he seeme further off, or stay long, it is not <hi>ad exitium,</hi> but <hi>ad exercitium,</hi> onely to try thee: as a father may try his childe, but his love lets him not leade him further into danger than hee will leade him out againe; the childes trouble is the fathers crosse, and <hi>in our trouble hee is troubled, Esay</hi> 19.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Oh, but I finde many potent and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke enemies in my way, Satan, sinne, and the worlds violence, so I feare I may fall short in the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But Gods faithfulnesse will defend his owne, he is a faithfull shepheard, and as <hi>David,</hi> will rescue and recover his sheep out of the mouth of the Lion and Beare. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91 4. <hi>Hee will defend thee under his wing, his faithfulnesse and truth shall be thy shield and buckler. In the world yee shall have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, Iohn</hi> 16.33. as sure as on the sea are tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings by huge waves and windes, and stormes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:26365:183"/>
rising and raging against the passenger, insomuch that billowes shall seeme to overwhelme them: <hi>But be of good comfort, I have overcome the world,</hi> ye shall put safe into the harbour.</p>
            <p>The second Argument confirming the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> is drawne from the grace bestowed on them already: <hi>Who hath called you.</hi> Where for the meaning are these things to be considered: 1. What calling is here meant? and 2. How the Apostle knew that they were called? 3. Who it is that hath called them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Quest.</hi> What calling is here meant?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a twofold calling to grace: 1. <hi>externall,</hi> 2. <hi>internall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is common to hypocrites &amp; reprobates:<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> the latter proper to the elect. The former is a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling only according to <hi>meanes</hi>: the other according to <hi>purpose.</hi> The one being external, brings men into the <hi>visible</hi> Church: By the other being internall, men are called into the <hi>invisible</hi> Church. The one is effectuall to salvation, we being by it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ the <hi>head:</hi> the other ineffectuall, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us onely to the <hi>members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one flowes from election, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Make your calling and election sure:</hi> the other doth not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. <hi>For many are called, but few are chosen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one brings to illumination of <hi>knowledge</hi> onely: the other to illumination of <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one brings to be <hi>professours</hi> of Christ; the other to be <hi>members</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>The one can onely <hi>restraine</hi> corruption for a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:26365:184"/>
time: the other <hi>changeth</hi> the heart and life from evill to good for ever.</p>
            <p>Now our Text meaneth of inward and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> because it flowed from election, chap. 1.4. <hi>Knowing that yee are elect of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> because to them the <hi>Gospell was not in word onely, but in the power of the holy Ghost, and in much assurance,</hi> whereby they answered the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, verse 5. and chap. 2.13. they <hi>received it not as the word of man, but as it is indeede the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is such a calling as must hold out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable. This is a severing of the elect from the world, to become members of Christ by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2 <hi>Quest.</hi> How knew the Apostle they were chosen, and effectually called? for <hi>God onely knowes who are his,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God onely knowes who are his <hi>by himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What way a man may know the calling of another.</note> and <hi>from himselfe,</hi> but men may also know, to whom he pleaseth to reveale it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God onely knowes who are his <hi>ex priori,</hi> by seeing and <hi>searching the heart, and trying the reines, Ierem.</hi> 17.10. But though hee know onely by the roote, men may know by the fruite, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God knowes onely by the judgement of <hi>certainty,</hi> infallibly: but ordinary men can know onely by the judgement of <hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. God knoweth his collectively, that is, the whole university of his chosen, and no meere
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:26365:184"/>
man or creature can in this sence know who are Gods.</p>
            <p>Now for the Apostles knowledge of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling, know,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that the Apostles had a gift Apostolicall, whereby they were enabled sometimes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the finall estates at least of some particular men: but this was by extraordinary revelation. This is not here meant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> our Apostle here walketh not onely by the judgement of charity, but of certainty: for he saith not, we hope or charitably conceive, but <hi>we know ye are the elect of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hee attained this certaine judgement of their effectuall calling by the same ordinary meanes, whereby ordinary men may also be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of their effectuall calling, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> By what ordinary meanes did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle discerne it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He saw it in the instrumentall cause of their effectuall calling, and their carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same, chap. 1.5. they were not onely called by the voice of the Gospell, but they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that call, for <hi>the Gospell was not to them in word onely, but in power, in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He saw it in the effects of the Gospell mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in them; as in their <hi>effectuall faith, patience, hope, diligent love,</hi> which are assured and infallible tokens of effectuall calling, verse 3. chap. 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the sound and sincere affections changed
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:26365:185"/>
by the Gospell, such as are <hi>joy in the holy Ghost, patience in afflictions, yea joy in suffering the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gospell,</hi> chap. 1.6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In their Christian and holy conversation, they followed the examples of the Apostles, and set themselves as examples to all that beleeved in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> chap. 1. verse 8.</p>
            <p>Now what is it to be a sound Christian, but by faith to be set into the head, and by love into the body of Christ; and by hope into the very fruition of the glory purchased by Christ, from which alone the Apostle concludeth them to be the elect of God, verse 4. chap. 1?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may and ought to know his owne effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, 4 Reasons,</note>Now by the same ordinary way may every Christian, yea and ought to know his owne effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling: for else,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> those exhortations were vaine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling sure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> either should we want the Spirit, or the Spirit should be wanting in his office; who is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, that by him we might <hi>know the things given us of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. one of the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is our effectuall calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the change by effectuall calling is so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> great, as it were strange it should not be discerned; it is a <hi>setting of prisoners to libertie, Luke</hi> 4.18. Can a man come out of a dungeon of ignorance, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and snares of sinne, and be restored to so glorious liberty of the sonnes of God, and not discerne it?</p>
            <p>It is the opening of blinde eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Can a blinde man be restored to sight, and not
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:26365:185"/>
know it? <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. <hi>One thing I know</hi> (saith hee that was blinde) <hi>that whereas I was blinde, now I see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the quickening of the dead, and raising of the buried in their graves. Can hee that is dead, cold <hi>Lazarus</hi> be raised to life after foure dayes, and move, and walke, and doe all the actions of life, and not know it? Can a man be quickened with heavenly life, and move and walke towards heaven, and not know it?</p>
            <p>May not a beleever know his owne faith, and thereby his calling, which ever goes with inward calling? <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe, helpe my unbeliefe:</hi> hee discerned in himselfe the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conversion and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Can a man have any comfort of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> action or duty of Christianity, for which hee wants a calling? how could he assure himselfe of comfort and acceptance in any thing, if he be not sure he is come to Christ, and have yeelded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his voice and call?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But may a man alwayes know the time of his calling and conversion?<note place="margin">A man cannot know alwayes the time of his calling, 3 Reas.</note> or may hee know himselfe at all times after to be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though some may know the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> time of their conversion, and answer to Gods call, yet it is folly to be curious to know the day or houre of it. It is all that the Scripture requires, that we may know our selves <hi>truly called of Iesus Christ:</hi> although we know not precisely the time when.</p>
            <p>Neither be foolishly censorious that another
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:26365:186"/>
is not converted, because he cannot point the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time of his conversion. I know a tree was planted, because I see it growne, greene and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though I know not the time and houre, nor yeare when.</p>
            <p>Consider, <hi>first,</hi> it is often with Gods children as with ours, who are so weake and fraile in the birth, that they know not whether they are born; nor for long time after discerne that they are borne, yet afterwards they come to know their life and birth. And so may Gods childe in the instant of the new birth for weaknesse and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency not know it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Spirit bloweth where it listeth, but knowest thou the way of the winde, or how the bones grow? <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.5. The way of the winde is unknowne in this, that a man cannot justly determine the first moment of the first blast of it: so cannot a man sometimes directly set downe the precise time of his conversion. This freedome of the Spirit allowes him to winde himselfe secretly into our hearts, and to come stealing upon us, sometime without any noyse, as Christ came in upon his Disciples, the doore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the casting in of this grace into our hearts is compared by Christ, <hi>Marke</hi> 4.26. to the casting of seede into the ground; so is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: as if a man should cast seede into the ground, &amp; should sleep &amp; rise up, and the seed should spring and grow, but he knowes not how. Which plainly sheweth, that although the Spirit
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:26365:186"/>
may come rushing in with a mighty noise of wind as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. yet he is most free to come in what manner he pleaseth, and so still, as that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwayes set downe the precise time of his comming.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the second: Whether a man once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alwayes know his calling?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In ordinary course a Christian knowes:<note place="margin">A man truly called may sometimes not know the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it selfe, in two cases.</note> But in <hi>anomolons</hi> and extraordinary cases and times, a good Christian may hardly, or not know it at all: as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> in a strong fit or pang of temptation, which is to the soule as a swooning to the body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wherein a man lives, but knowes not that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue: nay he will seeme to himselfe and others as quite dead. So a Christian disguised by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may implead his owne calling, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover well, and come to himselfe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> after some grosse or grievous sinne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God leaves his owne with terrours of heart to call great things into question: sinne as a boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous storme shakes the foundations, and leaves the sinner as a man in a trance or extacie, stunned and senselesse for the time by some great fall. Now may the Christian doubt of his calling, and of Gods favour, till he have made up his peace againe by repentance. But yet by the cherishing of faith and graces a man may ordinarily retaine the comfortable assurance of his good estate in grace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>efficient</hi> of this calling is God, <hi>Hee who calleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:26365:187"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 1. Effectuall calling depends upon <hi>his purpose,</hi> and is called a <hi>calling according to purpose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that can call effectually, 5 Reasons.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. for as he purposed the end, so also the meanes tending to the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>power</hi> is his, and argues the worke one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be his. It is a worke of new creation: who can create a new heart but he? he calleth things that are not, as if they were. Who can set light in the middest of darknesse, but hee that said, <hi>Let there be light, and it was so?</hi> But effectuall calling is a translating us out of the power of darknesse into <hi>his marvelous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and the Apostle ascribes it to this <hi>power,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p>Who can fashion man to his owne image, and repaire that image decayed, but hee that made it at the first? Surely hee onely can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire a new life into the face of the soule by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling that <hi>quickeneth the dead, Ephes.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>meanes</hi> is his, even the voice of God in the mouth of his servants: <hi>Wisdome cryeth in the streetes, Prov.</hi> 28. <hi>Hee that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The <hi>answer</hi> to the meanes is his, and by the worke of his mighty power. Who can make a dead man heare a voice but he? <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.28. <hi>The houre is that the dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>estate</hi> whence and whither we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led declares it to be from God alone. To free us from the servitude of sinne, death, the Divell, the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:26365:187"/>
world, hell and condemnation, implies a more mighty power, than all these put together; even that divine and mighty power, that bindes the strong man, and casts him out of his hold.</p>
            <p>And whither are wee called? even <hi>to the grace of the Gospell, Galat.</hi> 1.6. <hi>to fellowshippe with Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. to an holinesse above the first <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, and to the happinesse of the second <hi>Adam</hi> in the kingdome of glory: and this can onely be the worke of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>The God of all grace who hath called us to his eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> an excellent worke, where is such a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Hence 1. See what is effectuall calling. It is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a powerfull worke of God, calling persons to bee what they were not: of sinners to become Saints, of enemies to become sonnes; as <hi>Saul</hi> being called to bee a King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was changed into another man, and another Spirit was put upon him. So the Lord puts forth upon every convert another spirit agreeing with the condition to which he is called.</p>
            <p>And hence it followes, that if the Lord call so powerfully, hee leaves it not in our power whether wee will come or no; as the late refined <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> would perswade us. Who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist an almighty power? which is put forth in effectuall calling: can the creature resist the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of it selfe? can the dead resist and not come forth of the grave, at the voice of the Sonne of God?</p>
            <p n="2">

We must labour to feele this power of God working in our effectuall calling; not conceiting our calling to be a matter of opinion, or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things absent: but labour to finde the same power in our selves, which raised Christ from the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> by acknowledging the voice of Christ in the Ministery: <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. <hi>It is the voice of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> by answering the call, as <hi>Samuel, Speake Lord, thy servant heareth. Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Lord, what wouldest thou have mee to doe? Acts</hi> 26.19. <hi>I was not disobedient to the voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by daily separation from the corrupt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and profane of the world: thou hopest for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but hast no calling to it, that cannot be got out of earth, that traducest men, and cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this strict company.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by conjunction with the body of Christ not as wennes, or wooden legges, but as quickened members.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Despaire not of others, though farre runne on in their evill: their conversion is but a call of God; it is as easie for him to create new hearts, and regenerate them, as for us to call a man by his name: he can quickly call that <hi>which is not, as if it were,</hi> which the Apostle applieth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the whole body of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who lay in a wofull ruinous condition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For our selves, be thankfull that the Lord hath vouchsafed to call us out of our naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, to an estate of grace and glory. For a man
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:26365:188"/>
to give an hand to the maimed, an eye to the blind, were thank-worthy: but to give the hand and eye of faith to a sinner, yea to give life to the dead is another manner of worke. See how the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.1.4. breakes out into the praise of God for this blessing above all other.</p>
            <p>All rivers runne into the sea, and all blessing to the full sea of blessing; if wee must blesse him for the least temporall blessing, much more for spirituall and eternall blessings; for blessing us in our soules, blessing us in his Sonne, and in the blessings of the Gospell: here is a rich grace on Gods part, an undeserved grace on our part, who were found when we sought him not; a durable grace, seeing his gifts and calling is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the same power upholdes the worke that set it up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p>From effectuall calling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> From effectuall calling a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 5 Reasons.</note> a Christian may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude his owne salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom hee calleth he justifieth, and whom hee justifieth he glorifieth.</hi> And from calling we may rise to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as the Apostle implies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27. and here in the text, <hi>He hath called you, and he will doe it.</hi> And why?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because of the nature of this calling. What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is it but a drawing of men out of the state of sinne and death, into the state of grace and eternall life? <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darknesse, and translated us into the kingdome of his deare Sonne:</hi> from kingdome to kingdome, from an eternall state of death to an eternall state of life and glory.</p>
            <p n="2">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Gods eternall love is hidden with himselfe till effectuall calling discover it. And hence it seemes to be called a <hi>calling according to purpose,</hi> not onely as flowing from it, but also declaring, that whosoever are thus called, God purposeth eternall good to them; and they may know it shall be made good to them, because this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is infallible, and immutable.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Effectuall calling is a giving of man by God to Christ to save, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Every one that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth unto me, commeth unto me, and him I cast not out.</hi> If then thou knowest thou art once given to Christ, thou knowest thy salvation: For <hi>this calling of God is without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11.29. this gift is never cast away.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A man naturally ariseth from the effect to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the cause, from the fruite to the roote, from the streame to the fountaine: then in like sort may a man conclude of Gods eternall love by effectuall calling, which is a fruite of that roote, a streame of that fountaine of predestination to eternall life. And whereas wise men may by <hi>likely</hi> meanes judge of the end, much more may a Christian by the <hi>infallible</hi> meanes judge of the certaine end, God leading him by this meanes to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end, which nothing can frustrate, seeing <hi>all things fall out to the best to them that are</hi> thus <hi>called</hi> according to purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. As in the Law, he that had first fruites, might expect the harvest, so he that is effectually called hath begun his salvation already, hee hath begun the heavenly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>life upon earth: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:26365:189"/>
beleeveth, hath eternall life, and is translated from death to life.</hi> And as the earnest penny confirmes the whole bargaine amongst men, so the earnest of the Spirit gives us assurance of full holinesse, and full happinesse, because he that hath begun a worke of grace in us, will performe and finish it to the day of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>And this reproves not Papists onely who deny that a man may be sure of his salvation without extraordinary revelation: but even Protestants,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> who resolve never to trouble themselves about it: they will leave all to God,<note place="margin">The extreame folly of those that neglect the assurance of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 4 Reas.</note> and will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his councell, but rest in a good opinion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hope, in which if it happen well, they have well. But what a folly is this?</p>
            <p>For, <hi>first,</hi> What man in any outward title or tenure will content himselfe with uncertainties, if he may be certaine of a good estate? we would hold him a man distracted, that would offer to claime and hold house and land without eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conveyances. Is any man richer, because he dreames he is rich? So to dreame of the wealth of grace, enricheth none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the use of the whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but to be Gods embassage, certifying us of his free grace, in electing and saving us? what other use than to bring us peace of conscience through justification of faith? and what peace without assurance? 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.13. <hi>These things have I written unto you that beleeve, that yee may know you have eternall life.</hi> So as the end of all Scripture is not onely to know that there is an
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:26365:190"/>
eternall life, but that beleevers have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why are wee commanded to <hi>give all diligence to make our election sure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. if it be either needelesse or impossible? When Christ commands us to <hi>rejoyce that our names are written in the booke of life,</hi> doth he not imply, that a man may know it? and convince us that the want of this joy is by our owne default?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a man neglecting or despising this comfortable assurance, perverts the whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. Doest thou pray for remission of sinnes, and not beleeve it? thy prayer is a dead carcasse. Doest thou professe in the Creed, thou beleevest remission of thy sinnes, and by not caring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, give the lie to thy profession? Doth the word preached command thee to beleeve in the Lord Iesus Christ, and that thy Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, who loved thee, and gave himselfe for thee? and wilt thou sticke in an idle conceit, as if it were needlesse to wade into this deepe? Are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments but as seales set to blankes without this assurance, and is it yet needlesse? Doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle say that hee that knowes not that Iesus Christ is in him, is a reprobate, and is it an idle or a needlesse thing to prove it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But where may I come to this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We send not men to poare upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of predestination, nor to soare up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to pry into Gods councell. But thus. Looke downe into thy selfe, examine if thou beest effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called; see what God hath done in thee,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:26365:190"/>
and so maist thou judge what he will further doe in thee, and for thee.</p>
            <p>This is indeede an hard taske,<note place="margin">Effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling often hard to be discerned, and why.</note> and requires all diligence, which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> calls for unto it.</p>
            <p>For, 1. Satan seeks to plucke from us this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of our lives, both before our calling, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us either to shut our eare from the voice, or by picking and pulling the seede out of the heart by carnall distractions and objections.</p>
            <p>And after our calling, perswading men all is deceitfull or vaine, God is not at peace with them, nor they with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Most men rest in generall outward calling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is ineffectuall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But chiefly, the likenesse of outward ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> calling unto it makes it harder to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">Great simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude betweene calling effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall: 5 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherein is the likenesse betweene effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and ineffectuall calling?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. First,</hi> by ineffectuall calling a man may come to the feast, and sit downe at Gods table,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the unworthy guest did, may seeme one of the friends of Christ, may make shew of answer to the call, in respect of outward profession, and conformity to the doctrine; when the heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not, nor resolves to answer. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. The people came to <hi>Moses,</hi> and said, <hi>Whatsoever the Lord commandeth, that will wee doe.</hi> But the Lord said, <hi>Oh that there were such an heart in them</hi>! If the call were denied, or fairely excused and put off, as some of the guests did, this were more discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:26365:191"/>
But many come in among true worshippers, and bring in lampes and some oyle, and are the more hardly discerned. Because, as the same Sunne, earth, raine, roote, moisture, brings up the chaffe, as doth the wheat: so the same meanes of word and Sacraments nourish the hypocrite, which doth the sound hearted Christian.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> by ineffectuall calling a man may come to a great measure of knowledge of the word, to consent to the truth of it, may preach it, yea soundly handle it for the conversion and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of others; may preach it in the name of Christ, that is, for his glory, and by his grace. Many of those that preached in the name of Christ, shall come in the last day and challenge acquaintance of him, to whom he shall say, <hi>I never knew you.</hi> Nay perhaps those that have built an Arke to save others, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Carpenters, shall be drowned themselves. Yea more, a man may defend the word, as <hi>Iulian,</hi> and receive within him the seede of the word, and bring forth some fruites, as the bad ground did, and all this is like effectuall calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by ineffectuall calling a man may come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to see his sinne, to sorrow and grieve for it, to confesse his sinne, be humbled for it, ashamed of it; to acknowledge his estate to be nought, and preferre the state of the godly before his owne, yea wish and desire to change estates with them, as <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He may crave pardon of his sinne, desire the prayers of Saints, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus:</hi>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:26365:191"/>
He may refraine himselfe in many sinnes, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> He may fast, and rent his clothes, and lie in sackcloth, as <hi>Ahab.</hi> He may doe many things at the direction of the word, as <hi>Herod</hi> for <hi>Iohn,</hi> and yet be in the gall of bitternesse. And is not this like effectuall calling?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by ineffectuall calling a man may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to some kinde of faith; can beleeve Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a Saviour; can get a perswasion that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him; can taste some sweetnesse, as if hee drew vertue from Christ; can rejoyce as in a good estate; as the stony ground <hi>received the seede with joy, Luke</hi> 8.13. And some that being not <hi>onely enlightened, but taste of the good word, and power of the life to come, shall quite f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll away, Hebr.</hi> 6.6. And some we reade of, <hi>denying the Lord that bought them:</hi> that is, both in their owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and perswasion, and in the charitable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others. This is so like effectuall calling, as no man but would thinke them sheepe of Christ, as themselves doe, but are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> by ineffectuall calling a man may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Spirit of God, and be in some sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>sanctified by the blood of the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 10.29. Hee may attaine unto many excellent graces, as joy in hearing, sweete gifts in praying, power in preaching, a kinde of love of God, humility un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of God, as <hi>Ahab</hi>; a reverencing of good men, as <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced <hi>Iohn</hi>; a seemely externall worship of God; bounty and freenesse to uphold the worship of God, and not sticke at thousands of rammes, and rivers of oyle: Vnto
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:26365:192"/>
a fiery zeale for the Lord of hoasts, and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his worship, as <hi>Iehu,</hi> who seemed a servant, that could not abide his Masters dishonour; but departed not from the sinnes of his fathers. All which a man would thinke belongs to sound and effectuall calling. This likenesse therefore of the one with the other makes effectuall calling the more hardly discerned.</p>
            <p>Now therefore seeing this outward and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling brings us not into grace with God without the inward. 2. Seeing it is common to good and bad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Call in all you finde.</hi> 3. Seeing it is unprofitable: as what profit had <hi>Ismael</hi> of his Circumcision, <hi>Esau</hi> in <hi>Isaacks</hi> family, or <hi>Iudas</hi> in Christs family, being profane. 4. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be in the Church, and not of it, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himselfe of the chiefe priviledges of the Church, which is remission of sinnes, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.</p>
            <p>We must therefore labour to finde in our selves such sure markes of effectuall calling, as yet were never found in hypocrites, that wee may be sure our calling is sound and saving, proper to the elect, a note and forerunner of eternall glory.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> What are these markes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A discerning of the voice of him that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> calleth: this implies hearing, <hi>For hee that heareth not Gods word, is not of God, Ioh.</hi> 8.47. But besides hearing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> here is a <hi>spirit of discretion,</hi> putting diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene truth and errour, good and evill: <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. <hi>It is the voice of my welbeloved:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is a <hi>yeelding</hi> unto the perswasion, that it passe not without some such effect as is not to be found in any hypocrite.

            <p>The Lord pleaseth to speake and utter his voice sundry wayes,

            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> If God speake in the ordinary meanes and Ministery,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:26365:193"/>
as the hypocrite, but of <hi>love,</hi> feare, trembling, and the rest: and not into the <hi>affections</hi> onely, but into the <hi>conscience,</hi> whereby they let it in further, and allow it a deeper rooting than any hypocrite can doe. And therefore in the one it is an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation like a blaze, soone extinct againe: in the other it is a cleare light and lampe that carries them along into the bride-chamber. In the one it is like a sodaine flash of lightening, as soone gone as come: in the other it is like the Sun-shine, that shines all the day long for direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>For the parts of the word: the Law and the Gospell.</p>
            <p>If God speake in the <hi>Law,</hi> an heart effectually called heares that voice,<note place="margin">Of the Law.</note> not onely to <hi>see</hi> his sinne, and <hi>sorrow</hi> for it, which an hypocrite may; but to <hi>hate</hi> his sinne, to <hi>loathe</hi> it, and <hi>leave</hi> it: yea not to leave many, or all but one, all but our <hi>Herodias</hi>; but to forsake even the most beloved and bosome sinnes.</p>
            <p>Hee heares the voice of God in the Law as a rule of life, not onely to <hi>restraine</hi> corruption, but to drive him out to sound renovation, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee heares the voice of the Law to get out of his estate of nature, and to get into the state of the godly; not at <hi>death</hi> onely as <hi>Balaam,</hi> but in his <hi>life</hi>; and to apprehend so the end of godlinesse, as he useth the meanes to compasse it: whereas an hypocrite aimes at the end, but either passeth over or slubbers the meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:26365:193"/>If God speake in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Of the Gospel.</note> an heart effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called heareth that voice offering grace and pardon to it, which because it is weary and laden, this voice is as <hi>flagons of wine</hi> to revive his soule ready to faint in him: but an hypocrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not seriously humbled, heares carelesly. The former heares this voice as an instrument of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, by which he beleeves Christ not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a common Saviour, but his in speciall: not to <hi>wish</hi> onely, and make some offers, but to <hi>purchase</hi> the pearle what ever it cost: he heares this voice, not to <hi>taste</hi> onely some sweetnesse of Christ, and the heavenly gift, (which an ineffectuall calling may doe) but to <hi>digest</hi> it, and live by it.</p>
            <p>Ineffectuall calling may enlighten many, may affect many; but this perswades the heart, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth many: <hi>Esay</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie many.</hi> That may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the word, and and receive it with joy, but not with faith, not with love. That may taste it, but digest it not, as beleeving Christ rather the Saviour of others, than their owne: or if they say their owne, they cannot prove it: but this mingles all with faith, assenteth, and truly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and constantly retaines it, when all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blaze is quite put.</p>
            <p>If God speake in the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> hee heares his voice there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> in Baptisme, to obey his first call, to be gathered into the Church, as the creatures into the Arke: But with this difference.</p>
            <p>Hee heares this voice to be admitted not onely
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:26365:194"/>
into the externall society of the Church among true beleevers, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may, &amp; <hi>Demas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and every uncleane beast: but to put on Christ, and to be justified by faith, to be set into the head, and so are both in the Church, and of it.</p>
            <p>He heares the voice effectually, not onely to the washing of his body with water, but to the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his soule with the water of regeneration, and first fruites of sanctification. He heares this voice, not onely to make a profession, but an actuall renunciation of Satan, of lusts, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of the world, and to binde himselfe an houshold servant of Christ all his dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the Sacrament of the Supper, hee heares the voice and discernes it, to feede not his <hi>body</hi> onely with the <hi>Lords</hi> bread, but his <hi>soule</hi> with the <hi>bread</hi> which is the Lord. He heares the voice to renew his Covenant, and set his seale unto it; to eate and drinke worthily the flesh of Christ which is meate indeede, and the blood of Christ which is drinke indeede: and so growes up in the Covenant as a true member of Iesus Christ. He feedes his faith by this Sacrament, the hypocrite feedes his hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heareth the voice of mercies, how.</note>The <hi>second</hi> way of Gods externall calling, is by the voice of his mercies and crosses. The heart effectually called heares the voice of his mercy:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. To inflame it selfe with the love of God, but not as hirelings for wages, but as children for himselfe and his goodnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make him cleave to his worship, not
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:26365:194"/>
outwardly onely, as <hi>Cain</hi> and the <hi>Pharise,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and sincerely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To frame him to cheerefull obedience, whereas ineffectuall calling can make men say, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but they doe not things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To make him zealous for religion, and hate corruptions not in others as <hi>Iehu,</hi> but in himselfe, and that not by a fit, as a burning ague, but with a constant temperate heate against all evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of love of good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To make him thankfull to God, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to men, as God hath beene to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> when the Lord calls by afflictions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> crosses, this heart heareth the voice of the rod,<note place="margin">And the voice of the rod, how</note> to open, &amp; keep open the door, that is, the eare which was sealed. <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> as saith <hi>Eli,</hi> and not as <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord?</hi> Hee heares this voice to make him stoope, and inquire, and hearken further, as <hi>Manasseh</hi>; and as <hi>Paul</hi> stricken downe, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> Hee heares it to make him feare the more, but not servilly and slavishly by the <hi>spirit of bondage,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> at the giving of the Law, lest they should be stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through with darts; but with a childlike feare, lest they further offend him. He heares the voice of the Spirit purging and cleansing him by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as by the Lords fanne, and whitening him by this sope of afflictions: <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> The Lord speakes inwardly by a still voice in the heart:<note place="margin">Effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heareth the still voice of the Spirits motions.</note> sometimes by the motions of his Spirit, when the elect heare the voice behinde
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:26365:195"/>
them saying, this is the way; they heare the voice, cherish and foster the motion, and walke in the way.</p>
            <p>Many are the motions of ineffectuall calling, but they are not followed, but either resisted or neglected, and at last utterly quenched.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And checks of their owne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note>Sometimes the Lord speakes by the secret checkes of their owne conscience, which the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite by all meanes would choake and stifle: but effectuall calling listens to this voice, to the humbling of the heart, making the sense of one or more grosse sinnes to be as a weight of lead on their hearts to keepe them under; to the shunning of them, and terrifying of them from the like for time to come: so as by sinne, a way is made out of sinne, and a passage made to reconciliation, and grace which is given to the humble.</p>
            <p>Thus have we described the first and most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and infallible note of effectuall calling, namely, the true discerning of every voice and call of God, with a gracious fruite and effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same.</p>
            <p>A <hi>second</hi> infallible note of effectuall calling, is a manifest and <hi>continuall change</hi> by this voice; great and wonderfull is the change in a man truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.<note place="margin">2. Wonderfull is the change in a man truly called.</note> He is not the same man he was before: Gods voice and calling makes things that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. Was there not a great change in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was called out of the grave? yet the difference betweene <hi>Lazarus</hi> dead and alive is not more, than betweene a man ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called and uncalled: God hath quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:26365:195"/>
a dead man.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.1.</note> This change will bewray it selfe sundry wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> In respect of <hi>sinne.</hi> Before effectuall calling, oh how did he delight and joy in his <hi>sinne?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. In respect of sinne.</note> who was a more busie actour in sinne than he? he could runne to excesse of riot as fast as any; hee was a loving partner and companion of evill men; hee hated none so much as those who would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him from his sin; or if sometime he were stung and pricked in conscience, he could <hi>confesse</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> for sinne, but not <hi>hate</hi> it, not <hi>leave</hi> it. Perhaps some sinister respects might cause him to restraine himselfe as <hi>Haman,</hi> but to a thorow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he could never attaine.</p>
            <p>But now he is called not onely out of the curse and guiltinesse of sinne, but out of the bondage and service of sinne; that now hee serves not in the <hi>oldnesse</hi> of the letter, but in <hi>newnesse</hi> of spirit: the more dearely hee loved his lusts, the more deadly hee hates them, as <hi>Ammon</hi> did <hi>Thamar.</hi> Now he hates that which he doth. Hee dearely accompts of him now whom God useth as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to helpe him out of his sinne: so the <hi>Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Act.</hi> 16. He gives his sinnes a passe, and saith as <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his Idols, <hi>Get yee hence:</hi> hee loathes his beloved sinnes past, hates the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and avoides sinne to come, with all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, be they never so secret, gainefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> In respect of the <hi>world</hi>:<note place="margin">2. In respect of the world.</note> what a change is there in a man effectually called? He was <hi>in</hi> the world, and <hi>of</hi> the world, hee could follow it as
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:26365:196"/>
earnestly as any other: hee gave the world his heart, his hands, his thoughts, his time, his tongue; he minded nothing so much as earth, he savoured nothing but earth, hee spake of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else cheerefully; hee treasured nothing but earthly things, he was unsatiable, unmeasurable, unweariable in gathering earth &amp; earthly things: but now God hath called him out of his owne Country, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which he tooke so great content: he is called out of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19. Now he is become a stranger at home, his heart is estranged from things below, his minde is on things above; godly thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions begin to take him up; his affections are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that now he aimes and desires other wealth than before; his tongue can speake of heavenly things without tediousnesse, hee treasures now in heaven, and will be a gainer by godlinesse. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> being called forsakes his unlawfull, yea and lawfull gaines for Christ, chap. 2.9. <hi>Zacheus</hi> at a word speaking, enricheth himselfe by impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing himselfe, and making restitution.</p>
            <p>Happy is that man that findes this change in himselfe, that he hath got above the world, that though hee have the world in his hand, yet hee hath cast it out of his heart. Never could this be done by the strength of nature, never worldling attained it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. In respect of grace.</note>
               <hi>III.</hi> In respect of Graces, which discover themselves, 1. in their kindes, 2. in their sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 3. in their growth.</p>
            <p>This grace will appeare in setting forth <hi>the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:26365:196"/>
of him</hi> that hath called us out of darknesse into his marvelous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. By vertue of this holy calling we are sanctified throughout, as we have heard in the former verse: so as there will appeare,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A new life of grace. He that onely lived the life of nature,<note place="margin">1. For their kinds. New life.</note> but starke dead in respect of the life of God, and past all feeling, a carcasse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the soule of Gods Spirit, stinking in the grave of corruption; hath now heard a voice of Christ, saying come forth, and now the bands of death are loosed, a new life of grace succeedes, that hee may now say as Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold I was dead, but am alive for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A new light in the things of God.<note place="margin">New light.</note> Hee that was blinde, and could not see one steppe before him to eternall life, hath now his sight restored to him, that he can say with the blind man, <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blinde, now I see:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 9.</note> 
               <hi>the man Iesus hath opened mine eyes.</hi> Not his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely is restored, but his spirituall senses are quickened, that now he can <hi>taste how good God is,</hi> he can <hi>heare</hi> the voice of God, he can <hi>savour things of God,</hi> can <hi>feele the prickes of conscience:</hi> and hee whose tongue was tyed from good speech, can now <hi>speake</hi> of the things of God with understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Grace will discover it selfe in all new affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He that was an hater of God,<note place="margin">New affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> is changed into a deare lover of God; which sincere love is made a manifest note of effectuall calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. such as are called of purpose are said to be
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:26365:197"/>
such <hi>as love God:</hi> and this love of God as a sweet perfume rectifies all the other affections, it will expresse it selfe in a studious care to please him in all things, and in a feare of displeasing him.</p>
            <p>In a constant delight in his word and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being his love-letters, in a surpassing joy in all the meanes of our sweete fellowship with him, whom before we shunned as an enemy.</p>
            <p>In a love and admiration of his graces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, which are as jewells and pledges of his love.</p>
            <p>In an earnest and fervent desire of immediate fellowship with him whom we love best of all.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">New motions.</note>4. Grace will bewray it selfe in new motions, which is a new obedience unto the voice discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beleeved, even in difficult, dangerous, costly, and selfe-denying duties: for alwayes with effectuall calling there goes a power ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Christian to the fruitfull practise of the doctrine of godlinesse: <hi>Acts</hi> 3.7. And from the inward obedience of the heart flowes all outward obedience in the life. Ineffectuall calling moves not, or is not from within, but from some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall plummet, or can produce leaves, rather than fruite, or sound fruite; but not much, nor lasting, or in some things, not in all, as <hi>Herod.</hi> But this moveth and obeyeth sincerely, universally, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly. Thus will grace discover it selfe in all kindes through the whole man.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. For their soundnesse.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The graces of effectuall calling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and distinguish themselves by their <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Hypocrites want soundnesse in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:26365:197"/>
graces they have, and all for want of this change by effectuall calling.</p>
            <p>Ineffectuall calling may beget a kinde of love of God, but that is not <hi>for himselfe,</hi> but for <hi>wages</hi>; not as children love their father, but as <hi>hirelings</hi> love a strict master. Whereas true love of God attending effectuall calling, workes feare of offending him, not to be offended by him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his presence, in his ordinances, and love-letters, and in his graces, as so many jewels and pledges of his love.</p>
            <p>Ineffectuall calling may come to some feare of God, but onely by the spirit of bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. which true love casts out: as <hi>Israel</hi> in the Mount feared revenge. But true feare of God saith as <hi>Ioseph, Hath my Master done this for me, and shall I doe this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ineffectuall calling may attaine some zeale for God, as in <hi>Iehu</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> case, but rather against others sinne than his owne; and for durance it is but as a blaze in straw, as his being unsound lasted not. But zeale of effectuall calling hates sinne in another, because it hates his owne first.</p>
            <p>Ineffectuall calling may attaine a kinde of love of the brethren, but this is neither ordinary, nor well grounded: it is not for Gods image, and it is rather a reverence of good men, than love of their goodnesse. <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced <hi>Iohn,</hi> but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not: neither can that love that is so light, and set upon indirect ends and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons continue, but will be easily changed into deadly hatred, as <hi>Herods</hi> was.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The grace of effectuall calling will distinguish it selfe by the growth of it, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in sanctification: Hence it is called an holy calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. both in respect of the authour, the holy Ghost, and of the meanes, the holy word sanctified hereto, and of the effect; because it workes holinesse in heart, and sanctimony in life: But also in regard of the end to which Saints are called, namely, by the degrees of holinesse, to rise to the perfection of it.</p>
            <p>A counterfeit may be washed over, and goe for currant, but it wants, 1. weight, 2. sound, 3. substance: so counterfeit sanctification wants three things, that suffer it not to abide the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Vnion</hi> with Christ, being onely tyed by a thred of profession, not set or incorporate into him, he hath no substance of Christ in him.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ is given onely to sonnes, he dwells not in that house where is onely a base sound of sanctification, in some common gift, onely suppressing open sins, but not inward lusts: whereas effectuall grace, not onely checkes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions, but daily renewes the heart, and perfects the image of God. Hence it is that many that seemed to answer the call, fall off to nothing, because they were never good: whereas true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This were to make our perseverance depend on our faithfulnesse; whereas our Apostle makes it wholly depend upon Gods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This devise makes Gods faithfulnesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon ours, which is as absolute as his owne unchangeable essence is, and <hi>no unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of man can make him unfaithfull,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This conceit plainly dissolves our Apostles Argument, which he hath so firmely knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>God is faithfull, and therefore hee will doe it:</hi> and <hi>God hath already called, and he will glorifie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if wee looke into the Scripture, wherein this faithfulnesse of God manifests it selfe, wee shall see it descrying it selfe in two things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which will suffer his end to be frustrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> in keeping the Saints from evill: 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord is faithfull, who will stablish you and keepe you from evill.</hi> Doth <hi>Stapleton</hi> still doubt
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:26365:201"/>
that those that have received true grace shall fall away? see here the faithfulnesse of God puts it out of doubt, for it shall keepe them from all such evills as might frustrate their perseverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in confirming the Saints in grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: <hi>Who shall confirme you to the end, that yee may be blamelesse in the day of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Papists doubt whether the Saints shall lose their grace, but where then is Gods faithfulnesse, who shall confirme them in grace to the end? This faithfulnesse stirres them up to the meanes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them in their dulnesse, raiseth them after their falls, and leades them by the hand to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> drawing the same line with these <hi>Bellarminians,</hi> object, That God in all his decrees implies some conditions; and deales with a man as a physitian doth in restoring a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: He tells him he will cure him conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he follow his directions, keepe good dyet, abstaine from the feeders of his corrupt humour. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a difference betweene these Physitians; one cannot rule his patient, but the Lord can and will keepe his patient temperate, his grace shall remove all lets and impediments of cure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods promises of perseverance imply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of holinesse, watchfulnesse, unblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: But Gods faithfulnesse enables him to keepe these conditions: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.3.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I finde my will so mutable, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to grosse evills, that I have great cause to feare my falling away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But art thou effectually called? then is this will of thine by Gods over-ruling will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to perseverance unto the end.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> For Gods <hi>affection</hi> to the Saints it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall: <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1. <hi>Whom he loved once,</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> The second reason is drawne from the <hi>power of God,</hi> which preserves them to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. His strength is such as none can plucke them out of his hands, <hi>The Father is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than all, Iohn</hi> 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.28. <hi>I know he is able to keepe that I commit to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I know hee is able too: But will hee keepe me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, if thou beest effectually called, this brings thee within compasse of Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.14, 15. <hi>They are not of the world, I pray that thou shouldest keepe them from evill.</hi> Hath
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:26365:202"/>
Christ prayed his father to keepe thee? certainly then he will keepe thee safe: for he was heard in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> God is strong enough I know: but I am weake, Satan is strong against mee, sinne is strong in me, how then may I holde out?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No mans weaknesse shall disappoint the strength of God, but manifest it rather. 2. No strength of Satan can prevaile against the faith of him that is effectually called: for <hi>God is faithfull, and will not suffer him to be tempted above his strength,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third reason may be taken from <hi>the gifts and calling of God, which are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Rom.</hi> 11.29. that is, such peculiar gifts as flow out of Gods eternall love and election: whereas naturall, morall, and many spirituall gifts are sometimes lost. This calling of God according to purpose is never frustrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But though God repent not of his gifts, yet the gifts of God are in themselves changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and men may cast away their gifts, and fall from their faith and repentance, and shake off the calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The gifts are indeede in themselves changeable, for nothing is simply unchangeable but God himselfe: But they are all kept by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gift, namely of perseverance, which crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the rest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the elect should cast away the gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then should they be tempted above their strength, and God should be unmindfull of his
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:26365:202"/>
promise, which is impossible. Nay Gods strength suffers them not to cast away their gifts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For shaking of the calling, if you speake of the inward calling it is false; for then how should God abide constant to them? or his word be true, which saith, Whom he calleth he glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Or how holdes he under his hand in their falls? Besides, he giveth these gifts to none but such as know the worth and use of them, and not to such as will reject them or cast them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The last reason is taken from the stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ raised dyes no more, no more doth the Christian.</note> who as a member must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Christ his head: for as Christ being once risen from the grave, never returnes againe, or dieth any more; so the life of grace in his members, once called out of the grave of sinne, never dies more, no not in death, nor in the grave: It is the Apostles reason, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8, 9, 11. <hi>As Christ raised dieth no more, so thinke ye.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2. The prodigall is every man lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> who by creation was the sonne of God, but in <hi>Adam</hi> lost and dead, and in the second <hi>Adam</hi> found and quickened, if by faith set into him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let us cast downe our crownes at the feete of the Lambe, and put off all praise of doing any thing from our selves, and confesse that unlesse the Lord should adde his last worke to the first, all were lost.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> for <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> in dispensing the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospell, that they may speake the word as it ought to be spoken: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>And for mee, that utterance might be given, that I may speake boldly as I ought to speake.</hi> Did <hi>Paul</hi> need their prayers for that purpose, and doe not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers much more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> for <hi>liberty</hi> and free passage of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the mouthes of the Ministers, that without let and impediment the Gospel might be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without interruption or contradiction: 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Brethren pray for us that the word of God may have free passage.</hi> This is called sometime the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of a doore which was shut: <hi>Col.</hi> 4 3. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, that God may open to us a doore of utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> for <hi>happy successe</hi> and prosperity of their labours in the hearts of the Saints for their gathering. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pray for us, that the word of God may be glorified even as it is with you.</hi> Now the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had received it in power, and with much assurance. People must pray that by the labour of their Ministers the conversion and salvation of men may be furthered: for <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water,</hi> but <hi>unlesse God give the increase, all is lost,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> for the daily <hi>sanctification</hi> of their persons, that they may by unblameable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation remove the lets and scandalls which might
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:26365:206"/>
hinder their doctrine, and become examples to their flocke in good life, and in expression of all good workes. So the Apostle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Pray for us, for we are assured that we have a good conscience in all things desiring to live honestly.</hi> As this is an argument, that you should pray for us, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and honest men; so pray that wee may so continue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> for the <hi>protection and safetie of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> for their workes sake, against persecuters and enemies. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pray for us, that wee may be delivered from unreasonable men:</hi> from absurd wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, which in all corners rage against Gods standart-bearers, men of corrupt mindes, resisting the truth: and thus, <hi>Philemon</hi> 22. the Apostle trusted by their prayers to be given to them <hi>out of bands,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered out of the lyons mouth miraculously by the strength of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church made for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30, 31. <hi>Strive with mee by prayers, that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Iudea.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note>Because men of greatest parts are farre from
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:26365:206"/>
perfection in gifts or graces. <hi>Paul</hi> saw hee had not yet attained, but may receive a daily increase; and therefore stands in neede of the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for increase and further degrees of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he hath.</p>
            <p>Even they are men subject to the same passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and infirmities with others, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> The more grace and gifts they have, the more are they in danger to be puffed up and forget themselves. Yea themselves being as fraile as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their prayers are often weake and faint, and neede many hands lifted up for them to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them: even <hi>Moses</hi> needes <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> to susteine him in lifting up his hands;<note place="margin">Exod. 17.12.</note> for even his hands may grow heavie.</p>
            <p>Men of greatest gifts are in the greatest fight, faire markes for Satan:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Satan</hi> will be sure to <hi>stand at Iehoshuahs right hand, Zach.</hi> 3.1. and will <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now Peter as wheate, Luke</hi> 22.31. He knowes if he can cast downe one of these, hee falls not alone, but many are like to fall; and that God is more dishonoured, and the Gospell more disgraced by one of these than many others: and therefore these have most neede to be supported by the prayers of the Saints.</p>
            <p>This meetes with men of great and high spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, because of the greatnesse of their parts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> they thinke themselves all-sufficient in themselves, rapt into their owne admiration: They have a notable gift of prayer themselves, and what neede they crave the prayers and assistance of others? But suppose thou hadst the sufficiency of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:26365:207"/>
nay wert rapt into the third heaven as <hi>Paul</hi> was: Hadst thou one drop of the grace of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as he had, thou wouldest descend, and out of sense of thy wants begge the prayers of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Christians, and that not coldly or formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with earnestnesse and vehemency as hee did.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note>It teacheth not to despise the meanest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, seeing the meanest may be usefull, and thou maist receive a blessing by him sometime, by counsell, or comfort, or example, at least by his prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note>To incourage poore Christians to pray, seeing here were we see God is no accepter of persons: He will heare as well the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> for <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> as them for the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians</hi>; he gives as soone to the meanest as to the greatest: these are as welcome to him as they, for he casts none in the teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am unworthy to pray for my selfe or others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou prayest not in thy owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, but in the merit and intercession of Christ, which belongeth to the poorest brother as well as the richest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am unable to pray, I want gifts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Prayer receiveth not vertue or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, from excellency of gifts, but from Gods promise, and from faith and affection in our selves: Not the words but affections, and sighes which may be in men meanly gifted are regarded of God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:26365:207"/>2. Thou seest here the Lord so farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing thee, as that hee commends the greatest matters to thy prayers; even to pray for those that in respect of gifts can better pray for thee: Bring thou so much the more faith, more sense of want, more thirst after grace, and thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est better gifts to prayer, than hee that bringeth more words, Rhetoricke, forme and fluence of speech.</p>
            <p>And here observe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Christians must pray for their Ministers Reasons 3.</note> The duty of all Christians is to pray for their Ministers, yea for all their Ministers. <hi>Pray for us:</hi> for <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> as well as for <hi>Paul</hi>; for <hi>Paul</hi> envies not to them a roome in the prayers of the Saints. So a number of places afore alledged doe prove: And many reasons presse the duty upon the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> howsoever the Ministery is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance effectuall by his power,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> and Ministers as starres in his right hand safe by his providence and protection; yet he hath made it the duty of people to pray for their Ministers as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their care and paines, and labour in the worke of their salvation; and as a part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that people owe them, as fathers by vertue of the fifth commandement: and in way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of prayers for prayers. So the Apostle had earnestly prayed for them in the former verse, and now earnestly beggs prayers for them. So Ministers are the peoples mouth to God, they stand in the gappe and breach for them, they by prayers procure blessings on their people; it is equall and just the people should by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:26365:208"/>
procure blessing on them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we be bound to pray for all Saints, and private men, much more for our Pastors and Fathers in Christ, by whom the Lord offers and conveyes his best and most lasting blessings upon us; whom hee hath separated as one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to declare to man his righteousnesse, to be lights to them that sit in darknesse, guides to the blinde, and patternes to the flocke: Ministers by whom the Lord conveyes his saving graces into the hearts of the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. People negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the guilt of many sins: 5 Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> People neglecting this dutie, lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the guilt of many sinnes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that every man being bound to respect the glory of God in the furtherance of his pure worship; which cannot be done but by an able and gracious Ministery, they sinne against du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that by their prayers strengthen not their Ministers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Christian is bound to be an helpe to the truth, 3 <hi>Iohn:</hi> they plainly detract this helpe, that withhold their prayers from their Pastours, their teachers and maintainers of truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every Christian ought to be compassionate to the soules of their brethren, and by all meanes promote the salvation of men: And therefore out of compassion of millions of soules who stand in neede of powerfull preaching, and without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are like to perish, ought to pray that God would mightily worke with the word in the mouthes of his Ministers, to make it powerfull, to rescue people out of the snare of the Divell.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:26365:208"/>4. All those people make themselves guilty of the troubles, falls, and ill successe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that faile them in this duty of prayer: Thy prayers might have upheld him, or helped them out of trouble, out of frailty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such as pray not for their Ministers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themselves of the blessing and happy fruite of that Ministery: the more earnestly people pray for their Pastours, the more assurance of good and happy fruite may they expect from their Ministery, and often of their Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who are worthily removed from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy people, that never prized them for their workes sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This serves to reprove inconsiderate men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> I.</note> who by neglect of this duty signe themselves to be out of the communion of Gods people: they care not whether their Minister stand or fall, sink or swimme; leave him to himselfe, take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his labours, trialls, sufferings, his person, his worke, his wages is no part of their care: they have no hand lift up for him to God or men, but perhaps both against him.</p>
            <p>These are at least inconsiderate. 1. That the blessing and benefit of a good Minister is invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and must be begged of all those that must share in the benefit. One of the speciall clauses of the new Covenant is, that God will give Pastors according to his owne heart: and wil he give such a speciall gift to such as prize it not, nor praise him for it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. They consider not the weight of the calling,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:26365:209"/>
the charge of soules, for which who is sufficient? The rage of Satan and all wicked men against this great worke, never sleeping, but alwayes hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the free passage of the Gospell, both with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fury and secret devises: The many sharpe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults that these leaders of Gods armies against the Prince of darknesse and his forces, are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto: often in the forlorne hopes, not onely bestowing their lives and strength in preaching the Gospell; but often being bestowed for it, and die to seale it with their blood. Did they consider this, they would pray in <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29. <hi>Lord, grant thy servants that they may speake boldly thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They consider not how deepely themselves are interessed in the welfare and happy estate of their Ministers.</p>
            <p>Is not the fall of the Minister commonly the ruine of the people? Can the shepheards be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the sheepe not be scattered? Can vision faile, and people not perish? Can a watch-man of a Citty or Castle be corrupted or surprized by the enemy, and the Citty be safe? Or can a man be an agent or accessary in the corrupting and surprizing a Captaine set to keepe a Fort, without treason to his Prince? Even so hee that prayes not for the prosperity of every good Minister, shewes himselfe in enemy to the Church, and no friend to his owne salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To reprove that cursed generation of men, who in stead of praying for the prosperity of the Ministery and Ministers, who being sent
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:26365:209"/>
of God in mercie, are a principall blessing:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They repine and grieve as if some heavie scourge or plague were come upon them; as the Divells did at Christs coming, because they were tormented before their time: It was never merry with them since there was such running and thronging after preaching; now they cannot sit at ease, nor have roome to bring their beds with them: nothing is such a corrasive unto their hearts, as to see Gods blessing, and successe of a godly Ministery; and the people of God flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his owne Ordinance. This was the dust and daggers in the <hi>Pharises</hi> and <hi>hypocrites</hi> in Christ his time, that they could profit nothing, but that <hi>the world runne after him, Iohn</hi> 12.19.</p>
            <p>Oh that such men would seriously consider, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whosoever esteeme this excellent blessing a burden, a plague, it shall be so to them: It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it selfe now as a blessing, but shall turne to the most intolerable plague that can befall them; even a witnesse, a bill of inditement aggravating their damnation, burdening them with plagues and curses easelesse and remedilesse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is not a more proper note of a Divell incarnate, and a man in state of damnation, than to envie and grieve at the grace of God, at the prosperity, successe and growth of the Gospell.

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> others in stead of praying for their Ministers, curse them, revile them, slander them, runne to the Rulers every week to disturbe them, as if they were loath to be too farre behinde the Divell, or not to be chiefe instruments in the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of the Kingdome of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus those that are bound to pray for their Ministers, that they may be delivered from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and unreasonable men, are most ready to make a prey and spoile of them.</p>
            <p>But doubtlesse they are wicked and gracelesse men, neare to a curse, a wonder their steely hearts feare not some extraordinary judgement, and messenger of Gods wrath every moment. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. When little children in their play cursed and reviled the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> beares came out of the wood and destroyed them: how much lesse can the aged escape, who teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by example to revile and scorne the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and servants of God?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> others will not revile them, but can spy wants and imperfections in them, (as indeede there is in the best) can sit as Iudges on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, cast him off for one weake in gifts, colde in his doctrine, carelesse in his life; and so turne him off: But when did they pray for him, that God would enable him to the worke of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; that God would bestow the Spirit, to deliver the word so as he might save his owne
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:26365:210"/>
soule, and them that heare him? And if they faile herein, are they not guilty of all his defects which they complaine of? Surely would they spend as many earnest prayers for him, as they doe words to taxe and disgrace him; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether the Lord might not open his heart and mouth for their comfort and profit? And what reason hath the Lord to minister comfort, and benefit by a man, when it is never desired? Thou findest no sweetnesse nor comfort in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, thou prayest for none. How canst thou finde without seeking?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> for instruction. Seeing our want and sinne heretofore, let us reforme our selves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> and provoke our selves to so needfull a duty, daily to commend our Ministers to the grace of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were by the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.40. The first ground, and to doe it aright,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee must love them heartily, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must flow from love: where prayer must be earnest, love must be earnest first; even as the love of fathers begetting us and breeding us up to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. true love and prayer are ever inseparable, it is impossible for a man to love another, and not pray for him. Some say they love their Minister, and like preaching; but as the worldling boasts of false liberality: when didst thou ever pray unto God for him, that hee would be pleased to give him strength and ability, successe, freedome from molestation,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:26365:211"/>
from unreasonable men, and every good encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in his place? scarce in all thy life. Then may I say to thee as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lilah</hi> to <hi>Sampson, How canst thou say thou lovest mee, and doest not this thing for mee?</hi> How canst thou say thou lovest mee, and keepest this thing from me? even thy prayers, and best wishes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The object must be right, the things prayed for. Many wish well to their Ministers, and much love they shew them, and pray for them, that God would give them good livings two or three, and for meanes of further preferments, to raise them to the fayre of dignities, wish them good Lords and Patrons, and countenance of great men.</p>
            <p>Oh, the happinesse of Ministers stands not in these things. A Turke or Heathen can wish all these to their friends; and yet Christians wish no more: These are wishes of carnall men. But pray thou for liberty, spirit, courage, power, faithfulnesse to stand against men and Divels, that by force or subtlety would discourage him from the worke: grace and faithfull dispensation makes an happy Minister. Pray for this, and yet I doubt many Ministers themselves pray more for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than these.</p>
            <p n="3">3. With prayer thou must bring the other companions of love and thankfulnesse. We must not deale by our Ministers as many answer beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, God helpe you, but give them nothing: you must yeeld us not onely good words, and good prayers, but audience, redence, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, you must doe that you pray for. It is but
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:26365:211"/>
hypocrisie to pray in a set forme of prayer for all Bishops, Curates, and all Congregations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, if thou doest not set thy hand to thy prayer.</p>
            <p>If love set thy mouth on worke to pray for a Ministers prosperity, it will set the hand on work to uphold his person, his comfort, his Ministery, his cheerefulnesse in the worke of the Lord; all thy pretences leave thee but an hypocrite, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of righteousnesse, who art hyde-bound, and hand-bound, who valuest not sundry yeares labours of thy Pastour at so many farthings. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Savages would be loath to reject their Idolatrous Priests so farre, but either conscience, or shame, or feare, or company would force some expressions of love to them. But Heathenish Christians, nothing can worke them.</p>
