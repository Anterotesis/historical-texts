            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diſſolved and broken up by them, and thereupon they returned to their
former wayes of waſt and confuſion, and the very next day after the
diſſolution thereof, ſome eminent members of both Houſes had their
Chambers, and Studies, yea, their Cabinets, and very pockets of their
wearing cloaths (betimes in the morning, before they were out of
their beds) ſearched for Letters and Writings, and ſome of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
and a falſe and moſt ſcandalous Declaration was publiſhed
againſt the Houſe of Commons in the Kings Name.</p>
               <p>32 A forced Loan of money was attempted in the City of <hi>London,</hi>
to be made a Preſident (if it prevailed there) for the whole Kingdome,
but ſome Aldermen refuſing, were ſorely threatned and impriſoned.</p>
               <p>33 In which interim, the Clergies convocation continuing (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the diſſolution of the Parliament) new conſcience-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſſing-Canons
were forged, and a ſtrange Oath with a <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in it was

framed for the eſtabliſhing of the Biſhops Hierarchy, with ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments

neceſſary to Salvation. And that I will not endeavour by my ſelfe or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
directly or indirectly, to bring in any Popiſh Doctrine, contrary to that
which is ſo eſtabliſhed: Nor will I ever give my conſent to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

all theſe things I doe plainly and ſincerely acknowledge and ſwear, according to
the plaine and common ſence, and underſtanding of the ſame words, without
any equivocation, or mentall evaſion, or ſecret reſervation whatſoever. And
this I doe heartily, willingly, and truly upon the faith of a Chriſtian. <hi>So help
me God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>34 In this Convocation ſore Taxations were alſo impoſed upon
the whole Clergie, even no leſſe than ſix Subſidies, beſides a bountifull
contribution to forward that intended War againſt <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35 For the advancing of which ſaid ſums for this War, the Popiſh
were moſt free and forward; yea, and a ſolemn prayer was compoſed
and impoſed by the Biſhops on their Miniſters every where, to be uſed
and read in all Churches againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as rebels and traytors.</p>
               <p>36 The Papiſts alſo in a high meaſure enjoyed even almoſt a totall
toleration, and a Popes Nuncio ſuffered amongſt us to act and govern
all Romiſh affairs, yea a kind of private Popiſh Parliament kept in the
Kingdom, and Popiſh Juriſdictions erected among them.</p>
               <p>37 Commiſſioners were alſo (ſecretly) iſſued out for ſome great
and eminent Papiſts, for martiall Commands, for levying of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and ſtrengthening their party with Arms and Ammunition of all
ſorts, and in great plenty.</p>
               <p>38 His Majeſties treaſure was by theſe means ſo extreamly exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and his revenues ſo anticipated, that he was forced to compell (as
it were) his own ſervants, Judges, and Officers of all ſorts, to lend him
great ſums of money, and priſons filled with refuſers of theſe and the
other illegal payments; yea, many High-Sheriffs ſummoned in the
Star-Chamber, and to the Councel-board, and ſome of them impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
for not being quick enough in levying of Ship-money, and
ſuch like intolerable taxations.</p>
               <p>39 In ſum, the whole Land was now brought into a lamentble
and languiſhing condition of being moſt miſerably bought and ſold
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118334:5"/>
to any that could give and contribute moſt of might and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and no hope of humane help, but dolour, deſperation, and
deſtruction, to be the portion of all.</p>
               <p>40 In which interim, the <hi>Scots</hi> being entred our Kingdome for their
own defence, the King had advanced his Royal-Standard at <hi>Yorke,</hi>
where the cream of the Kingdom, Nobles, and Gentry being aſſembled,
and a Treaty betwixt the prime of both Armies had at <hi>Rippon,</hi> for a
fair and peaceable accommodation, the King was, at laſt, inforced to
take his Nobles councel, and in the firſt place, a ceſſation of Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

                              <p>MY Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> (and my Lords, and the reſt of theſe
Gentlemen) it is a very great comfort to me, to have your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by me this day, in regard I have been known to you a long time, I
ſhould be glad to obtain ſo much ſilence, as to be heard a few words, but
doubt I ſhall not; my Lord, I come hither by the good will and pleaſure
of Almighty God, to pay the laſt debt I owe to ſin, which is death, and by
the bleſſing of that God to riſe again through the mercies of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
to eternal glory; I wiſh I had beene private, that I might have
been heard; My Lord, if I might be ſo much beholding to you, that I
might uſe a few words, I ſhould take it for a very great courteſie; My
Lord, I come hither to ſubmit to that judgement which hath paſt againſt
me, I do it with a very quiet and contented mind, I do freely forgive all
the world, a forgiveneſs that is not ſpoken from the teeth outward (as
they ſay) but from my heart; I ſpeak it in the preſence of Almighty God,
before whom I ſtand, that theſe is not ſo much as a diſpleaſing thought
in me, ariſing to any creature; I thank God I may ſay truly, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
bears me witneſs, that in all my ſervices ſince I have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſerve his Majeſty, in any imployment, I never had any thing in my
heart, but the joynt and individuall proſperity of King and people; if
it hath been my hap to be miſconſtrued, it is the common portion of us
all while we are in this life, the righteous judgement is hereafter, here
we are ſubject to error, and apt to be miſ-judged one of another, there is
one thing I deſire to clear my ſelf of, and I am very confident, I ſpeak it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118334:6"/>
with ſo much clearneſſe, that I hope I ſhall have your Chriſtian charity
in the belief of it; I did alwayes think that the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi>
were the happieſt conſtitutions that any Kingdome or any Nation lived
under, and under God the means of making King and people happy, ſo
far have I been from being againſt Parliaments; for my death, I here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
all the world, and pray God heartily to forgive them; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
my Lord Primate, I am very glad that his Majeſty is pleaſed to
conceive me not mericing ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment as the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
execution of this ſentence; I am very glad, and infinitely rejoyce in
this mercy of his, and beſeech God to turn it to him, and that he may find
mercy when he hath moſt need of it; I wiſh the Kingdom all the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and happines in the world; I did it living, and now dying it is my
wiſh. I do now profeſs it from my heart, and do moſt humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to every man here, and wiſh every man to lay his hand upon his
heart, and conſider ſeriouſly whether the beginning of the happines of a
people ſhould be writ in letters of blood; I fear you are in a wrong way,
and I deſire Almighty God, that not one drop of my blood may riſe up
in judgement againſt you. <hi>(My Lord)</hi> I profeſs my ſelf a true and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Son to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the Church wherein I was born,
and wherein I was bred; proſperity &amp; happines be ever to it: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it hath been ſaid, that I have inclined to Popery, if it be an objection
worth anſwering, let me ſay truly, that from the time ſince I was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one years of age, till this hour, now going upon forty nine, I never
had thought in my heart, to doubt of the truth of my Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and never any had the boldneſſe to ſuggeſt to me contrary to the
beſt of my remembrance; and ſo being reconciled to the mercies of
Chriſt Jeſus my Saviour, into whoſe boſom I hope ſhortly to be gathered
to that eternall happineſs that ſhall never have end, I deſire heartily
the forgiveneſſe of every man, both for any raſh or unadviſed word, or
deed, and deſire your prayes: And ſo my Lord farewel, farewel all the
things of this world: Lord ſtrengthen my faith, give me confidence and
aſſurance in the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. I deſire you, that you would be
ſilent and joyn in prayers with me, and I truſt in God that we ſhall all
meet, and live eternally in heaven, there to receive the accompliſhment
of all happines, where every tear ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and every
ſad thought from our hearts: And ſo God bleſs this Kingdome, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

as I had any hopes that this ſort of my ſuffering might conduce to the
peace of theſe 3 Kingdoms, or the hindring of more effuſion of blood, I
did willingly undergo, but now finding by too certaine proofs, that this
my continued patience would not only turne to my perſonal ruine, but
likewiſe be of much more prejudice to the furtherance of the publique
good, I thought I was bound as well by natural as political obligations,
to ſeek my ſafety, by retiring my ſelf for ſome time from publique view
both of my friends and enemies, and I appeal to all indifferent men to
judge, if I have not cauſe to free my ſelfe from the hands of thoſe who
change their principles with their condition, and who are not aſhamed,
openly to intend the deſtruction of the Nobility, by taking away their
negative voyce, and with whom the Levellers doctrine is rather coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
then puniſhed; and as for their intentions to my perſon, their
changing and putting more ſtrict guards upon me, with the diſcharging
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118334:15"/>
moſt of all the ſervants of mine, who formerly they admitted to wait
upon me, do ſufficiently declare: nor would I have this my retirement
miſ-interpreted, for I ſhall earneſtly and unceſſantly endeavour the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a ſafe and well-grounded peace, where ever I am or ſhall be, and
that (as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſtian blood,
for which how many times have I preſt to be heard, and yet no ear given
to me; and can any reaſonable man think (according to the ordinary
courſe of affairs, there can be a ſetled peace without it, or that God will
bleſs thoſe that refuſe to hear their own King? ſurely no; I muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
add that (beſides what concerns my ſelf) unleſs all other chief
intereſts have not only a hearing, but likewiſe juſt ſatisfaction given to
them (to wit, the Presbyterians, Independents, Army, thoſe who have
adhered to me, and even the <hi>Scots)</hi> I ſay there cannot (I ſpeak not of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
it being in my opinion a ſinful preſumption in ſuch caſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or truſt to them) be a ſafe and laſting peace: now as I cannot deny
but that my perſonal ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of this my retirement,
ſo I take God to witneſs, the publique peace is no leſſe before mine eyes,
and I can find no better way to expreſſe this my profeſſion (I know not
what a wiſer man may do) then by deſiring and urging that all chief
Intereſts may be heard, to the end each may have juſt ſatisfaction; as for
example, the Army (for the reſt, though neceſſary, yet I ſuppoſe are not
difficult to conſent) ought (in my judgement) to enjoy the liberty
of their conſcience, and have an Act of Oblivion or Indempnity (which
ſhould extend to the reſt of all my ſubjects) and that all their Arrears
ſhould be ſpeedily and duly paid, which I will undertake to do, ſo I
may be heard, and that I be not hindred from uſing ſuch lawful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
means as I ſhall chuſe. To conclude, let me be heard with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
honour, and ſafety, and I ſhall inſtantly break through this cloud
of retirement, and ſhall ſhew my ſelf to be <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi>

the puniſhment; but I think it is my duty to God firſt, and to my Country, for to
clear my ſelf both as an honeſt man and a good Chriſtian; I ſhall begin firſt with my

for to incroach upon their Priviledges, they began upon me, it is the <hi>Militia</hi> they
began upon, they confeſt that the <hi>Militia</hi> was mine, but they thought it fit for to have
it from me; and to be ſhort, if any body will look to the dates of Commiſſions, of their
Commiſſions and mine, and likewiſe to the Declarations, will ſee clearly that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
theſe unhappy troubles, not I; ſo that as for the guilt of theſe enormous crimes that
are laid againſt me, I hope in God that God will clear me of it, I will not, I am in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
God forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the two Houſes of Parliament, there is no
neceſſity of either, I hope they are free of this guilt; for I doe believe that ill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
between them and me, ha's been the cauſe of all this blood ſhed; ſo that by way
of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf, clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too: yet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118334:17"/>
for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay that Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are juſt upon me: many times he does pay juſtice by an unjuſt ſentence, that is
ordinary; I will onely ſay this, That an unjuſt Sentence that I ſuffered to take effect, is
puniſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon me; that is, ſo far I have ſaid, to ſhew you
that I am an innocent man.</p>
               <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a good Chriſtian, I hope there is a good man <hi>(point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iuckson)</hi> that will bear me witneſſe, that I have forgiven all the world; and
thoſe in particular that have been the chief cauſers of my death; who they are God
knows, I do not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
muſt go farther, I wiſh that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a
great ſin in that particular, I pray God with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their
charge; nay, not onely ſo, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the
Kingdome: So (Sirs) I do wiſh with all my ſoule, and I do hope (there is ſome here
will carry it further) that they may endeavour the peace of the Kingdom. Now (Sirs)
I muſt ſhew you how you are out of the way, and will put you in a way; firſt, you are
out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet as I could find by any
thing, is in the way of Conqueſt; certainly this is in an ill way, for Conqueſt (Sir) in my
opinion is never juſt, except there be a good juſt Cauſe, either for matter of wrong, or
juſt Title, and then if you go beyond it, that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at
firſt: But if it be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbery; as a Pirate ſaid
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that He was the Great Robber, he was but a petty Robber; and ſo, Sirs,
I do think the way that you are in, is much out of the way. Now Sir, for to put you
in the way, beleive it you will never doe right, nor God will never proſper you, untill you
give God his due, the King his due, (that is, my Succeſſors) and the people their due;
I am as much for them as any of you: You muſt give God his due, by regulating right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Church (according to his Scriptures) which is now out of order: For to ſet you
in a way particularly now I cannot, but onely this, A Nationall Synod freely called,
freely debating among themſelves, muſt ſettle this; when that every Opinion is freely
and clearly heard.</p>
               <p>For the King indeed I will not, the Lawes of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for
that; therefore, becauſe it concerns my own particular, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
               <p>For the people, and truly I deſire their Liberty and Freedome, as much as any body
whomſoever; but I muſt tell you, that their Liberty and their Freedome, conſiſts in
having of Government; thoſe Lawes, by which their life and their goods may be moſt
their owne. It is not for having ſhare in Government (Sir) that is nothing pertaining to
them. A Subject and a Soveraign, are clean different things; and therefore untill they
do that, I mean, that you do put the people in that Liberty as I ſay, certainly they will
never enjoy themſelves.</p>
               <p>Sirs, it was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
way, for to have all Lawes changed according to the power of the Sword, I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid
to your charge) that I am the Martyr of the people.</p>
               <p>Introth Sirs, I ſhall not trouble you much longer; for I will onely ſay this to you,
that intruth, I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe that I would have
put this that I have ſaid in a little more order, and a little better digeſted then I have
done, and therefore I hope you will excuſe Me.</p>
               <p>I have delivered my Conſcience, I pray God, that you do take thoſe courſes that are
beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Salvation.</p>

Sirs, my Conſcience in Religion, I think, is very well known to all the World;

called to D <hi>Iuxon</hi> for his night cap, and having put it on, he ſaid to the Executioner,
does my heire trouble you, who deſired him to put it all under his Cap, which the King
did accordingly, by the help of the Executioner and the Biſhop, then the King turning

much, there are many Gentlemen and Souldiers
there that ſee me, but my voice truely is ſo

truly was I ever at any time ſo much in love
with ſpeaking, or with any thing I had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
that I tooke delight in it; yet this being
the laſt time that I am to doe ſo, by a Divine
Providence of Almighty God, who hath brought
me to this end juſtly for my ſins; I ſhall to you
<hi>Sir,</hi> Maſter <hi>Sheriffe,</hi> declare thus much, as to the matter that I am now to
ſuffer for, which is as being a Traytor to the Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sir, It was a Country that I equally loved with my owne, I made no
difference, I never intended either the generality of its prejudice, or any
particular mans in it; what I did was by the command of the Parliament
of the Country where I was borne, whoſe command I could not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
without running into the ſame hazard there, of that condition that I
now am in.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe that Army under my command, as it was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined;
and I, as their Generall, cloathed with a commiſſion, ſtand here, now
ready to dye; I ſhall not trouble you with repeating of my plea, what I ſaid
in my owne Defence at the Court of <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STICE,</hi> my ſelfe being ſatisfied
with the commands that is laid upon me, and they ſatisfied with the juſtneſs
of their Procedure, according to the Laws of this Land. God is juſt, and
howſoever I ſhall not ſay any thing as to the matter of the ſentence, but that
I doe willingly ſubmit to his Divine Providence, and acknowledge that very
many wayes I deſerve even a worldly puniſhment, as well as hereafter, for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118334:19"/>
we are all ſinfull, <hi>Sir,</hi> and I a great one; yet for my comfort, I know there
is a God in Heaven that is exceeding mercifull; I know my Redeemer fits at
his right hand, and am confident (clapping his hand on his breaſt) is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
for me at this inſtant, I am hopefull through his free grace and all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
merits, to be pardoned of my ſins, and to be received into his mercy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that I rely, truſting to nothing but the free grace of God through <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> I have not been tainted in my Religion I thank God for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince
my Infancy it hath been ſuch as hath been profeſt in the Land, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and now it is not this Religion, or that Religion, nor this or that fancie
of men that is to be built upon, it is but one that's right, one that's ſure, and
that comes from God, <hi>Sir,</hi> and in the free grace of our Saviour. <hi>Sir,</hi> there
is truly ſomewhat that <hi>(he then obſerving the Writers ſaid,)</hi> had I thought my
ſpeech would have been thus taken, I would have digeſted it into ſome better
method then now I can, and ſhall deſire theſe Gentlemen that doe write it,
that they will not wrong me in it, and that it may not in this manner be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
to my diſadvantage, for truly I did not intend to have ſpoken thus when
I came here.</p>
               <p>There are, <hi>Sirs,</hi> terrible aſperſions that has been laid upon my ſelf; truly
ſuch as, I thank God, I am very free from; as if my actions and intentions
had not been ſuch as they were pretended for; but that notwithſtanding
what I pretended it was for the King, there was nothing leſſe intended then to
ſerve him in it. I was bred with him for many years, I was his domeſtique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and there was nothing declar'd by the Parliament that was not really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by me; and truly, in it I ventured my life one way, and now I loſe it
another way: and that was one of the ends, as to the King; I ſpeake onely
of that, becauſe the reſt has many particulars; and to clear my ſelf from ſo
horrid an aſperſion as is laid upon me: neither was there any other deſigne
known to me by the in coming of that Army, then what is really in the
Declaration publiſhed. His perſon, I doe profeſſe, I had reaſon to love, as
he was my King, and as he had been my Maſter: It hath pleaſed God now
to diſpoſe of him, ſo as it cannot be thought flattery to have ſaid this, or any
end in me for the ſaying of it, but to free my ſelf from that Calumny which
lay upon me: I cannot gain by it, yet Truth is that which we ſhall gaine
by for ever.</p>
               <p>There hath been much ſpoken, <hi>Sir,</hi> of an invitation into this Kingdome:
it's mentioned in that <hi>Declaration,</hi> and truly to that I did and doe remit my
ſelf: and I have been very much laboured for diſcoveries of theſe inviters,
'Tis no time to diſſemble, How willing I was to have ſerved this Nation in
any thing that was in my power, is known to very many honeſt, pious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men; and how ready I would have been to have done what I could
to have ſerved them, if it had pleaſed them to have preſerved my life, in
whoſe hands there was a power: They have not thought it fit, and ſo I am
become unuſefull in that which willingly I would have done. As I ſaid at
firſt (Sir) ſo I ſay now concerning that point; I wiſh the Kingdome happineſs,
I wiſh it peace; and truly Sir, I wiſh that this bloud of mine may be the laſt
that is drawn: and howſoever I may perhaps have ſome reluctancie with my

wanting by my Prayers to God Almighty for the happineſſe of the King; and
truly I ſhall pray ſtill, that God may ſo direct him as that may be done which
ſhall tend to his glory, and the peace and happineſſe of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>For my Religion, that which I ſaid was the eſtabliſhed Religion, and that
which I have practiſed in my owne Kingdome where I was borne and bred;
my Tenets they need not to be expreſt, they are known to all, and I am not
of a rigid opinion; many godly men there are that may have ſcruples which
do not concerne me at all at no time; they may differ in opinion, and more
now then at any time; differing in opinion does not move me (nor any mans)
my owne is clear: Sir, the Lord forgive me my ſinnes, and I forgive freely
all thoſe that even I might as a worldly man, have the greateſt animoſity
againſt; Wee are bidden to forgive; Sir, tis a command laid upon us (and
there mentioned) <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>The Executioner pointing to the front of the Scaffold, the Earl replyed,
What, my head this way?</p>
               <p>After a little diſcourſe in private with ſome of his ſervants, he kneeled
downe by the ſide of the Scaffold and prayed a while to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Then with a cheerfull and ſmiling countenance, (embracing Dr. <hi>Sibbalds,)</hi>
he ſaid, Truly Sir, I doe take you in mine arms, and truly I bleſſe God for it,
I do not fear, I have an aſſurance that is grounded here (laying his hand upon
his heart) now that gives me more true joy then ever I had, I paſſe out of a
miſerable world to go into an eternall and glorious Kingdom; and Sir, though
I have bin a moſt ſinfull creature, yet Gods mercy I know is infinite, and I
bleſſe my God for it, I go with ſo clear a conſcience, that I know not the man
that I have perſonally injured.</p>
               <p>Then imbracing thoſe his ſervants which were there preſent, ſaid to each
of them, You have been very faithfull to me and the Lord bleſſe you.</p>
               <p>And ſo turning himſelfe to the Executioner, he ſaid, I ſhall ſay a very ſhort
prayer unto my God, while I lye downe there; and when I ſtretch out my

devoutly praying to himſelfe, he ſtretch'd out his right hand, whereupon the
Executioner at one blow ſevered his head from his body, which was received
by two of his ſervants then kneeling by him, into a Crimſon Taffery Scarfe,

me to this place. The firſt thing which I muſt profeſſe, is, what concerns my
Religion, and my breeding, which hath been in a good Family, that hath
been ever faithfull to the true Proteſtant Religion, in the which I have been

done, I think it is knowne they have been ever very faithfull to the publique,
and very particularly to Parliaments, My affections have been ever expreſt
truly and clearly to them. The diſpoſitions of affairs now have put things in
another poſture then they were when I was ingaged with the Parliament:
I have never gone off from thoſe Principles that ever I have profeſſed: I
have lived in them, and by Gods grace wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and changes that may carry them further then I thought reaſonable,
and there I left them: But there hath been nothing that I have ſaid, or done,
or profeſſed either by Covenant, or Declaration, which hath not bin very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and very clear upon the principles that I ever have gone upon, which
was to ſerve the King the Parliament, Religion (I ſhould have ſaid in the
firſt place) the Common-wealth, and to ſeek the peace of the Kingdome:
That made me thinke it no improper time, being preſt out by accidents and
circumſtances, to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdome, which I thought was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſince there was ſomething then in agitation, but nothing agreed on for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Propoſitions to the King; that was the furtheſt aime that I had, and truly
beyond that I had no intention, none at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And God be praiſed, although my
blood comes to be ſhed here, there was I think ſcarcely a drop of blood ſhed
in that action that I was ingaged in. For the preſent affairs, as they are, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to judge of them: and truly they are in ſuch a condition, as (I
conceive) no body can make a judgement of them: and therefore I muſt make
uſe of my prayers, rather then of my opinion, which are, that God would
bleſſe this Kingdome, this Nation, this State; that he would ſettle it in a way
agreeable to what this Kingdome hath been happily governed under; by a
King, by the Lords, by the Commons, a Government that (I conceive) it
hath flouriſhed much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather
a prejudice, a diſorder, and a confuſion then the contrary. I look upon the
Poſterity of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and truly my conſcience directs me to it, to deſire, that
if God be pleaſed that theſe people may look upon them with that affection
that they owe, that they may be called in again, and they may be, not through
blood, nor through diſorder, admitted again into that power, and to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that God hath in their birth intended to them I ſhall pray with all my Soul
for the happineſſe of this State, of this Nation, that the blood which is here
ſpilt, may be even the laſt which may fall among us, and truly I ſhould lay
down my life with as much cheerfulneſſe as ever perſon did, if I conceived
that there would no more blood follow us; for a State, or affairs that are
built upon blood, is a foundation for the moſt part that doth not proſper.</p>
               <p>After the bleſſing that I give to the Nation, to the Kingdom, and truly to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118334:21"/>
the Parliament, I doe wiſh with all my heart, happineſſe, and a bleſſing to all
thoſe that have been authors in this buſineſſe; and truly that have been authors
in this very work that bringeth us hither: I doe not only forgive them, but I
pray heartily and really for them; as God will forgive my ſins, ſo I deſire
God may forgive them.</p>
               <p>I have a particular relation, as I am Chancellor of Cambridge, and truly
I muſt here, ſince it is the laſt of my prayers, pray to God that that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
may goe on in that happy way which it is in, that God may make it a
Nurſery to plant thoſe perſons that may be diſtributed to the Kingdome, that
the ſouls of the people may receive a great benefit, and a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by them, and (I hope) God will reward them for their kindneſſe, and
their affections that I have found from them. (Looking towards Mr. <hi>Bolton)</hi>
I have ſaid what Religion I have been bred in, what Religion I have been
born in, what Religion I have practiſed; I began with it, and I muſt end
with it. I told you that my actions and my life have not been agreeable to
my breeding, I have told you likewiſe that the Family where I was bred
hath been an exemplary Family (I may ſay ſo I hope without vanity) of much
affection to Religion, and of much faithfulneſſe to this Kingdom, and to this
State. I have endeavoured to doe thoſe actions that have become an honeſt
man, and which became a good Engliſhman, and which became a good
Chriſtian. I have been willing to oblige thoſe that have been in trouble,
thoſe that have been in perſecution, and truly I find a great reward of it, for
I have found their prayers and their kindneſſe now in this diſtreſſe, and in this
condition I am in, and I thinke it a great reward, and I pray God reward
them for it.</p>
               <p>I am a great ſinner, and I hope God will be pleaſed to hear my prayers, to
give me faith to truſt in him, that as he hath called me to death at this place,
he will make it but a paſſage to an eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt, which
I truſt to; which I rely upon, and which I expect by the mercy of God. And
ſo I pray God bleſſe you all, and ſend that you may ſee this to be the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and the laſt blood that is likely to be ſpilt among you. And then
turning to the ſide raile, he prayed for a god ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>God hath given me (ſpeaking to M. <hi>Bolton)</hi> long time in this world; he
hath carryed me through many great accidents of Fortune; hee hath at laſt
brought me down into a condition, where I find my ſelf brought to an end, for
a diſ-affection to this State, to this Parliament, (that as I ſaid before) I did
believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expected to ſuffer for that
Cauſe. I look upon it as a great judgement of God for my ſins. And truly
Sir, ſince that the death is violent, I am the leſſe troubled with it, becauſe of
thoſe violent deaths that I have ſeen before; Principally my Saviour that
hath ſhewed us the way, how and in what manner he hath done it, and for
what cauſe, I am the more comforted, I am the more rejoyced. It is not long
ſince the King my Maſter paſſed in the ſame manner; and truely I hope
that his purpoſes and intentions were ſuch, as a man may not be aſhamed
not onely to follow him in the way that was taken with him, but likewiſe not
aſhamed of his purpoſes, if God had given him life. I have often diſputed with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118334:21"/>
him concerning many things of this kind, and I conceive his ſufferings, and
his better knowledge and better underſtanding, (if God had ſpared him life)
might have made him a Prince very happy towards himſelf, and very happy
towards this Kingdome. I have ſeen and known that thoſe bleſſed ſouls in
heaven have paſſed thither by the gate of ſorrow, and many by the gate of
violence: And ſince it is Gods pleaſure to diſpoſe me this way, I ſubmit my
ſoul to him, with all comfort, and with all hope, that he hath made this my
end, and this my concluſion, that though I be low in death, yet nevertheleſſe
this lowneſſe ſhall raiſe me to the higheſt glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Truly, I have not ſaid much in publike to the people concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
actions that I conceive I have done by my Counſels in this Kingdom;
I conceive they are well known, it were ſomething of vanity (me thinks) to
take notice of them here; Ile rather dye with them, with the comfort of them
in mine own boſom; and that I never intended in this action, or any action that
ever I did in my life, either malice, or bloodſhed, or prejudice to any creature
that lives. For that which concerns my Religion, I made my profeſſion before
of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Family that was
looked upon to be no little notorious in oppoſition to ſome liberties, that they
conceived, then to be taken; and truly there was ſome marke upon me, as if I
had ſome taint of it, even throughout the whole ways that I have taken: every
body knows what my affections have been to many that have ſuffered, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that have been in troubles in this Kingdom, I endeavoured to oblige them,
I thought I was tyed ſo by my conſcience, I thought it by my charity, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very much by my breeding; God hath now brought me to the laſt inſtant
of my time, all that I can ſay, and all that I can adhere unto is this; That as I
am a great ſinner ſo I have a great Saviour, that as he hath given me here a
fortune to come publikely in a ſhew of ſhame in the way of this ſuffering,
(truly I underſtand it not to be ſo) I underſtand it to be glory, a glory, when I
conſider who hath gone before me, and a glory when I conſider I had no end
in it, but what I conceive to be the ſervice of God, the King and the Kingdom,
and therefore my heart is not charged much with any thing in that particular,
ſince I conceive God will accept of the intention, whatſoever the action ſeem
to be. I am going to dye, and the Lord receive my ſoul; I have no reliance but
upon Chriſt, for my ſelf, I doe acknowledge that I am the unworthieſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
my life hath been a vanity, and a continued ſin, and God may juſtly bring
me to this end, for the ſins I have committed againſt him, and were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the iniquities that I have committed in the way of my life, I
look upon this as a great juſtice of God to bring me to this ſuffering, and to
bring me to this puniſhment, and thoſe hands that have been moſt active in
it, if any ſuch there have been, I pray God forgive them, I pray God that
there may not be many ſuch Trophies of their Victory, but that this may be
as I ſaid before, the laſt ſhew that this people ſhall ſee, of the blood of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Condition, of perſons of honour. I might ſay ſomthing of the way of our
Tryal, which I think hath been as extraordinary, as any thing I think hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been ſeen in this Kingdom, but becauſe I would not ſeem as if I made ſome
complaint, I will not ſo much as mention it, becauſe no body ſhall believe I

hand of God under whom I fall, I take it intirely from him, I ſubmit my ſelf
to him, I ſhall deſire to roul my ſelfe into the Armes of my bleſſed Saviour,
and when I come to this place, (Pointing to the block.) when I bow downe
my ſelfe there, I hope God will raiſe me up, and when I bid farewell, as I
muſt now to Hope and to Faith, that Love will abide, I know nothing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the Soul out of this World but Love, and I hope that Love will
bring me to the fountain of glory in Heaven, through the Arms, Mediation,
and the Mercy of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whom I beleeve, O Lord helpe
my unbelief.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make as much haſt as I can to come to that glory, and the Lord of
Heaven and Earth take my ſoul: I look upon my ſelfe intirely in him, and
hope to find mercy through him, I expect it, and through that fountaine that
is opened for ſin, and for uncleanneſſe my ſoul muſt receive it, for did I reſt in
any thing elſe, I have nothing but ſin and corruption in me; I have nothing
but that, which inſtead of being carryed up into the arms of God and Glory,
I have nothing but may throw me downe into Hell.</p>
               <p>And here is the place where I lye downe before him, from whence I hope
he will raiſe me to an eternall Glory through my Saviour, upon whom I rely,
from whom onely I can expect mercy: into his arms I commend my ſpirit,
into his bleeding armes, that when I leave this bleeding body that muſt lye
upon this place, he will receive that ſoul that ariſeth out of it, and receive
it into his eternall mercy, through the merits, through the worthineſſe, through
the mediation of Chriſt that hath purchaſed it with his owne moſt precious
blood.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus receive my ſoul, my ſoul hungers and thirſts after him; clouds
are gathering, and I truſt in God through all my heavineſſ: and I hope
through all impediments, he will ſettle my intereſt in him, and throw off all
the claim that Sathan can make unto it, and that he will carry my ſoule in
deſpight of all the calumnies, and all that the Devill, and Sathan can invent,
will carry it into eternall mercy, there to receive the bleſſedneſſe of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>That Lamb of God, into his hands I commit my ſoule: and that Lamb of
God that ſits upon the Throne to Judge thoſe 24 that fall down before him,
I hope he will be pleaſed to look downeward, and Judge me with mercy
that fall down before him, and that worſhip him, and that adore him, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truſts upon his mercy for his compaſſion, and that as he hath purchaſed me,
he would lay his claime unto me now, and receive me.</p>
               <p>Indeed if Chriſt juſtifie, no body can condemne, and I truſt in God, in his
juſtification, though there is confuſion here without us, and though there are
wonders and ſtaring that now diſquiet, yet I truſt that I ſhall be carried into
that mercy, that God will receive my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> looking over among the people, pointing to a
Souldier, ſaid, This honeſt man took me priſoner, you little thought I ſhould
have been brought to this, when I delivered my ſelf to you upon conditions,
and eſpying Capt. <hi>Watſon</hi> on horſe-back putting off his hat ſaid to him, God

Here muſt now be my Anchor, a great Storm make the findes my anchor

God, though he kill me, I will relye upon him, and the mercy of my Saviour.</p>
               <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> imbraced Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher,</hi> and took his leave
of him: After which, he came to Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> and having embraced him, and
returned him many thanks for his great pains and affections to his ſoul, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God to reward him, and returne his love into his boſome. Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>
ſaid to him, The Lord God ſupport you, and be ſeen in this great extremity,
The Lord reveal and diſcover himſelfe to you, and make your death the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

my friend, let my clothes and my body alone, there is ten pounds for thee, that
is better then my clothes, I am ſure of it. Executioner, Will your Lordſhip
pleaſe to give me a ſign when I ſhall ſtrike? And his Lordſhip ſaid, you have

               <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> turning to the Exeuctioner, ſaid, Friend, doe you
hear me, if you take up my head, do not take off my Cap. Then turning to
his ſervants he ſaid to one, Fare you well, thou art an honeſt fellow, and to
another, God be with thee, thou art an honeſt man, and then ſaid, Stay, I will
kneel down and ask God forgiveneſſe, and then prayed for a pretty ſpace, with
ſeeming earneſtneſſes. Then ſpeaking to the Executioner, he ſaid,</p>
               <p>Which is the way of lying? (which they ſhewed him) And then going to
the Front of the Scaffold, he ſaid to the People, God bleſſe you all, and God
deliver you from any ſuch accident as may bring you to any ſuch death as is
violent, either by war or by theſe accidents, but that there may be peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

may be the laſt that may happen in this Kingdome; It is that I deſire, it is that
I beg of God, next the ſaving of my Soul: I pray God give all happineſſe to
this Kingdom, to this people, and this Nation: and then turning to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
ſaid, How muſt I lye? I know not.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118334:23"/>
ſay to you: When I made an Addreſs to them (which was the laſt) I told
them with much ſincerity, That I would pray to the God of all mercies, that
they might be partakers of his ineſtimable &amp; boundles mercy in Jeſus Chriſt,
and truly, I ſtill pray that prayer; and I beſeech the God of Heaven, forgive
any injury they have done to me, from my ſoul I wiſh it. And truly, this I tell
you, as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am a Chriſtian; but it is neceſſary I ſhould
tell you ſomwhat more, That I am a Proteſtant, and truly I am a Proteſtant,
and very much in love with the proſſifeon of it, after the manner as it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
in <hi>England</hi> by the thirty nine Articles; a bleſſed way of profeſſion,
and ſuch a one, as truly, I never knew none ſo good: I am ſo far from being
a Papiſt, which ſome body have (truly) very unworthily at ſome time charged
me withall, that truly I profes to you, that though I love good Works, and
commend good Works, yet I hold, They have nothing at all to doe in the
matter of Salvation; my Anchor hold is this, <hi>That Chriſt loved me, and gave
himſelfe for me,</hi> that is that, that I reſt upon And truly, ſomething I ſhall ſay,
to you, as a Citizen of the whole World, and in that conſideration I am here
condemned to dye: truly, contrary to the Law that governs all the World,
that is, <hi>The Law of the Sword,</hi> I had the protection of that for my life, and the
honour of it; but truly, I will not trouble you much with that, becauſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place I have ſpoken very largely and liberally about it, I believe you wil
hear by other means what Arguments I uſed in that caſe: But truly, that that
is ſtranger, you that are Engliſh men, behold here an Engliſh man now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and acknowledged a Peer, not condemned to dye by any Law of
<hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England;</hi> Nay ſhall I tell you more (which is
ſtrangeſt of all) contrary to all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that I know of. And truly
I will tel you, in the matter of the civil part of my death, and the Cauſe I have
maintained, I dy (I take it) for maintaining the fifth Commandment, enjoyned
by God himſelf, which enjoyns reverence and obedience to Parents: All Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
on all hands, though they contradict one another in many ſeverall Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
yet all Divines on all hands, do acknowledge that here is intended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
and Order, &amp; certainly I have obeyed that Magiſtracy &amp; the Order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which I have lived, which I was bound to obey; and truly, I do ſay very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
that I do dye here for keeping, for obeying that fift Commandment
given by God himſelf, and written with his own finger. And now Gentlemen, I
will take this opportunity to tell you, That I cannot imitate a better nor a
greater ingenuity then his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuffering an unjuſt judgement
upon another, himſelf was brought to ſuffer by an unjuſt judgement.</hi> Truly Gentlemen,
that God may be glorified, that all men that are concerned in it may take the
occaſion of it, of humble repentance to God Almighty for it, I doe here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
to you, that truly I did give my Vote to that Bill of the E. of <hi>Strafford,</hi> I
doubt not but God Almighty hath waſhed that away with a more precious
blood, and that is, with the blood of his own Son, and my dear Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt, and I hope he will waſh it away from all thoſe that are guilty of it:
truly this I may ſay, I had not the leaſt part nor the leaſt degree of malice in
the doing of it: but I muſt confes again to Gods glory, and the accuſation of
mine own frailty, and the frailty of my Nature, that truly it was an unworthy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118334:23"/>
Cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great a torrent as carried that buſines at that time.
And truly, this I think I am moſt guilty of, of not courage enough in it, but
malice I had none; but whatſoever it was, God I am ſure hath pardoned it, hath
given me the aſſurance of it, that Chriſt Jeſus his blood hath waſhed it away;
and truly, I do from my ſoul wiſh, that all men that have any ſtain by it, may
ſeriouſly repent and receive a remiſſion and pardon from God for it. And now
Gentlemen, we have had an occaſion by this intimation to remember his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
our King that laſt was, and I cannot ſpeak of him, nor think of it, but truly
I muſt needs ſay, that in my opinion that have had time to conſider all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of all the greateſt and vertuouſeſt Princes in the world; and truly, in my
opinion there was not a more vertuous, and more ſufficient Prince known in
the world, then our gracious King <hi>Charls</hi> that dyed laſt: God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
our King that now is, his Son, God ſend him more fortunate, and longer
days; God Almighty ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed both the vertues and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies
of his Father: For certainly, I that have been a Councellour to him,
and have lived long with him, and in a time when diſcovery is eaſily enough
made, for he was young (he was about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or ſixteen
years of age) thoſe years I was with him, truly I never ſaw greater hopes of
vertue in any young perſon, then in him; great Judgement, great Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
great Apprehenſion, much Honour in his Nature, and truly, a very perfect
Engliſhman in his inclination; and I pray God reſtore him to this Kingdome,
and unite the Kingdoms one unto another, and ſend a happineſſe both to you
and to him, that he may long live and Reign among you, and that that Family
may Reign till thy Kingdome come, that is, while all Temporall Power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated:
I beſeech God of his mercy, give much happines to this your King,
and to you that in it ſhall be his Subjects by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Truly, I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it,
that is, That God Almighty would confer of his infinite and ineſtimable grace
and mercy, to thoſe that are the cauſers of my comming hither, I pray God
give them as much mercy as their own hearts can wiſh; and truly for my part,
I will not accuſe any of them of malice, truly I will not, nay, I will not think
there was any malice in them; what other ends there is, I know not, nor I
will not examine, but let it be what it will, from my very ſoul I forgive them
every one: And ſo, the Lord of Heaven bleſſe you all, God Almighty be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in goodneſſe and mercy to you, and direct you in thoſe wayes of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his commands to his Majeſty, that this Kingdome may be a happy
and glorious Nation again, and that your King may be a happy King in ſo good
and ſo obedient people. God Almighty keep you all, God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this Kingdome, God Almighty preſerve you all.</p>
               <p>Then turning about, and looking for the Executioner (who was gone off
the Scaffold) ſaid, Which is the Gentleman? which is the man? Anſwer was
made, he is a coming, he then ſaid, ſtay, I muſt pull off my Doublet firſt, and my
Waſtcoat: And then the Executioner being come upon the Scaffold, the
Lord <hi>Capel</hi> ſaid, O friend, prethee come hither: Then the Executioner kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118334:24"/>
There is five pounds for thee; and truly for my clothes and thoſe things, if
there be any thing due to you for it, you ſhall be very fully recompenced;
but I deſire my body may not be ſtripped here, and no body to take notice of
my body but my own ſervants: Look you friend, this I ſhall deſire of you,
that when I lye down, that you would give me a time for a particular ſhort
prayer.</p>
               <p>Then Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher.</hi> Said, Make your own ſigne, my Lord.</p>
               <p>

and be contented and fully ſatisfied: and then ſpeaking to his ſervants, he
ſaid, God keep you; and Gentlemen, let me now doe a buſineſſe quickly, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
and pray let me have your prayers at the moment of death, that God
would receive my ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capel.</hi> Pray at the moment of ſtriking, joyn your prayers, but make no noiſe

                  <hi>Servant,</hi> My Lord, put on your Cap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capel.</hi> Shoul I, What will that doe me good? Stay a little, is it well as it is
now? And then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, Honeſt man, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
thee, therefore ſtrike boldly; from my ſoul I do it.</p>
               <p>Then a Gentleman ſpeaking to him, he ſaid, Nay, prethee be contented,
be quiet good M—be quiet.</p>
               <p>Then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, Well, you are ready when I am
ready, are you not? and ſtretching out his hands, he ſaid, Then pray ſtand off
Gentlemen, then going to the front of the Scaffold, he ſaid to the People, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
though I doubt not of it, yet I thinke it convenient to ask it of you,
That you would all joyn in prayers with me, That God would mercifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my ſoul, and that for his alone mercies in Chriſt Jeſus, God Almighty
keep you all.</p>
               <p>Executioner, My Lord, Shall I put up your hair?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capel.</hi> I, I, prethee do; and then as he ſtood, lifting up his hands and eyes,
he ſaid, O God, I doe with a perfect and a willing heart ſubmit to thy will: O
God, I doe moſt willingly humble my ſelf: then kneeling down, ſaid, I will
try firſt how I can lye; and laying his head over the block, ſaid, Am I well now?</p>
               <p>Execu. Yes.</p>
               <p>And then as he lay with both his hands ſtretched out, he ſaid to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
Here lye both my hands out, when I lift up my hand thus, then you
may ſtrike.</p>
               <p>And then after he had ſaid a ſhort prayer, he lifted up his right hand, and
the Executioner at one blow ſevered his head from his body, which was taken
up by his ſervants and put (with his body) into a Coffin, as the former.</p>

we returne you this Anſwer, by which I hope in the Lord it will appear, That
we continue the ſame we have profeſt our ſelves to the honeſt people of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
wiſhing to them as to our own ſouls, it being no part of our buſines to
hinder any of them from worſhipping God in that way they are ſatisfied in
their Conſciences by the Word of God they ought (though different from us)
but ſhall therein be ready to perform what obligations lie upon us by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
but that under the pretence of the Covenant miſtaken, and wreſted
from the moſt native intent and equity thereof, a King ſhould be taken in by
you, to be impoſed upon us, and this called <hi>The Cauſe of God and the Kingdome,</hi>
and this done upon the ſatisfaction of Gods people in both Nations, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged,
together with a diſowning of Malignants, although he who is the head

not be an eſpouſing of a Malignant party, quarrell, or intereſt, but be a meer

underſtand, eſpecially conſidering, That all theſe Malignants take their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

which we conceive will not be by a few formall and feigned ſubmiſſions from

               <p>COnſidering how a clear and full Narrative may ſatisfie the State
(although it may prejudice my ſelfe) I am willing with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
freedome, and openneſſe of heart to make knowne the whole
matter, ſo far as I diſtinctly know, and well remember, humbly hoping
that this large acknowledgement of mine (which is more then any in
the world can prove againſt me) ſhall not be taken as an Aggravation
of my fault, but as a Demonſtration of my ingenuity. Before I mention
the matters of Fact, I humbly crave leave to ſignifie the time when, and
manner how I came to be intangled in this unhappy buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>As for the time, it was after the breaking off the Treaty between
the King and the Scots at <hi>Jerſey;</hi> for before that time (to the beſt of
my remembrance) I was not privie too, or acquainted with any meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about the ſending of Captain <hi>Titus</hi> (whoſe face I never ſaw) to
<hi>Jerſey,</hi> or ſending Letters to him, or receiving Letters from him, while
he was there; or about ſending any Letters too, or receiving any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the King, Queen, <hi>Jermyn, Piercy,</hi> or any other perſon in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118334:28"/>
forreign parts during the Treaty at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> but after that Treaty was
ended, M. W. <hi>Drake</hi> came to me, told me he had Newes to impart,
and to that end, he deſired to know (if he could get friends together)
whether I was willing that they ſhould meet at my houſe (it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
ſcituate in the midſt of the City) that ſo he might commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
what he heard of Affairs abroad. To ſatisfie my curioſity to hear
New<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, I was content to let him, with thoſe he ſhould bring to meet at
my houſe. Thus for the time when, and manner how I came to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at any meetings about Intelligence.</p>
               <p>I now come humbly and truly to relate the matter of Fact, which is
as followeth: It appeared to me by the teſtimony of the Witneſſes, that
there were frequent meetings by Mr. <hi>Drake, Alford, Titus, Adams,</hi>
and others, ſoon after the death of the late King, and applications made
to the King of Scots, the Queen his Mother, to <hi>Jermyn,</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi>
both before and during the Treaty at <hi>Ierſey,</hi> of which I know nothing,
nor was I preſent: But the firſt meeting I was at, was at my houſe,
and was (as I remember) at the reading of a Letter which came
from Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> after the Treaty was ended at Jerſey; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of that Letter were (if I miſtake not) to this effect: That the
Treaty at Jerſey was broken off through the violent and evill Counſels
of deſperate Malignants; and that he had ſomething of concernment
to communicate, which he durſt not doe in perſon, being not ſafe for
him to come over into <hi>England,</hi> nor could he well do it by writing, he
judging it not fit nor ſafe to ſend by the Common Poſt, fearing a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage;
wherefore he deſired ſome body to be ſent over to him to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
to whom he might give an account of all proceedings. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the
reading of this Letter, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> moved that ſome perſon ſhould be
deſired to goe to <hi>Calice;</hi> for ſaid he, We ſhall hear the whole relation
of the buſineſſe at Jerſey: Whereupon Major <hi>Adams</hi> or Captain <hi>Farr</hi>
were moved by Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> to goe. There was mention of Major <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
to goe, though he was not then preſent that I know of, nor was he
ever within my houſe, as I remember, untill after he returned from
<hi>Calice:</hi> ſo that there was none that I know of was gone, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi>
told me, Major <hi>Alford</hi> was the fitteſt man to goe over to <hi>Calice,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
buſineſſe of his owne to goe into <hi>France,</hi> to look after his Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Son, ſo that it was (ſaid he) a plauſible pretence to conceale
his going over to meet with <hi>Titus.</hi> There were preſent at this firſt
meeting, <hi>M. Drake, M. Ienkins, Maj. Adams, D. Drake, Cap.
Farr, Cap. Potter,</hi> and my ſelfe, with ſome others, but who more,
I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118334:28"/>
About two or three dayes after Major <hi>Alfords</hi> returne from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> told me he was come to <hi>London,</hi> and told me he
would goe to ſeverall Miniſters and Citizens, to deſire them to meet at
my houſe, that ſo we might hear what Newes Major <hi>Alford</hi> brought
with him from <hi>Calice;</hi> accordingly the next day in the evening they
met at my houſe, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> brought Major <hi>Alford</hi> with him; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Alford</hi> at that meeting gave an account of his conference with
<hi>Titus,</hi> and of his receiving a copy of the Kings Letter from him, as
alſo a Narrative of the proceedings at the Treaty at Jerſey: But he
ſaid (if I miſtake not) that he brought not over the Letters himſelf,
but delivered them to a Paſſenger that came over in the Ship, to carry
them, leſt that himſelfe ſhould be ſearched; but after he came into
<hi>England,</hi> he received the Letter and Narrative from the Paſſenger
(but who he was I know not) and ſo brought them to <hi>London;</hi>
whether the Copy of the Kings Letter was read at my houſe, in my
hearing, I remember not; yet I deny not but it was read there, I am
ſure I heard that the Contents of it were to this effect, That he tooke in
good part the affections and loyalty of thoſe who formerly had made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
by way of Petition to him (of which Petition I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
and if ever God reſtored him, or put him in a condition, he
ſhould remember them: The Narrative which <hi>Alford</hi> brought from
<hi>Titus,</hi> was read in my houſe, in my hearing, which was to this effect,
He made a large deſcription of the Scots, commending his prudent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and good inclinations to an Agreement with the Scots, but that
his bad Councell about him hindred it; Alſo he made a rehearſall of
his ſufferings from the Cavaliers at <hi>Ierſey,</hi> how he was impriſoned in
a cloſe Room: Many things elſe was in the Narrative, which I have
forgotten. There were preſent at this meeting, <hi>Major Alford, M.
Drake, M. Caſe, Major Adams, M. Iaquel, M. Iackſon, M. Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
D. Drake, Cap. Potter, M. Sterks, Cap. Farr,</hi> and my ſelf,
with ſome others, but who more, I doe not remember.</p>
               <p>A little before or about the Treaty, between the King and the Scots
at Breda. there was a meeting at my houſe, <hi>M. Drake</hi> propoſed, that
we ſhould think of ſome way to promote the Agreement betweene the
King and the Scots; where by the way, I deſire humbly to give notice,
That this was the firſt and onely meeting of this nature, and for this
end, at my houſe, that I know of. At this meeting, <hi>M. Drake</hi> tooke
cut ſome papers out of his pocket, written in Characters, which he
read in my ſtudy; what he read, went under the name of a Commiſſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118334:29"/>
and Inſtructions (as he termed it) to be ſent to the Lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
Alderman <hi>Bunce, Maſſey, Graves,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to appoint them
to adviſe with, and uſe their intereſts in perſons of Honour, about the
King, to provoke him to agree with the Scots, and to take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
as alſo to adviſe with the Scots Commiſſioners, and perſwade
them, That in their agreement with their King, they would have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reſpect to the intereſt of Religion, and terms of the Covenant;
the Commiſſion ran in this form, as if it were in the names of all the
Presbyteriall party in <hi>England:</hi> After I heard it read, I expreſſed
my ſelfe againſt it, alledging ſeverall Reaſons, chiefly, That it was an
Act of high preſumption for private perſons to ſend a Commiſſion with
inſtructions, and an act of notorious falſhood, to ſay, this was in the name
of the Presbyteriall party of <hi>England,</hi> when none but a few perſons
knew thereof, that I know of: Many in the company did expreſſe a
diſlike thereof, as well as my ſelfe. <hi>M. Drake</hi> did alſo read a Letter
in this meeting, but to whom it was, I know not, neither know I the
Contents of it, I was at leaſt a dozen times called out of the Room,
whiles the Company were there met, ſo that I am not able to give ſo
full and particular an accompt of the Contents of the Letter, and of the
Commiſſion and Inſtructions: What <hi>M. Drake</hi> did about the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Inſtructions after he was gone from my houſe, I know not;
what he ſent away, I know not, nor did I know by whom it was
ſent away, untill <hi>Maj. Alford</hi> declared before the High Court, That
he received the Papers from <hi>M. Drake,</hi> carried them to <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
and delivered them to one <hi>Maſon</hi> (whoſe face I never ſaw) and he
carried them to <hi>Holland.</hi> There was preſent at this meeting, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Huntington</hi> (who was never at my houſe before nor ſince, whoſe
face I never ſaw before nor ſince, but at my Tryall) <hi>M. Drake, D.
Drake, M. Jackſon, M. Jenkins, M. Cauton, Maj. Alford, M.
Gibbons, Maj. Adams, Cap. Farr,</hi> and my ſelfe, with ſome others,
whom I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more I make bold to mention, That there are other
perſons, beſides thoſe I have named, who did now and then come to
theſe meetings at my houſe, as <hi>M. Robinſon, M. Nalton, M. Havi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
M. Blackmore, Col. Vaughan, Col. Sowton,</hi> theſe were
alſo preſent at one time or another, but at what particular meeting, I
cannot poſitively ſay.</p>
               <p>Thus I have clearly laid open the whole matter of Fact, ſo

                  <hi>BEloved Chriſtians,</hi> I am this day made a Spectacle unto God,
Angels, and Men; and among them I am made a grief to
the godly, a laughing-ſtock to the wicked, and a gazing ſtock
to all; yet bleſſed be my God, not a terror to my ſelf; although
there be but a little between me and death, yet this bears up my
heart, there is but a little between me and Heaven: It comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Taylor,</hi> the Martyr, when he was going to Execution,
<hi>That there were but two ſtiles between him and his Fathers Houſe;</hi>
there is a leſſer way between me and my Fathers houſe, but two
ſteps between me and glory; it is but lying downe upon the
block, and I ſhall aſcend upon a Throne: I am this day ſailing
towards the Ocean of Eternity, through a rough paſſage, to
my Haven of reſt; through a red Sea, to the promiſed Land.
Methinks I hear God ſay to me as he did to <hi>Moſes, Goe up to
Mount Nebo, and die there,</hi> ſo goe thou up to <hi>Tower</hi>-hill, and dye
there. <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>That he was old, and yet he knew not
the day of his death;</hi> but I cannot ſay thus, I am young, and yet
I know the day of my death, and I know the kind of my death
alſo, and the place of my death alſo; it is ſuch a kind of death
as two famous Preachers of the Goſpel were put to before me,
<hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, they were both behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
yee have mention of the one in Scripture ſtory, and of the
other in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory: And I read in the 20 of the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> and the 4. <hi>The Saints were beheaded for the word of
God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> But herein is the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which I am in in the thoughts of many, who judge that I
ſuffer not for the word, or for Conſcience, but for medling
with State-matters. To this I ſhall briefly ſay, That it is an
old guiſe of the Devil, to impute the cauſe of Gods peoples ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
to be Contrivements againſt the State, when in truth
it is their Religion and Conſcience they are perſecuted for.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118334:30"/>
The Rulers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they would put <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to death, upon a
Civill account, though indeed it was onely the truth of his
Propheſie made the Rulers angry with him: yet upon a Civill
account they did pretend he muſt dye, becauſe he fell away to
the Chaldeans, and would have brought in forreign forces to
invade them: The ſame thing is laid to my charge, of which I
am as innocent, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was. I find other inſtances in the
Scripture, wherein the main cauſes of their ſufferings were ſtill
imputed to meddling with State-matters: <hi>Paul,</hi> though he did
but preach Jeſus Chriſt, yet he muſt dye, if the people might
have their will, under the pretence that he was a mover of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Upon a civill account my life is pretended to be taken
away, whereas indeed it is, becauſe I purſue my Covenant, and
will not proſtitute my Principles and Conſcience to the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and luſts of men. Beloved, I am this day to make a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exchange, I am changing a Pulpit for a Scaffold, and a
Scaffold for a Throne; and I might add a third, I am changing
this numerous multitude, the preſence of this numerous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
upon <hi>Tower</hi>-hill, for the innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in the holy hill of <hi>Zion;</hi> and I am changing a guard of
Souldiers, for a guard of Angels, which will receive me, and
carry me into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. This Scaffold is the beſt Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
I ever preached in, for in the Church Pulpit God through
his grace made me an inſtrument to bring others to Heaven, but
in this Pulpit he will bring me to Heaven. Theſe are the laſt
words that I ſhall ſpeak in this world, and it may be this laſt
ſpeech upon a Scaffold my bring God more glory, then many
Sermons in a Pulpit.</p>
               <p>Before I lay downe my neck upon the block, I ſhall lay open
my caſe unto the people that hear me this day: and in doing
it, I ſhall avoid all rancour, all bitternes of ſpirit, animoſity,
and revenge; God is my record, whom I ſerve in the ſpirit, I
ſpeak the truth, and lye not, I doe not bring a revengefull
heart unto the Scaffold this day; before I came here, upon my
bended knees, I have beg'd mercy for them that denied mercy to
me, and I have prayed God to forgive them who would not
forgive me: I have forgiven from my heart, the worſt enemy I
have in all the world, and this is the worſt that I wiſh to my
Accuſers and Proſecutors, who have purſued my blood, that I
might meet their ſouls in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118334:30"/>
I have now done, I have no more to ſay, but to deſire the
help of all your Prayers, that God would give me the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and ſupply of divine grace to carry me through this
great work I am now to doe; That I, who am to doe a work
I never did, I may have a ſtrength that I never had; that I may
put off this body with as much quietneſſe and comfort of mind,
as ever I put off my cloaths to goe to bed. And now I am to
commend my ſoul to God, and to receive my fatall blow, I
am comforted in this, though men kill me they cannot damne
me, and though they thruſt me out of the world, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhut
me out of Heaven. I am now going to my long home, and
you are going to your ſhort homes, but I tell you I ſhall be at
home before you, I ſhall be at Heaven, my Fathers Houſe, before
you will be at your owne Houſes. Now I am going to the
Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the innumerable company of Angels,
to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant, to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of juſt men made perfect, to God the Judge of all, in whoſe
preſence there is fulneſſe of joy, and at whoſe right hand there
are pleaſures for evermore. I ſhall conclude.</p>
               <p>Then he kneeled downe and made a ſhort Prayer privately.</p>
               <p>Then after riſing up, he ſaid, Bleſſed be God I am full of
joy and peace in believing, I lye downe with a world of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
as if I were to lye downe in my bed. My bed is but a ſhort
ſleep, and this death is a long ſleep, where I ſhall reſt in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
boſome, and in the embraces of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And then ſaying, <hi>The Lord bleſſe you,</hi> he laid himſelfe downe
upon the Scaffold, with his head over the block, and when he
ſtretched forth his hands, the Executioner cut off his head at
one blow.</p>

               <p>THat your Petitioner is unfeignedly ſorrowfull for all his late miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
whether teſtified againſt him, or acknowledged by him,
and for the great and ſinfull unſutableneſſe of them to his calling and
condition.</p>
               <p>That upon earneſt ſeeking of God, and diligent enquiry into his will,
your Petitioner is convinced, that the alterations of Civill Governments
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118334:31"/>
are ordered by, and founded upon the wiſe and righteous providences of
God, who removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings, ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he will.</p>
               <p>That the providences of this God, have in the judgement of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner,
as evidently appeared in the removing of others from, and the
inveſting your Honours with the Government of this Nation, as ever
they appeared in the taking away, or beſtowing of any Government, in
any Hiſtory of any age of the World.</p>
               <p>That he apprehends, that a refuſall to be ſubject to this preſent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
under the pretence of upholding the Title of any one upon earth,
is a refuſall to acquieſce in the wiſe and righteous pleaſure of God, ſuch
an oppoſing of the Government ſet up by the ſoveraigne Lord of Heaven
and Earth, as none can have peace, either in acting in, or ſuffering for,
and that your Petitioner looks upon it as his duty, to yeeld to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
all active and cheerfull obedience in the Lord, even for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake, to promiſe (he being required) truth and fidelity to it,
and to hold forth the grounds of his ſo doing, to any, as God ſhall call
him thereunto.</p>
               <p>That though an impriſonment, accompanied with the loſſe of eſtate,
and to be followed (without your gracious prevention) with a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Arraignment before a high and eminent Iudicatory, are far from
being pleaſant to fleſh and blood, and though the injoyment of your grace
and favour, be a bleſſing moſt deſerving to be reckoned among the beſt of
temporals, yet that neither the feeling, and fearing of the former, nor the
expectation of the latter, could have induced your Petitioner againſt the
light of his owne judgement, and the prepondering part of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to have made, or preſenting this acknowledgement, he ſadly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting,
that a whole skin is but a contemptible recompence for a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſcience.</p>

                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. 1651. A glorious Victory obtained through Gods
mercy, by the Forces of the Common-wealth, over the Scotch
Army at <hi>Worceſter, 3 Sep.</hi> 1651. This day twelve months was
glorious at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> but this day hath been very glorious before
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Word was, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and ſo it was now;
<hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> having been wonderfully with us: the ſame
ſignall we had now as then, which was to have no white about
us, yet the Lord hath cloathed us with white Garments, tho
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118334:31"/>
to the Enemy they have been bloody, onely here lyeth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that at <hi>Dunbar</hi> our work was at break of day, and done
ere the morning was over, but now it began towards the cloſe
of the evening, and ended not till the night came, that in the
end it became an abſolute Victory, determined by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
poſſeſſion of the Town, with a totall Routing and Defeat
of the Scotch Army, the number of perſons taken is neer 10000.
neer 3000 were ſlain of the Enemy, but of all our ſide not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
200. which adds much to the mercy. My Lord Generall
did exceedingly hazard himſelfe, riding up and down in the
midſt of their ſhot, and riding himſelf in perſon to the Enemies
Forts, offering them Quarter, whereto they returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but ſhot. Let us conclude therefore in the words of our
renowned Generall, The dimentions of this mercy are above
all our thoughts, it is for ought I know, a crowning mercy,
ſure if it be not ſuch a one we ſhall have, if this provoke not
thoſe that are concerned in it to thankfulneſſe, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to doe the will of him, who hath done his will for it, and
for the Nation.</p>

               <p>Sir, The Scottiſh King came hither on Munday the laſt of
<hi>October, new ſtyle,</hi> and being demanded by his Mother and the
Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> how he eſcaped the Fight of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> gave
them this account.</p>
               <p>That about ſix a clock in the evening, his Army being in all
likelihood beaten, he quitted <hi>Worceſter</hi> Towne, with a party of
Horſe, and marched toward <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> but being fearfull of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118334:32"/>
being purſued, and likewiſe of ſome of the Scotiſh Officers that
might deliver him up, he with my Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> quitted their
Horſes, ſent the party of Horſe upon their march, and betook
themſelves the ſecond dayes march from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> into a Tree,
where they remained untill night, and then marched on foot
that night; the third day they took ſanctuary in a wood, and
night approaching marched on towards <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where they
were received by a Lady who furniſhed them with Cloaths for
a Diſguiſe, and cut off their haire very ſhort. Having repoſed
two or three dayes, the Lady reſolved to endeavour to ſhip them
out of <hi>England,</hi> to which purpoſe, ſhe riding behind the King,
and <hi>Wilmot</hi> as another ſervant by, they went to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a narrow and hot inquiry there, reſolved to go for <hi>London,</hi>
where they ſtayed three weeks. The King one day went into
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, where he ſaith he ſaw the States-Arms, and
Scots Colours; my Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> procured a Merchant to hire
a ſhip of forty Tuns to tranſport them, which coſt them a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty pounds, but where they took ſhipping is not
yet knowne: but as ſoon as my Lord was entred the Barque,
and the King as his ſervant, the Maſter of the Veſſel came to my
Lord, and told him, That he knew the King, and told him, that
in caſe it ſhould be knowne, he could expect no mercy: which
ſaying troubled them, but at length, what with money and
promiſes, they prevailed, and ſo ſet faile for <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi>
where they landed, and from thence to <hi>Roven,</hi> where they
cloathed themſelves, and writ to <hi>Paris.</hi> His arrivall there will
put them to new Counſels, ſince now they cannot ſend their
Embaſſadors, which was concluded on before his coming. The
Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> fetched him into Towne, and expreſſed much
as to ſerve him. Yeſterday he, with <hi>Thurenne, Beaufort,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> came to him to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the King told them,
that they ſhould endeavour to reconcile the breach between the
Prince and the King of <hi>France,</hi> for, ſaid he, to my knowledge
the Engliſh will viſit you with an Army in the Spring.</p>
