            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reverend Dr. GODOLPHIN, Provost of <hi>ETON COLLEGE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>THere are few Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses of this kind, where the Writer considers the Reputation of the Person he applies to, half so much as his Own; for tho' the Gratitude from whence
<pb facs="tcp:62293:3"/>
they Flow may be sincere; yet they are likewise very glad that the World should know their Friend or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron: If something of this should be laid to my Charge, <hi>I</hi> could hardly acquit my self; since 'tis not <hi>I</hi> confess, without some Pride, that <hi>I</hi> acknowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ge thus Publickly the great Obligations which <hi>I</hi> have to you.</p>
            <p>However, <hi>I</hi> must say, that this was not the only Ground of my applying to you: For having undertaken the Defence of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> it would not have been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:62293:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to have shewn, that God reserves to himself the Absolute Propriety of it, and that he imparts it to Man, for a great and noble End; unless <hi>I</hi> had given some Instance how Valuable, how Glorious it might become, by a constant pursuit of <hi>that End.</hi> Where then could <hi>I</hi> have met with so full an Instance to this purpose, as in the Example of <hi>Your Life?</hi> Where such strength of Reason is guided so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Revelation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Vertue improvd and adorn'd by Primitive Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62293:4"/>
Thus <hi>Your Name</hi> supports my Argument, at the same Time, that 'tis necessary for my Protection, who have attack'd an Error of so much Reputation, and which is set off with all the pompous Boasts of Reason, Courage, Honour and Liberty; by which Men chuse to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, rather then guided by Revelation; till after the loss of Health, Estate, and a Good Conscience, they are driven to seek for Ease in <hi>Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among other Pretences which have been brought to
<pb facs="tcp:62293:4"/>
justify this Act, one of the most Popular is the Example of the <hi>Romans: I</hi> have endeavour'd to give some Account <hi>when</hi> it first grew in Vogue among them; and what Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es and Opinions made way for it; how from a People Naturally Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Brave, and Disinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested; above Corruption, as much as Cowardice; They fell firstinto Atheism, and from thence into Luxury, Bribery, and Treachery, Publick Poverty, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Extortion; which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last in the Slavery
<pb facs="tcp:62293:5"/>
and Ruin of that Great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> could not consider this without a melancholic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; formerly not unlike the other in its Vertues, as its Enemies will confess for their own Credit; But, alas! now too like it in its Vices, as its best Friends must be forc'd to own: What can save it from the same Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but the restoring that lost Zeal for Religion and Vertue, and Sincere Love of the Publick Good? And what one Family can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb facs="tcp:62293:5"/>
more to this than Your Own? Where at this time are to be found such excellent Qualifications for Support and Ornament, both of the Church and State? May that Good Providence, which upon all Occasions has been so favourable to this Nation, make you his happy Instruments to this Purpose.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>Your most Humble and most Faithful Servant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>BY</hi> Self-Murther, <hi>I mean a</hi> Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving himself of Life wilfully and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly. <hi>For the proving this Act to be</hi> unlawful, <hi>we are to consider</hi> what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life is: From whence Man receives it: Where the absolute Propriety or Dominion of it is to be plac'd: And to what End it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd.</p>
               <p>Man consists of a Rational Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy united together naturally. Humane Life is <hi>the Result of this Vnion.</hi> There was a Time when neither Soul, nor Body, had any Being; therefore the Soul cou'd not be the Cause of it self; much less cou'd the Body be so. But the Being of each,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62293:11"/>
and the Union of both, and the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Union, must be owing to that <hi>All-wise, All-mighty, Vniversal Cause,</hi> which is called <hi>God.</hi> This I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will easily be granted; and if so, it will lead us to the fixing the true Propriety or Dominion over Humane Life, the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and lawful Power to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All absolute Propriety is either Original or Derivative;</hi> each of which is <hi>twofold, of Men,</hi> or <hi>of Things.</hi> In the present Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Life of a Man is the Man, and not a Thing; he that destroys the Life of a Man, destroys a Man; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys a Man, destroys the Life of a Man: However, one of these may be of use to illustrate the other; and if we know by what means Original Propriety of Things is acquired, we may the more easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether Man has any <hi>Original Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of his Life, or no.</p>
               <p>Original Propriety of Things comes, by taking possession of that which belongs to no body; or which has been forsaken by those to whom it did belong; or else, by making or producing something out of that which is no Bodies; which last seems to give the best Title of Propriety, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only the possessing, but the giving a kind of new Being to the Thing: Now,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62293:11"/>
I. Man <hi>cannot</hi> have the <hi>Original Propriety of himself,</hi> by any of these ways, because he could not make himself, nor can he be ever so derelinquished or forsaken by the great Cause of his Being, as to remain indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and absolute; but while <hi>he is,</hi> he must belong to the same Cause, thro' which he at first <hi>was;</hi> besides, he cou'd not take possession of himself before he was, nor cou'd he be at the same time both the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taking possession, and the Person pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed. If Man then has not the Original Propriety of himself, no other Creature can pretend to it, and therefore it remains only that it should be in God: And in Him indeed it is in the strictest manner, not by producing him out of that which was no Bodies, but by making him out of that, which he created out of nothing; and by being independent Himself; and not only causing, but sustaining, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Things.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As to any <hi>derivative Propriety,</hi> or Dominion which Man may be suppos'd to have of his Life; if we consider such Propriety as absolute and independent, which it must be, if it gives him a Right to dispose of his Life as he pleases; he can have no such Propriety neither, because
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62293:12"/>
this is contradictory both to the Nature of God and Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This cannot be derived from any but God; but God cannot divest himself of such absolute Dominion or Propriety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this wou'd make Man from the time in which God shou'd do this, so indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that God would have no further Right over his Life; and therefore cou'd not in any Case threaten him with Death, nor command him any Duty under the Penaity of any Punishment: In a word, this wou'd hinder God from being Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porent; for he cannot be so, who has not a Power over all, whether Persons or Things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Altho' we shou'd suppose that God shou'd part with his Original Propriety, and derive it to Man; yet Man is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving it. Hecou'd not by the condition of his Nature subsist alone in the absolute Propriety of his Life one moment; because he can no more conserve Life, than he can begin it; <note n="*" place="bottom">Greg. de Valent. T. 1. Dis. 8. q. Secund.</note> 
                  <hi>the Conservation of any thing, is the continuation of the Production of it:</hi> Wherefore <hi>nothing</hi> but the <hi>same Power</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62293:12"/>
which <hi>began Life</hi> at first, can <hi>continue it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</hi> No Man, nay, not all Mankind can contribute the least to this purpose, by making any of those things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the continuing of Life; not the meanest part of his Food, not a Grain of Corn, or a Blade of Grass; nor has any one the Art or Skill so to digest such Food when taken into the Body, as to adapt it to the support of Life, nor so to distribute it that it shall be turn'd into the Substance of all those parts of the Body, as Bones, Nerves, Flesh, Blood, Spirits, which are necessary for the continuation of it; nor lastly, to order the whole distribution so with relation of every part to every other, as to make up that Harmony wherein Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e consists.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as God cannot derive this absolute Propriety to Man in regard of his Omnipotence, so cannot Man receive it in regard of his natural dependance upon Him: But <hi>Life continued is</hi> as fully God's Propriety, as <hi>Life first bestow'd;</hi> and therefore it must be an Act of the greatest Injustice for any Man to cut it off by Self-Murther.</p>
               <p>From hence we may clear a mistake which People may be very apt to fall into by Life's being so frequently <hi>call'd the Gift</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62293:13"/>
                  <hi>of God.</hi> If by this they mean that it is of <hi>God's Free-will</hi> and Goodness that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and continued to Man, or that it is given him <hi>for his use only,</hi> they are <hi>so far in the right:</hi> But if they think that the Word <hi>Gift</hi> signifies here an <hi>actual transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Right to any thing;</hi> the ceasing of Propriety in one Party, and the beginning os it in the other, as this concerns hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, it is a <hi>great mistake;</hi> because as <hi>God can never cease giving,</hi> so <hi>Man can never cease receiving; never</hi> be in full, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent possession of it the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and consequently <hi>never</hi> have the absolute Propriety of it.</p>
               <p>Besides, this cou'd not be such a Gift as conserr'd absolute Propriety, because the Civilians tell us, that for the making of a Gift valid, as there must be <hi>Donatio</hi> on the one side, so there must be <hi>Acceptatio</hi> on the other; for if the first should be sufficient without the last, then it might be in the Power of the Giver to undoe the Receiver. Now when God bestowed Life upon Man, there was no acceptation necessary for Man, nor could there possibly be any such acceptation; and therefore Man has no absolute Propriety of his Life deriv'd to him from God, by way of Gift.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62293:13"/>
1. No Acceptation was necessary from Man, because this was an Act of <hi>absolute Dominion,</hi> and Supreme Power, whereby God <hi>has a Right</hi> to create what he pleases <hi>without</hi> the Consent of the Creature: Not but that this Act of Supreme Power was also an Act of Supreme Goodness, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great Benefit which Life may be to Man if He pleases, and therefore did <hi>not want</hi> His Consent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There cou'd not possibly be any such thing as Acceptation in this Case as the ground of absolute Propriety by Gift, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there being <hi>no Propriety without</hi> some Act of the <hi>Free-will Antecedent,</hi> as to the choice of accepting or rejecting (as has been said,) and Life being before Free-will it self, it was impossible that this Choice shou'd be made: This Argument <hi>Aquinas</hi> starts; and it is improv'd afterwards by <note n="†" place="bottom">22 <hi>dae.</hi> q. 64.

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62293:14"/>
of Man as already possess'd of Free-will, and consequently of Life; therefore Life it self, and those things which contribute naturally to the Being of Man, cannot fall under Man's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Neither can the Power of Free-will it self do so, which altho' it be after Life, yet must be before any Dominion, because it is the very Foundation of all Dominion whatsoever; and this <hi>(says he)</hi> is the true and solid Proof that no Man has any absolute Propriety or Dominion over his Life.</p>
               <p>What then! shall we say that Man has <hi>no Right at all?</hi> No Power over himself or his Life? If this were so, how could he <hi>venture</hi> it at any time, or expose it to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? What has been said, does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this. He has a Right over it in <hi>some sense,</hi> that is, a <hi>Right of Vse,</hi> but <hi>not a Right of absolute Propriety,</hi> a Right to employ it for that end for which he receiv'd it: (which shall be shewn more at large im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately) and upon this account, has he also a Right to <hi>hazard Life;</hi> but this being never to be exerted, but when Life is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> in Danger, it amounts to no more than <hi>a Right of preserving it;</hi> which is a <hi>Duty</hi> rather than a <hi>Privilege,</hi> and therefore cannot be supposed to inferr, of all Things in the World, any <hi>Power or Liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it.</hi>

There are some Inferences which might be drawn from this Head to establish God's absolute Propriety of Life; but these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the End or Design of Life, may, I believe, be brought in better, at the conclusion of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">I. That whatever the End of humane Life is, what Disputes soever there may be concerning it; <hi>it is not the destroying it;</hi> since nothing can have Being given to it, only in order to the not being.</p>

                  <hi>seems good</hi> to any one, or avoiding whatever <hi>seems evil</hi> to him, for none of these things are at the absolute command or disposal of Man; wherefore that which is the universal End of every Man's Life, must be something which depends only upon every Man's self, and which no Events or outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances can hinder him from observing, if he will.</p>

III. The End of Life must be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>to that degree of Capacity which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has in respect of other Creatures.</hi> Life is common to Beasts as well as Man; the End of <hi>their</hi> Being, is to live, because by the Faculties which they are endowed withal, they are capable of no more, than what is proper for the promoting of this; but Man is capable of more, because en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with nobler Faculties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must have a nobler End than they, and consequently a greater degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>These things being granted, the best way to discover the <hi>True End of Man's Life</hi> will be to consider <hi>Humane Nature</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, according to that <hi>Rank</hi> which it bears in <hi>Vniversal Nature:</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it may be of some Use to examine what may be the true meaning of that <hi>Maxim,</hi> which was in so much <hi>Credit</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>ancient Greeks and Romans, viz.

                  <hi>fulfilling of that particular End for which it was made, in proper Harmony and Consent with the Vniverse.</hi> Thus not only Beasts, but Plants, even Stones and Minerals, and every Element, may be said to follow Nature: Yet since there are different Faculties appropriated to each of these, by which they excel each other accordingly; and as Beasts excel Plants by <hi>Sensation,</hi> so Man excels them by <hi>Reason:</hi> The <hi>true sense</hi> of the <hi>following Nature,</hi> and <hi>the true End</hi> of all created Beings is <hi>the working according to the utmost of their Capacities, or according to that Superiour Faculty or Power wherewith they are endowed, and by which they are distinguished from one another.</hi> To bring this particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Man; the <hi>utmost Capacity of Beasts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Faculties or Powers of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: The utmost Capacity of Man</hi> depends upon the <hi>Powers</hi> of a <hi>Rational Soul.</hi> Now Beasts act by <hi>necessity,</hi> they follow directly where-ever <hi>sense</hi> does lead; but Man is a <hi>voluntary Agent,</hi> able to discover of himself what is his Duty, and to follow this of <hi>Choice, not of Necessity:</hi> Wherefore there must be <hi>two principal Fountains</hi> of Man's Actions, namely, <hi>Knowledge and Free-will.</hi> Again we must distinguish concerning Knowledge; for this is of various kinds, according as its Objects are; that which is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62293:16"/>
concern'd in the present Question is <hi>the knowledge of those Rules and Laws by which our Actions ought to be guided,</hi> the <hi>knowledge of our Duty,</hi> as usually divided according to its <hi>three chief</hi> Objects, <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and <hi>our selves:</hi> This Knowledge; so much of Reason as this implies, is easie to be attain'd unto by the meanest Capacities; for tho' there are three Objects about which Humane Actions are chiefly concern'd, yet this variety does not hinder the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man's Knowledge, as to the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of his Duty,</hi> towards each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Object. For instance, who can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant? Or who must not consent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately? <hi>That the Supreme Being to whom we owe Life, and all Things, ought to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> or <hi>that we ought to do by others as we wou'd be done by our selves; or that we ought not to injure our Health, or act against our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or do any thing to impair, much less to destroy those Faculties by which we excel other Creatures:</hi> These are Truths which are so plain and self-evident, that the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 'em is Demonstration; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Man can plead Ignorance in this Case, or that his <hi>own Reason</hi> tells him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>This then is the first Fountain of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, <hi>knowledge of Duty:</hi> And such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62293:17"/>
Knowledge being to be attain'd unto by Reason alone, and yet to be attain'd easily by every Man's Reason, such Knowledge being the Perfection of that noble Faculty, I desire leave to distinguish it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Discourse (when I mention the End of Life) by the Word <hi>REASON.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet the easiness of this Knowledge wou'd signifie nothing unto Man, unless the <hi>Will</hi> did put it in Execution: It must be readily applied, and reduc'd to Action, or else our Duty wou'd remain unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: Thus, <hi>'tis not sufficient</hi> for a Man to <hi>know</hi> that God must be honour'd, that his Neighbour is to be us'd as himself, or that he ought to do himself no Injury, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this were put in practice,</hi> by his being pious, just, patient, temperate, &amp;c. Wherefore <hi>the Compliance of the Will with that which it knows to be its Duty, is the chief thing to be taken care of.</hi> The Vices of Men come not so much from <hi>want of Knowledge</hi> or Reason in this Case, as from <hi>want of such Compliance:</hi> And the true Notion of a <hi>weak Man,</hi> is not so much from his <hi>being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> of his Duty, as from <hi>his not doing</hi> what he knows to be so. On the other side, that which makes a <hi>good Man,</hi> is not <hi>greatness of Knowledge,</hi> but the <hi>bending of his Will vigorously in all</hi> Circumstances
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62293:17"/>
whatsoever to the doing what he knows is his Duty. And therefore the doing so, is that which has obtain'd the venerable Name of <hi>VIRTVE;</hi> for VIRTUE <hi>is the force and vigour of the FreeWill,</hi> through which the Soul <hi>complies chearfully and gladly</hi> with what it knows to be Duty: Which <hi>force or vigour takes different Names</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its <hi>different Objects</hi> (above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) and is call'd <hi>Piety, Justice, Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Constancy, Temperance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If this is allow'd, it will not be difficult to show <hi>wherein</hi> Man's <hi>true Happiness</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; for this is the natural result of what has been said, <hi>'tis that Rest or Ease</hi> which the Soul enjoys after it has <hi>mov'd regularly and vigorously</hi> in the doing of its Duty. 'Tis the <hi>sweet Fruition</hi> which it is <hi>blest</hi> withal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>just sense of the proper Vse of its Free Will,</hi> and its having <hi>faithfully discharged the End for which it was made;</hi> which it being impossible to do otherwise, than by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> showing <hi>what is Duty;</hi> and <hi>Free Will's obeying</hi> accordingly, I conclude that the <hi>true End</hi> or Design of humane Life, is THE FOLLOWING OF REASON BY VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE.</p>
               <p>I will not contend but that the <hi>following of Reason</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ght possibly signifie as much, as <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62293:18"/>
the Word <hi>Following</hi> seems to imply an Act of Free-will; and if this be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reason, as to the <hi>Government</hi> of humane Actions, (which is the thing meant all along) it must be <hi>Virtuous;</hi> so, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, <hi>the following of Virtue</hi> only, might include the other too: However, since these two Expressions have been us'd and taken in different Senses heretofore, and may still be liable to Exception; since it is <hi>necessary to fix the End of Life,</hi> which I shall have occasion to refer to so often in this Discourse, in <hi>some particular Terms</hi> or other: I thought it most convenient to make use of these, and <hi>hope</hi> that the doing so will not be look'd upon as any Affectation.</p>
               <p>This then is that which I take to be the great End of Humane Life, which I shall <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 7.</note> further confirm, when I come to consider the Objections which may be rais'd against it. Wherefore to apply this to our present purpose, from what has been said may be inferr'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That since there is certainly <hi>some End or other</hi> for which Man has Life; whether it be the same End or no which we have assign'd, thus far we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd that Self-murther is unlawful upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62293:18"/>
this Account, because by this Act, Man <hi>positively renounces that End,</hi> and destroys irrecoverably the means of obtaining it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the true End of Humane Life, is Man's working according to the utmost of those Faculties by which he excels other Creatures, <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue;</hi> then it is <hi>impossible that any one who does so, any good Man,</hi> shou'd ever be inclin'd to <hi>destroy his Life;</hi> because the worse his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are, the nobler Compass shall his Free-will have to follow its <hi>Reason</hi> by several <hi>Virtues;</hi> and the more it does so, the more it must be satisfied with it self, and therefore cannot at the same time be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to destroy <hi>that very Satisfaction</hi> by Self-Murther.</p>
               <p>From hence also some Inferences may be drawn for the confirming of what was said above, concerning Man's having no <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Propriety of his Life.</hi> As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be a <hi>certain End</hi> of Humane Life, then there must be also <hi>certain Rules or Laws,</hi> which Man must be bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the pursuing of that End; which Laws being founded in Nature, and not depending upon Man's Choice or Consent, oblige him whether <hi>he will or no.</hi> If there are such Laws as these (some of which are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62293:19"/>
above-mentioned) which Man is thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably oblig'd to observe, while he has Reason left, then he cannot have such an absolute Propriety of Life, as to destroy it when he pleases.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be such Laws as these, all Laws suppose Reward and Punishment, otherwise they wou'd be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Now when Man is in the <hi>State of Nature,</hi> he <hi>cannot be made to suffer any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> for transgressing any <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> he cannot be suppos'd to punish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and no body else has any Right to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him; wherefore <hi>there must be another State,</hi> wherein he must be <hi>liable to account for the use</hi> which he has made of Life; and if so, he cannot possibly have <hi>any absolute Propriety of that,</hi> which he is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for every moment that he has it, but also liable to Punishment for the <hi>misuse of it,</hi> and much more for the <hi>destruction of</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Supposing that Man had <hi>a derivative Propriety</hi> of his Life from God; yet if there be a <hi>certain End</hi> for which Life was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, that Propriety cannot be <hi>absolute,</hi> because it must be <hi>conditional;</hi> nor can it ever become absolute by the <hi>ceasing of the Condition,</hi> because the Condition can <hi>never</hi> be perform'd so fully as to be <hi>cancell'd.</hi> The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62293:19"/>
Condition here is the same with the End of Life, <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue.</hi> There can be <hi>no Circumstances</hi> of Life where this is not absolutely necessary. A Man can never <hi>have done</hi> being reasonable or virtuous; never <hi>fulfil this End so far</hi> as to have liberty to destroy himself; unless we will say, that the <hi>more</hi> a Man has of Reason, the <hi>greater Right</hi> he would have to <hi>renounce it;</hi> and the <hi>better use</hi> that he can make of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>more liberty</hi> he would have of <hi>not living at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude what has been said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Propriety which God has reserv'd to himself of</hi> Humane Life, and the <hi>End</hi> for which Man has it from him, with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that both these have been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by the wisest Philosophers. For Instance,</p>

               <p>HItherto we have considered Man as Single and Independent from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, and show'd that as he is so, Self-Murther is an Act of Injustice towards God, by destroying that <hi>which is his alone;</hi> and also both towards God and towards a Mans own self, by the positive and wilful refusal of <hi>performing that end</hi> for which he received Life, and in which his happiness truly consists. Let us in the next place, for a further confirmation of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62293:21"/>
of this Act, consider Man as <hi>a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Civil Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this we ought to do with the greater attention, because, though it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in some respects to consider him in the individual, and in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet this is only Notional; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so as to any part of the World which we have to do withal, nor can he be so at any time but to his great Misfortune, for as 'tis necessary <hi>for his Security,</hi> that he should be under some Government, so is it likewise necessary, <hi>for the Perfection of his Nature:</hi> for his having a larger and a nobler compass for his Reason and his Virtue; there being several Virtues which cannot be exercis'd by Man when alone, but which owe their being to Society.</p>
               <p>If then we consider Man in this manner, his Obligations to preserve Life are still more; both as the end of Life is <hi>enlarg'd,</hi> (the good of <hi>others,</hi> as well as his own being concern'd in it) and as he has then less to do with <hi>his Life,</hi> (the use of it being more at others disposal) than when he was consider'd in the state of Nature: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has not then the same Authority to defend himself which he had before, but is bound in most Cases to have recourse to the Magistrate for this purpose. Besides,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62293:21"/>
by enjoying the benefit of Protection in any Government, he must be supposed either tacitly or expresly to have consented in a mutual Agreement of Offence and Defence for the maintaining of the same Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which being chiefly for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, as Self-Murther must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, so it must be absurd. But that which is most considerable and sufficient of it self to prove Self-Murther to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is, that this may prove <hi>destructive to the very Being of Society,</hi> as will appear if we consider the Reasons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because this wholly destroys the <hi>best Measure</hi> of mutual Kindness and Justice, that which is generally confess'd to be one of the chiefest and plainest Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; namely <hi>the doing to others as we would be done to our selves:</hi> The greatest injury that can be done to another is the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of him; now if a Man has the liberty to Murther himself, the measure of Justice in the most important Concerns towards others is broken; nor can it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing to say, that this is done out of love to ones self, because it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that it may be done out of love to another too, yet no one sure will ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this as a reasonable pretence for the Murther of his Neighbour.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62293:22"/>
2. This wou'd utterly destroy <hi>the force of Humane Laws;</hi> Man's having a right or power to kill himself, when he thinks siting, wou'd make void all Obligation to Humane Laws, as to the threats of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without a dread of which no Law wou'd signifie any thing: The greatest Punishment that Humane Laws can threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is Death; now if Men have Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to kill themselves, and be taught and perswaded that they have so, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Examples of others, which will not be wanting, when Men are so perswaded; the threats of Death will be despis'd as to the disgrace or torment of it when publick, because they may bring it upon themselves with ease and privacy at home, and therefore they will not be oblig'd to any Duty, by the fear of this, much less by the fear of any thing else; but wou'd Rob, Ravish, Murther, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever the Reasons are, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Civil Society, for which the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of another is forbidden; the <hi>same hold and perhaps with greater force,</hi> as to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of ones self; those Reasons are chiefly the <hi>having no Authority,</hi> the <hi>depriving the Publick of a Subject,</hi> the <hi>impossibility of making any Equivalent Satisfaction.</hi> The two first of these are of the same force as to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62293:22"/>
Murthering of ones self, the third seems to be of much greater; for he that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers another may make some satisfaction as to publick Justice, by the forfeiture of his own Life, and he that forfeits his Life publickly upon this Account makes some amends to the State, under which he lives, by deterring others from committing the same Crime by the Example of his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas on the contrary, he that Murthers himself, not <hi>only evades all satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to the Publick as to the paying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and Sensible Punishment; but in so doing <hi>gives encouragement</hi> to others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the same: Wherefore Self-Murther may be a greater Crime <hi>in regard of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> especially if it be a publick Person, than the Murthering of another Man; and if so is undoubtedly forbidden by that Law of Nature, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> otherwise that Law would be very imperfect, and reach only to the <hi>lesser</hi> Crime, and permit the <hi>greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, For a Man to have a right to kill himself when ever he pleases, must be destructive to Civil Government; because this Right <hi>must be Vniversal:</hi> One Man may exercise it as well as another; and since <hi>no publick rule</hi> can be given to show <hi>when,</hi> in <hi>what circumstances</hi> of Adversity, (which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62293:23"/>
are more or less felt by different Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Portions of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Vertue, their Courage or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) since, I say, no publick rule can be given to all Men to prescribe the <hi>Case ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly</hi> wherein it shall be reasonable and lawful to put this Right in Execution; every Man must be left to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that is, to be led as his own Passions or Appetites guide him. After this rate great numbers may make themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which by Example and Custom may grow still greater and greater, till the Publick is weaken'd not only by the loss of several of its Members, but also by the check and stop which there must be upon all Business, and Trade, Trust in one another; since the strictest Obligations to this purpose may be thus evaded.</p>
               <p>Add to this the misery of the Family particularly concern'd, the horrid sense which such an Act imprints upon the best Mens Minds, the general Aversion which it causes, and consequently the shame of the Relations and Acquaintance of the Self-Murtherer, and very often too the Confusion and Desolation of the forsaken Widow or Orphans; all which must be of ill Consequence to any State, especially if the Fact is frequently committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62293:23"/>
But lest this should give any colour for the plausible pretence of <hi>Compassion</hi> which is commonly made use of by those who are concern'd in the <hi>Coroner's Inquest</hi> upon such Occasions, I cannot but observe by the way, that all Kindness or Generosity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>particular</hi> Persons, though they be nearest Relations, is unwarrantable, which is prejudicial to that Love and Duty which is owing to the <hi>Publick,</hi> especially when People are <hi>actually intrusted by the Publick,</hi> and <hi>sworn to report impartially,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mov'd by <hi>any Passion</hi> whatsoever, what their judgment is concerning a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact. It may be as <hi>injurious to our Country</hi> to <hi>elude</hi> the Design of a Law <hi>out of Pity</hi> as <hi>out of Revenge;</hi> and as to <hi>Perjury,</hi> if we consider it in it self, 'tis <hi>as absurd</hi> to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it through <hi>Generosity</hi> as <hi>Bribery,</hi> though it may too justly be suspected, that in these Cases the <hi>latter</hi> generally has a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence than the <hi>former.</hi> But of this more hereaster. <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Reasons which make me conclude that Self-Murther is unlawful, if Man be considered as a Member of any Civil State; which are all of 'em of <hi>greater</hi> force, if it be also <hi>positively forbidden by the</hi>

In the next place we should enquire <hi>by what means God secures this Propriety to himself,</hi> for <hi>Man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of this end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he does by fixing in him the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Self-Preservation.</hi> This is the most <hi>Vniversal Law of Nature, it running through every part of the Creation,</hi> as is confest by

Ep. 121.</note> especially, who are our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est opposers in the present Argument; but it belongeth particularly to <hi>Man,</hi> for as the end of Humane Life is of the noblest kind, and Gods Propriety of it of the greatest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. As Man is furnish'd with better means to preserve his Life, so must he be more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to do it than any other Creature. Yet some People by imputing too much to this Principle, or by observing it without due regard to the end of Life, have caus'd it to be run down and despis'd as the <hi>base pretence of Knavery and Cowardice;</hi> whereas there wou'd not be any danger of either of these, if they wou'd but carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between <hi>the means</hi> and <hi>the end of Humane Life. Self-Preservation is the chief means by which God secures his Propriety of Humane Life, for Man's obtaining of the great end for which he received it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though Self-preservation is the first Principle by which Man does act, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Life must first be, before any use can be made of it) yet this is not the <hi>only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of Man's Actions, but as soon as he comes to the Knowledge of the End of Life, his Actions are to be guided by that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62293:25"/>
Knowledge. Thus tho' Infants endeavour to preserve themselves before they have any use of Reason; yet afterwards when they come to have this, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it by <hi>Virtue,</hi> then this great end of Life takes place according to its dignity, and is to be chiesly regarded; and Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation remains of force only as 'tis <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to this</hi> end and consistent <hi>with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wheresore since I suppose this end to be <hi>the following Reason by Virtue,</hi> and make this Precedent in dignity, and more to be regarded than Self-preservation, which is only the means subservient to it; there can be no fear of <hi>encouraging</hi> either <hi>Cowardice</hi> or <hi>Knavery</hi> upon account of it; because he that preserves Life <hi>only to this very end,</hi> that he may <hi>follow Reason by Virtue,</hi> can never do any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Self-preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed that unbounded Authority which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Leviath. Part 1. Chap. 14.</note> gives to what he calls Right of Nature, under which Self-preservation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, opens a very wide door to the worst consequences of Knavery or Cowardice; <hi>For,</hi> he says, <hi>that this is the Liberty each Man hath to use his own Power as he will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62293:25"/>
                  <hi>for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently of doing any thing, which in his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reason he shall conceive to be the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est means thereunto.</hi> This Latitude of Right of Nature in order to Self-preservation seems to be the ground of most of his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours concerning Civil Society, and may well be the occasion of the basest Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But we do not value Life at that rate: For Life is but <hi>a thing indifferent</hi> in its own Nature; wherefore to <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> it <hi>meerly upon its own account, is equally unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable:</hi> The <hi>just value or contempt of it</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon <hi>the use</hi> that is made of it, <hi>in the fulfilling or neglecting the end of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Wise Man has a Summ of Money lent him, he will use it (without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his Benefactor's right) to his own and his Friend's Advantage; so will the same Man do with Life; yet such a summ may be <hi>misused two ways,</hi> either through <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which will cause a Man to do all the foulest things imaginable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease or secure it; or else through <hi>Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> which will make him throw it away with the greatest Rashness: <hi>Cowardice is the Covetousness of Life,</hi> (consider'd only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62293:26"/>
for itself without the End of it;) <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther is the extreme act of Prodigality of it,</hi> but with this Aggravation, the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of what was graciously lent to Man, to the most noble and most glorious <hi>End;</hi> by the best and greatest of all <hi>Benefactors,</hi> even <hi>God himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return then to the Objection above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd; as it would be unreasonable to say, that the affirming, a <hi>Man ought not to be a Prodigal did infer, that he ought to be Covetous:</hi> So 'tis sull as unreasonable to pretend, that because we affirm that Self-preservation <hi>ought</hi> to be observ'd, we <hi>would have</hi> Men turn Knaves or Cowards <hi>in order to the doing so.</hi> By no means; for as it was said before, The true end of Life is the following of <hi>Reason by Virtue,</hi> Life may be <hi>hazarded</hi> in order to this end, and Death may be <hi>suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> rather than act against it; but suffer'd always from <hi>others,</hi> never from <hi>one's self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as People strive to disgrace Self-preservation, by the Imputations above-mentioned; so they cry up the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Life,</hi> on the other side, as the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Courage and Magnanimity:</hi> But he that knows what the <hi>right end</hi> of Living is, will keep this in his Eye in all Events, and therefore will <hi>neither value nor despise Life,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62293:26"/>
but <hi>only as it is more or less consistent with his Duty:</hi> And <hi>this is true Magnanimity;</hi> this will make him <hi>scorn to do an ill Thing to save Life;</hi> because this would be <hi>to destroy the very end</hi> for which he had Life: the <hi>doing well.</hi> On the other side, this <hi>will hinder</hi> him from throwing away Life, by <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther;</hi> because whatever his Condition is; the performing of the end of Life, can <hi>never be out of his Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore nothing can be more absurd, than that <hi>Contempt of Life,</hi> which is so very much affected by some People; which injudicious Poets very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute too: What than to have a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro strutting and ranting against Life; when either he has made it <hi>miserable by his Folly,</hi> or is <hi>incapable</hi> of making a <hi>proper vse</hi> of it by his <hi>Ignorance: Not to know what to do with Life, is not to know what to do with Reason.</hi> There are a great many Men in the World, who despise the Slavery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and Forecast, and depend only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gross Enjoyment of the present Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And then whenever they meet with opposition or disappointment, (which they must needs do often) they quarrel with Life, and are for parting with it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; whereas it <hi>is not</hi> Life, but <hi>they</hi> who are in Fault. <hi>Life is always pleasing,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62293:27"/>
                  <hi>when Reason is faithfully obey'd;</hi> when <hi>this is forsaken, Life indeed is worth nothing:</hi> But then who is it that makes it so? Yet still, after all, when it is become so worthless, <hi>Self-murther</hi> is not necessary; because the Cause of its being worthless may be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, if the Person concern'd pleases; and he can no sooner understand for what Reason Life is <hi>despicable,</hi> but that he may make it quite otherwise, by pursuing the <hi>true end</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to confirm this Contempt of Life, they plead the Examples of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and others, who have suffer'd Death with all Calmness and Magnanimity. But will any Man venture to say seriously, that these great Men behav'd themselves as they did out of <hi>Contempt of Life,</hi> or <hi>despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> or <hi>neglecting Self-preservation. This would be the greatest Detraction.</hi>

How much greater would it be for a Man to acknowledge, that he is not <hi>insensible</hi> of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62293:27"/>
the Terrors of Death, and yet to shew at the same time, that <hi>he is ready to suffer all, rather than trangress</hi> against that <hi>end</hi> for which Life was given him, by committing any one Crime. Wherefore when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the settled and calm Resolution of any great and innocent Man, at the point of violent Death, <hi>let it not be said,</hi> that he was glad to die out of any <hi>Contempt</hi> of Life: <hi>But allow him to have</hi> had a natural regard to Life, and <hi>then his parting with it upon the Account of Vertue, will be truly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62293:30"/>
Self-preservation is of natural Law, yet that natural Law is so general, that it extends to Beasts more than to Vs; because they cannot compare Degrees of Obligation, and Distinctions of Duties and Offices, as we can.</p>
               <p>Here in the first Place 'tis observable, that we have it acknowledged, That Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation <hi>is a Law of Nature.</hi> The same is also consessed by the Stoicks, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd before. That this <hi>Law extends to Beasts as well as to us, is true;</hi> so does it to Creatures inferior to them; that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it <hi>better</hi> than we do, is <hi>also true:</hi> But that they <hi>are more</hi> obliged to observe it than we are, which I suppose is meant by its extending to Beasts more than to us, is a <hi>great Mistake.</hi> The Law indeed is general, but the Obligation to observe it, is more or less, according to the <hi>Rank</hi> which each Creature bears in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and according as it is <hi>qualified</hi> to obey it: Wherefore since the end of humane Life is <hi>to follow Reason by Virtue;</hi> since by the same Power of <hi>Reason,</hi> Man is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with better means to preserve <hi>his</hi> Life to this <hi>great End;</hi> he must be <hi>more obliged</hi> to the Observation of this Law, than other inferior Creatures. And where the Law is plain, and <hi>acknowledged</hi> on all sides, as that of Self-preservation is here. As
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62293:31"/>
there can be no occasion for <hi>comparing of Degrees of Obligation,</hi> or of any <hi>Distinctions of Offices and Duties;</hi> so the making Use of these, proves always prejudicial to the Law: For when Men are thus shewing <hi>their Parts,</hi> they generally distinguish away <hi>their Duty.</hi> This also is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a prejudic'd and partial Temper: For in these Cases the Law is first broken; <hi>(at least in Intention)</hi> and then People raise up a Number of little Niceties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, to escape in the Dust of them: As if Reason were given them to evade Obedience to Laws, though never so much acknowledged, and not to promote it. This it was necessary to observe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause what this Learned Author says here, is to make way for all that he says after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

Self-preservation is not so of particular a Law of Nature, but that it is often transgress'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally.</p>
               <p>This is attempted to be proved again, by comparing <hi>Deserting and Destroying</hi> one's self, and by showing, that they are <hi>the same Thing:</hi> After which he would have it, that <note n="*" place="bottom">This he calls his chief Strength, p. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>Deserting one's self is Lawful in many Respects. As when a Man puts himself upon a Jury: Or when a Man may chuse to repel Force by Force: When he attends an Executioner: When he practises consuming Penances;</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 131.</note> Or, <hi>When he stands mute at the Bar.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>This latter Case,</hi> says he, <hi>seems to be justified by Church and State; and that for so low a Respect, as the saving of a Tempor al Estate, or escaping the Ignominy of another Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Instances are of divers Kinds, and may be thus divided:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Into such as relate directly to Civil Society, which shall be consider'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such us concern Religion; as that <hi>a Man may desert himself by consuming Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Which is not true, if consuming to such a Degree as to destroy Life; but this does not belong to the Argument in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62293:32"/>
3. As for those others which remain, it cannot be proved from any of them, that <hi>Desertion of one's self is Lawful,</hi> or that Self-preservation may be transgress'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally upon this account. For Example; whereas it is said, <hi>That a Man may choose to repel Force with Force in the State of Nature;</hi> this is by no means so, when Life is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently in danger; or <hi>that a Man deserts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by attending an Executioner;</hi> this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, because he has <hi>forfeited his Life</hi> to the Publick, and that too by his <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> if he has <hi>taken his</hi> Tryal. Nor does <hi>he desert his Life who puts himself upon a Jury;</hi> but on the contrary, endeavours to <hi>preserve it,</hi> by the Privilege which that Ancient and Excellent Law allows him. Some have also brought Instances of <hi>Soldiers and Seamen, as seeking Death lawfully;</hi> or as hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Deaths upon lawful Motives; and therefore without any Breach of this Law of Self p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>servation. But nothing can be more weak than this: Ask the Soldier, or the Sea-man, whether they <hi>seek Death, or no;</hi> and they will confess that, on the contrary, <hi>they seek a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:</hi> If not, why do the bravest of them oppose those who would bring them Death so vigorously?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62293:32"/>
But to shew the unreasonableness of such Pretences, <hi>I will propose a Case much stronger</hi> than any of these; in which, notwithstanding the Law of Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not be infringed, but most strictly observ'd. <hi>Vpon a Shipwreck,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Leagues from any Land, ten Persons get into the Long-boat, who being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven backwards and forwards for many Days, and their Provision all spent; agree to cast Lots who shall be first eaten, and continue to do so, till but two are left; Was this Lawful? Yes certainly; Is not this then a <hi>plain Breach of the Law</hi> of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation so often mention'd? <hi>Not at all; but rather the Observing it in the best manner:</hi> Because if this Course had not been taken, there would have been <hi>certain Death to them all</hi> in a few Hours, either by Famine, or by Killing one another. In this Case, it was lawful for them not only to put their Lives upon the <hi>Hazard</hi> of Ten to One, but upon <hi>equal Hazard,</hi> as the Two last must do. Because a <hi>Hazard of Death</hi> upon the <hi>hardest Terms,</hi> is better than <hi>a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it.</hi> All this then being done, as the <hi>using</hi> the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>only way to preserve Life,</hi> and consequently in each Man's <hi>own Defence,</hi> can be no <hi>Breach</hi> of the Law of Self-preservation; the same Account may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62293:33"/>
be given of several other pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s of <hi>Desertion</hi> of one's self. They first suppose some Case in which Man is brought into <hi>great Hazard</hi> of Life; but this <hi>Hazard they conceal,</hi> or <hi>pass over slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> And then if he incur any danger in order to preserve it; they call <hi>this Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of one's self, and transgressing the Law of Self-preservation; <hi>Whereas the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, is the most faithful and diligent Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it</hi> that can be possibly.</p>
               <p>As for the other <hi>Instance of Desertion;</hi> When any Person accused stands mute at the Bar, which is said to be <hi>allowed by our Church and State,</hi> and therefore brought to prove the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of Destroying one's self: First, this is <hi>truly</hi> deserting of a Man's self; so <hi>far he is in the Right,</hi> because 'tis the refusing the means of avoiding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, or of obtaining Mercy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and running voluntarily into a <hi>more painful</hi> Death, than any which he can fear. But then secondly to say, That <hi>this is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Church and State</hi> is very strange; because the Person who is thus obstinate, is condemned to suffer the greatest Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>for this very Crime of being so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis the excellency of the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> above those of other Nations, that as they have the greatest <hi>tenderness</hi> in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62293:33"/>
case of <hi>Life,</hi> so they have the greatest <hi>care</hi> in the case of <hi>Propriety.</hi> Now whereas some Men <hi>may not</hi> value their own Lives <hi>so much</hi> as their <hi>Childrens welfare;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>publick Good</hi> is above all <hi>private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations:</hi> It has been thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>it by our prudent Ancestors, to deter such Persons from great Crimes, not only by the <hi>forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Lives,</hi> but also by the <hi>forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Estates:</hi> But then again to shew the regard which they had to Propriety, these could not be forfeited without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and Conviction could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pleading, wherefore to <hi>make them plead</hi> a more dreadsul Death (<note n="*" place="bottom">Peine forte &amp; Diere.</note> as the Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, if duly put in Execution) than any which the Law requires if they should be found guilty upon Pleading, is threatned for their Obstinacy; so that the Law does not leave it to a Mans choice; thus, If you will stand Mute, and will be prest to Death, you shall save your Estate; the Estate is not under any Consideration as to the intent of the Law in this Case, but the <hi>obstinacy of refusing to Plead,</hi> which being punished so dreadfully, nothing can be greater detraction, than to say, That the <hi>deserting of ones self in this manner,</hi> is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62293:34"/>
not only <hi>allowed</hi> but <hi>justified</hi> in this Nation. These general and mixt Objections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Man partly as in the state of Nature, and partly as a Member of Civil Society, not knowing how to rank under any particular Head, I thought it most convenient to bring in here, and perhaps they may not be altogether unserviceable to the illustrating of that which is to <unclear>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</unclear>.</p>

1. That there can be no Injury com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, unless against Propriety; and therefore if the State has no Propriety of Man's Life, it can be no Injury to it for a Man to destroy his Life.

               <p>Another Argument perhaps may be raised from the Celebrated Story of the two generous Friends <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> to this purpose. <hi>No Man can lawfully give the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his own Life for another Mans appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at a certain Day, unless he has a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his Life.

                  <hi>Cato</hi> went out of Life as one that was glad of the opportunity, for the God who rules within us forbids our departure hence without his Command; but when that God himself gives just Cause, as he did to <hi>Socrates, Cato</hi> and many others.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That though it be true that God has the Absolute Propriety of Humane Life, in which Regard indeed Man cannot lawfully destroy it: Yet if God dispences with this Right of Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and calls or summons him out of Life, he may depart lawfully (<hi>viz.</hi> by Self-Murther)</p>

               <p>This is that which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> scatter up and down their Writings to reconcile this Act with <hi>Submission to Providence,</hi> which they diligently maintain, and which is Collected and Improv'd by our Author in the several Places above mentioned. Before I Answer this particularly, I desire the Reader wou'd take Notice,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatever is said in any of these Places concerning the <hi>removing the Reasons,</hi> or <hi>the ceasing of that End</hi> for which Life was given, shall be debated more particularly in the next Chapter, and but just touched upon here, as not being wholly to be avoided.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to what is insinuated here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God's Glory,</hi> though this does not fall under the present Argument, yet that this is always best promoted by <hi>observing of his Laws;</hi> that there can be no <hi>Case</hi> imagined, nor is there any pretended, but only glanc'd at by this Author artificially in general terms: Wherein a Man can be <hi>irresistably forc'd to forsake his Reason and his Virtue,</hi> and so detract from God's Glory: Or where in it will <hi>not be more for his</hi> Glory to suffer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62293:39"/>
Death <hi>from others,</hi> than <hi>from himself.</hi> But of this more perhaps hereafter.</p>
               <p>This being premised I shall in Answer to what is said above shew these three things:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> That according to the Account which this Learned Gentleman gives of <hi>Dispensation,</hi> and according to the Nature of the Law of <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> there can be no need at any time of such <hi>Dispensation</hi> for this Law.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> That in a Case of this Nature wherein Propriety of the greatest Importance is concern'd: Where an Error can never be recover'd; and where it is confessed, that there is a Law to secure it; no Dispensation can be sufficient but what comes from the Proprietor, the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himself; and which must evidently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably appear that it did so, by some plain and positive Manifestation of his Will.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> That no such natural Manifestation of God's Will is or can be assign'd, whereby Man may be fully assured that he is dismissed, call'd or summon'd by God from Life.</p>
               <p>As to the first, it is observable that Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation is <hi>allowed to be Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> And yet affirmed that it may be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62293:40"/>
withal upon this account: † <hi>That a thing which is universally Profitable or Honest, may by reason of some particular Event, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Dishonest or Hurtful; and when it does so, the Reason (or End) which is the Soul and Form of the Law ceases.</hi> This can never have place in any Law of Nature, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Self-preservation</hi> grounded upon God's Propriety, and the End of Humane Life already mention'd; because as there can be no time wherein it can be <hi>dishonest</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> (if we mean <hi>morally</hi> so) to avoid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong to God, to the Publick, and to our selves; so there can be no time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it can be destructive or hurtful (in the sence asoresaid) <hi>to follow Reason by Virtue;</hi> there can be no Event, I say, wherein it will not be a Man's Duty, and wherein it will not be in his Power to act thus, and therefore it can never be <hi>necessary</hi> that <hi>this Law</hi> should be <hi>dispensed</hi> withal.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Word Law is <hi>too general</hi> as us'd here; the Law which we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of is Law of Nature, and confest to be so; there may be Dispensations from Obedience to Humane Laws, which are limitted to particular Actions, and which through the weakness of Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cannot be fitted exactly to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; but then <hi>'tis observable,</hi> that all such
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62293:40"/>
Dispensations are <hi>supplemental</hi> rather than <hi>destructive</hi> to that Law concern'd, tending more effectually to the same end which that Law did, <hi>assisting</hi> and <hi>promoting</hi> it in a better manner, which end is always the <hi>Preservation</hi> of Mankind, of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Person, as far as is consistent with the whole, and <hi>not the Destruction</hi> of any one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be said,</hi> That the very End of Life which I have assign'd is inconsistent often with this Law of Self-preservation, and destructive of God's Propriety, it frequently happening that Men endanger their Lives, nay certainly incur Death, the more strictly and faithfully that they <hi>follow Reason by Virtue,</hi> and therefore that there must be some sort of Dispensation as to the observing of this End.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To this I Answer, There is no nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ty of this. That which I suppose to be the <hi>end of</hi> Humane Life is so excellently <hi>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed</hi> to the Nature of Man, that it not only promotes <hi>his happiness, his well-being,</hi> but certainly contributes to the <hi>prolong at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>on of his Being</hi> at the same time; <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue,</hi> including the regulating of Mens Passions and Appetites, making 'em <hi>Temperate</hi> and <hi>Peaceful, Just</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>cent,</hi> &amp;c. All which, if <hi>Duly observed,</hi> by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62293:41"/>
any number of Men, wou'd certainly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Life,</hi> as well as <hi>Happiness:</hi> Wherefore if Life becomes in danger upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and good Men suffer Death for the sake of their <hi>Virtue;</hi> this is <hi>accidental,</hi> not through any <hi>natural defect in that end of Life,</hi> or because it <hi>contradicts Self-preservation,</hi> and is <hi>destructive to God's right</hi> over it; but through the fault of <hi>unreasonable Men,</hi> who will not act by the <hi>same Rule,</hi> but make the <hi>indulging</hi> of their Appetites and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>to be the only end of their Lives;</hi> and therefore have no sense of Justice or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Men suffer Death upon the account of <hi>Virtue,</hi> this does not prove any Dispensation <hi>needful</hi> as to Self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as though they brought their own Deaths upon themselves; they <hi>wou'd live</hi> if they <hi>might be permitted;</hi> but they <hi>wou'd not forfeit their Reason and their Virtue to preserve Life,</hi> because these were the things for whose sake alone Life was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd; and the observing of which is the <hi>most proper way which God design'd by Nature to preserve Life by,</hi> and if it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd accordingly, 'tis through the Crimes of such as invade it, not any of their own.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62293:41"/>
But supposing that a Dispensation might be reasonable in some particular Case; yet,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> When Propriety of the greatest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is concern'd; where the Law that secures it is confess'd and acknowledg'd; where a mistake may be easily committed, and yet can never be recover'd; no Dispensation can be sufficient but such as comes from the Proprietor, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver himself; and which evidently appears by some plain and positive Manifestation of his Will to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propriety</hi> is of so nice and tender a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when it is to be made over, all the care imaginable is us'd, that the doing so may appear plainly and undeniably to be Voluntary; therefore not only several outward Actions, but also several Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of those Actions are requir'd upon such Occasions.

what can make Man more <hi>Happy,</hi> or more <hi>Glorious?</hi> What can exalt him higher above the rest of the Creation, or nearer to the Divine Nature, than the continual disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Eternal Truth,</hi> and the <hi>regulating</hi> of his Passions and Desires accordingly, than the <hi>improving</hi> of others by <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Information,</hi> and being the <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> of a great part of Mankind.

                  <hi>III. That</hi> no Natural Event is such a Manifestation of God's Will, whereby any Man can be assur'd that he is called, dismissed or summon'd from Life; or that God has chosen him himself for his Commissioner or Officer to destroy it.</p>
               <p>There is no Event indeed, but <hi>is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of God's Will.</hi> The worst Events are so, as much as the best; but to what <hi>end are they so?</hi> that we should <hi>bear them</hi> with Patience and Humility, is not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by lawful means, not that we should <hi>decline them, refuse 'em,</hi> or <hi>run away from them,</hi> by <hi>any means though never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since the Manifestation of God's Will against a known Law of Nature must <hi>be clear and distinct,</hi> as has been shown; how can it be demonstrated to be so from any of the Events above mention'd? the great difficulty, or rather the impossibility of this will appear if we consider the following Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That many Thousand Persons have suffer'd under the same Events, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to such a degree, as to be very <hi>willing,</hi> very <hi>desirous to die;</hi> and yet <hi>som</hi> of these have <hi>ever thought,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> of them have been <hi>ever fully satisfy'd</hi> that these were any

               <p>Self-preservation which we confess to be the foundation of general natural Law, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than a natural Affection and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Good, whether true or seeming.—Now since this Law of Self-preservation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd in attaining that which conduces to our Ends, and is (<hi>i. e.</hi> seems) good to us.—If I propose to my self in this <hi>Self-homicide,</hi> a greater Good, though Imistake it; I perceive not wherein I transgress the general Law of Nature, which is an Affection of Good, True or Seeming; and if that which I affect by Death be truly a greater Good, wherein is the other stricter Law of Nature, which is recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Reason, violated?</p>
               <p>I will <hi>first</hi> give a <hi>short</hi> Answer to every one of these Propositions in the <hi>terms here made of use;</hi> and in the same order that they lie; afterwards I will represent the strength of the Argument accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the best of my Judgment in <hi>other terms;</hi> such as seem to me more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> such as I have met withal in other <hi>Authors</hi> or <hi>Discourse;</hi> and then endeavour no answer it <hi>more fully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Reason upon which the Law of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62293:46"/>
Self-preservation is founded, <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap 4. p. 30.</note> has been shown to be twofold; 1. The preserving of <hi>God's Propriety</hi> of every Man's Life, and that 2. with regard to <hi>the End for</hi> which Life was given. This Reason is so <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> that <hi>no Circumstances whatever,</hi> unless <hi>a plain and undeniable Manifestation of God's Will,</hi> can ever alter it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conscience, which is the <hi>last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of upright Reason,</hi> as it considers <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions</hi> in the <hi>State of Nature,</hi> must be guided by what is allow'd to be the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which <hi>Self-preservation</hi> is allow'd to be; where there is <hi>no Law, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> may Act <hi>alone,</hi> but where there is 'tis bound to obey it; and its doing so proves <hi>Conscience</hi> to be <hi>well temper'd,</hi> and <hi>dispas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd;</hi> but it may justly be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis really so or no, when it <hi>looks out</hi> for a Reason for the ceasing of a <hi>confest Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover 'tis <hi>impossible</hi> that an <hi>upright Conscience,</hi> which acknowleges that the Reason of this Law is, the <hi>preserving of God's Propriety</hi> of humane Life, to the <hi>end</hi> above mention'd, can ever assure any Man that <hi>such an end</hi> is really ceased; as has been shown at large in the last Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62293:47"/>
Wherefore this <hi>Learned Gentleman,</hi> being sensible of this: Proposes <hi>another end of this Law,</hi> such as is very <hi>convenient</hi> indeed for <hi>his purpose,</hi> and may cease whenever any Man thinks sitting; and this is <hi>Good, True,</hi> or <hi>Seeming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If Self-preservation be an Appetition of Good, True or Seeming;</hi> this must be at least of <hi>such a sort of good as is or seems proper to preserve Life.</hi> If we consider <hi>Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> alone, without the <hi>moral end</hi> of it, this cannot be accomplish'd by attaining that which conduces to any <hi>other end,</hi> or seems <hi>good</hi> to Man in any <hi>other respect,</hi> than as it wou'd <hi>preserve Life:</hi> Wherefore it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> for any <hi>honest</hi> Man of very ordinary Understanding to mistake to such a Degree, as to look upon <hi>Self-murther as such a good;</hi> because this implies a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wou'd make that to be the <hi>end</hi> of a Law which is the <hi>utter destruction</hi> of it; for this wou'd be to argue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>the Law of Self-preservation is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd in attaining that which seems good to us; Self-homicide</hi> (i. e. <hi>Self-destruction) may seem good to me, therefore</hi> the Law of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation <hi>may be accomplish'd by my Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destruction.</hi>

4. These two Words <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> are of <hi>too large and doubtful a Signification;</hi> that which <hi>conduces to our ends,</hi> and is <hi>good to us,</hi> does <hi>not always accomplish</hi> the Law of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation;</hi> that which conduces to the <hi>true end</hi> of Life, <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue,</hi> accomplishes indeed the <hi>Law of Self-preservation;</hi> because it not only <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> the Mind, but <hi>prolongs</hi> Life, and therefore is <hi>truly good</hi> to us. But there are many other <hi>Ends</hi> of humane Actions, as many as we have Passions and Appetites, which become not only <hi>unworthy</hi> of our <hi>Reason,</hi> but <hi>destructive</hi> of our <hi>Life;</hi> as well by the <hi>manner</hi> of our <hi>pursuing</hi> 'em, as the <hi>measure</hi> of our <hi>enjoying</hi> them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ever they <hi>seem,</hi> whatever <hi>Shape</hi> or <hi>Beauty</hi> our <hi>Passions give them,</hi> are so far from being <hi>Good,</hi> that they are <hi>directly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Evil;</hi> and being so, can <hi>never accomplish the Law of Self-preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things will appear more <hi>clear,</hi> if in the next place we suppose the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection above mention'd to be made in these or the like Words</p>
               <p>To follow Nature has been allow'd to be the best rule of humane Actions by the wisest Men of all Sects. <hi>1.</hi> To follow Nature, is to seek to be happy. <hi>2.</hi> My happiness consists in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which seems good to me, and avoiding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62293:48"/>
that seems evil. <hi>3.</hi> I and no other am to be the Judge in this Case; therefore if Life by the want of any Good, in which I place my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, becomes an Evil, and Death seems good to me, I do but follow Nature in killing my self, and the Law of Self-preservation is not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, but gives place or ceases naturally.—<hi>For the Answering of this Argument clearly, I will make use of this Method.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>following Nature?</hi> Though some Account of this Maxim has been <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 2.</note> already given, yet being very much in request at present, and the Mistakes concerning it the occasion of other Crimes as well as this of <hi>Self-murther,</hi> it commonly happening that they who talk loudest of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> understand
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62293:48"/>
'em least, or act against 'em most; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to say something farther of it; and if in so doing I should repeat any thing that I have said before, let the Reader think, either that I wou'd save him the trouble of turning back again, or knew not how to express my self better.</p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Nature</hi> is sometimes a very general Term, and signifies that Order which the great Creator put the <hi>whole</hi> World to move in; sometimes, in a more limitted sence, it signifies that Rule which he gave <hi>each</hi> Creature to follow, for the fulfilling of that <hi>particular End</hi> for which it was made, in proper Harmony and Consent with the Universe; so that the Word <hi>Nature</hi> rises in its signification ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several Degrees of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and by following Nature must be meant, the <hi>obeying it according to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Power which distinguishes one Creature from another.</hi> This Beasts do by Sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this Man shou'd do by Reason: That great, that God-like Faculty which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to discern Good and Evil, and to regulate our Passions and Appetites by Virtue accordingly. Wherefore for <hi>Man to follow Nature,</hi> is the very same, with the End of Life, to which Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62293:49"/>
is subservient, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Chap. 2. p. 16. 17.</note> as has been shown, namely <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue.</hi>

               <p>As Humane Life consists of two parts, the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> so <hi>what is good</hi> must be consider'd in a <hi>twofold</hi> manner, as it relates to the <hi>Soul</hi> or to the <hi>Body.</hi>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62293:53"/>
To bring this to the Matter in hand, supposing that Good, True or Seeming were a proper Rule and End of humane Actions: There are but two sorts of Good, as has been shown, <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> but through which of these is it, that Self-murther can appear Lawful.</p>
               <p>If Moral Good tends not only to the <hi>improvement of the Mind,</hi> but also to the <hi>prolonging of Life;</hi> if nothing is Sensitive Good but that alone which is reported by the Senses to be <hi>proper to preserve</hi> Life, then it must be <hi>absurd</hi> to <hi>destroy</hi> Life upon the pretence of <hi>either</hi> of these Goods, and to do so <hi>must be Evil,</hi> both as to <hi>Moral Evil,</hi> and <hi>Sensitive also;</hi> and <hi>therefore highly against Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this let me add, that the only reason why any thing is <hi>naturally Evil</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> is as it contributes to the <hi>separation of it</hi> from the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is done positively and violently by <hi>Self-murther.

               <p>As Man is oblig'd to follow that Nature which is <hi>common</hi> to him with the rest of <hi>Mankind,</hi> so he is oblig'd to follow that <hi>Reason</hi> which is so too: I mean as to the

               <p>Hence it is that <hi>seeming Good</hi> and <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil</hi> are made to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, and the following of them the <hi>End</hi> of humane Life; the measure of its being Good or Evil, and Preserv'd or Destroy'd accordingly: Whereas to act according to <hi>seeming Good</hi> or <hi>seeming Evil</hi> can never be allow'd but in the case of <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> or <hi>extream Necessity,</hi> or <hi>Panic Fear,</hi> when the Soul has not the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Leasure</hi> to bring its Actions or Resolutions to the Rule of right Reason, or to examine what is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Good, or really Evil; and then we ought to observe that this is allow'd but upon <hi>one Account</hi> neither, and that is <hi>the preserving of Life,</hi> and therefore is a very strange Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Destroying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62293:55"/>
But after all that can be said, <hi>seeming Good</hi> and <hi>seeming Evil</hi> are <hi>sloating</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain things,</hi> and therefore can <hi>never</hi> be the Rule or End of Living; because as they can be no <hi>certain</hi> measure themselves, so they must <hi>destroy</hi> it as to all other things; for to suppose this, is not only to let a Man loose to any Object that he pleases, but also to hinder his obtaining of any one, while a <hi>new seeming Good</hi> may be starting continually, and so a warm Head shall be sure never to want Game: And Life thus employ'd wou'd be given to a very extraordinary End indeed; especially if we consider that the Event of this must prove not only <hi>fatal</hi> to a Man's self, but may do so by degrees to all that are near him; nay <hi>must</hi> do so to all <hi>Mankind.</hi> For if <hi>seeming Good</hi> is sufficient to justifie our Actions, what Crime can ever be justly laid to any Man's charge? As there is no <hi>Errour</hi> that pleases under the notion of <hi>Falshood,</hi> so there is no <hi>Wickedness</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon the Mind as it appears <hi>Evil;</hi> but as there is <hi>seeming Truth</hi> in the one, so there must be <hi>seeming Goodness</hi> in the other: Accordingly, he that <hi>Robs, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishes, Murthers,</hi> may plead that he did so only because it <hi>seem'd good</hi> to him and that in so doing he did but <hi>follow Nature;</hi> but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62293:56"/>
if this be to <hi>follow Nature,</hi> if the <hi>ground of General Natural Law is nothing but the appetition of Good, True or Seeming,</hi> then how absurd are all Humane Laws, and how unnatural are all Courts of Justice? In a Word, to give a Man up to act by <hi>seeming Good</hi> and <hi>seeming Evil,</hi> is to let him loose to his own <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> to grant him <hi>Wildness</hi> instead of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and to make <unclear>Life</unclear> depend upon this, is to tell him he may destroy <hi>himself whenever he thinks <unclear>fitting.</unclear>

               <p>HItherto I have endeavour'd to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer those Objections, which might seem to oppose what I had said to prove Self-murther <hi>Vnlawful;</hi> as Man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd in the <hi>State of Nature:</hi> I come now to examine some others which are brought against what has been said to confirm the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62293:56"/>
same, as he is a Member of <hi>Civil Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I must say something to that which was <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 5. p. 44.</note> above mention'd, as an Instance of deserting ones self Lawfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Biath. p. 46.</note> Self-preservation doth not so rigorously, and urgently, and illimitedly bind, but that by the Law of Nature it self, things may, yea must, neglect themselves for others, of which the <hi>Pelican</hi> is an Instance. <hi>Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance he gives of</hi> Bees <hi>too, from whence he infers,</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 47.</note> That as this natural Instinct in Beasts, so rectisied Reason belonging only to us, instructs us often to prefer publick and necessary Persons, by exposing our selves to inevitable Destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 128.</note> We may Lawfully dispossess our selves of that, without which we can have no hopes to sustain our Lives; as in a Shipwreck a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man may give his Plank to a Magistrate, <hi>and the Examples of</hi> Codrus, Curtius <hi>and the</hi> Decij, <hi>and the Approbation of the</hi> greatest <hi>and the</hi> wisest <hi>Nations, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which they paid to their Memory, are usually brought in upon this occasiou; this is to prove that the</hi> Law of Self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>may be</hi> dispenc'd <hi>withal in regard of</hi> serving the Publick; <hi>and therefore that it</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62293:57"/>
may be so as reasonably in any Man's private Concern, even to the degree of Killing himself: Or thus, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (as to <hi>Self-preservation</hi>) between a Man's Killing himself upon account of the <hi>Publick,</hi> or his <hi>own account;</hi> now he that dispossesses himself upon the publick Account, to save a publick Person: Of that, without which he can have no hopes of saving his own Life, Kills himself.</p>
               <p>To this may be Answer'd, 1. That the use of <hi>Instinct</hi> in Beasts is to <hi>Preserve</hi> them. It was given them to this <hi>End alone,</hi> instead of <hi>Reason;</hi> therefore it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to affirm, that any Beast, Bird, or Insect <hi>destroys</hi> it self by Instinct, and the Instances here brought to prove this are <hi>Fabulous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the more Reason is <hi>rectify'd</hi> in Man, the more he will understand to what <hi>End</hi> he receiv'd Life, and how little Authority he has to dispose of it; and therefore the more carefully will he <hi>obey</hi> the Law of Self-preservation, and this particularly upon the Consideration of what <hi>he owes the Publick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Law of <hi>Self-preservation</hi> may not be <hi>wilfully</hi> broken, even upon the Account of the <hi>Publick.</hi> No Man has <hi>naturally</hi> any Authority to <hi>destroy himself</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62293:57"/>
for his Country, <hi>designedly</hi> and <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ively;</hi> but to <hi>hazard his Life</hi> only.</p>
               <p>As to the Instances of <hi>Codrus, Curtius,</hi> and the <hi>Decij,</hi> what they did was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Religious or Superstitious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; which they obey'd as <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and therefore cannot be us'd to prove what is <hi>Naturally Lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Instance of giving <hi>a Magiftrate a Plank in a Shipwreck,</hi> implies only great <hi>hazard</hi> of Life, not <hi>positive Destruction</hi> of it; because there is a <hi>possibility</hi> of escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left; and because the <hi>intention is not to die,</hi> to <hi>abandon all</hi> care of ones self, but to take care of another <hi>first:</hi> To make this more plain I will show,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What <hi>Authority</hi> the Publick Power, where-ever 'tis plac'd, has to require any Person to <hi>hazard his Life,</hi> and what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Person has to hazard it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The difference between <hi>extreme Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi> and <hi>Self-murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What Authority, &amp;c. In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration I shall have no regard to any one particular State, but only enquire into the End of Government or Civil Society in General, and this with all Submission
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62293:58"/>
imaginable. The end of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, I suppose, the promoting the <hi>same</hi> things for many Men <hi>together,</hi> upon which their true <hi>Happiness</hi> depended, as consider'd <hi>singly</hi> in the State of Nature: this is usually call'd the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> that is, each Man's Private Good as he is Man, consider'd collectively, and with regard to the <hi>General Welfare. Private Good</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>twofold,</hi> as hath been shown, <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Sensitive;</hi> the object of humane Laws must be <hi>twofold</hi> also, <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> and the promoting and securing these in Peace from all Enemies, either from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or within any Political Body seems to be the <hi>true natural end of Civil Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as there is <hi>Publick Good</hi> to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, so in order to this, there must be <hi>Publick Power</hi> over every particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, lodg'd in one or more Persons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Form of the Government is; and lest this Power should be either Dangerous or to no Purpose, there must be also <hi>Publick Judgment,</hi> the Result of the Debates of Wise and Upright Men, to limit it and direct it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas every particular State must be consider'd as one Political Person; in which respect the being of any State is to be look'd upon as the Publick
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62293:58"/>
Life, and the Well-being of the same State, the Publick Health: So it must be supposed that the Publick Power must be such, as is proper and requisite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend these, and consequently that it must extend to <hi>Particular Life,</hi> whenever the <hi>Publick Life</hi> is any ways in danger.</p>
               <p>Now this may be endanger'd <hi>two</hi> ways, either <hi>1st.</hi> By Enemies <hi>within</hi> the State, Corrupt and Vicious Men, who obstruct and break the Laws, and insect others; in which Case the Publick Power extends to the <hi>actual</hi> Destruction of such particular Mens Lives, as being necessary for the Preservation of all the rest. Or <hi>2dly.</hi> It may be endanger'd from <hi>outward Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> other Governments that would En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave or Destroy it: In which Case the Publick Power extends to the obliging such as it thinks fitting to <hi>hazard</hi> their Lives, when 'tis necessary for the Publick Preservation: To <hi>hazard,</hi> I say, not <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively destroy</hi> themselves, (as when a blow is made at a Man's Head, he may lift up his Arm to defend it, <hi>venture</hi> the breaking of it, not positively break it, which he has no right to do) and necessary it may be suppos'd, sufficiently to <hi>warrant</hi> any Man's Obedience, when the <hi>Publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> declares that it is so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62293:59"/>
But the chief Question is, from <hi>whence</hi> this Power is deriv'd to the Publick, by <hi>whom</hi> it was granted.</p>
               <p>Some suppose it to be granted by <hi>Man</hi> himself, upon a kind of compact for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but though <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tion</hi> may be one great End of this Power; yet it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed, that this Power cannot be conserr'd on the Publick by every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man; because God alone has the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Propriety of humane Life: Man has no such Power himself, and what he has not, he cannot make over to another. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will have it to come <hi>from Man,</hi> but then to decline this Objection, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his darling Principle of <hi>Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he says, This is not done by Man's <hi>transfer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>The Subjects did not give their Sovereign that Right; but only in laying down theirs, strengthned him to use his own as he should think fit for the Preservation of them all;</hi> so that it was not <hi>given</hi> but <hi>left</hi> to him: If I take this right, this is a very odd distinction; for if a Man has any <hi>right</hi> to <hi>hurt</hi> others for his own Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62293:59"/>
then as he is bound to <hi>Preserve</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so he is bound to <hi>retain that Right;</hi> and yet if he <hi>lays</hi> it down, he <hi>parts</hi> with it as much as if he <hi>actually gave it away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told us just before, <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 161.</note> 
                  <hi>That in the making of a Common-wealth every Man gives away the Right of defending another, but not of defending himself.</hi> In several Places <note n="†" place="bottom">Leviath. part 1. chap. 14.</note> he repeats and inculcates this, that no Man can <hi>ever</hi> part with the right of defending himself; no, not <hi>after Lawful Tryal</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:</hi> If this be so, How can he lay down the right which he has to hurt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, since by so doing he must be left in a great measure defenceless, and liable, by <hi>his own</hi> Consent, not only to be <hi>hurt,</hi> but to be actually <hi>destroy'd,</hi> as in all Capital Punishments.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, not withstanding Men chuse to struggle thus, rather than have any thing to do with <hi>God,</hi> while they frame their Political Systems: Yet it seems plain that such a Power as we are speaking of can be deriv'd from no other but <hi>God,</hi> who alone having the absolute <hi>Propriety</hi> of all humane Life, can alone have the right to give some Men Power over the Lives of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62293:60"/>
others; and who having fram'd Man in such a manner, that Civil Society is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for his Security and Improvement, and yet such Society not to be preserv'd without such a Power, must upon these Considerations, and also as he is a wife and just Being; and as he who wills the End must will the Means necessary to that End; must, I say, be supposed to grant to the Magistrate such a Power; a Power to hazard Life himself, and to oblige others to do so, in defence of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>From what has been said may appear, that the Power or Authority which any Government has to require Men to <hi>hazard their Lives</hi> for the Publick Good is derived from God himself, that the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing this depends upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgment; and that Man is thus warranted for hazarding his Life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>To return then to the Instance above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, of <hi>a Man's giving a Magistrate his Plank in a Shipwreck:</hi> If a Man may <hi>hazard</hi> his Life for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> then if there be some particular Person, in whom the Publick <hi>Power</hi> and Publick <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is lodg'd,</hi> from whom all the Springs of Action derive their Motion, who is in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62293:60"/>
effect the Life, the Soul of the whole Body, and in whom the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty (as we love to speak) of many Millions centers and may be lost; and among the rest <hi>his Life also,</hi> who shall be <hi>concern'd</hi> for this <hi>Publick Persons</hi> safety; then we may conclude, that any Man <hi>may hazard</hi> his Life even to the utmost danger to <hi>preserve such a Person;</hi> yet in these Cases we are to remember Life is <hi>only hazarded</hi> not <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,</hi> much less <hi>positively destroy'd;</hi> and that for such <hi>extreme hazard</hi> Men may justly suppose that they have <hi>Authority</hi> from God himself, as they are Members of any Civil Government.</p>
               <p>And though the danger be great, yet 'tis very seldom that Men fall into certain Death upon these Accounts, as might be shown easily.</p>
               <p>But suppose it should be so, yet in this Case an honest good Man does not mind any thing but <hi>to do his Duty,</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>faithfully</hi> the <hi>End</hi> for which Life was given; and if Life should be lost in this pursuit, this is <hi>not his desire, nor his fault;</hi> 'twas <hi>not his aim to die,</hi> but to do as he <hi>ought;</hi> nay gladly wou'd he have lived had Life been <hi>consistent</hi> with his Virtue; but when <hi>this</hi> came in Question, both <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> became <hi>indifferent,</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>The next Objection is to this purpose, That</hi> if Self-murther is unjust in regard of the Publick, 'tis because it loses a Member; <note n="†" place="bottom">Biath. p. 111.</note> but this may as well be said of all those who retiring themselves from Functions in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, defraud the State of their Assistance, and attend only their own Ends. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ib. p. 113.</note> If the Person be of necessary use to the State, there are in it some degrees of Injustice, but yet no more than if a General of much use shou'd retire into a Monastery. <hi>To this may be Answer'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>one</hi> of the Reasons why Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther is <hi>unjust</hi> to the Publick, but not the only one; is its losing a Member.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Instance here given <hi>does not come up to the point;</hi> for a General <hi>may not</hi> lay down his Commission without <hi>leave,</hi> when he is <hi>necessary</hi> for his Countries Service; but he may <hi>justly</hi> be punish'd if he refuses to Act. Yet suppose a Man may retire from Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs to attend <hi>his own Ends;</hi> Is this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62293:62"/>
as much damage to the Publick as Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther? He that attends his own Ends, (if by this be meant his particular Interest as to his Family) contributes to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and may do so very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, though never so much retir'd: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the causes of his Retirement may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then he may serve the Publick again upon Necessity; or shou'd he not, he may serve and assist his particular Friends and Relations, improve his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and his <hi>Fortune,</hi> be an Example of Virtue, and in many other respects observe the end for which Life was given; and this sure cannot be the same with the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Man's self into an <hi>unalterable incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of doing any good at all, by the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and positive destruction of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this it may perhaps be reply'd,</hi> That here Strength and Vigour is requir'd, Health of Body and Activity of Mind; but suppose a Man by <note n="*" place="bottom">As the Stoicks. See Chap. 10.</note> extreame Age or Infirmity, by loss some Sense or some Limb, shou'd be made incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of serving the Publick, had not he as good be gone as stay to no purpose, may not he leave the World if he pleases when he is become good for nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62293:63"/>
This Supposition seems to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a very <hi>gross</hi> sence of <hi>serving the Publick;</hi> as if States-men were to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the breadth of their Shoulders, and strong and sizeable Men were as necessary for the Council Table as the Guard Room; for if Men <hi>be past</hi> Reason the Dispute is at an end, but <hi>if they are capable of using it,</hi> why should old Age be objected, unless Maturity and Experience shou'd be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages? When Reason is <hi>lost,</hi> no Man can be accountable for Self-murther, or any <hi>other Action,</hi> yet even then we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Life carefully in <hi>Ideots</hi> and <hi>Madmen</hi> at the Publick Expence; either in hopes of their recovery, or to learn to value Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as we ought, or to praise the giver of it, so that there is scarce any Wretch but may be some way or other beneficial to the Publick, even by <hi>his being alive alone;</hi> how much more may he be so when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son remains, and that too so highly valued and well understood, that Men will choose sooner to part with Life than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main depriv'd of the glorious advantage of it? Or if this shou'd not be allow'd, what Rule can be given? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Age or Insirmity can be fix'd, when Men shall be judg'd to <hi>be good for nothing,</hi> and permitted to <hi>Murther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>

                  <hi>accordingly?</hi> Such a thing (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) might prevent it indeed, since Men wou'd be apt to live in despite of all their Miseries, rather than buy the privilege of Self-murther at so dear a rate, as to be judg'd by others, and be oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themselves, that they are good for nothing.</p>
               <p>But while Reason remains, as I said before, this is impossible, and many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may be given of Persons who have done their Country the most considerable Service under all these Calamities above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, nay at the very time of Death it self.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Yet after all; supposing that it should be lawful to chuse the <hi>Civil Punishment,</hi> for the committing that which is <hi>Naturally E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> How shall this <hi>reach the Offender,</hi> as to Self-murther?

If in excuse for this it shou'd be said, That such People may be suppos'd to satisfie themselves with hopes of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

being escapt by their Heirs, either through Friendship, Compassion, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. If, I say, this shou'd be alledg'd, then certainly it is very well worthy of Consideration, whether the putting of those Laws <hi>duly and constantly in Execution,</hi> which are provided in this Case, wou'd not be of very <hi>great force</hi> to put a stop to this Evil? The Consideration of <hi>shame</hi> alone <note n="†" place="bottom">Biath. p. 96.</note> did this heretofore in the Case of the <hi>Milesians,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tarquinius Priscus:</hi> Our Laws then may do this more effectually; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing but the same Burial which <hi>other</hi> Felons have, and requiring the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of the <hi>Personal Estate,</hi> have not only the Natural tye of <hi>shame,</hi> but a much stronger, that of <hi>tenderness</hi> to their <hi>Posterity,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain such Rash and Melancholy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by.</p>

What is meant by being <hi>non Compos;</hi> the Law informs them, that it is the <hi>deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reason or Vnderstanding:</hi> Such a state of the Mind wherein there is a Cessation from Exercising the Discursive Faculty.

Upon the Verdict of <hi>non Compos</hi> the Goods and Chartels of the Deceas'd are to be enquir'd after, valu'd immediately, as if they were to be sold and deliver'd to the Kings use; and the Body refus'd Christian Burial. The reason of which Punishment is said to be, <note n="*" place="bottom">Plowden. 261. 6.</note> because Self-murther is an Offence <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature,</hi> it being the Property of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to preserve it self; <hi>against God,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62293:69"/>
for that it offends his Commandment; <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King,</hi> for that he loses a Subject, and an ill Example is given to the rest. All which have been explam'd and enforc'd in the former part of this Treatise.</p>
               <p>We may see here the Authority, by which the <hi>Coron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come to shew the unreasonableness of those Prejudices and Pretences by which Men are usually sway'd in this Matter; and in so doing I shall not look upon my self (being to talk with another sort of People now) to be consin'd to Natural Principles only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is a General Supposition that <hi>every one</hi> who kills himself is <hi>non Compos,</hi> and that no body wou'd do such an Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62293:69"/>
he were Distracted; this will be found unreasonable if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if this were really so, then it wou'd be to no purpose for the Law to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>any enquiry</hi> to be made in such Cases: If a Man may not be suppos'd to be in his Wits when he lays violent Hands upon himself, to what intent is the Summoning in of so many Men, the giving them a Solemn Oath, examining Witnesses, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Council; all this supposes the Case doubtful; but according to that Opinion all this is vain and impertinent, because they have nothing left to judge of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this were so, then our Laws are not only Impertinent but <hi>Vnjust,</hi> by affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Punishment to such an Act, as the Person that commits it cannot help: He that is Distracted knows not what he does, and therefore is not Accountable for this or any other Deed; since then the Laws of this Nation, and of many others of great Reputation for Wisdom and Justice (as shall be shewn immediately) have ordain'd a Punishment for this Action, it is plain that they thought it might <hi>possibly</hi> be committed <hi>Wilfully,</hi> and <hi>Advisedly;</hi> and if so, 'tis Confidence and Presumption for any private Person to suppose the contrary.</p>

As to the <hi>

                     </gap>th.</hi> sort of Madness above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, the Law does not look upon this as an Excuse for any Crime committed in that Condition; because it was the Parties own voluntary Act to bring himself into it. However this may be of Use to judge of other kinds of Madness by: Which People may be suppos'd to be affected withal in this Case; it very seldom appears that they who destroy themselves have had the same or as great signs of Distraction, as are frequently caus'd by excessive Drinking, or supposing they may have had so, yet let the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror consider whether this may not be caus'd as much through the Parties own fault as the other; whether he did not bring upon himself, or give way to the beginning of his Discontent; whether he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62293:70"/>
did not wilfully foment and increase it, and at last stubbornly persist in it. Let him also consider whether he wou'd have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused the <hi>same Person</hi> for killing <hi>another Man,</hi> upon those <hi>very signs</hi> of Madness which move him now to excuse him for killing himself: I believe this may be one <hi>good Rule</hi> for an <hi>honest Juror to walk by,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since the killing of ones self has been shewn above, to be rather worse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Publick, than the killing of another Man.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, how oft does it appear in these Cases, that the Person concern'd did give plain and certain Signs of a good Understanding (I mean Naturally, not Morally so) by some Circumstances of his Death or other: Some have enquir'd what was the easiest way of Dying, or where to place the Weapon best; others have us'd much cunning and contrivance to procure the Instrument, have kept it long by them, and warily chosen a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Time and Place to make use of it; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again have made their Wills, or settled their Affairs otherways; taken leave of their Friends solemnly, sent those out of the way that might have hinder'd them; these and such like Circumstances are Arguments of <hi>Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62293:71"/>
and prove sufficiently that such a Person was <hi>Compos Mentis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be <hi>Moral</hi> and not <hi>Natural</hi> Madness that is here meant, not only he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits any other great Crime, but he that subverts a Lawful Government, by a long train of well laid Designs, though he cannot be suspected of any Natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Understanding, yet is as much Mad in this sense as any one that kills himself can be suppos'd to be; and yet sure this wou'd not be allow'd as an Excuse for so doing. But this sort of Madness does not fall under the Coroners Inquest in the present Case: <hi>Moral</hi> Madness is the <hi>misapplication</hi> of the Understanding, not the <hi>total</hi> Deprivation of it, and the Question here is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Understanding was <hi>misapply'd,</hi> but whether there was any Understanding <hi>left at all:</hi> This brings me to some other kind of Pretences, which are caus'd chiefly,</p>
               <p n="2">2. By mistaking the <hi>Subject</hi> of their <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> and making themselves <hi>Judges</hi> of that which does <hi>not</hi> belong to them; their Duty consists in enquiring well and truly how the Person came by his Death, if by himself, whether he was <hi>felo de se,</hi> or <hi>non Compos,</hi> and in making true Presentment accordingly. This is what they are <hi>Sworn</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:62293:71"/>
to do; but instead of this they are apt to run out beyond their Bounds, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the Event of their Verdict will be, either as to the <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> or the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> Deceas'd.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mightily concern'd about this; What will <hi>become</hi> of it? Upon <hi>whom</hi> shall it be bestow'd? Upon <hi>such</hi> perhaps as do not want it, or among <hi>so many</hi> that it will do 'em little or no Good; whereas in the lump it might be of great advantage to the <hi>next Heirs:</hi> Why is not <hi>Charity</hi> due to them as much as meer <hi>Strangers,</hi> &amp;c. To this may be reply'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is thus forfeited devolves to the Lord <hi>Almoner,</hi> the distributer of <hi>His Majesties</hi> Alms, according to <hi>his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> and therefore they ought to be satisfy'd that it will be dispos'd of <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> and <hi>Faithfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Supposing the <hi>worst,</hi> what is this to the <hi>Coroner</hi> or any of his <hi>Jury;</hi> the Law has not made <hi>them</hi> Judges in this matter, or given <hi>them</hi> Authority to consider what will be most convenient and proper to be done with that which is Forfeited, or <hi>who</hi> are the best Objects of <hi>Charity:</hi> They are call'd to Judge of matter of <hi>Fact</hi> by what
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62293:72"/>
they see and hear. Let 'em remember their <hi>Oaths,</hi> they are not Sworn to be <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> but to be <hi>Just,</hi> to enquire <hi>well and truly,</hi> diligently and impartially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fact, and to give their Judgment according to their Conscience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Man ought to be upon his Guard against such Insinuations as these, and to take care lest his <hi>Charity</hi> shou'd absurdly corrupt his <hi>Justice; absurdly I say,</hi> for he that is Just, (in Criminal Causes especially,) is Charitable in the Noblest way; for whilst his Impartial Sentence deters others from committing the same Crime, his Charity extends not only to all the Innocent and Virtuous of the Present Age, but to late Posterity.</p>
               <p>Again some run out beyond their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and fall into Mistakes, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Event</hi> of their <hi>Judgment</hi> as to the Parties <hi>Reputation,</hi> and their being Guilty of <hi>Vncharitableness</hi> in this regard; they think that to bring him in <hi>Felo de se,</hi> wou'd be to pronounce him <hi>damn'd,</hi> therefore that they ought to Judge <hi>Charitably,</hi> especially, since they cou'd not see into his Heart, or discover his last thoughts.</p>
               <p>This wou'd not need an Answer, but that Ignorant, though well meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are often concern'd upon these Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62293:72"/>
and apt to receive such Scruples from Cunning Solicitors, that are always busie about them, if the Chattels are worth the saving: Therefore something must be said to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the Jurors bringing in the Deceas'd <hi>Felo de se,</hi> does not pronounce him damn'd at all, this he leaves to God alone; whatever <hi>his Judgment</hi> of the Fact is, it can be neither the better nor the worse for him in the next World; his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Verdict does not <hi>alter</hi> the Nature of the Fact: If he thinks him Guilty, yet he does not contribute to his being so, and what he thinks; he is oblig'd to declare by Lawful Authority; and if he does not so, is Guilty himself of Breach of Trust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Country, and of Perjury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the seeing into his Thoughts, the difficulty of doing so, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charitably upon this Account: This seems very little to the purpose: In <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Actions, or such as will bear a <hi>double</hi> Interpretation; we ought to beware how we Judge to the disadvantage of our Neighbour, especially when <hi>not call'd</hi> by Lawful Authority; but where a Man <hi>is so call'd;</hi> where there is a Notorious Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Law, as in the present Case,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62293:73"/>
the Fact is so evidently Evil, that there needs no weighing of the thoughts, or searching of what kind they were; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since, when a Person is found to have kill'd himself, the Question is not <hi>what</hi> his Thoughts were, but whether he had <hi>any Thought</hi> at all, that is whether he was <hi>Mad</hi> or no?</p>
               <p>Yet after all, though I have hitherto apply'd my self to the Jury, 'tis certain that their Verdict depends much upon the Coroner, and 'tis <hi>his</hi> fault chiefly if the Laws which provide against Self-murther, are cluded; 'tis he that <hi>Summons</hi> whom he <hi>pleases</hi> to be of the Jury, and to these he gives <hi>what Charge he pleases;</hi> the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Witnesses, the Summing up the Evidence is done <hi>by him:</hi> So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there happen to be upon the Jury Men of Conscience, Courage and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which may easily be avoided if the Coroner thinks sitting) they will be apt to be led by him implicitly. And there being no Fee allow'd upon <hi>Felo de se,</hi> the Verdicts being for the King; and a Gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity seldom wanting when it is for the Heirs; 'tis no wonder that the Return is generally <hi>Non Compos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if these Papers shou'd ever fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of any of these Gentlemen;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62293:73"/>
I intreat 'em to Consider <hi>seriously</hi> the <hi>trust</hi> that is repos'd in them, they being Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Freeholders of their several Counties, as Parliament Men are; and what the Consequence will be (even to after Ages) of the breach of such Trust: And to themselves especially, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing of another World: For to omit the Suspicions of Corruption which I am very loath to improve; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Motive</hi> is, through which the Design of any Law is Eluded; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence will be much the <hi>same:</hi> If a Law be made to restrain a dreadsul Sin, which is withal very pernicious to the State, and such or such a Punishment is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this End; if this Law becomes of <hi>no force</hi> by that very Persons <hi>Preventing</hi> the Punishment, who is <hi>intru<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

need it: Or if they did never somuch, how preposterous must that Charity be, which to assist a sew, as to Temporal Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, shall contribute to the Damnation of <hi>many Souls,</hi> and make a Man venture through <hi>Treachery</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> to hazard his <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If these Considerations, and others of the like kind, should not prevail with these Persons so much as immediate Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: The Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, for the time being, is, as I am told, the chief <hi>Coroner of England,</hi> enquiries into Failures of this kind, may be made in that Court, and this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ought to terrifie every one who shall be thus concern'd, especially at this time, since that <hi>Important Trust</hi> was <hi>never</hi> discharg'd with more profound <hi>Knowledge</hi> of our Laws, and with greater <hi>Integrity</hi> than at <hi>Present.</hi>

               <p>To summ up what has been said upon this Head, if Self-murther was not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> during the first six hundred Years; if this was the time wherein they were at the height of their Virtue; if not one of those, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the most Judicious <hi>Virgil,</hi> were the greatest Glory to their Country, did ever kill himself; if both he and <hi>Cicero</hi> were against it in their own Judgments; if there were several Laws by which it was severely Punish'd among them; then the Example of this great Nation is rather against Self-murther than for it: This perhaps may be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by that which is to follow.</p>

               <p>AFter several of the Wits of <hi>Greece</hi> had spent their time in useless Gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and vain Disquisitions, concerning such things, as whether false or true, cou'd serve very little to the insluencing of Mens Actions: <hi>Socrates</hi> the most discerning and the least corrupted Soul that ever saw by the Light of Nature, shew'd 'em a more prositable and more noble use of <hi>humane Reason,</hi> made it to look first into it <hi>self,</hi> and to <hi>regulate</hi> those Passions and Appetites, that were grown so great an <hi>Injury,</hi> and so just a <hi>Scandal</hi> to it: This was a very tender
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62293:88"/>
Point, and yet this wonderful Man, by the sweetness of his Temper, by his Easiness and Affability, by his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that he <hi>knew nothing;</hi> prevail'd upon a great many to hearken to him; and by <hi>his Death,</hi> which was more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more Exemplary, if possible, than <hi>his Life,</hi> won over many Thousands more.</p>
               <p>What he thus successfully began bad other Advantages from those two great Men <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who had been his Scholars, and who recommended their Masters Principles to the World with all the happy Advantages of Eloquence, in such a clear Method and prevailing Stile as represented naturally the Calmness of his Mind, and the Sweetness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: This made his Followers mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and grow Famous by the Names of <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> whose Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents differ'd very little, under two great Leaders <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi>

               <p>But of those who heard <hi>Socrates</hi> with Admiration, one of the chief was <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes,</hi>

and Freedom from all Passion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; this hit so very much with his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and crabbed Temper, that without <hi>vegarding</hi> what <hi>Socrates</hi> Discours'd of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Affability,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Example</hi> of whatever cou'd be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in <hi>those Virtues;</hi> he fasten'd upon the former alone, in a short time set up for himself, and became the Founder of the <hi>Cynics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctrine both of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> lost ground immediately after their Decease; they who succeeded <hi>Plato</hi> in the Academy, besides their want of his great Abilities, his Elevation, Sagacity and Politeness, came short of him in his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, being guilty of Covetousness and great Enormities. <hi>Aristotle</hi> who died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twenty four Years after him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd his Friend <hi>Theophrastus</hi> to conceal his Books, which was done carefully for many Years; during which time his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> taught only by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which made his Opinions liable to be Adulterated, and such as were Genuine to lose very much of their Spirit and Vigour: While the <hi>Academy</hi> and <hi>Lycaeum</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these disadvantages, two very great Genius's appear'd much about the same time, <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Zeno;</hi> the first was for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62293:89"/>
advancing a new Principle of Morality, and indeed a very strange one, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood; which was <hi>Pleasure:</hi> And conformably to this he new dress'd up the Systeme of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and us'd the Gods <hi>worse</hi> by his manner of <hi>owning them,</hi> than <hi>Anaxagorus</hi> had done by <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding them entirely:</hi> In all Ages the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Systeme</hi> has been fitted to the <hi>Moral one,</hi> and where-ever you sind <hi>Libertinism</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd, under the popular pretence of asserting the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>humane Reason,</hi> there you will meet with <hi>a world ready made to the purpose,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Providence excluded,</hi> for fear of being injurious to the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>humane Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Zeno</hi> took a very different way, he had heard <hi>Crates</hi> many Years, yet cou'd not allow of the Brutality and Immodesty of the <hi>Cynics,</hi> and therefore went over to <hi>Xenocrates</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> the Successors of <hi>Plato,</hi> these he sollowed very much in his <hi>Principles,</hi> but still retain'd the severity of the others in his <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Plato</hi> he taught the being of one God, Supream over many others, and that the World was Govern'd, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind particularly, by his Providence: And though he and his Followers mention Fate frequently, yet this signifies generally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>He taught further, that the <hi>first</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in humane Nature, was the <hi>preserving of ones self;</hi> that Nature recommended us to our selves in the strictest manner, as <hi>Cicero</hi> makes <hi>Cato</hi> speak at large; that the End of humane Life, and the measure of all our Actions, was the <hi>following of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> This Maxime was common to all the <hi>Platonists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Zeno</hi> resolving to set up a new Sect, though without any Reason, as <hi>Cicero</hi> proves excellently <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 4. de finibus.</note>; though he durst not reject this Principle which was so readily embrac'd by every body, yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to give it a new turn, to weaken and obscure it by many Niceties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, and so make way for several of his Principles, especially that of Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which were otherwise too plainly inconsistent with it.</p>
               <p>And here I intended once to give a particular Account of this matter, but it growing unavoidably longer than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and full of their Contradictory Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

and Absurd Distinctions; and having already stated <note n="‖" place="bottom">Cap. 2. &amp; 7. sup.</note> the true meaning of this Principle, I think it may suffice to direct such as are curious to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>3d</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi> Books <hi>de Finibus,</hi> and to <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses against the <hi>Stoics.</hi>

And here I cannot but observe by the way, what <hi>awkard Imitators</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> some People are, who study that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth only in its decay; embrace the Vices and Opinions (as this of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther</hi>) which occasion'd or attended the Ruin of it; and in the first place think it necessary to be Atheist's, in order to be good Republicans.</p>
               <p>Conformable to this were their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Plain and Sincere, Inflexible in their Resolutions, Grave in their Deportment, severely Virtuous; this was the <hi>Masculine Air</hi> which they gave, that noble Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that Probity, that Honour, which distinguish'd 'em from the <hi>rest</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and made 'em <hi>truly greater before</hi> they Conquer'd the World, than <hi>after it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Nation being of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, were naturally prepar'd to receive the <hi>Stoic Philosophy,</hi> especially not being prepossest by any other.</p>
               <p>For though <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had liv'd and grown Famous in one part of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet the <hi>Romans</hi> who were given wholly <hi>to Arms,</hi> seem'd to have heard little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>if him,</hi> or to have minded any thing of <hi>this nature,</hi> till <hi>Greece</hi> being subdu',d and <hi>Macedon</hi> reduc'd into a Province, they

               <p>At the same time <hi>this Philosophy</hi> appear'd in <hi>Rome</hi> it self with great Advantages, by <hi>Panaetius,</hi> who was entertain'd in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and grew into much Veneration among the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the great Virtues of <hi>Scipio Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> which were suppos'd to be owing to his Instructions, and Conversation; having mention'd this <hi>great Man,</hi> it will not be wholly foreign to my purpose, and perhaps some relief to the Reader, to make a little stand and take a short view of him. <hi>P.

               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more reasonable than that one or more ill Actions shou'd escape the Censure of Posterity; under the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of a great many good ones; but the Perverseness of some People will not allow of this, who being given to think out of the way, and maintain dangerous Paradoxes, are always searching into the Lives of great Men, to pick out something to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Pretences.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though it be a very ill office to disturb the Ashes of the Dead, and to call in Question those Encomiums, which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62293:102"/>
have long since ripen'd into Glory, yet when such Authorities shall be thus dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously abus'd, and great Names brought in instead of sound Arguments, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to enquire into the Matter of Fact, as well for the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, as the Information of the Living.</p>
               <p>Of all the Examples that are brought for Self-murther, <hi>Cato</hi> is the most Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; wherefore in order to the making a right Judgment of this Matter, it will be necessary to do these things</p>
               <p n="1">1. To form a just and true Idea of him, by considering his particular Temper, and what it was that distinguish'd him from other Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To consider him as he stood in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>It is generally supposed that <hi>Cato</hi> dy'd <hi>for the Liberty of Rome,</hi> and this is one of the chief Grounds upon which the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums of him were rais'd in after Ages: But it prov'd quite otherwise, for next to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Death, <hi>Cato</hi>'s was the greatest

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62293:109"/>
that <hi>Caesar</hi> might have lost that Battle, which was the <hi>most doubtful</hi> and <hi>most bloody</hi> that he <hi>ever fought;</hi> and which he gain'd only through the folly of <hi>Labienus;</hi> or after that he might have retir'd into some place unknown, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not extended to that degree then, or ever after, that there was no place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to, no means of evading Tyrants fury but Self-murther: And though he could not <hi>have prevented Caesar</hi>'s greatness, yet he wou'd still have been <hi>a curb upon him,</hi> and at least have made him use his Fortune more <hi>moderately;</hi> nor was it long before Opportunity did offer it self to recover again his Countries Liberty.</p>
               <p>I do not think that <hi>Cato</hi> wou'd have been drawn into the Conspiracy against <hi>Caesar;</hi> I believe his great Mind was not capable of consenting to the <hi>Murthering</hi> even of <hi>his mortal Enemy in so base a manner;</hi> but afterwards he might possibly have joyn'd with them, supported the Virtue of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and restrain'd the Fury of <hi>Cassius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Anthony</hi> and young <hi>Octavius,</hi> and wou'd have been in all respects a <hi>great strength</hi> to their Party, for notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Character, his Ingratitude to <hi>Caesar</hi> lost him many Thousand <hi>Romans</hi> that would gladly have come in to <hi>Cato.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:62293:110"/>
Wherefore if we consider these things impartially, though it is commonly said in Justification of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Self-murther, that he dy'd <hi>for the Liberty</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis plain that he <hi>stabb'd it himself;</hi> yet not <hi>purposely</hi> but <hi>accidentally,</hi> in such a manner as a Man that resolves himself a Mischief, might in his rage stab his own Father that cling'd about him.</p>
               <p>There is one thing by which <hi>Cicero</hi> wou'd prove that <hi>Cato</hi> ought to have dy'd in this manner, and that is <hi>Decorum,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero de Ossicijs, lib. 1. Sect. 31.</note> which is the same with maintaining a Character; a certain likeness between all our Actions, an unalterable equability of Life: And this is grounded upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Universal and particular Humane Nature, of which something has been said above; This <hi>difference of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Natures, which forms the several Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Men, is of that force,</hi> says he, that <hi>sometimes one Man ought to kill himself,</hi> and yet <hi>another</hi> in the very same Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>ought not; For was</hi>

it would have been blameable in them to have kill'd themselves, because their Manners were gentler and easier; but as Nature had given <hi>Cato</hi> an incredible Gravity, and he had confirm'd this by a perpetual Constancy, and had always remain'd unmoveable in what he had once resolv'd and undertaken; it became him rather to die than to see the Tyrants Face.</p>
               <p>Here this great Man seems to give in too much to the Principles of the <hi>Stoics;</hi> upon which (though well corrected in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places) that excellent Treatise is founded: <hi>They</hi> laid down in the first place, that a wise Man <hi>cou'd not possibly be mistaken;</hi> upon this they advanc'd, That <hi>such a Man ought never to change his Opinion,</hi> or way of Living or Acting, but be <hi>always the same:</hi> Now if the <hi>first</hi> cou'd have been <hi>true,</hi> the latter wou'd have been <hi>reasonable;</hi> but alas! it is far from being so, the wisest and the best of Mankind may err in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and consequently in his Actions; and therefore nothing can be more <hi>dangerous,</hi> than to mantain that a Man <hi>ought never to alter.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Inconstancy</hi> are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>unmanly</hi> Faults; but next to the not being in any Errour <hi>at all</hi> 'tis the greatest Wisdom to get out of it <hi>quickly;</hi> and the doing so is no more Levity and

Inconstancy than when a Man has mistaken his way, and is <hi>running</hi> upon a <hi>Precipice,</hi> 'tis Levity and Inconstancy to <hi>turn back again.</hi> To <hi>persist</hi> in an Errour is <hi>Stupidity;</hi> this is the <hi>Constancy</hi> the <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of <hi>Brutes;</hi> but to get out assoon as <hi>possible,</hi> not only becomes the Dignity of humane Nature, but improves it in the <hi>highest manner,</hi> since every Errour we <hi>leave</hi> the more we have of <hi>Truth,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently partake the <hi>more of God himself.</hi>

To observe a Resolution <hi>steadily</hi> is so much the <hi>worse,</hi> if the Resolution be not <hi>just,</hi> and is no more than being positively in the <hi>wrong,</hi> wherefore it should have been prov'd first that Self-murther was <hi>Lawful,</hi> for if it be not so, no Plea can be <hi>weaker</hi> than that of <hi>Decorum,</hi> which in this Case is nothing more than <hi>habitual Stubbornness</hi> and <hi>profess'd Injustice;</hi> and as for the Evil which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendod here for <hi>Cato</hi>'s dying; Namely, the <hi>seeing the Tyrants Face;</hi> this was not <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> he might and ought to have sav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the other Senators, and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled

               </p>
               <p>This Passage of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s puts me in mind of what I said concerning him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, when I brought him in against <hi>Self-murther:</hi> He is so directly in his <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Scipionis,</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> shews suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 9.</note> That Excellent Piece was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death; when his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Free. Afterwards <hi>Cicero</hi> being of the same Party that <hi>Cato</hi> was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carry'd away with that Torrent of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause which that Age run into. He makes all the shifts he can to palliate and excuse his killing of himself, and is very hard put to it to do so, as may appear from the Instance which we have been just now discoursing of; and his making <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Case and his the same, 1. <hi>Tuscul. quaest.</hi> than which nothing can be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62293:112"/>
more unreasonable; but if any Body should be so zealous in this matter as not to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with this; his Authority shall be wav'd if they please.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Point, if it be ask'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, What shall we say to those <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> which were given to this great Man? How could so many People be in the wrong? How could his Death ever have been so much Applauded if not Reasonable and Lawful? The true Causes of this great Applause were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was a Man really of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Probity, Honour, Integrity, Courage, the truest Lover of his Country that can be found in any History, that the Faults of his Life were fewer, and the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies brighter than any other Example can afford.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That upon this Account the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the other <hi>Cato,</hi> which was very great, sunk into his, and in after Ages what was said of the Former was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Latter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That as to his Death, there are some Actions which become Famous not for their <hi>being Reasonable,</hi> but for their happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a <hi>particular time; Cato</hi> kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>just upon the alteration</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government; He dy'd <hi>with</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:62293:112"/>
                  <hi>Liberty</hi> most certainly, whether he dy'd <hi>for it or no,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> that Liberty was <hi>miss'd,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> was his Death <hi>Applauded;</hi> the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Revolutions</hi> of the <hi>Roman State,</hi> the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of that <hi>Glorious Republick</hi> was attended <hi>by the Self-murther</hi> of <hi>two most Virtuous Persons,</hi> which being Celebrated with so many Encomiums, has <hi>deceiv'd</hi> many People; but the <hi>Virtues</hi> of their <hi>Lives conceal'd</hi> the <hi>Errours</hi> of their <hi>Deaths,</hi> and the Publick being so far <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd</hi> in them, ran away with their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,</hi> which Posterity has receiv'd from Age to Age without much Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>From what has been said I hope it doth appear, that as no Example of Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to sway with us, either upon account of the <hi>Romans</hi> Practice, or the Doctrine of the <hi>Stoics,</hi> so this of <hi>Cato</hi> in particular ought not to be of any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this Case.</p>

               <p>OTher Pretences there are for Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which are grounded upon mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notions of Courage, Honour and Liberty; the first of which is Courage.</p>
               <p>In so Warlike an Age and Nation as this is, it might perhaps be taken amiss, for any one to enquire what Courage is: But that they who abound most in any thing that is commendable, always bear the Examination of it best.</p>
               <p>Here we meet with our Author again, who is more Lofty than usual upon this Occasion. <note n="*" place="bottom">Donne. pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>As to the Causes of this Fortitude which he mentions here, to omit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent what relates to Religion, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns dying for ones Country, has <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 8.</note> been spoken to at large, the Motive of Fame shall be consider'd in the next Chapter, as also that of Shame. But how the killing of ones self upon the account of Ease, Love, nay Fear too, shou'd be Instances of Fortitude is very strange.</p>
               <p>By Fortitude here I suppose meant the same with what is call'd Courage. This being generally look'd upon as a great Virtue, and Self-murther believ'd to be an Effect of it: It will be necessary to make a particular enquiry into it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the clearing of this Mistake, but several others rising from the same Root.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us see what is the Nature, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and use of Courage, particularly as Rational and Humane.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the Mistakes are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and what are probably the Causes of them. And this being done I shall shew,</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:62293:114"/>
3. That Self-murther is not the Effect of true Courage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Nature of it, Courage is only the Effect of an active and vigorous heat in the Heart as its Name imports in many Modern Languages, which Heat sends forth many brisk and lively Spirits which diffuse themselves through the whole Body and prompt it to Action; so that this is Common to other Creatures as well as Man; and therefore not any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue naturally, the Virtue of it depends upon the goodness of the Object, and proper use of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Object: All Objects work upon Creatures which have Life either under the Notion of <hi>Good,</hi> or under the Notion of <hi>Evil</hi> (as to things indifferent our Passions are not concerned about them:) As to what is or seems Good, if this is easie to be obtain'd, the very Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it is sufficient to make the Soul reach after it without any occasion for Courage; and if we cou'd imagine a Man to be wholly at ease, to abound in all things he can wish for, and to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the enjoyment of them, such a one wou'd have no need of Courage, and therefore it wou'd languish and die away
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62293:114"/>
by Degrees. But on the other side, if any thing presents it self as an obstacle in the way to that which we take to be Good, or if any thing which we take to be Evil threatens us with danger, then the Soul looks out and views the Enemy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it finds its strength prepares to attack or resist it; from whence it appears that the proper Object of Courage is Evil. Thus a Modern Author, <note n="*" place="bottom">Hobb's Leviath. p. 1. chap 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Fear is the Opinion of hurt from the Object, Courage is the hope of avoiding that Hurt by Resistance.</hi> Or as another, <note n="†" place="bottom">De la Chamb. Char. des pa<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

Courage is one of the Chief, must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be intended, as subservient to this End, and therefore the Justness and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their Motion, must be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by it accordingly. First then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Courage ought to be inform'd truly concerning its Object, to have a <hi>right and certain</hi> knowledge of its <hi>being Evil,</hi> which Reason will quickly discover: Secondly it ought to Attack or Resist that Evil in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>It has been said already that Courage is twofold, either such as Attacks or such as Resists Evil. Let us bring both of them to these Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to that part of Courage which consists in Attacking Evil, the measure of this is, that the Evil be real which we attack, that it be attack'd with <note n="*" place="bottom">Ea animi el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62293:115"/>
Courage ought not to be the Instrument of his Ambition, his Covetousness, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Revenge; for these will make him not only fancy Evil where there is none, but attack it in such a manner as is most unjust: In this regard Beasts use their Courage better than Men, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do it in defence of Life, to supply their Hunger, or to escape Death, when threaten'd some other way. But Man employs it against Man, when Life is far from being in danger, only to usurp over him; and therefore this kind of Courage is rarely employed by good Men, unless upon extreme Necessity; and yet even where such Necessity requires it, it must be always closely attended by Justice and Goodness, without which it would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but injurious Insolence.</p>
               <p>Yet commonly speaking there is seldom any thing in the World less regarded than Justice, by those who value themselves most upon this kind of <hi>Courage;</hi> pushing Courage as some call it, and what is most strange, although the World sut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Hence it is that Impudence and Cruelty, Noise and Madness, want of Sence as much as Virtue, Oaths, Violence, Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

Revenge, Injuring Man, and Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheming God is so often counted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>These Mistakes begin early, they are some of the first Effects of the Baseness, and Degenerateness of humane Nature. Men either out of Cowardize, Worship what they fear, or else Admire it, because they find the same Principles in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by which it usually Acts, as Pride, Ambition, Covetousness, Revenge; and would be glad to have it as an Instrument to compass such Ends as these aim at: This ill grounded Admiration is nourish'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Honour and Titles which are given to this successful Injustice, as such an one the <hi>Conquerour, or the Great;</hi> and by some Characters in Heroic Poetry. But Conquerour is generally a Fatal Title, the Badge of Absolute Slavery, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally selt more by the Heroes own Country than those which he adds to it.</p>
               <p>And what should be meant by such an one the Great? The great Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Arts and Sciences, the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of Virtue; No, the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader and Destroyer of Mankind: Or what are many of the Heroes of Poetry if stript of the Ornaments of Numbers, Wit and Eloquence, and consider'd in

               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> himself seems to have been misled, when coming to <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Tomb, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero pro Archia Poeta.</note> he is said to have cry'd out, <hi>O happy Youth who hadst such a Poet as</hi> Homer <hi>to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thy Deeds.</hi> This false Admiration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him into one of the worst Actions of his Life, the dragging the <note n="†" place="bottom">Quint.

                  </gap> Courage, which imposes upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, first by its Noise and Splendor, and afterwards often enslaves them.</p>
               <p>I have been the more particular in this matter, because this lawless Arrogance, which is often sowr'd into a surly Brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, after it has been long Injurious to Man, and Insolent to God, when any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens cross to it, and it is Check'd or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd by Providence, is very apt to fly out into Rage and Indignation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot reach that, falls upon it self, and so becomes one of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Causes of Self-murther; which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People take to be an Effect of Courage accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other part of Courage consists in the resistance of Evil. And is that firmness and constancy of Mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it supports it self undauntedly under all Calamities, this is the more noble sort of Courage; because a Man cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just here towards his Neighbour, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62293:117"/>
his God; for this consists in the bearing of all Events with Patience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Poverty, Pain, Loss of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Friends or Children, Disgrace, &amp;c. Some one of which, at least, befal most Men sometime or other, and therefore every one ought to be provided with this kind of Courage, whatever he is with the other, because there are much fewer Evils that require being resisted by Violence, than by Patience: This then is that Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than which the Soul should have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to retire unto, when it is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by sudden Evils; and then it is, then chiefly that it has the most glorious opportunity of discovering it self; for what nobler Idea can we form of humane Nature, than to consider it beset by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evils at once, attack'd in its Body, Reputation, and Estate, and yet <hi>undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And though left singly and alone, Arming it self with Resolution, Patience, and Constancy; whatever has been said of the <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Arms of Old, such as these are Impenetrable indeed, because well wrought and tempered by deliberate Reason, by God himself, and bestowed by him upon the greatest and the best Men only. But alas! though this part of Courage is so necessary to Mankind, yet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62293:118"/>
it is least regarded, because 'tis against the wild Appetites and Passions which are indulg'd by the other; it has no Noise, Pomp and Ostentation, which glitter splendidly upon Corrupted Fancies; but is Calm, Easie, Regular and Modest, as all the Steps of Virtue, when guided by right Reason are.</p>
               <p>If this is a right Account of Courage then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Self-murther cannot be any Genuine or Natural Effect of it, in which of these Senses soever we take it, for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which makes the difference between Brutal and Humane Courage is Reason and Justice; now Self-murther has been shown at large to be highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these, to be an Act of the greatest Injustice, and therefore in this Regard cannot be the Effect of Courage as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Rational; nor can it be the Effect of Brutal Courage properly so call'd, because there is no Beast, though never so remarkable for Courage, that ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys it self; this will appear more plain if we consider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The proper object of Courage which is Evil, I will not stay to show here how often Evil is falsely Represented and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisied, or how many ways it is mistaken,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62293:118"/>
but supposing that to be really Evil which Men take to be so; yet in the Case of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther, the Soul instead of attacking or resisting what it takes to be Evil, flies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it; and therefore this Act is no more an Argument of true Courage than the rushing into a Torrent, the leaping down a Pit or Precipice in a Panic Fright, is so.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Courage</hi> is the attacking or resistance of <hi>Evil,</hi> as has been shewn, then <hi>Death</hi> must be look'd upon as an <hi>Evil,</hi> before any Man can be suppos'd to shew his Courage by killing himself; for where there is no <hi>Evil,</hi> there can be no occasion for <hi>Courage.</hi> Death can never be an Evil but when Life is casie and happy, and look'd upon as a great Good; this makes it so honourable for People of Quality who abound in Wealth and Power, and all such things as make Life desirable, to hazard <hi>theirs</hi> for the Publick. But to them that kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Life cannot seem Good but Evil: And when Life becomes an Evil, through great Pain, Poverty, Disgrace, &amp;c. then Death must be look'd upon as Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably; and if so, there can be no Courage in running to it. But on the contrary, 'tis the part of a brave Man, when Life becomes an Evil to him, not to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62293:119"/>
fly to Death, but to turn Head and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the Misfortunes of Life; for here lies the Enemy as <hi>Caesar</hi> told his frightn'd Souldier, An <hi>unhappy Life</hi> is the Field for true Courage and Magnanimity; whereas the killing of ones self is plainly to decline the Combat, to convey ones self away, out of the reach of the Eneny, to pass from a state of Misery, into a state of Ease or Indolency at least, <hi>as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;</hi> and this sure can be no great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Courage.</p>
               <p>That which is most apt to deceive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon this Account, is the Notion which the World generally has of Death, as the greatest of all Evils, that it takes us through a Thousand Pains and Tortures from our Friends and Relations, our Projects and Possessions, and all the Enjoyments of the World: All which Terrours are increas'd by the sight of the Death of some dear Friend or near Relation; for then humane Nature Starts and Trembles at the Ghastly looks and Convulsions of Expiration.</p>
               <p>These are the things which make Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grow up in a detestation of Death, and this is still augmented the more happy they are in their outward Circumstances; Wherefore they who kill themselves may
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62293:119"/>
seem indeed to such People to have a great deal of Courage, because <hi>these</hi> run volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily into that which they abhor as the worst of Evils; whereas the Notion of Life and Death is quite contrary in such unfortunate Creatures; 'tis some Pain, some discontent that drives them to this Violence; upon account of which <hi>Death,</hi> as I said before, becomes the <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> the <hi>Evil;</hi> therefore as it wou'd be true Courage in Health or Prosperity to <hi>suffer Death,</hi> rather than commit <hi>a Crime:</hi> So in Sickness or any Adversity it would be the same, to <hi>undergo Life</hi> rather than be <hi>guilty of Self-murther;</hi> for he who parts with Life, because he thinks himself Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; parts with nothing but what he is <hi>griev'd withal.</hi> He only lays down his Burthen, quits his Virtue, his Arms, for fear of the Enemy, and where can be the Courage of this; even <hi>Sardinapalus</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> cou'd desert their Station in this manner; and why not with as much Bravery as any other can pretend to, In a Word, when the Heart gives way to Evils and Asslictions, when Hope is gone and Despair enter'd, Men may make themselves away out of tenderness and softness; there being little or no Pain to be selt in Voluntary Death; especially if
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62293:120"/>
Men will take but as much care as <hi>Brutus</hi> did, to place the Weapon right, or as the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> to have the Mortal Place mark'd out exactly.</p>
               <p>What, shall we say then, that all Men are Cowards that kill themselves? No; but that this particular Act has naturally more of Cowardice than Courage in it, and is in those who have signaliz'd their Courage an act of Revenge or Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore though some Men of Courage have kill'd themselves, yet since the Nature of Courage consists in resisting Evil, and Self-murther is the flying from Evil; since many Women and Slaves, many Effeminate Men and Notorious Cowards, many for <hi>Ease</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> as our <hi>Author himself</hi> confesses, have kill'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Self-murther ought not to be look'd upon as the natural effect of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>To confirm what has been said, I shall call several Persons of unquestionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

XIII.</hi> Of <hi>Honour:</hi> That this is twofold, either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a Principle of Virtue; or Outward, the Applause which follows upon it; That neither of these can ever require Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iher: The mistakes concerning <hi>Honour,</hi> which occasion it. Objections answer'd.</head>
               <p>THe next pretence for Self-murther is <hi>Honour.</hi> There is nothing I think that is more generally pretended to than this, excepting <hi>Wit</hi> only; and yet this seems to be as little understood as that; <hi>Honour</hi> People find is something that is commendable, though what it is they cannot tell; therefore every one being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to have their Actions pass for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; the Word is strain'd to as many Significations as they have Inclinations; often 'tis taken for some particular Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is thought to belong more to one degree of Men, or to one Sex, than another: Thus in Women Chastity is Honour, in Men of high birth Truth and Justice, in Soldiers Courage, in Tradesmen punctual Payment; but since these several Qualities may be attended by great Vices: Since these things are truly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62293:122"/>
as commendable in one Person as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and equally required in all People, this is but a very imperfect account of <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this must be something which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all Mankind, and therefore humane Nature it self must be considered before we can come to any knowledge of it. The perfection of Humane Nature, and the great end of Humane Life has been shewn to be the <hi>following of Reason by Virtue;</hi> therefore what I said of Courage before, must be said of Honour now, that the excellency of it consists in the <hi>promoting of this End;</hi> now though whatever is an hindrance to this is call'd by the general Name of <hi>Evil,</hi> yet all Evil does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its own natural shape, but often puts on the form of Good, and so works and insinuates it self into Man by his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Appetites; wherefore Honour seems to be that Principle whereby the Soul is secur'd against both these kinds of Evil, in the quiet pursuit of the End of Life. And thus perhaps it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd.</p>
               <p>Honour is an Elevation of the Soul, upon the sence of its Preheminence above the rest of the Creation, in regard to that great End of its being, the following of Reason by Virtue; a firm
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62293:122"/>
Resolution to observe it; and agenerous disdaln of all Pleasure or Profit, all loss or danger, of whatever the World can promise or threaten; of whatever is dreadful or delightful in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of doing so—<hi>So that this is the greatest excellency of Man's Nature,</hi> 'Tis a Spirit drawn off from the noblest parts of humane Reason, 'tis that God within us, as the <hi>Stoics</hi> speak; that divine Power which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects Man's Free-will, follows him diligently through every part of his Duty; Regulates his Knowledge and his Courage, and hinders the one from falling into <hi>Injury,</hi> and the other into <hi>Knavery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This I take to be the first and most important meaning of the Word <hi>Honour,</hi> as it is an inward Principle of Action, and depends wholly upon ones self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another signification of this Word <hi>Honour,</hi> as it depends upon other People, and is something of the same Nature with Reputation but above it. Reputation is esteem from supposed Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, when we say such an one is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so and so.</p>
               <p>Honour is Praise, Respect, Veneration, upon a clear Knowledge, a certainty of such Excellencies, and when this is given by many Men it is call'd Glory, so that Honour is twofold inward or outward:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62293:123"/>
But the last depends chiesly upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are to bestow it.</p>
               <p>The outward Honour which is truly Valuable, is the Image of inward Honour reflected back in the Applause of Good and Wise Men, upon a Man's observing faithfully the true end of Life, and making always a right use of those Powers by which he excells all other Creatures; in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impartial Reason by steady Virtue, what ever Dangers threaten or Pleasures slatter. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> who understood this very well, though he was a little too forward to help himself to it, tells us that Glory (which is of the same Nature with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though of a larger Extent) is <note n="*" place="bottom">Gloria est solida quaedam res &amp; expressa non adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, ca est consentiens laus honorum, incorrupta vox bene Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantium de excellente Virtute.

all other no better than the slight daubing of fading Colours which decays immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
               <p>But because the love of Honour includes the fear of Dishonour, and no Man can be desirous of Praise, but he must have a proportionable Aversion to Disgrace, it will be necessary also to observe from whence this comes, this must be from acting quite contrary to what was said above from forsaking the true end of Life, from refusing to <hi>follow Reason by Virtue,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting it wilfully to obey Vice; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of this is first inward Disgrace, when the Soul abhors it self, and hates the sight of its own folly; and this when known, becomes outward Disgrace, which truly consists in the <hi>concurrent dispraise of good Men:</hi> But then we should take notice that though this is a great Evil, and though a Man may happen to fall into it, yet he may recover his Reputation or Honour again by taking the contrary Course, and following of his Reason by Virtue, and that the sooner, because good Men, upon whose Verdict Disgrace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends will be always ready to acquit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of blame upon reasonable Grounds, and glad to believe and proclaim their change.</p>

If this then be an Account of Honour, how can it be pretended that it shou'd ever require a Man to Murther himself, for first as to inward Honour; if this be an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul, rais'd upon a just sense of the Advantages which Man has above other Creatures, in the Powers of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Free-will, and the excellent end which they are given for; and if it be a firm Resolution of pursuing that End, What can be more contradictory to this than Self-murther? What can it signifie to Man to have such Preheminences, nay to be made to any purpose at all, if the noblest Principle in his Nature shou'd teach him to decline that purpose; if that which was plac'd in him to support and improve his Being, shou'd require him not to be at all? Again if Honour be the generous disdain of whatever is Terrible or Dangerous in the way to our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true end of Life, and if it is always in a good Man's Power to perform this End? What Circumstances can be of such a kind, so Evil, so Painful, Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or Dreadful, wherein Honour can put a Man upon killing of himself? Lastly if this be the guard which is to follow the Soul diligently through every part of its Duty, as to the chief Objects of it, God,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62293:124"/>
our Neighbour or our selves; how can it ever perswade a Man to such an Act as is the highest Injustice to every one of these? Whoever considers inward Honour which is the most worthy of a great or good Man's care in these respects; he will find nothing more against Self-murther than this; so likewise as to outward Honour, if this consists in the praise of good Men, grounded upon excellent Virtue, and if nothing is truly Disgrace, but what comes from the same Persons, for forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true End of Life; and if this though forsaken may be recovered again when the Party concern'd pleases, then how can any Man kill himself to avoid Disgrace, especially since killing himself is an Act of the greatest Injustice in the Judgment of the best Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doing so must be increasing of Disgrace rather than avoiding it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether we consider inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Honour, neither of these can ever require a Man to Murther himself; and therefore I suppose that, whenever this is said to be done upon this Account, it is either meer Pretence, or else proceeds from some mistake concerning one or both of these kinds of Honour.

Some Men are deceiv'd by reckoning Honour nothing but a greatness of Mind, Elevation of the Soul, without considering upon what Grounds it ought to be rais'd, and by what Rules directed when it is so, from whence instead of any just Grandeur they sall into insolent Haughtiness, and this encreases upon the value which they set upon themselves, and that value is nourish'd by their choosing out some one Virtue asfecting the observation of it in a more extraordinary manner than other People do, which makes 'em run over the bounds of what is sit and just, as far as the Idle or the Cowardly fall short of 'em: <hi>Montaign</hi> says very well, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Essays lib. 3. cap. 2.</note>

of Errour in this matter is the immoderate desire of Applause; the neglecting the Principles of Virtue upon which inward Honour is form'd, and aspiring impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to outward Honour only, and not only so, but mistaking the Persons who are to bestow it; and therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to please the <hi>most</hi> and not the <hi>best;</hi> the very same is done likewise in relation to Disgrace; this is that fatal Rock upon which many great Spirits have been cast away, and therefore there never was any considerable Moralist, but has cautiously warn'd People of it, and endeavoured carefully to recal them to consider the Dictates of Reason and Conscience, and <hi>inward Honour,</hi> to <hi>Reverence themselves</hi> and not the Multitude, and to do well for their own sakes without any regard to common Praise or Disgrace.</p>
               <p>And indeed it might be enough to cure this, to consider attentively, how much a Man must undervalue himself in order to be rais'd in this manner; he that courts any one must endeavour to humour and please him; now this cannot be done but by being like him, by levelling a Man's self both to his Capacity and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by renouncing his own Judgment and following what he takes to be the

Wherefore let the distinction between <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>outward Honour be always carefully observ'd;</hi> let all good Men despise the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in comparison of the <hi>former;</hi> for if this depends upon the Multitude, 'tis below their care; if it depends upon the best of Men, it does not want it; because it will naturally follow upon the acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles of inward Honour, and if these Principles be faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, they can never lead to Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Because <hi>inward Honour</hi> is the guard of the great End of Life, and therefore can never prompt any Body to destroy it, it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends constantly upon impartial Reason, and follows it not by one but every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and therefore its Course is always Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and even; it blesses the mind with a just and lasting Applause, makes it dear to it self, and generally to all the World, and therefore must hinder and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Self-murther rather than promote it.</p>
               <p>But if this shou'd not be sufficient to give some Gentlemen satisfaction in this matter, I will suppose an Objection to this purpose. <hi>A Man's Honour ought to be dearer to him than his Life; he may be abus'd to that degree as to forfeit his Honour if he shou'd bear it; and therefore he ought rather to kill himself; especially since Women them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>

                     </gap>uch harder than theirs were:</hi> For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>a Man born Nobly, bred a Soldier,</hi> &amp;c.—I will Answer first this Objection, with its Instances, and then consider the particular Case afterwards: 'Tis said here first, that a Man's Honour ought to be <hi>dearer to him than his Life,</hi> very True; if Honour be taken here for that <hi>inward Principle</hi> which secures Man in the doing of his Duty. Honour <hi>in this sence</hi> ought to be dearer to a Man than Life, that is, he ought to <hi>suffer</hi> the worst Extremities, even Death it self, rather than act <hi>against it;</hi> but then it is absurd for any Man to <hi>destroy his own Life</hi> upon this Account; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this kind of Honour is always <hi>in his own Power,</hi> and cannot be forc'd from him unless he consent.</p>
               <p>If <hi>outward Honour</hi> be meant here, that is <hi>Reputation,</hi> this ought not to be dearer to him than his Life; because it wou'd then be dearer also than the great End of Life. Dearer than his Duty; and he must Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisice both his Reason and his Virtue to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62293:128"/>
maintain his Reputation; and that too among the worst of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis said here, a Man may be abus'd to that degree as to forfeit his Honour if he shou'd bear it: This cannot be as to the <hi>first sence of Honour,</hi> for that will never be in danger if he be Innocent, how much soever he is abus'd; Power and Injustice may oppress Virtue, and a Man of the nicest Honour may be Unfortunate, but yet this Honour may be encreased by the manner of his bearing of his Misfortune, by his Deportment under great Injuries; to Kill ones self rather than bear 'em; is to be <hi>unjust to God</hi> in the <hi>highest</hi> manner, because another is <hi>unjust</hi> in a small matter <hi>to me;</hi> and this sure cannot be Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the first sence; but indeed is nothing but an Act of Impotent Indignation and Revenge, of Pride, Cowardice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, and therefore cannot be Honourable in the latter neither.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Objection assisted by these Instances. The first of these indeed may justly raise Compassion in all that read her Story, and never had any Person more Statues rais'd to her; but it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that because <hi>Lucretia's</hi> Death was much Applauded therefore it was <hi>Lawful</hi> or is to be <hi>imitated.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:62293:129"/>
It was Applauded by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for being the accidental occasion of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Liberty, and of the great Glory it rose to afterwards; and other Nations consented to this Applause, as they heard her Case, out of Compassion and Generosity, which is due most to those who fall into mistakes only through <hi>too severe</hi> and <hi>nice a sense of Honour:</hi> Far be it then from me to search farther into this matter. No, let the Garlands which have been hang'd over her Tomb by Chaste Wives and Virgins remain forever unshaken and unviolated: Let all the <hi>Wit</hi> that has been shewn in her Praise <hi>pass for Reason;</hi> but then let me entreat such as are most Zealous to vindicate the manner of her Death, to consider what has been said already, to prove such an Act <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and withal to remember the Occasion of her using her self so; and allow at least, that it ought not to be imitated, but in just <hi>the same Circumstances;</hi> and then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her living wou'd have been an Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for Unchastity or no, (as the poor Lady thought) I am confident that her Death will not be any dangerous cause of Self-murther.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> she is very ill join'd with the other; the Example of <hi>her Death,</hi> ought no more to befollowed than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

of it depended much upon the Character and Demeanour of the Person that was led in Triumph; therefore it has not been always Ignominious to those who have been thus expos'd; when <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinoe, Cleopatra</hi>'s younger Sister, a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady, was us'd so by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> the Multitude was softened into Pity and Compassion at the sight, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflected upon their own <hi>Condition,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Dion Cass. lib. 4.</note> that they were in effect as much <hi>Slaves</hi> as <hi>she;</hi> and that great Man was never so much overseen, both as to his Politicks and Generosity, as in gratifying <hi>Cleopatra</hi> at so dear a rate: So might it have been with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> her self too, had she been as Virtuous as she was Great. For where is the Crime of being Oppress'd, or the Shame of being Unfortunate? How cou'd the Multitude have ever dishonour'd her? Had not her <hi>own Infamy</hi> ran before her? What a strange niceness of Honour is it, not to scorn to <hi>commit</hi> the foulest Vices, and yet to scorn to <hi>hear</hi> of them: Honour is truly lost when an ill Action is <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> not when it becomes <hi>known,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very Ridiculous, though very Common, to be easie as to the first, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62293:130"/>
scrupulous as to the latter; for this is to make <hi>Secrecy</hi> the measure of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and no Vice <hi>dishonourable</hi> but only when it is <hi>discovered;</hi> where Virtue suffers publickly the Honour of the Publick suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, this is Infamous to the State, not to the Person that is injur'd; whose Honour may be encreas'd by suffering as they <hi>should do:</hi> But where Honour is first ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd by enormous Crimes 'tis too late to be tender of it as to Publick Disgrace, or to think to redeem it by Self-murther; for this is not only a great Crime it self, but a Confession of all those which are laid to the Parties Charge. And though <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was so tender in this matter, yet other Persons of unquestionable Courage and Honour underwent the same Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Not only <hi>Perseus,</hi> but <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> whose Wit and Courage gave the <hi>Romans</hi> so much trouble, did so; nay <hi>Ventidius,</hi> the faithful Friend of <hi>Anthony,</hi> was first led in Triumph himself, and afterwards by a strange change of Fortune Triumph'd over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the most dreadful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy the <hi>Romans</hi> ever had.

And yet when she had satisfied whatever Honour requir'd as to Action, she made use of it to bear her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity with as great a Mind as she did her Prosperity; and therefore she did not Murther her self when she was to be led in Triumph; but carry'd it so as to be consider'd with Admiration, and liv'd in <hi>Rome</hi> it self with great Respect many Years after.</p>

                  </gap>arder than theirs were; <hi>(I have had one put to me much to this purpose)</hi> A Gentleman born Nobly, and bred a Soldier, having gain'd much Honour by many great Actions in his Countries Service, is afterwards by the Ingratitude and Jealousie of his Prince, accus'd falsely of some foul Crime, and Condemn'd to suffer a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Shameful Death; <hi>the Question is,</hi> Whether such a one after he has stood his Trial, and done what he cou'd to clear and save himself, shou'd tamely expect the Death which he sees is Inevitable, let his Enemies have their Will over him, and be the Scorn and Derision of the Multitude: Or not rather disappoint their Malice and Contempt, and vindicate his Honour by killing of himself. <hi>I confess I am of Opinion that he</hi> ought not <hi>to do the</hi> latter <hi>by any means: For the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us see what <hi>may be the Character of a Man of Honour:</hi> (the Ignorance whereof so often misleads People in other Cases as well as this:) according to what
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62293:132"/>
                  <hi>has been said above,</hi> He is one who has a just and regular Elevation of Soul; whose Eye is always sixt steddily upon his Duty, and who disdains equally whatever Threatens or Flatters to draw him from it: One who is ever glad to be doing good to all Men, and abhors Cunning and Oppression as much as Cowardice. <hi>Or if we take Honour for Publick Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> He despises all but that alone which comes from Good and Wise Men; yet he prefers his Duty before this also; he values a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science above a Good Name, and therefore would be as Virtuous in a Desart, as in the midst of Prying Multitudes; nay would not be guilty of an unjust Action, though he shou'd he sure that it wou'd be conceal'd from God as well as Man; much less to gratisie any Revenge, or to avoid any Disgrace.</p>
               <p>Now, though the Instance is given here in a So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dier, and many are apt to think, as well as those Gentlemen themselves, that <hi>they</hi> ought to be <hi>more</hi> concern'd to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their Honour than other People are, I do not see any ground for this: If what I have said of Honour before, and also just now, (and chiefly to prevent this mistake) be duly observ'd; nay although Courage alone shou'd be the Standard of Honour, as some of them are inclin'd to believe,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62293:132"/>
and they shou'd think themselves bound to observe stricter measures in regard to this, than the rest of the World; yet this is not to be vindicated by Self-murther in the Case before us, as shall be shewn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The chief ground of this Plea is, <hi>That such a one has stood his Trial, that he has done what he cou'd to clear himself, and for all that is unjustly Condemn'd:</hi> But nothing of this alters the Case, this does not give a Man more right over his Life than he had before; and one sort of Injustice is not to be return'd by another: If Man is unjust to me, what excuse is that for my being unjust to God? <hi>Socrates</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd unjustly if ever Man was, yet he refus'd <note n="*" place="bottom">See Plato's Crito.</note> to save himself by flying out of Prison at his Friends entreaty; because he reckon'd it against the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and unjust to do so. How much more would he have thought it unjust to have evaded the Sentence by Self-murther; for this is an Act of the highest Injustice, and what is so can never be Honourable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore a Man of Honour in these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is not to be sway'd by Opinion, nor to be hurry'd away by Passion; but to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62293:133"/>
enquire calmly and seriously what right he has to destroy himself. It has been shewn that he has none at all; but supposing that he has ever had such a right, yet if he has stood his Trial, he will find this rather lessen'd upon this Account than encreas'd; sor in all Trials there is a tacit Agreement between the Party and the Court to stand the Issue, that if he be found Innocent he shall be discharg'd: If not, submit to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Punishment: Wherefore upon the Prisoners being found Guilty in Capital Causes, his Life becomes the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks immediately; 'tis forfeited by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ct as some Amends for his Crime, and therefore he must be unjust if he evades the paying of that Forfeiture by Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And what the sense of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in this Case is, appears; in that most of them, if not all, make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the Life of an Innocent Man, and the Life of an Offender under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but he that kills the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall as certainly be put to Death as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> kills the former. And though this perhaps may seem the less Crime because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prevents Death but a few Days or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; this makes no difference; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the unlawfulness of Self-murther consists not in the hindering of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62293:133"/>
from living such or such a time, but in usurping a Power which we have no right to, in destroying that which is not our own, and so breaking the Laws of Nature; and this may be done as much by a Man's hindering himself from living a few Minutes, as many Years: In a Word, since what is Unjust cannot be Honourable, since Self-murther after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is rather more unjust than it would have been before. A Man of Honour cannot be oblig'd to kill himself, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Reputation in such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>If it be said that <hi>the Common People have not this Notion of Honour, that something is due to them</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> truely I think nothing at all, much less Life it self, nay Honour too; for if a Man does an unjust thing to satisfie the Multitude, and to preserve his Credit among <hi>them,</hi> he Sacrifices true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to an empty Name; and yet the Multitude it self, to do it Justice, is seldom so bad a Judge of Praise and Disgrace, as to reckon a Man's Honour, in such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as we have been speaking of, vindicated by killing of himself; for by Honour here must be meant either his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> or his <hi>Courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:62293:134"/>
But as to the first, If a Man is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd unjustly, the best way that is left to prove his Innocence, is such a Behaviour as is the Natural Effect of it, a noble dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of the Injustice which he suffers under, a generous indifferency as to Life or Death; and of what the World says or thinks; a perpetual calmness of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, settled Aspect, &amp;c. These will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail very much even upon the worst sort of People, whose Malice begins to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd or tir'd at the time of Execution, and who are inclin'd then to believe both the Looks and Words of dying Men; and indeed there is such a Majesty in calm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, such a Beauty in undaunted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, as checks and controuls insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the rudest Insolence, and changes the Opinion of the most Prejudic'd Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; whereas he that kills himself under Sentence of Death, confirms the Justice of his Condemnation; and is look'd upon as Guilty by the Laws of most Nations and particularly our own.</p>
               <p>As to the Second: Self-murther is not the proper way to vindicate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Courage in such Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it being generally look'd upon as an Act of Despair: Humane Courage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists either in the offering of <hi>just Violence,</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:62293:134"/>
whereas this is the most <hi>unjust</hi> as has been shewn; or else in the <hi>resisting</hi> of <hi>great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> whereas this is the <hi>declining of them</hi> as has been also shewn; the greater the Evil is under which a Man Labours, the greater must his Courage be that resists or supports it; wherefore a Publick and Ignominious Death, being confest to be a greater Evil, to a Soldier especially, than any he has met withal before. His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage must be shewn, if he places his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this alone, in the resisting it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. A Man may have been bred in War, been in many Battles and Seiges, and yet never have march'd to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Death, or rarely have been upon such Service, where 'twas an even chance whether he came off or no: Besides upon these occasions the number of Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Spectators, the certainty of Glory if they behave themselves well, and the heat of the Action animates 'em mightily, and inflames their Courage. But to be dragg'd slowly along through the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Bound and Guarded; to be dragg'd thus to certain Death, to the Death of a Common Malefactor, is a very different Case; to undergo this with Constancy is the Test of true Courage indeed, and argues greater Bravery than can be shewn
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62293:135"/>
in the Field. <hi>He who yields to Affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tion,</hi> says the Author above mention'd, <note n="*" place="bottom">Moral Galantry, p. 122</note> 
                  <hi>shews that they that inflict it are greater than himself, but he who braves it; shews that it is not in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of any thing but Guilt to make him Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This induces me to beleive that Passive Courage is much more Noble than what is Active; for one who Fights gallantly in the Field in the Front or View of an Army, is assisted by the Example of others, by hope of Reward of Victory, and needs not much to fear that Death which he may shun as probably as meet: But he who in a Noble Quarel adorns the Scaffold whereon he is to suffer, evinces that he can master Fate, and makes Danger less than his Courage, and to serve him in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Fame and Honour:</hi> so that if by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be meant Innocence or Courage, this is much better vindicated by a Noble Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under Barbarous Injustice, than by killing ones self in order to avoid it. But suppose it shou'd not be so, suppose the Multitude shou'd insult and deride a Brave and Innocent Man; Will any Person that is Innocent or Brave, so Born, so Bred, as one that we are speaking of, vouchsafe 'em any regard? Will not his Mind be employ'd in a nobler way? And since
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62293:135"/>
there must be a Place for the Reward of injur'd Innocence, since a Good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence affords the best Acclamations: What do the Words and Actions of the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and inconstant Multitude signifie; to mind what they do or say wou'd be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, as to be concern'd whether it wou'd be soul or fair Weather at the time of Execution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the remaining part of the Plea for Self-murther in this Case, <hi>the preventing his Enemies having their Will over him, and disappointing their Malice;</hi> this I am sure is no <hi>Masculine</hi> Reason: This I believe indeed is the Cause why many Men destroy themselves in such Cases: Anger, Despight, Rage, Envy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge drive 'em to this unjust Action, and put 'em upon disappointing their Enemies Malice, with as much Malice of their own; an excellent temper of Mind to leave the World in! But if an Enemy shall not drive me to an <hi>unjust thing</hi> by any <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> shall his <hi>ill usage</hi> do so? This wou'd be to fulfill his Will effectually, to glut his Malice even to a kind of Luxury, for <hi>his Wili is,</hi> that you should Fret and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your self under what he makes you suffer, his Will is, that People should think you Guilty; that the Credit which you
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62293:136"/>
gain'd formerly shou'd be lessen'd by your poor Behaviour at last, all which wou'd be gratify'd by Self-murther: But if you wou'd disappoint his Malice, (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las that is but a base Motive to the doing any part of ones Duty) continue in the same Virtue which first rais'd his Envy and Hatred; march with the same steddy Pace through the ingrateful Multitude, with which thou used'st to do against their Enemies,; Pity them with the same great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind wherewith thou didst defend 'em, and deprive 'em of a Triumph, by maintaining still the same Character, and being even in Death a Conqueror. So <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> went to embrace certain Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst a Thousand Torments. With such a Mind <hi>Scaevola</hi> expos'd his Arm to the Flames; and many others in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have turn'd their Persecutors Barbarity upon themselves, and shaken their ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or ill us'd Power more, by the calm Bravery of their Deaths, than Thousands cou'd have done in the Field: All Histories will afford Instances of this kind. In a Word, this is most certain, that there never was a great Innocent Man put to Death Publickly, but that the Power who caus'd this, wou'd have been hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62293:136"/>
glad, that he wou'd have prevented it by being the Murtherer of himself.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone through this Pretence also; more to comply with some particular Persons, than out of any real Necessity that there is of such Proofs; since all depends upon what was said at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Treatise concerning Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being an <hi>Act of Injustice;</hi> and if so, whatever may be pretended upon the account of <hi>Honour:</hi> If <hi>Honour</hi> be any thing of a <hi>Virtue,</hi> it can never require that which is <hi>unjust,</hi> and consequently it can never be <hi>the occasion of Self-murther.</hi>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62293:137"/>
maintain their Liberty by observing the Dictates of Reason, and following the End, for which they receiv'd Life, which gives Peace, Joy, and lasting Happiness; and this is true Liberty: On the other side, ill Men by deserting the same Dictates, and renouncing the same End, fall into Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Anxiety and Remorse, which is the worst Slavery: Now if <hi>Cato</hi> himself was free in this sense, as to his being a good Man; then what occasion had he to die to obtain further Liberty? If he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for it, then he must own that he was an <hi>ill Man, a Slave,</hi> or in unavoidable danger of being so, which a right <hi>Stoic</hi> cou'd never be.

Why should I wait still the Cruelty of Man or Sickness; when I can walk out of Life through the midst of Torments, and but shake my self and be free from all Adversity? This is the only thing we cannot complain of Life for; it stays no Body: Does Life please you? Live on: Does it not please you?

During his Friends absence, he falls into great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, is very hardly us'd by those he has to do withal; and upon this grows Discontented and Melancholy; when acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally some <hi>Philosophical</hi> Acquaintance comes in; and having heard his Case, talks to him to this purpose: <hi>Since the Soul affects Freedom naturally, why shouldst thou be a Slave to Poverty?

               <p>Liberty is one of the most Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; Man is said to be like God in respect of this, Particularly; and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be more dear to him than his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. If this be so, then when this Liberty is lost by any great Calamity, it must be extreme Cowardice, or extreme Dulness, to drag about a Decrepit Body, or an Afflicted Mind, and to chuse to continue poorly under this Slavery; when God and Nature still leave him so much

Liberty, as to set his Soul Free whenever he pleases.</p>
               <p>Observe, The Word <hi>Liberty</hi> here is a very doubtful Term, having several Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, the using of which promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously occasions great Obscurity and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which are the chief Advantages of this Pretence: Sometimes it signifies <hi>that Liberty</hi> which Man has over his <hi>own</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the freedom of <hi>his Will:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it signifies <hi>the Liberty</hi> of the Body as well as the Mind, and these two, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Slavery which regards each of these, are often us'd the one for the other. Sometimes again Liberty signifies some <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> which Man is suppos'd to have to destroy himself in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumstances though he be ty'd up in all others. Lastly it signifies <hi>that Ease or Freedom</hi> from any Trouble, Grief or Pain, which the Soul is suppos'd to be <hi>let out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> by Self-murther, according to which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Significations, I will consider,</p>

               <p>But while Reason remains, Liberty must remain also; the Mind cannot be enslav'd though beset by various Evils, till it basely surrenders up to 'em; no more than a City is enslav'd, when 'tis only beseig'd and defends it self valiantly; nay not so much, since the Avenues of Reason (in those who are adult especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) cannot be shut up; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the greater the Evils are which beset

the Body, the more may the Mind <hi>enlarge</hi> its Liberty, by the practising of several Virtues, which it would not have had the opportunity of exercising otherwise: All Virtues are the <hi>different ways</hi> of the Souls <hi>exerting its Power,</hi> according to the Dictates of right Reason: Wherefore if the Evils of the Body give it <hi>greater</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to exert <hi>this Power,</hi> and require with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that it should be exerted with <hi>greater</hi> strength and vigour; then these Evils will be so far from <hi>abridging its Liberty,</hi> that they will rather <hi>enlarge</hi> it.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62293:146"/>
to its Reason: Extreme Pain is the truest test of a great and upright Mind, but although it may force a Man to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it <hi>need not</hi> to <hi>Rebel,</hi> it may affect him with <hi>Sorrow,</hi> but not cast him down into <hi>Despair;</hi> and where <hi>Reason struggles faithfully</hi> to retain its <hi>Power: Courage, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Justice, Constancy,</hi> and <hi>great Examples,</hi> will be called in to help to resist what is <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Evil,</hi> rather than a good Man should fall into what is <hi>morally so;</hi> rather than he should be guilty of an <hi>unjust Action,</hi> to fly from <hi>Pain;</hi> when this is only <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>When Pain is encreas'd to such a degree as to destroy Reason, the dispute is at an end; but let Men have a care lest they should <hi>fancy</hi> or <hi>grant</hi> themselves to be <hi>Mad,</hi> only through Impatience, and indulg'd Passions; and then <hi>afterwards make use</hi> of their <hi>Reason</hi> to contrive their Self-destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

Not only the <hi>Stoics</hi> heretofore, but some others since, have been inclined to think that he has; thus one tells us, <note n="*" place="bottom">Mont. lib. 2. chap. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>God gives us leave enough to part with Life, when he is pleased to reduce us to such a condition, that to Live is far worse than to Die.</hi> The Rule which is here given, whereby we are to judge when we have this leave, is; <hi>when God is pleased to reduce us to such a Condition, that to</hi> Live <hi>is</hi> far worse <hi>than to</hi> Die. But this will be found very insussicient to this purpose; if we examine the Particulars; it supposes these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there may be some Condition of Life far worse than Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That 'tis God that reduces the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer to such a Condition.</p>
               <p>As to the first, before we can compare things rightly, we must understand exactly the terms by which they are represented: Life as Humane, implies the union of the Soul and Body; Death is the dissolution of that Union; the condition of Life, which is supposed here to make it far worse than Death, is <hi>extreme Pain;</hi> now the fallacy lies in not mentioning the <hi>manner of this Dissolution</hi> which may be Violent, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the <hi>consequences of it:</hi> To a good
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62293:150"/>
Man indeed, Life in extreme Pain, is far worse than Natural Death; and this is a proper Argument for <hi>such Men,</hi> not to sear <hi>such a Death:</hi> But the Death which we are speaking of, is <hi>a Death of Self-murther;</hi> which should have been particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, and then the Question would be, Whether a Life of <hi>extreme Pain,</hi> is far worse than a Death of <hi>Self-murther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to judge truly of this, we should not only consider the time of the Dissolution, or the Pain that accompanies it, (which in <hi>Self-murther</hi> may be little or none) but also what is to sollow: For if we should look upon Death here, only as the separation of the Soul and Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther prospect, then this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, <hi>that to live in extreme Pain is far worse than to die,</hi> would be impertinent; because Death in this sense, would be no more than the ceasing to be, the utter end of all Sensation; and if so, what a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discovery would it be to say, that the continuation of extreme Pain, is far worse than the cessation of it; or that it is far worse to seel great Misery, than not to seel any thing at all: Wherefore to give some ground for the Comparison, as Life supposes some State or Condition; so Death must likewise, and therefore that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62293:150"/>
which follows afterwards must he in included in the Word. If this then be granted, let Life be never so miserable, through extreme Pain and Torture; yet before a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that this is worse than a Death of <hi>Self-murther,</hi> Let him consider seriously, Whether any thing follows after Death? Whether <hi>Self-murther</hi> is naturally unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? if it be, Whether it will not be punish'd hereafter? and if so, Whether that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not exceed both as to the degree of Pain and the duration of it; that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pain which he would avoid? Nor is it sufficient to say, upon this occasion, that you cannot tell whether there shall be any Future state or no; you never met with any demonstration from Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that there is, or that you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing of it; this I say is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the <hi>Self-murtherer</hi> ought to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> that there is <hi>none;</hi> nothing can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him from an Action of this kind, but plain and undeniable Certainty, and this I am sure cannot be had; but rather the contrary: And in a Matter of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, it might be sufficient without any farther arguing, to stop any Man's Hand, to consider this alone: That the greatest part of Mankind, in all Ages, at least ten Thousand to one, has held some
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62293:151"/>
Future State. And then what a folly must it be upon the pretence of Incertainty, to run such a hazard against so much odds? To rush violently into Death unlawfull, when that which is lawful is so very near; (I mean in the case of extreme Pain or Sickness) and for the avoiding a short time of Misery here, venture the being a Thousand times more Miserable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But still they may insist, <hi>That if God gives one leave this will not be; and he gives me leave enough when he is pleas'd to reduce me to extreme Pain,</hi> &amp;c. This brings me to the second part of this Rule, namely, <hi>that 'tis God that reduces Man to such a Condition,</hi> that is, that he is the sole or chief cause of the Misery he groans under, by some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Effects of his Providence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of the Sufferer: To this I answer, 1. That this is very rarely so, but the sufferings of extreme Pain or Sickness, especially in those who are most inclin'd to <hi>Self-murther</hi> are generally through their own fault. 2. That though they were not but the plain effects of extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; yet no Man can conclude reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably from hence, that God gives him leave or liberty to destroy himself.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:62293:151"/>
1. It is very seldom that God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or chief cause of Man's suffering thus, or that he pleases to reduce him to extreme Pain and Misery, without any fault of the Sufferer, especially those who are inclined to Murther themselves; because their Passions are high and uncontroulable: They despise the Laws of God and the thoughts of a Future State, and therefore are commonly the chief cause of their own Misery; 'tis their own folly that puts such and such second causes into such a motion, as naturally produce such Effects, as great Poverty, Just Disgrace, Painful Sores, and Torturing Diseases; and then if Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes worse to any one of these than any Death; he must blame himself alone: Wherefore nothing can be more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than for such People to be always lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault upon Providence, and to pretend to quarrel with Life, crying out <hi>'tis to no purpose to Live any longer; that Life is not worth the while in such Circumstances,</hi> &amp;c. Alas! they foolishly misuse Life, they wast their Bodies as well as their Estates; and when they feel the natural Effects of doing so, they wisely discover that <hi>Life is not worth the while;</hi> whereas this discovery comes too late; it might and should have been made much sooner; for to instance
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62293:152"/>
in such a Life as has often ended in <hi>Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> When every Hour was grossly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd; when the Mornings were wasted in Sleep, or sickly Qualms; when the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons were thrown away in false Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, inventing or spreading fresh Scandal, in endeavouring to impose upon Virtuous Women, or being effectually impos'd upon by Lewd ones: When the Nights were spent in Gaming, Prophaneness, Drunkenness, Lust, Quarrellings, Murther; then Life indeed was not worth the while, not worth the being continu'd amidst so much toyl of Folly, and so much drudgery of Lewdness; but when nothing but the common Effects of such a Life are felt in Pain or Sickness; for a Wretch to tell you gravely, <hi>that Life is not worth the while,</hi> is Absurd and Ridiculous; nay 'tis false too, for even the sad remains of such a Life are valuable if rightly employ'd; and that very Evil, whether it be Sickness or Pain, for which they hate and despise it, may, by forcing them to break off ill Acquaintance, and compelling them to be Temperate and Retir'd; give them time to think (if they ever are capable of doing so) and restore them by degrees, to themselves, and to their God.</p>

2. Supposing that Men were not the Causes themselves of such Evils falling upon them, but that they were the plain Effects of God's particular Extraordinary Providence; as when a Temperate Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, born of Virtuous Parents, is taken suddenly, in a middle Age, with most violent Pains, falls into tormenting and incurable Diseases, breaks out in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loathsome Sores; and at the same time has violent sits of the Cholick or the Stone; supposing all this, I say, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reasonably concluded from hence, that these are any Signs or Tokens of God's giving him leave to destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For the Reasons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though these great Evils are caus'd by God's particular Providence, yet they come upon the Party in a Natural way, they may have their Causes assign'd by skilful Men, without any recourse to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Power: If so, then since <hi>Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> has been proved to be <hi>naturally unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> no Event which is <hi>Natural</hi> can be a sufficient sign to <hi>assure</hi> any Person, that God gave him leave to do that which is against Nature. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Chap. 6. p. 69.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:62293:153"/>
2. <hi>Pain</hi> can be no certain sign of God's giving Men leave to Kill themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there can be no degree of it fixt, no particular time settled, when they can judge assuredly that it is so; and therefore People must be left to their own Fancies, to destroy themselves when they think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according as they are led by their Cowardice, or their Discontent: <hi>Pain,</hi> as I said before, is most acute at first, when the Disease strugles with Nature in its strength, and before it has actually overcome it, the Sensation of it grows less and less, as the parts affected are weakned, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Incurable: When then can a Man suppose that God gives him leave to Kill himself upon the account of Pain? when it is most Violent? but then 'tis Curable: When it becomes Incurable, as the <hi>Stoics</hi> taught? but then a Man is past the worst of it; and Natural Death draws nearer and nearer. Beside People feel Pain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently according to their different Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or Dispositions of Mind, the same Man will sometimes bear much more, when he has been pleas'd and his Affairs go on well in other Respects, then when he is cross'd by Accidents and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore to make Pain the sign of God's giving a Man liberty to Kill himself,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62293:153"/>
and to leave every one to judge when it is so, is to leave Mankind to their own Fancies; and then one might destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as well for a small fit of the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, as another for the most violent fit of the Stone. Add to this how many others have been in the very same Circumstances of Pain as you are; you will not deny but that some of them have been as Wise, as Learned as your self, and as desirous to die too; and yet <hi>they</hi> have not kill'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>they</hi> have not taken extreme Pain to be any sign of God's giving leave to do so, and therefore how can you be ever satisfy'd that this is such a sign to you, which they could never understand to be so to them <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 6. p. 68.</note>?</p>
               <p>But to give farther scope in this Matter; suppose that extreme Pain should not be only caused by God's Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but also in a <hi>miraculous</hi> and <hi>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> manner; yet this would not be any sign that God gives the Sufferer any leave to destroy himself: Because,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This would imply a Contradiction in God's acting, 'twould suppose him to <hi>will,</hi> and to <hi>will not,</hi> the very same thing at the very same time. It has been already shewn <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1. p. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:62293:154"/>
that the continuation of Life is as much owing to God, as the beginning of it; if this be so, then as long as a Man lives, let it be in extreme Pain, Natural or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, or in what ill condition soever; so long 'tis certain that it <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 6. p. 61.</note> is God's Will that he should Live: If it were not, that which is the cause of his Pain, would put an end to his Life, the first Moment it came upon him. How then can it appear from any Circumstances of Life, though never so dreadful, that God gives a Man liberty to destroy Life? This must be impossible, because he alone continues that very same Life; without him it could not subsist one Moment in Pain, any more than in Ease; and therefore since it does so, 'tis plain that he Wills that the Person should Live on, not Kill himself. And a good Man would be apt to reflect thus with himself in such Circumstances; as I at <hi>first was;</hi> so I <hi>still am,</hi> by the Will of God alone: He continues my Life as truly in this Torment, let it be Natural or Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as he did heretofore: If He would have me die, I should do so instantly, without any need of my own Hand, or of his manifesting his Will to give me leave,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62293:154"/>
but since I do not, I find I have no such leave, and therefore I will struggle on, and whether in Life or Death conform my self the best I can, to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>I might add farther, That extreme Pain, though brought upon a Man by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providence, nay even by Miracle, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any sign of such leave; because by Providence is meant the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular course</hi> of God's working; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently supposes him to work always for some End: That his working in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by extreme Pain, &amp;c. cannot be to this End only, that Man should destroy himself, as by the last Argument appears; that there are other important Ends of such Events, namely the Punishment of the Wicked, the Improvement of the Good, and the Examples necessary to be given to the World of God's Justice on the one side, of Patience, Constancy, Humility, &amp;c. on the other; that whatever the end of God's Providence is in this case; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of these, or any other, 'tis certain that very End is defeated by Destroying ones self; and therefore we cannot suppose that extreme Pain can be any sign of leave for so doing: But what has been said may suffice to shew the Unreasonableness of this pretended Rule for Self-murther, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:62293:155"/>
When God is pleas'd to reduce us to such a Condition, that to Live is far worse than to Dye.</p>
               <p>And whereas 'tis said slightly, that God gives a Man <hi>leave enough:</hi> This shews their mistrust of what they say, and that they are conscious that no such leave can be prov'd; for what leave can be <hi>enough</hi> in this Case? Let any one that is thus tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed consider the Nature of the Fact in Question, and the Importance of it; that without this leave 'tis the Destruction of God's own Propriety, the Rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Providence, the positive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing that end sor which Life was given, the committing that which is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true after all, extreme Pain is the most dreadful Condition of Humane Life, and the severest Trial of a good and great Mind; 'tis true, it may be so excessive, that all Reasoning of this kind may be to no purpose, and Arguments concerning <hi>God's</hi> Propriety, or the End of <hi>Humane</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:62293:155"/>
                  <hi>Life, or Civil Society,</hi> cannot be much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, in a violent sit of the Cholick, or the Stone; when Reason it self shall be often overcome, and the best Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed into Madness. All this is true, but the Question is not whether a Man may not lose his Reason through extreme Pain? if it were it would be readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the Question is, Whether a Man has <hi>any Liberty</hi> given him to destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the <hi>account of extreme Pain, while his Reason still remains;</hi> This I suppose he has not for the Reasons above mentioned; Nay Madness it self has not this Liberty; for if a Mad-man kills himself, he is not Excusable upon account of any Liberty which he had to do so more than other People, but because he knew not what he did: Nor are these Papers design'd for the perusal of People in extreme Pain; but rather for those in perfect Health, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them (if perhaps they are capable of doing so) to undergo it if it should be their Lot: And if they shall happen to be convinc'd when they are in Health, that <hi>Self-murther</hi> is unlawful even in extreme Pain; this will influence their Minds when they come to suffer it, they will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do what they were once satisfy'd was unlawful, though they are not then
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62293:156"/>
able to run through the several Particulars upon which their Conviction was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The last signification of the Word <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> is that Ease which the Soul enjoys after it is separated from the Body; in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to which I am to shew,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That as Man has no Liberty or Authority granted him to destroy himself, upon account of extreme Pain, or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so if he presumes to put this in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to obtain Ease or Liberty, the Soul instead of enjoying any such Liberty, will fall into a state of Great Slavery: This will require the making out these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there will be another State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the separation of the Soul from the Body, wherein it shall be accountable for its Actions, and as they are Good or Bad be Rewarded or Punish'd accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Self-murther</hi> being one of the worst Crimes, shall be liable to a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Punishment.</p>
               <p>The first of these, <hi>That there shall be a State,</hi> &amp;c. is very seldom deny'd by those who acknowledge the Being of a God; and is readily granted, nay vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain'd, by the Gentleman with
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62293:156"/>
whom I have been chiesly concerned; however it is necessary for the compleating of this Design, to offer some Arguments for the Proof of it, and to remove some Objections which are usually made against it. Yet what shall be done to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, shall be only what may be naturally drawn from those Principles which I laid down at the Beginning; for if <hi>those</hi> be true, then this will follow of course; if there is a God who reserves to himself the Propriety of Humane Life, the Supreme and Absolute Dominion over us: If Life is imparted and continu'd to Man for a particular End, and if Rules and Laws are given him for the pursuing and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that End; if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e Laws may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here unpunish'd, and a Man become the more unhappy the more faithfully he observes them; if a Man is capable of doing more good than he can receive an adaequate Reward for in this Life, and if he is capable of Committing more Evil than he can receive a full Punishment for; if those Faculties which give him this Capacity, and which distinguish him from all other Creatures, suggest to him naturally Reward and Punishment, and fill him with Hopes and Fears accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: Then it will be allow'd by any
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62293:157"/>
sensible and unprejudic'd Person, that it does appear, even by the Light of Nature, that there must be such a State hereafter; Let us consider each of these Reasons a little more particularly:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to that Propriety which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to himself over Humane Life, that Absolute Dominion which he holds and exercises over Man; this (considering withal the Nature of Man,) is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he will take an account of his Actions hereafter. 'Tis true all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures owe their Being and Preservation to God, as well as Man, and are as much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Dominion as he is; but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Frames of Creatures shew that God will exercise his Dominion differently: Beasts act by Instinct not by Reason; by Necessity, not Choice; and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that End for which they were made, and their being so framed is a plain Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that God will not exercise any <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Power</hi> over them: But Man has Reason and Liberty to follow it, he knows his Duty; has Natural Principles to direct him in it; freedom of Will to chuse whether he will be so directed or no, and commonly refuses to be so; and therefore
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62293:157"/>
acting contrary to the End of his Being and doing so through his own fault; God who gave him such a frame, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an Absolute Propriety and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over him, must either do all this to no purpose, or else call him to account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Cou'd it be prov'd that God left us wholly to our selves, after he put us into the World, and that we had no Natural Rules to act by, or that we could maintain and prolong our Beings without his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; there might be some ground for doubt in this Matter; but since it is quite contrary, since we have an <note n="*" place="bottom">See pag. 6, 7, 8.</note> inseparable dependence upon him, since he has given us such Frames or Natures on the one side as prove us to be accountable, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd such a Propriety and Sovereignty over us on the other, as gives him a Right to require an account of our Actions; 'tis certain that he <hi>will,</hi> nay that he <note n="†" place="bottom">See that Excellent Treatise: <hi>A Practical Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Future Judgment,</hi> from pag. 6. to pag. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>must</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will appear more Plain if we come to consider the next Principle which I laid down at the <note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap. 2.</note> beginning, <hi>that Life</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:62293:158"/>
was imparted to us for a particular End; for if Man is indispensibly oblig'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that End, then this Obligation is a proof that there must be a Future State, and that for these Reasons sollowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because every End supposes some Rules or Laws to be observ'd for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it. Now whatever the End of Humane Life is, whether it be <hi>the following of Reason by Virtue</hi> or no, 'tis certain it is from God, and therefore the Rules or Laws which are necessary for the pursuing of it, must be from him likewise: Now any Law given to a free Agent, without any Punishment annex'd to it, or without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Provision made for the Executing of that Punishment, wou'd justly call in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Wisdom of the Lawgiver; and therefore we cannot suppose that the Laws which God gives to Man by Nature, shou'd be defective in this Respect; and yet we see frequently that all such Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is escap'd in this Life: If we consider Man in the State of <hi>Nature,</hi> whatever Crimes he commits against himself; for Instance, as to any Excess or Intemperance, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. pag. 20. Sup.</note> no other has any right to punish: Nay, if we consider him as a Member of Civil
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62293:158"/>
Society, Humane Laws cannot always reach that which is naturally Evil; for not to insist upon the many Designs and Contrivances of Lust, Envy, or Revenge, before they are put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: How many evade Punishment after they have been Executed, [and that very insolently] by Interest or Authority? A Powerful Offender, or Corrupt Magistrate, may make the threats of Positive Laws, how just or how severe soever, to signifie nothing: Wherefore, either there must be no <hi>End</hi> at all of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> or there must be no such Rules or Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> as are necessary for the obtaining of this End; or these must be without any Sanction, or that Sanction must be to no purpose, or else there must be another State, wherein those who transgress such Laws now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Punishment, shall receive what is their due hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The different Events which befal those Persons which pursue or forsake the End for which <hi>Humane Life</hi> was given, shew also, that if we believe that there is a <hi>God,</hi> there must be a <hi>Future State:</hi> They who are least careful to pursue the true End of Life; or rather, who most indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously forsake it, are often most Happy, as to all Appearances, and grow Great and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62293:159"/>
Wealthy, and live in Peace and Honour: On the other side, they who pursue this End most saithfully, are exposed to great Sufferings; their Virtues are often to their Disadvantage; their Humility, Patience, and Generosity encourage Insolent and Violent Men to injure and oppress them; and their Constancy and Integrity brings them some times to Barbarous and Bloody Deaths. So that Man's indispensible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Happiness as to this World, are often inconsistent, and therefore we must conclude, either that God is Unjust or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in proposing such an End of Man's Being, as may make it Miserable, nay as may prove the Destruction of it; or else that there must be another State, wherein those who pursue or forsake this End most, shall be Rewarded or Punish'd more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Man is capable of doing so much Good by the pursuing of this End, that he cannot receive an adequate Reward in this Life, and is capable of doing so much Evil by acting against it, that he cannot be made to suffer an adequate Punishment, and therefore there must be another State for both these Purposes.</p>
               <p>As to the first, A Man may make so great a Progress in Knowledge and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62293:159"/>
and be so very Good himself, that by his Example and Instruction, especially if he have Interest and Power in the World; he may retrieve many from Ignorance and Vice; he may be the occasion of such good Laws, or of making such Provision for the Unhappy, as may extend to Future Ages: What a Blessing is a Wise and Good Prince, that faithfully emploies his Time and his Power for the benefit of his Subjects? Now, what Reward can this World afford that can be any ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to such a Persons Virtue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if we consider, that the more Rational and Virtuous any Soul is, the more it must be above whatever belongs to Sensation, that is, whatever Wealth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Pleasure this World can offer it. 'Tis true the Pleasures of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, look something like a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in such cases; but alas! what are these without the prospect of a better State; and how much must they be check'd and damp'd continually by the consideration of the shortness and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this <hi>only</hi> Being?</p>
               <p>As to the second, A Man may commit so much Wickedness; he may be guilty of so many Murthers; he may spread such pernicious Principles, as by destroying the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62293:160"/>
Belief of a God, and enervating the force of Humane Laws, may let loose the most furious Passions, and wildest Appetites; and this may end not only in the Misery of the Present Age, but infect the Future; and what Mischief is not a Vicious Tyraut capable of doing? The worst Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that can be inflicted in these Cases must end in Death; but how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable is that, though caused by the most exquisite Torments, if compared with such Crimes, and many others which may easily be supposed? Wherefore since Man is capable of doing more Good or Evil than he can receive an adequate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Punishment for in this Life; we must either accuse that God who made him so, of want of Wisdom, Goodness, or Justice, or else allow that there shall be another State, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If we consider also the vast Capacity of Humane Nature, the excellency of those Faculties whereby Man is qualify'd for pursuing his proper End; How much they set him above all other Creatures; how they suggest to him naturally Future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Misery, and fill him with Hopes and Fears accordingly; this also will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us other Arguments to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:62293:160"/>
1. As to that great degree of Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Man has in regard to other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Excellency of those Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which he is distinguish'd from them <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. pag. 13, 14. sup.</note>: To what purpose were these if there were no other Life but this? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and Sensation would do the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Self-preservation as well in Man as in Beast, without the great Endowments of Reason and Freewill, by the misuse of which Man has a possibility of making his Life both more miserable and short than they can theirs; so that these Powers which he values himself upon so much, wou'd not be only Supersluous, but greatly to his Disadvantage; wherefore as the very placing of these Faculties in Man, by a Wise and Sovereign Being, shew that he was made for a greater End, than only to continue such a time here; so if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Operations of them, we shall find that they aspire to something greater than this World can afford, that we have a Capacity too great to rest satisfy'd with the choicest Enjoyments here, that our Reason teaches us to despise them, and raises us to Desire more Noble Objects,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62293:161"/>
and more solid and lasting Happiness, <note n="*" place="bottom">See that late Learned and Ingenious Discourse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning The Certainty and Necessity of Religion In Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Pag. 142, &amp;c.</note> Had God intended this Life as the only Scene of Man's Happiness, he would have sitted and proportion'd his Capacity accordingly; he would have made him to acquiess in such Enjoyments as he found here, and not have dispos'd him naturally to think of another State, and to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; and therefore since he has done so, we may be assur'd, that there will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other State answerable at least to such Conceptions. <note n="*" place="bottom">See that late Learned and Ingenious Discourse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning The Certainty and Necessity of Religion In Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Pag. 142, &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is also Evident from the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense of Evil, and of Guilt upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, and the fears which attend it; otherwise Man would be the most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Creatures to no purpose: There is no Creature that feels Remorse upon sense of Guilt, or that dreads Punishment accordingly, but Man alone; and since this dread may increase to a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by the niceness of his Reflection, and the tenderness of his Conscience; there is no Creature that can possibly be so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable as Man; and if this is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, then there is not a Beast, an Insect that perishes, but has greatly the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62293:161"/>
of this <hi>Reasoning Creature,</hi> this <hi>Lord of the World,</hi> as he has flatter'd himself to be for so many Ages: Since then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Man has such Notions; and that God who dispos'd the frame of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in such a manner, as to receive 'em early, and retain 'em strongly, is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, Good and Just: It cannot be imagin'd that he did this in Vain, or only to Disturb and Torment him; for as it would not be agreeable to Infinite Wisdom to do any thing to no purpose; so it would by no means consist with Insinite Goodness to fix such Principles in the Noblest of his Creatures, as must serve to no other End, but to make him more miserable than any of the rest.</p>
               <p>These Reasons, I hope, may suffice to prove to any Unprejudic'd and Impartial Person, <hi>who acknowledges that there is a God;</hi> the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of a Future State of Reward and Punishment, and that too according to <hi>Natural Principles.</hi> As for those Objections that are usually made upon this Occasion, <hi>That the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Good and Evil depends only upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws;</hi> that <hi>the Hopes and Fears of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward and Punishment are not Natural, but the Inventions of Politicians to manage Mankind, and support Government; and that</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:62293:162"/>
                  <hi>this is prov'd by those, who having had the Sence and Courage, to assert their Natural Liberty, have never been troubled with any thing of this kind;</hi> nothing can be more Unreasonable than this; for first it is plain by the consent of Nations, that the distinctions of Good and Evil, (which are generally the same) are sounded in Nature; that the force which they have upon Men's Minds is ancienter than Government it self; as being from <hi>Right Reason,</hi> which is co-eternal with God: As <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, <q>Nor, says he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Nec si Regnante Lue.

often to their present disadvantage: Or else we must grant that these Notions, which are necessary for the general good of Mankind, and are also generally embrac'd by them, must be <hi>Natural.</hi> In a Word, nothing sure can be more reasonable than this; Man cannot be happy without Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society; Civil Society cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without Man's Passions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are restrain'd, these cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd without the Hopes and Fears of a Future State; these Hopes and Fears are generally entertain'd by Man, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him; and therefore as they are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, they must be True, and there is a Future Sate accordingly.</p>
               <p>Nor does it signify any thing in this case to boast of Wit and Courage, Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Natural Liberty, and the being free'd by these means from these Notions. What was the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in this Case? were not these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as Famous for their Wit as for their Arms? and wou'd it not be as Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for any single Man to oppose his Sence as his Courage, against them; and how is Man's Natural Liberty endanger'd by these Notions, when it depends upon the direction and assistance of such Principles, as are founded on them, as has been shewn
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62293:163"/>
in the first part of this Chapter: Or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that some Gentlemen, even that one in a hundred (which I am sure is many more than I need grant) had wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd any such Notions; does it follow from hence that there is no such at all, or are those few a better Argument of what is Natural to Man, than so many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of others? What if there be some few that are Deaf or Blind, or that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted themselves by their Vices; shall we conclude from hence, that Stupidity or Blindness are Natural, and that Seeing and Apprehending are signs of Mens being out of order? Though a Man should be free from all sense of Evil and fear of Future Punishment; this would be no better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that such a Persons Soul was in its proper and natural State, than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being free from all Pain would prove that it was in perfect Health. Pain is the effect of some Violence offer'd to Nature, in order to put it upon its Guard; as the Soul has an outward sense of it, by the Body, that it may resist or avoid whatever is hurtful to that, so it has an inward sense of it, in an ill Conscience, that it may avoid what may prove hurtful to <hi>it self also:</hi> Now as it would be very strange for any one, upon his loss of Feeling in any Part,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62293:164"/>
from a Gangrene or Dead Palsey, to argue that 'twas unnatural for any Man to have the sense of Feeling in that Part; so is it no less strange for any one, that has lost these Notions of Good and Evil, Reward or Punishment in a Life to come, to tell you considently that they are <hi>unnatural;</hi> for all that this proves is only, that such a Persons Mind is distemper'd, that it does not exert its Faculties in a natural way; that is, in the same way that the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mankind do; for 'tis <hi>from hence</hi> that we must judge of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> not from the <hi>temper</hi> or <hi>report</hi> of one or few Persons; and if so, then these Notions which are so <hi>General</hi> must be <hi>Natural,</hi> and therefore <hi>certain;</hi> because whatever is of <hi>Nature,</hi> is of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There needs no further Answer to the Objections against a Future State, or any further proofs for it, where the wisest of the Philosophers concur with us so Universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The belief of this was the Foundation of those Excellent Discourses which were written by these Antient Sages; and therefore we may find the Immortality of the Soul, and a Future State continually Inculcated, by the greatest of them; this too was the ground of that greatness of Mind, that Justice, Courage, Temperance, and

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62293:167"/>
I have shewn already <note n="*" place="bottom">Sup. pag. 26, 27,</note> that among other things which prove the unlawfulness of <hi>Self-murther,</hi> 'tis a greater Crime in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Publick than the Murther of <hi>another Man;</hi> because some satisfaction may be made for that, especially to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by the forfeiture of the Persons own Life, and by the terrour of his Example: But in <hi>Self-murther</hi> there can be nothing of this; the Offender evades all sensible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; he makes no Satisfaction consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for despising and breaking the Laws of his Country, and encouraging others to do so: He brings Horrour, Confusion, Infamy, (and Poverty often) upon his forsaken Family, and yet does it often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very Account, <hi>that he cannot be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd here,</hi> and therefore will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer in a more dreadful manner here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Thus I have considered the several Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the Word <hi>Liberty,</hi> as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for <hi>Self-murther;</hi> and shewed what that <hi>Liberty</hi> is in <hi>General,</hi> which Man has as to his own Actions: That no Evil which oppresses the Body can be destructive (while Reason remains) to the Liberty of the Soul: That no Sickness or Pain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62293:168"/>
can be any sign that God gives the Sufferer <hi>Liberty</hi> to destroy himself: That he who does so to obtain <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Ease</hi> from any such Evils, shall fall into a state of greater <hi>Slavery;</hi> and therefore that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> in what sense soever, is an <hi>unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretence for Self-murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I have gone through what I propos'd, laid down the Principles upon which I take <hi>Self-murther</hi> to be unlawful: Answer'd such Objections as I thought most strong against them; and withal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd those General Prejudices by which People are usually misled in this Matter: I will not trouble the Reader with any more particular view of what has been said; If he wants this, he may have it by turning back to the Contents.</p>
               <p>But hitherto we have been led only by Natural Reason; if the Principles which we have argued from, were brought to what is revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures, the unlawfulness of this Act would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear more Plainly: For as to <hi>God's Propriety in Man: There</hi> we may find in how wonderful a manner this is <hi>increas'd</hi> by the <hi>Death of our Crucifi'd Lord,</hi> who <hi>purchas'd</hi>

                  <hi>us</hi> by his Blood, made us <hi>Members</hi> of his Body, <hi>uniting us to Himself</hi> by his Holy Spirit: Thus too, as to the <hi>end of Humane Life; there our Reason</hi> is instructed what to believe, and our <hi>Wills</hi> what to do, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to obey accordingly by the <hi>assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the same Spirit:</hi> And although we may see <hi>there,</hi> that the best of Men, in the <hi>following of this End,</hi> shall be expos'd to great Afflictions, to Poverty, Sickness, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, nay sometimes to Death it self; yet we may <hi>see also</hi> the great <hi>advantages of such Sufferings,</hi> by the improvement of ourSouls, and the increase of our Reward: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, for the enabling us to undergo them in their worst Extremes; we have <hi>there</hi> set before us the most <hi>Excellent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of Patience, Constancy, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the <hi>meek and forgiving Son of God:</hi> What Contempt or Disgrace, what Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Body</hi> could ever equal what <hi>He</hi> Suffer'd in his Death? What Sorrow and Anxiety, what Torments of the <hi>Mind,</hi> could ever be compar'd to what <hi>He</hi> felt in the <hi>Garden,</hi> and yet with what Duty and Resignation did <hi>He</hi> submit to all? <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible let this Cup pass from Me; nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt.</hi> These Blessed Words alone, if rightly consider'd,

might afford, in what Circumstances soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the most Sovereign Preservative against this dreadful crime of <hi>Self-murther.</hi> But Arguments of this kind may (if it be found necessary) be insisted upon more conveniently hereafter.</p>
