            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is but a very little time since you met together in this place to lament the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of a <hi>raging pestilence,</hi> which the last year destroyed so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand inhabitants of the late great and famous City: and now <hi>God</hi> hath given us another sad occasion for our <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>devouring fire</hi> to break forth and consume so many of her habitations. As though the infected air had been too kind and partial, and like <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> had only destroyed <hi>the vile and refuse,</hi> and spared <hi>the greatest of the people;</hi> as though the grave had surfeited with the bodies of the dead, and were loth to go on in the execution of <hi>Gods</hi> displeasure; he hath imployed a more furious Element, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102516:3"/>
by its merciless and devouring flames might in a more lively manner represent unto us the <hi>kindling</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> against us. And that by a <hi>Fire,</hi> which began with that violence, and spread with that horrour, and raged with that fury, &amp; continued for so long a time with that irresistible force; that it might justly fill the beholders with confusion, the hearers of it with amazement, and all of us with a deep and humble sense of those sins which have brought down the judgements of <hi>God</hi> in so severe a manner in the midst of us.</p>
            <p>For whatever arguments or reasons we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that should compose the minds of men to a sense of their own or others calamities, or excite them to an apprehension of the <hi>wrath of God</hi> as the cause of them, or quicken them to an earnest suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him for mercy, they do all eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the sad occasion of this dayes solemnity. For if either compassion would move, or fear awaken, or interest engage us to any of these, it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there should be an instance of a more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, than that is which we this day bewail; For who can behold the ruines of so great a City, and not have his bowels of compassion moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it? Who can have any sense of the anger of God discovered in it, and not have his fear awakened by it? Who can (as we ought all) look upon it as a judgement of universal influence on the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not think himself concerned to implore the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102516:3"/>
mercy of Heaven towards us? For certainly, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may vainly flatter and deceive our selves, these are no common indications of the frowns of heaven; nor are they meerly intended as the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Gods</hi> severity towards that City which hath suffered so much by them; but the stroaks which fall upon the head (though they light upon that only) are designed for the punishment of the whole body.</p>
            <p>Were there nothing else but a bare permission of Divine Providence as to these things, we could not reasonably think, but that <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> must needs be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us, when he suffers two such dreadful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to tread almost upon each others heels; that no sooner had <hi>death</hi> taken away such multitudes of our inhabitants, but a <hi>Fire</hi> follows it to consume our habitations. A <hi>Fire,</hi> so dreadfull in its appearance, in its rage and fury, and in all the dismal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it (which we cannot yet be sufficiently apprehensive of) that on that very account we may justly <hi>lie down in our shame, and our confusion cover us:</hi> because <hi>God hath covered the daughter of Sion with a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven to earth the beauty of</hi> Israel, <hi>and remembred not his footstool in the day of his anger.</hi> For such was the violence and fury of the <hi>flames,</hi> that they have not only defaced the beauty of the City, and humbled the pride and grandeur of it; not only stained its glory, and consumed its palaces; but have made the Houses of <hi>God</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a heap of ruines, and a spectacle of desolation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102516:4"/>
And what then can we propose to our selves as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Gods</hi> severe displeasure against us, which we have not either already felt, or have just cause to fear are coming upon us without a speedy and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere amendment? If a Sword abroad and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at home, if Fire in our Houses and Death in our Streets, if Forreign Wars and Domestick Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if a languishing State and a discontented People, if the ruines of the City and poverty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, may make us sensible how sad our condition at present is, how much worse it may be (if <hi>God</hi> in his mercy prevent it not) we shall all surely think we have reason enough this day to lay to heart <hi>the evil of our doings which have brought all these things upon us, and abhor our selves, repenting in dust and ashes.</hi> That would seem indeed to bear some analogy with the present ruines of the City, and the calamities we lie under at this time; but <hi>God</hi> will more easily dispense with the pompous shews, and solemn garbs of our humiliation; if our hearts bleed within for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impieties, and our repentance discovers its sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erity, by bringing us to that temper; that, <hi>though we have done iniquity, we will do so no more.</hi> That is the true and proper end, which <hi>Almighty God</hi> aims at, in all his Judgements: he takes no delight in hurling the world into confusions, and turning Cities into ruinous heaps, and making whole Countries a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: but when he sees it necessary to vindicate the honour of his Justice to the world, he doth it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102516:4"/>
with that <hi>severity</hi> that may make us apprehend his displeasure, and yet with that <hi>mercy</hi> which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to repent and <hi>return unto the Lord.</hi> Thus we find in the instances recorded in the Text, when some <hi>Cities</hi> were <hi>consumed by him;</hi> so that as far as concerned them, they were made <hi>like to Sodom and Gomorrah:</hi> yet he doth it with that kindness to the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> that <hi>they are pluckt as firebrands out of the burning:</hi> and therefore he looks upon it as a frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the design both of his <hi>Justice,</hi> and of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> when he is fain to conclude with that sad reflection on their incorrigibleness; <hi>Yet have ye not returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me saith the Lord.</hi> Thus ye see what the design and scope of the words is, which I have read unto you, wherein we may consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The severity of the Judgement which God was pleased to execute upon them. <hi>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The mixture of his mercy in the midst of his severity, <hi>and ye were as a firebrand pluckt out of the burning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The incorrigibleness of the people notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing both. <hi>Yet have ye not, &amp;c.</hi> In the first we have <hi>Gods Rod</hi> lifted up to <hi>strike,</hi> in the second we have <hi>Gods Hand</hi> stretched out to <hi>save,</hi> yet neither of these would make them sensible of their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; though their <hi>Cities</hi> were <hi>overthrown</hi> for <hi>their sakes,</hi> though they themselves escaped not <hi>for their own sakes,</hi> but for his <hi>mercies sake</hi> only whom they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102516:5"/>
had so highly provoked; <hi>yet have ye not returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, saith the Lord.</hi> I am sure I may say of the two former parts of the Text, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case, <hi>This day hath this Scripture been fulfilled among you:</hi> we have seen a sad instance of <hi>Gods severity, a City</hi> almost wholly <hi>consumed</hi> as <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> and a great expression of his kindness, <hi>the Inhabitants saved, as firebrands pluckt out of the burning:</hi> O let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be said that the last part of the words is fulfilled too, <hi>Yet have ye not returned unto me, &amp;c.</hi> which, that it may not be, I shall first consider <hi>the severity of God in his judgement</hi> this day, and then discover <hi>the mixture of his kindness with it,</hi> and the result of both will be the <hi>unreasonableness of obstinate disobedience</hi> after them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The severity of the Judgement</hi> here expressed: which though we take it not in reference to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men, but to the Cities wherein they dwelt: as it seems to be understood not only by the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> wherein the words relating to persons are left out: but by the following clause, expressing their preservation: yet we shall find the Judgement to be severe enough, in regard 1. Of the <hi>nature and kind</hi> of it. 2. The <hi>series and order</hi> of it. 3. The <hi>causes</hi> moving to it. 4. The <hi>Author</hi> of it. <hi>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The nature and kind of it:</hi> We can imagine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more severe when we consider what it is set forth by, the most unparalleld Judgement we read of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> by a fire
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102516:5"/>
from Heaven. Although in all circumstances the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance might not come up to the parallel, yet in several respects there might be so sad a desolation, that any other example but that might fall beneath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and severity of it. And we may better understand of how sad and dreadfull a nature such a Judgement must be, if we consider it with relation to the <hi>sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unexpectedness</hi> of it, to the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of it, and to all that <hi>sad train of circumstances</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and follow it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The suddenness and unexpectedness</hi> of it; <hi>as God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw Sodom and Gomorrah, i. e.</hi> when they least of all looked for such a desolation. For <hi>thus it was in the</hi>

               <hi>as if all things went well with them; and were like to do so.</hi> They thought God could not possibly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish such a people as they were in such a manner; they could easily have believed it of any other people but themselves: but that <hi>God</hi> should punish his own people in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, that Judgement should begin at the house of <hi>God,</hi> that they who had loved to be called by his name, should be made examples to all other Nations; this seemed so harsh &amp; incredible that by no means could they entertain it. But <hi>God</hi> &amp; Wise men too thought otherwise of them than they did of themselves: they could not but see an outward shew of Religion joyned with a deep and subtil hypocrisie; there being among them an heap of pride and luxury, of fraud and injustice, of sedition and faction guilded over with a fair shew of greater zeal for <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Glory:</hi> which that impartial Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (as one who knew them well) hath described at large: and although they could not believe that such heavy Judgements should befall them, yet others did not only <hi>believe,</hi> but <hi>tremble</hi> at the apprehensions of them.</p>
            <p>Who among all the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> could have been perswaded, but the day before the <hi>Fire</hi> brake out, nay when they saw the <hi>flames</hi> for near a day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that ever in four days time, not a fourth part of the City should be left standing? For when were they ever more secure &amp; inapprehensive of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than at this time? they had not been long return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102516:6"/>
to their Houses, which the <hi>Plague</hi> had driven them from, and now they hoped to make some amends for the loss of their Trade before; but they returned home with the same sins they carryed away with them; like new <hi>Moons,</hi> they had a new face and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but the same <hi>spots</hi> remained still: or it may be, increased by that <hi>scumm</hi> they had gathered in the Countries where they had been. Like Beasts of prey that had been chained up so long till they were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-bitten, when they once got loose they ran with that violence and greediness to their wayes of gain, as though nothing could ever satisfie them. But that which betrayed them to so much security, was their late deliverance from so sweeping a Judgement as the <hi>Plague</hi> had been to the City and Suburbs of it: they could by no means think, when they had all so lately escaped the <hi>Grave,</hi> that the City it self should be so near being buried in its own ruines; that the <hi>fire</hi> which had missed their blood should seize upon their houses; that there should be no other way to purge the infected air, but by the <hi>flames</hi> of the whole City. Thus when the Mariners have newly escaped a wreck at Sea, the fears of which have a long time deprived them of their wonted rest, they think they may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely lye down and sleep, till it may be another storm overtake and sink them. We see then there is neither piety nor wisdom in so much security when a great danger is over, for we know not but that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry security it self may provoke <hi>God</hi> to send a greater.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102516:7"/>
And no kind of judgements are so dreadful and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing, as those which come most unexpectedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men; for these betray the succours which reason offers, they infatuate mens councils, weaken their courage, and deprive them of that presence of mind which is necessary at such a time for their own and the publick interest. And there needs no more to let us know how severe such a Judgement must be when it comes upon men in so sudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a manner; but that is not all, for the severity of it lyes further,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the force and violence of it:</hi> and surely that was very great which consumed four Cities to nothing in so short a time, when <hi>God</hi> did <hi>pluere Gehennam de coelo</hi> as one expresses it, rained down <hi>hell-fire upon</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah. And this is that which some think is called <hi>the vengeance of eternal fire, which all those in</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>are said to suffer;</hi> i. e. <hi>a Fire</hi> which consumed, till there was nothing left to <note place="margin">Jude 7.</note> be consumed by it. Not but that those wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did justly suffer the <hi>vengeance of an eternal fire</hi> in another life, but the <hi>Apostle</hi> seems to set out and paint forth to us that in the life to come, by the force and violence of that <hi>fire</hi> which destroyed those Cities; and it would be harsh to say, that all who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in that common calamity (who yet were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as to the great abominations of those places, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Infants</hi> there destroyed) must be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sentenced to eternal misery. But although <hi>God</hi> since
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102516:7"/>
that perpetual monument of his justice in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those Cities hath not by such an immediate fire from Heaven consumed and razed out the very foundations of other Cities; yet at some times there are <hi>fires</hi> which break out and rage with a more than ordinary violence, and will not yield to those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for quenching them, which at other times may be attended with great success. Such might that great fire in <hi>Rome</hi> be in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, which whether begun <hi>casually,</hi> or by <hi>design</hi> (which was disputed then, as it hath been about others since) did presently spread it self with greater speed over the <hi>Cirque</hi> (as the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <note place="margin">

Such likewise might those two great <hi>fires</hi> have been which have formerly burnt down great part of the then City of <hi>London;</hi> but neither of them come near the dreadfulness of this, considering how much bigger the habitations of the City were now, and how much greater the riches of it then could be imagined at those times. How great must we conceive the force of this Fire to have been, which having at first gotten a head where there was little means of resisting it, and much fuel to increase it; from thence it spread it self both with and against the wind; till it had gained so considerable a force, that it despised all the resistance could be made by the strength of the buildings which stood in its way; and when it had once subdued the strongest and the tallest of them, it then roared like the waves of the sea, and made its way through all the lesser obstacles, and might have gone on so far, till it had laid this <hi>City</hi> levell with the ruines of the other, had not he

who sets the bounds to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and saith, <hi>thus far shalt thou go and no further,</hi> put a stop to it in those places which were as ready to have yielded up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the rage of it, as any which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The severity of it will yet more appear from all <hi>the dreadful circumstances which attend and follow it.</hi> Could you suppose your selves in the midst of those Cities which were consumed by <hi>Fire</hi> from heaven, when it had seized upon their dwellings, O what cryes and lamentations, what yellings and shriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might ye then have heard among them! We may well think how dreadful those were, when we do but consider how sad the circumstances were of the <hi>fire</hi> we mourn for this day. When it began like <hi>Sampson</hi> to break in pieces all the means of resisting it, and carryed before it not only the <hi>Gates,</hi> but the <hi>Churches</hi> and most <hi>magnificent structures</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> what horrour and confusion may we then imagine had seized upon the spirits of the <hi>Citizens;</hi> what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction in their councils, what paleness in their countenances, what pantings at their hearts, what an universal consternation might have been then seen upon the minds of men? But O the sighs and tears, the frights and amazements, the miscarriages, nay the deaths of some of the weaker Sex at the terrour and apprehension of it! O the hurry and useless pains, the alarms and tumults, the mutual hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of each other that were among men at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102516:9"/>
the rage and fury of it! There we might have seen Women weeping for their children, for fear of their being trod down in the press, or lost in the crowd of people, or exposed to the violence of the flames; Husbands more solicitous for the safety of their Wives and Children, than their own; the Souldiers running to their swords, when there was more need of Buckets; the Tradesmen loading their backs with that which had gotten possession of their hearts before. Then we might have heard some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining thus of themselves: O that I had been as carefull of laying up treasures in Heaven as I have been upon Earth, I had not been under such fears of losing them as now I am! If I had served <hi>God</hi> as faithfully as I have done the world, he would never have left me as now that is like to do. What a fool have I been which have spent all my pretious time for the gaining of that which may be now lost in an hours time! If these flames be so dreadful, what are those which are reserved for them who love the world more than <hi>God!</hi> If none can come near the <hi>heat</hi> of this <hi>Fire,</hi> who can dwell with <hi>everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings!</hi> O what madness then will it be to sin any more wilfully against that <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>a consuming fire,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more dreadful than this can be! Farewell then all ye deceitful vanities: now I understand thee and my self better, O bewitching world, then to fix my happiness in thee any more. I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth learn so much wisdom to lay up my treasures
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102516:9"/>
there where neither moths can corrupt them, nor Thieves steal them, nor Fire consume them. O how happy would <hi>London</hi> be, if this were the effect of her flames on the minds of all her inhabitants! She might then rise with a greater glory, and her inward beauty would outshine her outward splendour, let it be as great as we can wish or imagine.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time who can behold her present ruines, without paying some tears as due to the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the spectacle, and more to the sins which caused them? If that City were able to speak out of its ruines, what sad complaints would it make of all those impieties which have made her so miserable. If it had not been (might she say) for the pride and luxury, the ease and delicacy of some of my inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the covetousness, the fraud, the injustice of others, the debaucheries of the prophane, the open factions and secret hypocrisie of too many pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to greater sanctity, my <hi>beauty</hi> had not been thus <hi>turned into ashes,</hi> nor my glory into those ruines which make my enemies rejoyce, my friends to mourn, and all stand amazed at the beholding of them. Look now upon me, you who so lately admired the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my trade, the riches of my Merchants, the number of my people, the conveniency of my <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> the multitude of my Streets, and see what deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations sin hath made in the earth. Look upon me, and then tell me whether it be nothing to dally with Heaven, to make a mock at sin, to slight the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102516:10"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> and abuse his mercies, and after all the attempts of Heaven to reclaim a people from their sins, to remain still the same that ever they were? Was there no way to expiate your guilt but by my misery? Had the <hi>Leprosie</hi> of your sins so fretted into my Walls, that there was no cleansing them, but by the flames which consume them? Must I mourn in <hi>my dust and ashes</hi> for your iniquities, while you are so ready to return to the practice of them? Have I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so much by reason of <hi>them,</hi> and do you think to escape your selves? Can you then look upon my ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines with hearts as hard and unconcerned as the <hi>stones</hi> which lye in them? If you have any kindness for me, or for your selves, if you ever hope to see my breaches repaired, my beauty restored, my glory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, look on <hi>Londons</hi> ruines and <hi>repent.</hi> Thus would she bid her inhabitants not weep for her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, but for their own sins; for if <hi>never any sorrow were like to her sorrow,</hi> it is because never any sins were like to their sins. Not as though they were only the sins of the City, which have brought this evil upon her; no, but as far as the judgement reaches, so great hath the compass of the sins been, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>God</hi> to make her an example of his justice. And I fear the effects of <hi>Londons</hi> calamity will be felt all the Nation over. For, considering the present lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing condition of this Nation, it will be no easie matter to recover the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> which have been lost by this <hi>Fire.</hi> So that whether we consider
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102516:10"/>
the sadness of those circumstances which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the rage of the fire, or those which respect the present miseries of the City, or the general influence those will have upon the Nation, we cannot easily conceive what judgement could in so <hi>critical</hi> a time have befallen us, which had been more severe for the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of it, than this hath been.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

So this <hi>Prophet</hi> tels us, that the true account of all <hi>Gods</hi> punishments is to be fetched from the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> Amos 1. 3. <hi>For three trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of</hi> Damascus, <hi>and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof:</hi> so it is said of <hi>Gaza, v. 6.</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, v. 9.</hi> of <hi>Edom, v.</hi> 11. of <hi>Ammon, v.</hi> 13. <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. 1. <hi>Judah, v. 4.</hi> and at last <hi>Israel, v. 6.</hi> And it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable of every one of these, that when <hi>God</hi> threatens to punish them for the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>iniquities,</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102516:12"/>
the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>transgressions,</hi> (which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed to be meant by the <hi>three transgressions and the four)</hi> he doth particularly threaten to send a <hi>fire</hi> among them to consume the Houses and the Palaces of their Cities. So to <hi>Damascus,</hi> chap. 1. 4. to <hi>Gaza,</hi> v. 7. to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 10. to <hi>Edom,</hi> v. 12. to <hi>Ammon,</hi> v. 14. to <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. v. 2. to <hi>Judah,</hi> v. 5. <hi>I will send a fire upon</hi> Judah, <hi>and it shall devour the Palaces of Jerusalem:</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in the words of the text. This is a judgement then, which when it comes in its <hi>fury,</hi> gives us notice to how great a height our sins are risen; especially when it hath so many dreadful fore-runners, as it had in <hi>Israel,</hi> and hath had among our selves. When the <hi>red horse</hi> hath marched furiously before it all <hi>bloody</hi> with the <hi>effects</hi> of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and the <hi>pale horse</hi> hath followed after the other with <hi>Death</hi> upon his back, and the <hi>Grave</hi> at his heels, and after both these, those come, <hi>out of whose mouth issues fire, and smoak, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> it is then time for the inhabitants of the earth, <hi>to repent of the work of their hands.</hi> But it is our great unhappiness that we are apt to impute these great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to any thing rather than to our <hi>sins;</hi> and thereby we hinder our selves from the true remedy, because we will not understand the cause of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper. Though <hi>God</hi> hath not sent <hi>Prophets</hi> among us, to tell us for such and such sins, I will send such and such judgements upon you, yet where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the parallel between the <hi>sins</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> agreeable with what we find recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102516:12"/>
we have reason to say that those sins were not only the <hi>antecedents,</hi> but the <hi>causes</hi> of those punishments which followed after them. And that because the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of punishment was not built upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar relation between <hi>God</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> but upon reasons common to all mankind; yet with this difference, that the greater the mercies were which any people enjoyed, the sooner was the measure of their iniquities filled up, and the severer were the judgements when they came upon them. This our <hi>Prophet</hi> gives an account of, Chap. 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Nations of the earth, therefore will</hi> I <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you for your iniquities.</hi> So did <hi>God</hi> punish <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> as well as <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, he would punish them sooner, he would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them more severely. I wish we could be brought once to consider what influence <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> hath upon the good of a Nation, if we did, we should not only live better our selves, but our <hi>Kingdom &amp; Nation</hi> might flourish more than otherwise we are like to see it do. Which is a truth hath been so universally received among the wise Men of all ages, that one of the <hi>Roman Historians,</hi> though of no very severe life himself, yet imputes the decay of the <hi>Roman State,</hi> not to Chance or Fortune, or some unhidden causes (which the <hi>Atheism</hi> of our age would presently do) but to the general loosness of mens lives, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their manners. And it was the grave Observation of one of the bravest <hi>Captains</hi> ever the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102516:13"/>

They are our <hi>sins</hi> which have drawn so much of our blood, and infected our air, and added the greatest fuell to our flames.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough in general to declaim against our <hi>sins,</hi> but we must search out particularly those predominant vices, which by their <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi> have provoked <hi>God</hi> thus to punish us; and as we have hitherto observed a parallel between the <hi>Judgements</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in this Chapter, and our <hi>own:</hi> So I am afraid we shall find too sad a parallel between <hi>their sins</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> too. Three sorts of <hi>sins</hi> are here spoken of in a peculiar manner, as the causes of their severe punishments, Their <hi>luxury and intemperance,</hi> their <hi>covetousness and oppression,</hi> and <hi>their contempt of God and his Laws,</hi> and I doubt we need not make a very exact <hi>scrutiny</hi> to find out these in a high degree among our selves: and I wish it were as easie to reform them, as to find them out.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Luxury and intemperance;</hi> that we meet with in the first verse, both in the compellation, <hi>Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, and in their behaviour, <hi>which say to their Masters, bring, and let us drink. Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, <hi>Loquitur ad principes Israel &amp; optimates quosque decem Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buum,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom,</hi> he speaks to the <hi>Princes of</hi>

Israel, <hi>and the chief of all the ten Tribes;</hi> Those which are fed in the richest pastures, such as those of <hi>Bashan</hi> were. Who are more fully described by the <hi>Prophet</hi> in his sixth chapter. They are the men <hi>who are at ease in Sion,</hi> v. 1. <hi>they put far away from them the evil day,</hi> v. 3. <hi>they lye upon beds of Ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the midst of the stall,</hi> v. 4. <hi>they chaunt to the sound of the Viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick like</hi> David, v. 5. <hi>they drink Wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oyntments, but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joseph. The meaning of all which is, they minded nothing but ease, softness, and pleasure, but could not endure to hear of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which were so near them. Nothing but mirth, and jollity, and riot, and feasting, and the evil consequences of these were to be seen or heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Their delicate souls were presently ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled and disturbed at the discourse of any thing but matters of Courtship, address and entertainment. Any thing that was grave and serious, though never so necessary, and of the greatest importance, was put off, as <hi>Felix</hi> put off S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> to a more convenient time: especially if it threatned miseries to them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with a countenance sadder than their own. These were the <hi>Kine of Bashan,</hi> who were full of ease and wantonness, and never thought of the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>slaughter,</hi> which the other were the certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of. <hi>Symmachus</hi> renders it, <gap reason="foreign">

which others apply to <hi>the rich Citizens of Samaria,</hi> I am afraid we may take it in either sense without a <hi>Soloecism. Bring and let us drink,</hi> which as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Hierom</hi> goes on, <hi>ebrietatem significat in vino &amp; luxuria quae sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mentis evertunt, it implies the height of their luxury and intemperance.</hi> It is observed by some, that our <hi>Prophet</hi> retatins still the language of his education in the bluntness of his expressions, <hi>the great men</hi> that lived <hi>wholly</hi> at their <hi>ease,</hi> in wantonness and luxury, he styles like <hi>the heardsman of</hi> Tekoa, <hi>the Kine of</hi> Bashan. That he thought was title good enough for such who seemed to have <hi>souls</hi> for no other end, than the other had. And hath not that <hi>delicata insania,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> calls it, that soft and effeminate kind of madness taken possession of too many among us, whose birth and education designed them for more manly imployments? yea, what an age of <hi>Luxury</hi> do we live in, when instead of those noble characters of men from their vertue, and wisdom, and courage, it is looked on among some as a mighty character of a person, that <hi>he eats and drinks well:</hi> a <hi>character</hi> that becomes none so much as the <hi>Kine</hi> of <hi>Bashan</hi> in the literal sense, for surely they did so, or else they had never been in so much esteem among the <hi>heardsmen of Tokoa.</hi> A <hi>character</hi> which those <hi>Philosophers</hi> would have been ashamed of, who looked upon no other end of humane life but <hi>pleasure;</hi> but in order to that, they thought nothing more necessary than <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>sobriety;</hi> but whatever esteem they had then,

they have lost all their reputation among our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Epicures,</hi> who know of no such things as <hi>pleasures</hi> of <hi>the mind,</hi> and would not much value whether they had any <hi>faculties</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> or no, unless it were for the contrivance of new oaths and debaucheries. But if this were only among some few persons, we hope the whole Nation would not suffer for their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: for scarce any age hath been so happy, but it hath had some <hi>monsters</hi> in <hi>Morality</hi> as well as <hi>Nature.</hi> But I am afraid these vices are grown too <hi>Epidemical;</hi> not only in the <hi>City,</hi> but the <hi>Countries</hi> too; what mean else those frequent complaints (and I hope more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral then the causes of them) that the houses of <hi>great men</hi> in too many places are so near being <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick schools</hi> of <hi>debauchery,</hi> rather than of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> where men shall not want instructers to teach them to <hi>forget</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>themselves;</hi> wherein <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> is so far from being accounted a matter of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> that the rules of the <hi>Persian</hi> civility are quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and <hi>men</hi> are <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>unman</hi> themselves. I know nothing would tend more to the honour of our Nation, or the advantage of it, then if once these publick excesses were severely restrained, I do not mean so much by making new <hi>Laws,</hi> (for those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do but exercise peoples Wits by finding out new evasions) but by executing old ones.</p>

And if there be not so much of open violence in our dayes, the thanks are due to the care of our <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and the severity of our <hi>Laws,</hi> but it is hard to say whether ever any age produced more studious and skilful to pervert the design of <hi>Laws,</hi> without breaking the letter of them, than this of ours hath done.

If their enquiries were deeper, their reason stronger, or their arguments more perswasive, than of those who have made it their utmost care and business to search into these things, they ought to be allowed a fair hearing; but for men who pretend to none of these things, yet still to make Religion the object of their <hi>scoffs</hi> and <hi>raillery,</hi> doth not become the gravity of a Nation professing wisdom to permit it, much less the sobriety of a people professing <hi>Christianity.</hi> In the mean time such persons may know that wise men may be argued out of a <hi>Religion</hi> they own, but

none but <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>mad men</hi> will be <hi>droll'd</hi> out of it.

But while this is so prevailing a <hi>humour</hi> among the vain men of this Age and Nation, what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but that <hi>God</hi> should by remarkable and severe judgements, seek to make men more serious in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or else make their <hi>hearts to ake,</hi> and their <hi>joynts to tremble,</hi> as he did <hi>Belshazzars,</hi> when he could find nothing else to carouse in but the <hi>vessels</hi> of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And when men said in the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi>

Divine Justice, when he hath determined <hi>to visit their transgressions with rods,</hi> and <hi>their iniquities with stripes.</hi> But when he doth all this, yet his <hi>loving kindness doth he not utterly take from them:</hi> for in the midst of all his judgements he is pleased to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mercy; of which we have a remarkable instance in the Text, for when <hi>God</hi> was overthrowing Cities, <hi>yet he pluckt the inhabitants as firebrands out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and so I come from the <hi>severity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>

said, that neither judgements nor kindness will work upon us: that neither our deliverance from the <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> which <hi>walks in darkness,</hi> nor from the <hi>flames</hi> which shine as the <hi>noon-day,</hi> will awaken us from that <hi>Lethargy</hi> and security we are in by our sins: but let <hi>God</hi> take what course he pleases with us, we are the same incorrigible people still that ever we were. For we have cause enough for our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamentation this day, (if <hi>God</hi> had not sent new calamities upon us) that we were no better for those we had undergone before. We have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted with mercies, and grown sick of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heaven to us, and when <hi>God</hi> hath made us smart for our fulness and wantonness, then we grew sullen and murmured and disputed against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and were willing to do any thing but repent of our sins and reform our lives. It is not many years since <hi>God</hi> blessed us with great and undeserved blessings, which we then thought our selves very thankful for; but if we had been really so, we should never have provoked him who bestowed those favours upon us in so great a degree as we have done since. Was this our requital to <hi>him</hi> for restoring our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> to <hi>rebell</hi> the more against Heaven? Was this our thankfulness, for removing the <hi>disorders</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> to bring them into our <hi>lives?</hi> Had we no other way of trying the continuance of <hi>Gods goodness</hi> to us, but by exercising his patience by our greater provocations? As though we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

to let the world see, there could be a more unthankful and disobedient people than the <hi>Jews</hi> had been. Thus we sinned with as much security and confidence, as though we had blinded the eyes, or bribed the justice, or commanded the power of Heaven: When <hi>God</hi> of a sudden like one highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked drew forth the sword of his destroying <hi>Angel,</hi> and by it cut off so many thousands in the midst of us. Then we fell upon our knees, and begg'd the mercy of Heaven that our lives might be spared, that we might have time to amend them: but no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did our fears abate, but our devotion did so too, we had soon forgotten the promises we made in the day of our distress, and I am afraid it is at this day too true of us which is said in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of those who had escaped the several plagues which so many had been destroyed by. <hi>And the rest of the</hi>

               <hi>men which were not killed by these Plagues, yet repented not of the work of their hands.</hi> For if we had not gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily suckt in again the poison we had only laid down while we were begging for our lives, if we had not returned with as great fury and violence as ever to our former lusts, the removing of one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not been as it were only to make way for the coming on of another. For the <hi>grave</hi> seemed to close up her mouth, and <hi>death</hi> by degrees to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself, that the <hi>Fire might</hi> come upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> to act its part too in the <hi>Tragoedy</hi> our sins have made among us: and I pray <hi>God</hi> this may be the

last <hi>Act</hi> of it. Let us not then provoke <hi>God</hi> to find out new methods of vengeance, and make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us of what other unheard of severities may do for our cure. But let us rather meet <hi>God</hi> now by our repentance, and returning to him, by our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humiliation for our former sins, and our sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast resolutions to return no more to the practice of them. That, that much more dangerous <hi>infection</hi> of our souls may be cured as well as that of our bodies, that the impure <hi>flames</hi> which burn within may be extinguished, that all our <hi>luxuries</hi> may be retrenched, our debaucheries punished, our vanities taken away, our careless indifferency in Religion turned into a greater seriousness both in the profession and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of it. So will <hi>God</hi> make us a happy and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, when he finds us a more righteous and holy Nation. So will <hi>God</hi> succeed all your endeavours for the honour and interest of that people whom you represent. So may he add that other Title to the rest of those you have deserved for your Countries good, to make you <hi>Repairers of the breaches of the City</hi> as well as of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>restorers of paths to dwell in:</hi> So may that <hi>City</hi> which now sits solitary like a <hi>Widow,</hi> have her tears wiped off, and her beauty and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness restored unto her. Yea so may her present ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, in which she now lyes <hi>buried,</hi> be only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of a more joyfull <hi>resurrection.</hi> In which though the <hi>body</hi> may remain the <hi>same,</hi> the <hi>qualities</hi> may be so altered, that its present desolation may be

only the puting off its former inconveniencies, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and deformities, that it may rise with greater glory, strength and proportion: and to all her other qualities, may that of <hi>incorruption</hi> be added too, at least till the general conflagration. And I know your great <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> will take care, that those who have suffered by the ruines, may not likewise suffer by the rising of it, that the glory of the <hi>City</hi> may not be laid upon the <hi>tears</hi> of the <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> but that its foundations may be setled upon Justice and Piety. That there be no complaining in the Streets for want of righteousness, nor in the City for want of <hi>Churches,</hi> nor in the <hi>Churches</hi> for want of a setled maintenance. That those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the service of <hi>God</hi> in them may never be tempted to betray their Consciences to gain a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, nor to comply with the factious humors of men that they may be able to live among them. And thus when the City through the blessing of Heaven shall be built again, may it be a habitation of <hi>Holiness</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> towards our <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King and his Successours,</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> towards men, of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> among all the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> till not Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries only, but the World and time it self shall be no more. Which <hi>God</hi> of his infinite mercy grant through the merits and mediation of his <hi>Son,</hi> to whom with the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Eternal spirit,</hi> be all Honour and Glory for evermore.</p>
