            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

other, are stollen away (so much as the Lord permite) from all true allegeance and obedience to our Lord Iesus Christ and his Anoinced, to ioyne themselves to the Church of Rome, to the endlesse perdition both of their soules and bodies. This also is as evident, that this is wrought principally by this subtiltie of the old Serpent: That they in that Church haue moe holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and doe also spend much more time therein, than wee in ours.</p>
            <p>By this enchantment amongst others, Satan and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seeke to deuoure not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes houses alone, as those did in the dayes of our Sauiour; but in time to swallow us all up quicke unlesse our mightie God stid deliver us from their iawes, as hither to he hath done.
<pb facs="tcp:19935:3"/>
Considering therefore how the Romish Seducers swarme in everie place, to the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of all the Churches and people of the Lord, &amp; even this our nation amongst the rest; and having heard more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over (by one of speciall note in<note place="margin">D.

mercie beene pleased to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe unto me in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>This also the rather, for that he having long agoe put this verie same care into my heart, to seeke hereby as much to save us all, as they doe to destroy us all, hath now much more enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, with an ardent studie hereof: upon this religious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and most honourable desire of those great Personages, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to me againe and againe, and that in Gods speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as I have taken it, to stir me up more earnestly hereunto. Let me therefore herein (right noble and worthie Ladies) hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg pardon, if I presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your truly renowned courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and tender and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, to be more than ordinarie in this my dedication to your Honours, upon this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb facs="tcp:19935:4"/>
and extraordinarie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, from this intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting of the common Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, and the pitifull deluding and destroying of multitudes of poore unstable soules, and also the endangering of us all, to lie open daily more and more unto the butcherly cruelties of Rome, when they have thorowly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way, by drawing enow unto their part, through this and other their cunning stratagems and strong delusions. Grant me leaue (deare Ladies) I beseech you (though a thing unusuall in such dedications, which are wont usually to bee verie briefe; yet (to manifest my long studie and earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire for the sauing of such of our brethren and sisters, as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered<note place="margin">Rom. 9 2. 2 Sam. 5. 1.</note> to be destroyed by this and the like subtilties of Satan)
<pb facs="tcp:19935:5"/>
to helpe hereby, and by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant prayers for them, to pull some of them backe againe from the subtill Serpent, unto our Lord Iesus Christ; and withall to keepe others from falling away from him, even so many of them as belong to the election of grace, and to leave the rest of them more without excuse. Now is the time that <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels strive specially<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 7.</note> against the Dragon and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, about the whole bodie of his Church. Now is the time, that our Lord Iesus lookes for us all to helpe him and his poore Church, to remember our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme vow in a speciall manner, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I haue therefore presumed upon the occasion of that their
<pb facs="tcp:19935:5"/>
right Christian and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration, to write a generall Epistle to all the plaine and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted people of our land, seduced by those deceiuers, or in danger thereof: and not onely to them, but to all sorts: That all may take the better notice of the delusions of Poperie, the difference betweene the devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Romish Synagogue, and of the true Church of Christ, and to make fully known unto them all, that they must all either renounce Poperie, and professe the Gospell with us, or else professe themselues therein to be of Satan, and to stand for his religion against our Lord Iesus Christ. That thus all may get out of Baby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>on, seeke to save themselves, and helpe to pull out and save all others.</p>
            <p>And so much the rather, for
<pb facs="tcp:19935:6"/>
that this verie service hath beene required of me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by a truly religious, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and ancient professour of Christs Gospell, in the behalfe of a great and honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who hath beene drawen away by this same delusion prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; to wit, <hi>That they have moe holy devotions in their Church, than wee in ours, and doe spend more time therein.</hi> Whereupon hee requested mee to write some Epistle, to helpe to reclaime her, and to bring her backe againe unto us. Which service or a greater I could not well denie, as God should bee pleased to vouchsafe mee abilitie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, especially hauing beene long obliged by his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent loue, though the unablest of thousand others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19935:6"/>And moreouer, for that I have likewise stood for many yeeres (after a sort) bound by promise, for the verie like ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in effect unto a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, much respected generally of all that are affected to that Romish Religion, for his speciall devotion in that superstitious kinde; one worthie indeed to be duely respected of all, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his good parts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, learning, and also descent, if the Lord shall bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to shew him that mercie to reclaime and bring him backe into the bosome of his owne true Church and people againe.</p>
            <p>This have I therefore more heartily wished to accomplish, not onely for that I have remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long thus bound by my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promise unto himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:19935:7"/>
(as after shall more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) but likewise for that I was specially obliged in dutie, both to his father, being a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Iudge of our Land, and in love to his eldest brother, who was a rare hope in his time, even in his tender yeeres (as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons house of Parliament could then have borne witnesse) if our God had beene pleased to have prolonged his daies. And this the more cheerefully also, for that the Lord had formerly shewed mercie on that his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brother, vouchsafing me, a poore and weake instrument, to helpe to pull him from Satan to Christ; out of deepe despaire, whereunto he had fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some part of their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even of <hi>Parsons Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the paines of hell, and to bring him to much assurance
<pb facs="tcp:19935:7"/>
and comfort in Iesus Christ, by the right use of a little part of ours, <hi>viz.</hi> of the practise of some directions in the first part of the <hi>True Watch.</hi> My trust is therefore that your Ladiships and all others will iudge my boldnesse to bee borne withall, though I thus presume, because I know assuredly, that you will not onely ioyne your hands, but your hearts to the reclaiming and saving of them both, and of all other so deluded, and even enchaunted with their sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that they themselves will most praise the Lord for this service, if ever hee shall thorowly open their eyes; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise without unfained turning and speedie preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, they will undoubtedly fall into a farre more forlorne and irrecoverable despaire,
<pb facs="tcp:19935:8"/>
when it will bee too late.</p>
            <p>And who knoweth how far this service may prevaile, being both thus requested and also promised; and now thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in all dutifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affection, and also in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse and singlenesse of heart towards them, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all other, as before our blessed God, who hath ever beene wont not onely to worke by the weakest and unlikeliest meanes, that himselfe alone may have all the glorie, but also to doe the greatest good to his Church, by the extremest rage, yea by the deepest and most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous plots of the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against it. Who knowes, whether his goodnesse may not make it an instrument, through your instant prayers, with the prayers and teares of many of
<pb facs="tcp:19935:8"/>
his people furthered by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to pull not them two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but with them likewise many thousands, yea hundred thousands from hell, and to bring them to heaven, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to keepe innumerable soules from ever declining from the Lord. Yea, what knoweth any one, whether he may not make it a meanes amongst others, to helpe to save us all, and with us, all Christs true Churches, from that common calamitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, which Satan and his Agents doe fully assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in time to bring upon them all, and upon all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord. Our bloudie enemies, having so resolved never to rest, untill, under the name of Heretiques, they have utterly rooted us all out, from off the face of the earth. My
<pb facs="tcp:19935:9"/>
trust is therefore (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable) that all who unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly love Christs Gospell, and the soules of these our deluded brethren and sisters, and desire the saving of the Church of God, will thinke it an acceptable service, to set before the eyes of all the world, the palpablenesse of this most notorious delusion: and to take away that forged imputation and shame from the true Church of Christ, and from all the Israel of God; viz. <hi>That our Adversaries of Rome have moe holy devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than we, and also doe spend more time therein, than we in ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accept then, I beseech your Honours, this poore service here now in this entrance into this fourth part of this <hi>Watch</hi> thus undertaken chiefly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of that most Christian desire of those great Ladies, to whom yet I durst not presume to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, being unknowne unto them: albeit I have heard much good concerning them, &amp; hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray that all heavenly graces may be ten times more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them, to their everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting praise &amp; happines.

<pb facs="tcp:19935:10"/>
of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to pull all Gods Elect out of the mouth of the roaring Lion.</p>
            <p>All may see (so farre as I am able to coniecture) that to bee true, which was mentioned, That the battle of the great day is come; That Satan hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and even visibly entred the field with his armies to fight against the Lords most glorious Maiestie and his Armies, even against all his poore Church at once; for that this spirituall warre is set on by his principall Commanders, the Pope and his Cardinals, with their chiefe Agents the Iesuites, and other Seminarie Priests, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and foughten by his most deadly weapons, lying and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Wee are therefore ever to keepe in memorie, that wee are
<pb facs="tcp:19935:10"/>
not now so much to labor to fight against flesh &amp; bloud, as against<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12.</note> principalities and powers, the Princes of the darknesse of this world, and to that end to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> with all the complete ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, both defensive and offensive.</p>
            <p>To this end, like as I have long travelled to helpe all our poore Countrey Schooles, and all of the inferiour sort, that the meanest of them, who will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to bee directed, might not need to feare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting of any, or of all the proudest Iesuites, in regard of laying a sure foundation of all good learning in our Grammar Schooles (with all sweet delight both to Master and Schollars) neither doth it repent me, but I blesse the God of heaven, that gave me a heart so to abase my
<pb facs="tcp:19935:11"/>
selfe; so have I here for all the poore people of the land, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prepare and fit them weapons against this great day. Which day all my labours will witnesse for me, that I have long feared, seeing the malice and rage of the Adversarie dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing more and more, with the increase of our iniquities to provoke the Lord to send it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, like as upon all the other Churches; to the end to make us all to seeke him by unfained repentance, &amp; that euerie one of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> may turne from our evill way unto his Covenant. That thus seeking him unfainedly, he may take our cause into his owne hand, fight his owne battles, and save us from these our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse enemies. The better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed sort of Christians, who are able to pray better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:19935:11"/>
need them not, I have therefore endevoured to fit them chiefly for all the younger and weaker sort, who would as faine learne to pray, to save themselves and the land with all the Churches, and long as much to be helpers in this worke, as any of those who are best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (deare Ladies) as you have so much reioyced in the former parts of this <hi>Watch,</hi> and to doe all things which may tend not onely to the saving of your selves, but also of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, and to make us a happie people; so I assure my selfe, that you will not disdaine these poore helps, though they bee composed in a plaine, easie, and homely stile; so as to leade the poorest by the hand, and to support their weaknesse, to
<pb facs="tcp:19935:12"/>
helpe to confirme weake hands and wearie knees, that all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may helpe together. It is not any painted (much lesse Players) eloquence, that will pacifie our blessed God, and defend us, or put to flight our proud Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. Wee have had a great while too much experience of that, in too many both of our Sermons and Prayers; no, no, it must bee the evidence and power of the word of the Lord, sent forth by the sighs and groanes of his holy Spirit, though all heavenly eloquence rightly used, be his most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift, and if ever, now speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be wished.

I humbly againe beseech you, if so much presuming upon your Ladiships patience, according to my assurance of your tender commiseration, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian humilitie, I have so farre passed the bounds of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Epistle in this matter of such extraordinarie moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, so nearely at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent concerning the safetie and happinesse of your Honours, and of all the people of the Lord. If I may (by the worthy ensamples of your honourable Ladiships) provoke other of your noble ranke and condition (as who have most leisure and best op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie) and so others of his servants and children to a holy emulation, seriously to meditate hereof, and to put all these in practise, onely so farre forth as his heavenly Maiestie cals all

Or if I may but helpe to awake such of his servants, as to whose view they shall be presented, to labour to be for all the rest, as the Angels for <hi>Lot,</hi> to pull all from Satan to our Lord Iesus Christ, and chiefly those of our owne native Countrey, who are so seduced by Antichrist, and by those who are sent abroad by him into the world to deceive, and to draw all to his part.</p>
            <p>Reade and consider, and so farre as your Ladiships shall clearely see our Lord Iesus Christ leading you by the hand, so farre follow him, doing as he directs you. So you shall not onely be sure to save your owne soules, but also helpe to save all

sorts, and more specially all the Honourable, and others; who either shall looke at, or heare of your worthie ensamples; yea, your native Countrey (as was said before) and all the true Churches of Christ, and shall in like manner be helpers, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all the remainder of his Elect, both Iewes and Gentiles, so to prepare the way to his most glorious comming.

you, in performing that service for you all, which hath beene requested at my hands, by such as wish much better to you, than you doe unto your selves. And that but only in these two things: First, in manifesting in what an estate and condition you presently stand, and so your danger eternally; and after, in helping to procure, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord may cry instantly and joyntly for you, that he may shew you mercie, in opening your eyes, to see how palpably you have suffered your selves to be deluded, and in plucking you out of the verie jawes of that old Serpent. Howsoever, for the present, you take it at my hands, yet y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time will come, as I certainly assure my soule, that you will either blesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> God of Heaven for the endevour of my ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards you, if it shall be available for you, or cry out against your selves, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wringing of your hands, and tearing of your haire, when it will be too late, and no more place found for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Vouchsafe me this favour, that being amongst the weakest of all my brethren, I may leave all matters of higher dispute, in maintaining the truth of Christ against the Iesuites and other Seminarie Priests, by whom you have beene so inchanted and abused, unto my more learned and reverend

brethren, who have alreadie entred the lists with them, and to others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in that kinde, whose bookes I acknowledge my selfe unworthie to beare; and that (sith what spare thoughts God hath vouchsafed mee from my necessarie calling, I have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially employed in this kinde, to helpe his people in holy meditations, and other like devotions) I may thus farre onely presume without offence: First, to put you in minde of your Baptisme vow, and Covenant made with our blessed God, from which you have so farre departed. And in the second place, to advertise you, that you may consider well upon what grounds you have departed. And finally, whither you are come. Whether by their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sleights you be not gotten under the verie banner of Satan, to fight even against our Lord and Saviour Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ, though you doe not imagine so much, but the cleane contrarie.</p>
            <p>In everie one of these therefore, I desire to deale lovingly, plainly, and ingenuously, as in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, before whom I stand: as he shall be pleased to assist mee with his grace, and according also to the weight of the businesse which wee have in hand, which concernes the saving of everie soule of you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19935:17"/>For our Baptisme vow &amp; Covenant, (which wee are all bound to performe all our dayes, as wee looke to have the Lord our God, or any benefit by our blessed Saviour, or ever to appeare with boldnesse before his Tribunall) I referre you first unto it, as the summe of it is set downe expresly in our publike forme of Baptisme; and if you please, as it is (amongst other of our bookes) more particularly and largely explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but even in the first part of this Watch, <hi>The Rule of Life:</hi> In which little booke, I have laboured, so farre as the Lord hath enabled mee, to shadow out the same vow, and so to trace out the narrow path of life, as to direct everie soule from step to step, and as it were, to guide them by the hand, untill wee have finished our whole course, and shall have entred within the gates of the Celestiall Ierusalem: which, though it be but amongst the least and weakest of our helpes for our de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:19935:17"/>
consequently, even from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so farre as I am any way able to conceive, judging as before his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majestie. And having so read and thorowly weighed and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with your way of life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any of your bookes of the like kinde, then to give sentence (as before him to whom you must surely give an answer, even for this) whether is the better and more holy, your way or ours, whether more agreeable to his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patterne.) And thus much for the first point, and your Baptisme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ow, which you seeme to have so far abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in so departing from the bosome of your mother, and utterly casting her oft: and to leave it to your more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation and more mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.</p>
            <p>For the second: <hi>viz.</hi> Vpon what grounds you have departed; I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe to have instanced but onely in this one; which, as is said, hath beene of late such a principall cause of your departure, and as I my selfe heard one poore soule, who had beene seduced, specially alleaging it (before sundrie witnesses, and some of them most learned) as a maine cause of her joyning to that religion, viz. <hi>That they have in their Church and Religion moe holy devotions than wee in ours, and spend</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19935:18"/>
               <hi>more time therein.</hi> That by the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of this delusion fully discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you and everie one of you may judge of all the rest of their delusions, which have nothing the like power so to bewitch you, and to steale away your hearts.</p>
            <p>And that I may proceed in order, to make all the mysteries of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion as cleare as the Sunne at the noone-day, even to the understanding and full capacitie of the simplest in the land, I will divide it into three parts, which are the three heads of this fell destroying <hi>Hydra,</hi> so maine a cause of your present departure from our Church and Religion, and of your turning to Poperie: To wit, <hi>Because</hi>
               <note place="margin">The delusion what, and the parts of it.</note> 
               <hi>they have in their Religion moe holy and and better devotions, and doe also spend more time therein, than we in ours.</hi> The first head then of this poysoning Serpent is this; <hi>That they have moe helps for devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their religion, than we in ours.</hi> The second, <hi>That their many devotions are more holy and better than ours.</hi> And the<note place="margin">The first part of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> third is, <hi>That they spend more time in these their holy devotions, than we doe in ours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie they have moe devotions than wee in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the first of these: <hi>That they have moe helps for devotions,</hi> that is, moe such as which those of our common sort may have, understand and use, it is as true as that which he, who lately writ

               </gap>: and so to take away the verie life of their lives, and indeed to prepare the way the better for the full effecting of their bloudie designes and desires against us all. Which I would therefore desire all (who would not willingly be so palpably abused by these murdering Iesuites, or who would but know these deluders and their Religion aright, and also the danger that wee stand in perpetually by it) to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.

For mine owne selfe, I have enquired of the most learned, and can heare of none other.</p>
            <p>But to passe over this most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; shamelesse untruth, together with that which they had devised in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the present hiding their owne wickednes in the Powder-Treason, for the dispatching us all, as it were, at one blow, like as it hath beene generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and received from thence till this day: to wit, <hi>That the Puritanes had blowne up the Parliament house;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby, that they therefore were well worthie to be destroyed out of the earth: and so under the name of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titanes, to have taken occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to have murdered all who truely professed Christs.

            <p>To passe over all these, and to leave them all, as rightly due to Popery; for<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> that lying and murder, the two chiefe workes of the Deuill, are now well knowne to all the world (even to all, that will not wittingly put out their owne eyes) to be the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And thus much briefly may suffice for the cutting off this first head of this Hydra.</p>

            <p>Or to speake all more shortly, those devotions must needs be best, which most frame all to the lively image of our Lord and Saviour, and so doe most forme Christ in us, to wit, which most fashion us to that absolute patterne of true holinesse, which is commanded in his blessed word, and not to superstition contrary to it and condemned in it.</p>
            <p>And also those, whereby we may be best assured to receive most power to prevaile with the Lord, and to obtaine all good things from him alone.</p>
            <p>Or yet more for the understanding of all: Those must needs be best, which doe best direct and help us to performe all our vowes &amp; promises made to him, and so to walke with him all our daies, doing onely that which he requires in all things, that so we may be assured of all his promises, both for this and the better life, to be fully performed to us, for the saving our selves and all the people of the Lord.</p>

The reason is, for that these three first being obeyed and sought first aright, will certainly bring the three latter petitions and blessings for our selves, both all things needfull for this and the better life, with forgiuenenesse of sins, deliverance from Satan, and from all the evils that he intends against us. That we shall see our Lord Iesus manifesting his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power and glory for us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us partakers of the same for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

word of God, which together with the Spirit can alone give faith; theirs the life of unbeleefe, grounded meerely upon the word of sinfull man, for that they beleeve the word, not for it selfe, but onely so farre as it hath authoritie from the Pope, as was said, which in truth can never give any sound faith. Yea ours directing and assisting to live not onely the life of faith in generall; but of the true iustifying and saving faith, which is wrought onely by the particular applying of Christ and all his promises to our selves, from which particular applying of Christ procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all true confidence, and every part of sanctification; theirs directing to beleeve, but without any such particular application; and onely in generall, and as the wickedest and the very Devils beleeve; for they beleeve there is one God, and quake and tremble.

            <p>11. Ours teaching &amp; working by the practise of them full assurance of Gods favour and love in Iesus Christ, which onely brings with it joy unspeakable
<pb facs="tcp:19935:28"/>
and glorious; theirs teaching and bringing but onely hope, without any ground of true faith, and therefore teaching doubting continually, which when the conscience is awaked, brings the very flashing of hell fire with it.</p>
            <p>So that ours, in the right use of them, are heaven upon earth; theirs, when their consciences shall be awaked, or when they but see what they have done in them all, a very hell upon earth.</p>
            <p>12. Our devotions are in the end the sweetest in the remembrance of them, and of all the time before that ever we have spent in them, since we beleeved in Christ; so as every one of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions made in faith, as our Religion directeth, and every moment of time so spent in them, hath a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; theirs being done without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word, yea contrary to the word, and therefore superstitiously and sinfully, not onely wanting all such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of reward (for who required the best of those things at their hands) but also having an expectation of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, when the conscience begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be a little awaked. So that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that then they are faine to renounce all but Iesus Christ, and so all confidence in these things, and to wish then with <hi>Balaam,</hi> to die the death of the righteous; toward
<pb facs="tcp:19935:28"/>
which death of the righteous, we are alway going forward; and which life we striving to live, shall be sure to die the death thereof, and our last end to be like to our life.</p>
            <p>13. Our devotions in so many of us as practise them aright, are as our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, viz. that pure Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God even the Father, which <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of, directing and<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> helping to visit the fatherlesse and the widow in their adversitie, and namely those of them who are of the houshold of faith, and the members of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to keepe our selves unspotted of the world. So as we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising rightly out devotions, there cannot be a lying tongue found in our mouthes, nor a hand or heart defiled with bloud, but we shall seeke by all meanes to save both soules and bodies of all sorts, even of our wickedest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the most bloudily-minded against us. Their Devotions contrarily are in truth, as their Religion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure widowes houses, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of long prayer, and to destroy all the innocent, the fatherlesse &amp; widow, even al who are of the houshold of faith, &amp; the members of Christ, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Innocents that save all the rest.<note place="margin">Iob 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And by these, they make themselves notorious and infamous to all the
<pb facs="tcp:19935:29"/>
world, to be the most polluted with execrable lying and the murder of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, of all other religions, that ever were in the world before, as will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare after, whereby all their chiefe professours, and namely their bloudy Iesuits have made themselves odious even to all Nations.</p>
            <p>14. Yea and to passe by many other; our Devotions are as our Religion, to make us faithfull and loyall subjects, and not to be so bold, as to have an evill thought in our hearts against him, whom the Lord sets over us, but to be as <hi>David,</hi> whose heart smit him, for touching but the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and so with that holy servant of God, and with the children of the Captivity, and with <hi>Daniel,</hi> yea with all the holy Martyrs to be content to endure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever from them, and from all in holy and lawfull authoritie under them, that in our patient sufferings, Kings, Princes and Rulers may see the truth, and what is pleasing to the Lord, and also what they ought to maintaine and doe for their owne salvation, and of their Royall Progenie and Dominions; theirs in all these things, to make all to be contrarily affected, viz. to arme and flesh all to rebellion, and the murdering of Kings and Princes when they can do it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniently. After that those their
<pb facs="tcp:19935:29"/>
ghostly fathers have made them to drinke deepe enough of this cup, and to be truly devout in the manner of their devotions: though I hope better things of you, to whom I write, yet it cannot hurt you to be warned.</p>
            <p>15. Moreover for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner &amp; forme of our devotions; All our devotions which are agreeable to our doctrine, are sent forth from understanding hearts, and so with a holy zeale, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the spirit of judgement, and the<note place="margin">Esa. 4. 4.</note> spirit of burning, mixt with the sweet perfume of Christs merit, and so offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to our heavenly Father, as they may be most pleasing, comming to him,<note place="margin">Apoc. 8. 3.</note> as out of the hand of our Saviour, yea offered also in order without any vaine<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> babling or idle repetition: Theirs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily are for most part and usually without any understanding at all; like as all the devotions of their ignorant sort are, especially those which are in an unknowne tongue; and so without all holy affection. For all holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must of necessitie be grounded upon knowledge, without which the heart cannot be good; neither can<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 2.</note> there be any faith in such, nor any<note place="margin">Rom. 4. end.</note> thing but sinne, <hi>for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne.</hi> And not onely so, but also theirs are full of vaine and idle repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that blinde manner, a matter
<pb facs="tcp:19935:30"/>
directly condemned by our Saviour as<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 7.</note> hypocriticall and heathenish, when men <hi>thinke to be heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Finally, for that theirs are usually sent forth in a proud opinion of their owne merit and worthinesse to be heard, or as they come out of the hand of some Saint or Angell; to whom therein they give this honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which solely belongs to our Lord and Saviour, viz. of presenting<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34. 1 Tim. 2. 5.

            <p>I might prosecute these comparisons in many other instances, as namely, that our devotions make us still better, the more they are practised by us, and more like to Christ Iesus; theirs as they are theirs properly, as those which I named, make them still and ever worse and worse, and more like to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as he is transformed into an Angell of light; as namely in all their Iesuits, their chiefe professed holy men, being indeed deuils in carnate, and so accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all States, and specially for those chiefe works of their lying and murder, which are manifest to all, to be their principall studie: Ours (to repeat it againe, that it may leave the deeper impression in every soule) tending to save all both soules and bodies; theirs to destroy all, not onely us whom they
<pb facs="tcp:19935:30"/>
terme Heretiques, but themselves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and all other whom they seduce by their delusions.</p>
            <p>But to omit all further comparisons, for that it would bee too long, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to content our selves with these, and to come to a conclusion of this second point, <hi>viz.</hi> That these things being so, as every one who professeth Christs Gospell, and holdeth the Religion of our Church, must needs acknowledge, and even the very consciences of our Adversaries will surely doe, when they shall be awaked to answer as before the Lords Tribunall; I now here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to every soule, whether are more holy and so better, their devotions or ours.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope this second head<note place="margin">Conclusion of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point.</note> of this monstrous destroying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring serpent, is utterly smitten off for ever hereafter hurting any of Gods people, who uprightly weigh these things, and to whom it is given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Gospell of Christ, and withall to lay to heart that forewarning of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the strong delusions<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 11, 12.</note> of Antichrist, amongst which these are not of the least. And for them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rag of the number of them being such, is to boast of their store of poyson and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent infection enough to destroy not only themselves, but even all the world
<pb facs="tcp:19935:31"/>
And thus much for the second head.<note place="margin">The third part of the delusion: that they spend more time in their devotions than we in ours.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To come therefore to the last head of this deadly Serpent, which is yet more perillous and full of mortall poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son than the former: <hi>viz.</hi> That they spend more time in their devotions than wee doe in ours, and therefore their religion is better. To cut off this likewise,</p>
            <p>1. I answer, that their devotions being such as those which wee have heard, <hi>viz.</hi> Idolatrous, superstitious, and against the direction of the Lord, yea against his expresse charge, (like as all theirs are, so farre as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly theirs) the more time they spend in them, the more they increase their sinne, and so the wrath of God against themselves, with their owne everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting miserie, so that to glorie of their many devotions spent in that kinde, is but to glorie in their shame and in their sinne, even in the launcing of their owne soules, in a devotion like to the devotion of <hi>Baals</hi> Priests.</p>
            <p>2. Thus I answer, that a Papist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right Papist, holding their usuall tenets, and following their practice, can never make one prayer which can be acceptable unto God, nor doe any worke which can be pleasing, for that<note place="margin">Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>m. on Rom. 3. vers. 22. sect. 7.</note> they doe not onely condemne, but also scorne, yea persecute that true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:19935:31"/>
faith, which consists in a particular applying of Christ, and in a peculiar and full assurance of Gods favour and love through Iesus Christ alone; without which faith there can bee no sanctification, for that all our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation flowes from our justification, and our justification from this particular saving faith, thus applying Christ to us, and making him ours, and so making us flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones; whereby all our good works flow from him by his Spirit, when wee are so united and incorporated into him thereby.</p>
            <p>Now they denying and scorning that whereby they should bee made good trees, can never bring forth any good<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33.</note> fruit pleasing and acceptable unto the Lord: For first, the tree must be good, and then will the fruit be good, &amp; never before, but scorning that whereby they should be made good trees and living members of Christ, &amp; have his Spirit, they can never do the works of Christ, or bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. Though they could make never so many prayers, and those good prayers in regard of the matter, yet none of those prayers can ever be accepted; but God threats to hide his face from<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 15.</note> them, because their hearts and hands are full of bloud, all of them, at least
<pb facs="tcp:19935:32"/>
the most devout of them, wishing and seeking the bloud of all heretiques, and so of us whom they principally account to be such amongst all other.</p>
            <p>For their verie hating of us so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they are murtherers, and much<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 15.</note> more, hating and seeling to root us all out, onely for our love to our God, even for his names sake, and for our cleaving fast to him alone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot have eternall life abiding in them, much lesse can any of their prayers be heard so long as they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
            <p>4 Moreover, for all their canonicall and set houres, if they be either in such kinde of prayers as theirs are properly; or else if they bee with the neglect of that particular calling wherein everie one of them should walke, to eat their owne bread, and not to bee as Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers and idle bellies, to live of the spoyle of the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; &amp; much more, if they be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and to delude poore soules in an opinion of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> it thereby; and most of all in putting their works so done in place of the merit of Christ, as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to the treasure of the Church; though by them they afflict and humble their bodies never so much; yet all these the moe they are, the greater is their sinne and miserie, as
<pb facs="tcp:19935:32"/>
was said before: for who required any<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 12. Psal. 50. 16.</note> of the best of them done in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at their hands? And much more any of those which are in themselves idolatrous or superstitious.</p>
            <p>5. For true and holy devotions, and which are pleasing and acceptable unto God, I doubt not constantly to affirme, but that the poorest and weakest true Christian in our Church (which rightly holding the doctrine of our Church, and justified by the bloud of Christ through a lively faith in him, makes conscience of all his wayes, and so useth to pray according to his will, in the name of Christ onely, both spends more time in true holy Devotions, and shall be more accepted with the Lord, yea shall have more power to prevaile with his Majestie for whatsoever hee seekes, and shall also bring more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his owne soule, and finde a farre greater reward from the Lord, than the proudest Pharisaicall Papist in all the world.</p>
            <p>For that the prayers of such an one so made, are the prayers of faith, unto which all the promises are made; and contrarily all the prayers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, so farre as they are Papists, and so made, can be no other but prayers of unbeleefe, and so can looke to receive nothing, because indeed they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:19935:33"/>
but sinne, and displeasing to his<note place="margin">Iam. 16. 7.</note> Majestie.</p>
            <p>And if the poorest Christian, and hee that spends least time doe this, what shall wee thinke of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands others, who have set themselves unfainedly to seeke and walke with God? Yea, what shall we thinke of all those, who knowing their owne sinnes and weaknesses, and the continuall endevours of Satan against them, with their owne necessities, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Churches, are driven to bee instant with the Lord day and night? And chiefly what shall wee judge of all those, who doe at this day truely take to heart the dishonours done unto his glorious Majestie, the oppositions against Christs Gospell, his crowne and dignitie, with the state of his poore Churches and people therein; the rage and furie of Satan and Antichrist? who have therefore set themselves tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to helpe our Lord Iesus in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to pacifie his wrath, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of his captives with the glorie of his Sion.</p>
            <p>Yet have we too just cause to accuse<note place="margin">Iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the greatest part of those who prosesse the Gospell.</note> and condemne our selves herein, not onely all our Atheists and prophane sort, but also the multitude generally, that wee suffer our adversaries so farre to condemne the greatest part of us,
<pb facs="tcp:19935:33"/>
who professe the Gospell, that they should labour farre more in their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious devotions, to increase their sinne and judgement upon them all (though this have beene alwayes the nature of superstition) than we in our holy and true devotions to increase our owne happinesse, and for the saving of us all. Notwithstanding that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deadnesse and want is amongst us in this behalfe, it is not through the fault of our Religion, which teacheth and enableth us otherwise when it is rightly knowne and practised, but it is the want of true knowledge, and of a sound and conscionable practice of our Religion.</p>
            <p>Hence it hath beene, and is one principall end whereunto I have bent my studies in these poore labours, the better to awaken us, and to put more life into us, to begin more universally and joyntly, and also more incessantly to importune the Lord herein, being provoked by their ensample.</p>
            <p>That thus we may labour as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and as earnestly with the Lord hereby, for the saving of our selves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and of so many of them with us as belong unto his eternall election, as they doe by theirs, to destroy both us and themselves together.</p>
            <p>And thus much also, for cutting off<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:19935:34"/>

(because that Religion so farre as it is differing from ours, and properly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, holding their chiefe grounds, must needs bee of the devill.) was grounded upon the expresse words of our Saviour to the unbeleeving Iewes, who therefore sought by lies and all devices to kill him, even for the truth, which he declared unto them, as now they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This I framed in the plainest manner that I could, for the easier understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and triall of it, as now I do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>That Religion which teacheth lying and murder for the supporting and advancing of it, is of the Devill; But the Religion of the Iesuited Papist it a Religion which teacheth lying and murder for the supporting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of it.</hi>

               <hi>Ergo the Religion of the Iesuited Papists is of the Devill.</hi>

            <p>And secondly, a lie as great as it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised not only to cover that bloudy fact, for the present; but by it to have destroyed all the rest, who had escaped that blow, even all truly professing Christs Gospell; in all countreys of the earth, under the name of Puritans; for that they had commited such a fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Puritanes had blowen up the Parlament house: like as when it was discovered, they gave it forth, that the Puritans had intended it.

            <p>Now this whole act of this devillish and deadly preparation, we know, was proved to be done by the advice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First, hee hath manifested it anew, in discovering againe, (even as it were to all the world) the wickednesse of

that Religion in this behalfe, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our whole nation, not onely to take more full and certaine notice of their dealing, and to bee enforced to seeke by all meanes to prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and danger by it; but also all the Churches, even all the earth, to see how by delayes and faire pretences <hi>(which have indeed beene nothing, but meere untruths and guls, to speake plainly of them)</hi> they have devoured so great a part, and are readie presently to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all, under pretences of maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of more strong leagues, and more firme peace, according to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent devices and practices, &amp; agreeably to their holy Councels at Trent, in the booke mentioned before: so as even all the world rings and cries out of it.</p>

            <p>3. By causing at this time their Art of equivocating and lying to come to light, and to bee published to the view of all sorts amongst us. How these Iesuites have beaten their braines, and even gone beyond Satan himselfe, in devising, maintaining, and practising this devillish Art, which wee may well call their new Blacke Art, for which I referre all to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Masons</hi> booke of <hi>The new Art of lying, covered by Iesuites under the vaile of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> That all may see and bee for ever fully satisfied, that these are their doctrines, &amp; the verie chiefest of them, in the refining and perfecting whereof, they bestow most paines.</p>
            <p>4. By that late and notable Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie<note place="margin">See Foot out of the Snare, pag. 25.</note> out of their owne bookes, by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gee,</hi> who was one of them; wherein he hath set downe such impious tricks and devices of their Priests and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, that (as hee there saith) all may justly hoot at them, for most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impostors and liars. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but of some of which will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly cleere whatsoever I have spoken in this behalfe, and this Assumption.
<pb facs="tcp:19935:39"/>
This likewise comming forth in Gods speciall providence at this verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for the more full conviction of all, or leaving all more without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and to stop everie mouth that shall plead for them.</p>
            <p>Yet to passe over all these, and this also; that all sorts doe know, that their Iesuites and Confessours are the chiefe contrivers and abettours of all their chiefe stratagems, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done without them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee are nothing to regard words, when their deeds, according to their Doctrines and Constitutions, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the world. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may delude little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by affirming that these are not their doctrines (if any dare still deny it against the witnesse of his owne heart) yet men, having their braines in their heads, can never bee so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted, unlesse they will wilfully joyne hands with them, or suffer their eyes utterly to be put out.</p>
            <p>For that which they say; That they are not their Doctrines, unlesse wee can shew them out of the Councell of Trent, or some of their chiefe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; can any man imagine, that the Councels would openly professe them to proclaime to all the world, that they
<pb facs="tcp:19935:39"/>
and their Religion is of Satan? or can wee thinke or imagine, that so many of their Iesuites should publish them unto the world, unlesse they were the advice of their Popes, and indeed their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But to passe all these things over,<note place="margin">All their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines lies in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic.</note> and to leave them to their further consideration, to worke better upon their consciences: what can they yet, or any other say to their Doctrines, which the Holy Ghost cals, <hi>Lies</hi>

               <hi>through hypocrisie,</hi> devised to devoure us all?</p>
            <p>Such as this here discovered, <hi>That they have moe holy devotions than we,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And even for all their Doctrines joyntly to leave it to the consciences of all whether all of those wherein they differ from us, and for which they so contend, bee not Doctrines meerely devised to please the corrupt nature of man; to hold up that Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie of the Pope, and tyrannie of that Sea of Rome, <hi>viz.</hi> of their Pope, Cardinals, Abbots, and the rest: And also for their bellies; and that they may keepe all the world in slaverie, and to hide their wickednesse. And more specially what their Doctrines are concerning Purgatorie, Masses, Indulgences, Pardons, even for the
<pb facs="tcp:19935:40"/>
time to come; Miracles done by this Saint and that, and by this Relique and that: and concerning their holy Reliques themselves, and so all their doctrines of Equivocation, mentall Reservation, and the like, whether they be not all (to speake as the thing is) notorious lies to keepe the poore people in ignorance, &amp; in their blinde devotions and slavery to them; yea to muzzle them in their murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring zeale against the true Church. Which if it be so, then the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is most manifest to all the world, even to children, and almost to suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing babes: <hi>That Popery teacheth lying and murder,</hi> or that which tends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, viz. <hi>to the destroying of all either soules, or bodies, or both.</hi>

            <p>1. Whether the Assumption being true, that Religion of theirs be not of the Devill, by our Saviours owne reason, and therefore that all of them must either renounce, and even abjure it, or else professe themselves to be of Satans Religion, to maintaine it, and
<pb facs="tcp:19935:41"/>
to fight for him against our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and that they will still doe it.</p>
            <p>2. Whether all sorts are not bound to seeke to save themselves from that lying and murdering Religion, and to use all warrantable and holy means, both to reclaime all from it, to the end to save them, both soules and bodies, and also to deliver all the Churches and people of the Lord, from the danger of being suddenly surprized, and murdered thereby; and so far as God inables them any way, to take away all the dishonour and provocations of his sacred Majestie, which may come thereby, as by all other such hainous sinnes. This I humbly submit to the judgement of all; seeing whosoever is not with our<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 23.</note> Saviour is against him, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever saves not, destroyes. That the Magistrates and all in authoritie are the keepers of both the Tables, each according to his place: and for that the bloud of all must be required at the Pastors and Watchmens ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And thus much also for the proofe of the Assumption, and the shutting up of this inclosed Epistle.</p>
            <p>Unto which, if this Gentleman, or any one for that Honourable Ladie, will offer to reply, let me but crave this of him, whosoever he be, which equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wisdome will require.</p>
            <p>1. First, to doe it in love and with good advice, as in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, without all shifts or devices against the light of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even as I have endevoured, and onely for the finding out and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth, whereunto (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) I shall ever yeeld, if any one in any thing shall rightly shew mee my error, and I shall moreover acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my oversight.</p>
            <p>2. And secondly, let me request of him, that hee will bethinke himselfe wisely, for what he pleades, and also
<pb facs="tcp:19935:42"/>
for whom, whether he doe it not even for Satan, and for the upholding of his kingdome by his chiefe workes of lying and murder; and also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider against whom he doth it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not against our Lord Iesus Christ, and against all his Saints and people: and withall to thinke, how hard it is for him to kicke against the prickes, and that against the light shining clearely in his heart. And yet<note place="margin">Acts 9, 5.</note> more also, to ponder wisely what it is to give Satan advantage, but by one lie only wilfully maintained, and especially such a lie, as tends but to the murdering of one soule. And how much more then, when it is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Art of lying devised by and for the devill himselfe; to hold up his kingdome, and to overthrow the kingdome of Christ, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and destroying of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soules, even of all bewitched by them; and tending to the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the people of the Lord, and the rooting them out of the earth. How dreadfull it will be to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ, to give answer but for the bloud of one soule alone; when <hi>Abels</hi> bloud, the bloud but even of his body alone, cries so loud from the earth, and makes <hi>Cain</hi> such a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb facs="tcp:19935:42"/>
all his daies, to be in hell whilst he was yet here in the earth; yea before hee came into that place of torment designed for him and for all other wicked men, and chiefly for all liers and murderers, to bee tormented there for ever.</p>
            <p>4. And finally, let mee wish him for his credit (if he respect nothing else) to answer all these books which I have mentioned, as well for the cause of the learned as the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because they are (as it were sent of God) to manifest the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and then I have no doubt, but he our most blessed and onely wise God, will both reply and answer for us still, and so maintaine his owne cause, as to put them all to silence, at least in the pit which they are digging for us, and that for evermore.</p>
            <p>Thus have I through the good hand of my God, made way to the satisfying of the holy desires of those worthy Personages, which wish so Honourably and Christianly unto you, &amp; that we may match our chiefe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries in our devotions; although we doe already (as all may plainly see) goe so far beyond them in this kinde; and also to the end that you who meane plainly, and have not
<pb facs="tcp:19935:43"/>
your hearts yet tainted with their bloud-thirstie desires, &amp; all others, may perceive, how you have been and are deluded, and even inchanted in every one of these respects: by which scale, all may measure the rest of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines and devices. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I hope that I have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the consciences of all, that all sorts must renounce Popery, and embrace the Gospell; or else professe themselves to be of their father the Devill, and that they will fight against Christ. To try if the Lord may be pleased yet to shew them mercy, to come out of the snares of Satan, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the cleere manifestation of these delusions of his, or by the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares of many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, crying jointly for all, to hale and<note place="margin">See Peters enlargement, concerning the power of faithfull praier.</note> pull them out of Egypt and Sodome, for what are not the joint praiers of Gods people able to doe?</p>
            <p>Now these things being so, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion so laid open, and the Assumption so plainly proved and demonstrated to the convincing of everie of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as I am fully perswaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, give me leave in tender commiseration to turne my speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all, who dare still stand out against his Majestie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19935:43"/>Oh bethinke your selves in time, what it is to fight against the light of your owne hearts! what will follow the wounded conscience, when the Lord shall wake it and call it to an account, which hee will certainly doe, either in this life, or so soone as ever you shall depart hence. Remember the cases of <hi>Cain, Saul, Iudas,</hi> for fighting so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately against the light, and so standing forth against the Lord and his most gracious offer of mercie.</p>
            <p>Oh bethinke your selves in time of his terrible and most glorious Majestie, against whom you have so fearefully sinned, as to provoke him not onely against your selves, but against this whole Nation, even against us all, for your causes, in departing from him and his holy Religion, to a Religion of such abominations, and so manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and declared to be of Satan his sworne enemie!</p>
            <p>Remember the dreadfulnesse of his wrath, so declared in the irrevocable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Angels that so fell from him, of Adam, the old world, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that which shall be so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> revealed when Christ shall come with thousand thousands of glorious Angels, in flaming fire, to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to all who know him not, and
<pb facs="tcp:19935:44"/>
who will not yeeld obedience to his heavenly Gospell, and much more to all his obstinate enemies.</p>
            <p>Consider well how your sinne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased not onely being committed so contrarily to your Baptisme vow, but also by all the evictions of the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that idolatrous, lying, and murdering Religion, especially in this Nation, since the time of the first ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it forth so publikely by Parlament, and even untill this verie day, and now last of all by this Discoverie of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged delusion, wherein so many others of yours like unto it are included.</p>
            <p>Thinke what it is, not onely to bee barred out of Heaven, deprived utterly of all the joyes thereof, but moreover to be thrust into hell, to abide the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof with Satan and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for ever and ever: which must needs come upon you, if that Religion of Rome bee such, and have such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, as you have or may see set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your faces.</p>
            <p>If you will not reade this, but bee as the deafe adder stopping your eares, and in stead of Satan hiding away and blinding your owne eyes, yet I hope you have each of you some faithfull friends, who (beleeving the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perswaded of your delusions as I am)

<pb facs="tcp:19935:47"/>
it were, into thy mouth; and withall thy hands holden up by him to doe it. Doe it therefore as well as thou caust, if thou regard but thine owne case, either of soule or bodie, thy present or eternall estate.</p>
            <p>I have purposely in many of the praiers, followed the order in <hi>the first part of this Watch,</hi> which I have taken for a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, both for that it hath beene so oft tried by the learned to be according to the true <hi>Rule of Life,</hi> and for that the places for proofes are there quoted to auoid further labour: and that thou and all the weaker sort may learne together both to watch and pray for your selves and all the people of the Lord, and so be sure to prevaile with his heavenly Majestie.</p>
            <p>If thou shalt finde or suspect any errour, wherein thou darest not joyne, signifie it as in love and in the feare of the Lord; and I shall (as I have ever bound my selfe) be most ready either to give thee satisfaction, or to reforme it; and yet in the meane time proceed in the rest joyntly with thy brethren.</p>
            <p>Let us all joyne as being of one heart and soule, wherein we all agree, crying unto our heavenly Father, compassing him about at his feet for our selves and all his deare children, and he will surely heare our cries, and in his due time reveale every diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto us, and wherein the errour lieth.</p>
            <p>I tie thee not to daies nor houres, but as thou observest the Lord offering thee fittest

            <p>Wonder not that I so oft go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereby we may have a certaine assurance from our Lord Iesus Christ the author of it, that he will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie it to every soule (that shall be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and so use it as be hath directed) with the power of his owne spirit, and be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in granting all things which we so beg according to his heavenly will, above all that any heart can conceive.</p>
            <p>Remember also for thy better incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how every prayer herein tends to the

appeasing of the Lords heavy indignation, which hath beene thus far declared against his people: and this by our joynt seeking to give him his glory in helping to reclaime and reduce us all to the obedience of his blessed Covenant of Grace, wherein is our life, and thereby to the deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that every one of us striving to pray faithfully and fervently, and to put in practise whatsoever we thus pray for; so farre as it concernes us, shall in every prayer and petition be true helpers unto our Lord Iesus and his poore Church; and for every such a service, even every houre so spent, receive our pay, and in the end for all a rich and most full reward.</p>

            <p>Thou hast heard the sound of the cruell warres abroad, the late prevailing of the enemie, the overthrow of the Churches, the

new threatnings of those bloudy intendments against all the rest, and the increase of their rage daily. In these poore helps, and the like, the Lord offereth thee weapons, and directs thee so to use them, that thou maist helpe them in the remotest parts; calls upon thee loud to come and helpe them, assures thee of a blessed victorie in the end, that then thou and all the true Church and people of the Lord shall sing the songs of <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Deborah,</hi> and of the 24. <hi>Elders,</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with Christ eternally, when all who have refused to helpe, shall weepe and waile for evermore.</p>
            <p>Thus intreating that the Lord may at length awake thee and all his people, that we may each give up a happy account, and escape the dreadfull doome and sentence, for neglecting his glory, kingdome, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and may hence forward carefully use all the meanes which his goodnesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords unto us for our present and eternall happinesse, I commend thee to his grace, and rest</p>
