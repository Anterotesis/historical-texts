         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I shall behaue my selfe by the grace of God, in the kéeping and distribution of the monie last sent and of that which resteth yet of the first summe, according to your highnesse prescription, and as I ought to answer to God in conscience, and to your highnesse in credit, and to the whole world in the reputation of an honest man, and will mannage it in such sort, that by the grace of God there shal be fruit drawn therof pleasant to your highnesse.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The mony is to be distributed among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi>
                  </note> It is true that I find (as all others would doe, that would enterprise such a charge here) my self inuolued in great difficulties: for on the one part I am in great danger of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, &amp; of them of the faction of England, by reason of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profession that I make of the Catholike religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of the suspicion that the last hath of my secret practises and dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. On the other part, I haue much ado to moderate the appetite that some Catholike lords haue, to haue the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie presently, for the hope which they giue of some pretended occasions, which will neuer fall out as they promise. The Earle of <hi>Huntlie</hi> made instance to haue the third part of the summe which was sent hither as soone as it was deliuered to me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Earle of Huntlie would haue a third part to himself.</hi>

I beséech your highnesse, by the first letter it shall please you to

If I had commandement from your highnesse, I would giue them some little almes in your name to helpe them &amp; eight others, whereof foure are also Iesuits, and the other foure are semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie priests of <hi>Pontawmoussone</hi> in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> which are al the

They of this countrie that are of the faction of England, were in a maruellous feare during the incertaintie of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the sayd armie, and confessed plainly, if it had landed here they had bene vtterly ouercome.

He suffers himselfe to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablie guided by me, notwithstanding the diuersitie of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and hath often times sayd, that if the Catholikes would giue him suretie to possesse, after the restitution of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes religion, two Abbies which he hath, that he would euen presently be altogether one of yours. He intends to send the <hi>Colonell Halkerstoun,</hi> to accompanie certaine Captaines and gentlemen to Spaine, and almost foure hundred souldiors, all safe from the Naufrage in our Iles.

And if we thinke it good, hath offered himself to go out of the countrie, and to go offer himselfe to your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the low Countries, and by your aduise afterward, doe the like to his Catholike Maiestie in Spaine. But here vpon we will aduise what is most expedient. If we may alwaies be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of him, he will be as profitable for the weale of our cause, as any Lord in Scotland, for he hath great dependance about
