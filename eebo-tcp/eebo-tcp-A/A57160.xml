            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Here present thee with a Sermon many
years since Preached in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and his Brethren,
by the late Right Reverend Father in God
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Edward Reynolds</hi> late Lord Bishop of
<hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Copy I received from the hands of a
Gentleman, who being an Auditor himself
of the Sermon, and of good acquaintance with
the said Lord Bishop, obtained it of him fairly
written in his own hand with liberty to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it.</p>
            <p>Which being carefully done, and revised
by the original, is here presented to thy view.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:45367:3"/>
This Gentleman bad me farther assure
thee, that notwithstanding he knows his copy
to be exact, he would not have taken that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to have printed it, had he not first obtained
from the Author a willingness that it might be
printed, which himself would have done, but
could not readily find his papers.</p>
            <p>This encouragement made him willing to
let the world be partaker of this excellent and
elaborate discourse, by which he being dead: yet
speaks to thee in the words of the Prophet, <hi>to
do justly, to love mercy, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with thy God.</hi>

                  <hi>Micah</hi> Chap. 6. Ver. 6, 7, 8.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>6. Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self
before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings,
with calves of a year old?</p>
                  <p>7. Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with
ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born
for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of
my soul?</p>
                  <p>8. He hath shewed thee O man what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to do justly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter we find mention of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
between God the Plaintiff, and his People the
Delinquent. The action, an action of unkindness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
after two great deliverances; from the tyranny of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the subtilty of <hi>Balaam</hi> in <hi>Moab.</hi> And
this is an high aggravation of injury when it is done by a friend,
the Philosopher tells us, <hi>Rhet. lib.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, you know was
the deepest wound that <hi>Caesar</hi> felt; and <hi>Moses</hi> is at the self
same figure, <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45367:4"/>
unwise? Is not he thy Father? Deut. 32. 6. Iob</hi> complains
of it as of one of his greatest afflictions, <hi>They whom I loved,
are turned against me, Iob</hi> 19. 19. yea he that was greater
than <hi>Iob</hi> at <hi>Iobs</hi> greatest excellency of patience, cannot but
complain of this, that his wounds like <hi>Amnons</hi> were given
him in the House of a friend, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 6. The kiss of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
did no less pierce him, than the Nails of a Souldier. His
Enemies that wounded him found mercy, when his friends
that betrayed him found none.</p>
            <p>The people being cited to appear to this action, and being
condemned by their own witness, begin to betake themselves
to counsel: Not how they may come and stand before God,
which is the gesture of men that can abide a trial; <hi>Isai.</hi> 50. 8.
but how they may come and bow before him to deprecate the
judgment which they are forced to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>And when they have advised upon a course of their own,
and made tender of performances of their own to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,
they all come short, and are rejected. God himself
is pleased to be of their counsel, and he who in the beginning
of the suit was the Plaintiff to accuse them, in the issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
their Advocate to instruct them; and when he had a
judgment entred against them upon their own confession, doth
himself notwithstanding direct the way how that judgment
may be reversed, and avoided.</p>
            <p>He hath shewed thee O man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what then are the counsels that he gave? Surely one
would judge but such as were very obvious, and which any
man might have given to himself; To be just, merciful, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
religious. Who could not have said as much as this?</p>
            <p>Certainly how mean instructions soever we may judg them,
there is not a man can learn them but of God. Let <hi>Israel</hi>
alone here to counsel himself; we find him at his Sacrifices,
and Holocausts, with rams, and oyls, with thousands, and ten
thousands, with a child, a first-born, with as many costly and
hyperbolical evasions, and circuitions of his own carnal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45367:4"/>
will-worship as Rhetorick can express; Sacrifices more,
sumptuous than justice could provide, Sacrifices more bloody
than mercy would allow; but all this while not a word of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
or Mercy themselves.</p>
            <p>But what? did not God shew those as well as these? did
not <hi>Moses</hi> as well receive the pattern of the Sanctuary, as the
Tables of the Law? did not the law give an express <hi>indicavit</hi>
for these too? Surely we may not deny it. But it is still with
respect to judgment, and mercy. Commanded they were, but
not as principal, either in point of obedience, for they must
yield to the great duties of the law; or in point of expiation,
for they must lead to the great Sacrifice of the gospel: Leave
these things out, and then ask of God whether he required
those or no, and he will answer you with a <hi>Quis requisivit,
Isai.</hi> 1. 12. Ask whether he will own them or no, and he will
tell you, they are yours, and not his, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 21. Nay ask
him whether they be good or no, and he will tell you plainly,
<hi>Dedi eis praecepta non bona,</hi> I gave them Statutes which were
not good, and judgments whereby they should not live.</p>
            <p>Well then, my people, if you will needs be saved by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thousands, and ten thousands, go not to the Mountains
for them, but go to thy Conscience; there thou shalt find
thousands of beastly, and ten thousand of inordinate desires
fit to be slaughtered, and sacrificed unto him.</p>
            <p>If ye will be saved by Sacrifices, and oblations, and rams;
No Sacrifice to that which is reasonable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to that of thy self, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. No Rams to the
rams of <hi>Nebaioth,</hi> the confluence of the Gentiles to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 60. 1.</p>
            <p>If you will needs swim through rivers to Heaven, Rivers of
oyl are nothing worth to rivers of judgment. <hi>Let judgment
run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream,
Amos</hi> 5. 24.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt needs go to God with meat-offerings of oyl, no
oyl to the Samaritans oyl of mercy and compassion, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45367:5"/>
If you dare not come to God without a first-born, go not
to thy self for one. Thine is like thy self, sinful and unclean;
but take him in thy arms who is the first-born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
There is none but <gap reason="foreign">

wit in the great duties of the Law and Gospel. And here are
considerable four particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The substance of the duties required. <list>
                     <item>1. Iudgment, and that to be done.</item>
                     <item>2. Mercy and that to be beloved.</item>
                     <item>3. Walking with God, and for that to be humbled.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>2. The principles whence they must rise. <list>
                     <item>1. The light of Gods law, <hi>Ille in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit,</hi>
he hath shewed.</item>
                     <item>2. The authority of Gods will, <hi>Quid requisivit,</hi> what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>3. The manner how couched in these words, <hi>to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with thy God;</hi> which I take not only for the specification
of a distinct duty, but a qualification also of both the other
which are, To be done <list>
                     <item>1. In constancy, it must be ambulation, a tenor, progress, proficiency; jumping or leaping will not serve the turn.</item>
                     <item>2. In sincerity, with an eye to God, so as to agree with him and to please him.</item>
                     <item>3. In humility, denying our selves both persons and duties.</item>
                     <item>4 In faith, the foundation of all the rest, we must walk with him as our God.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>And 4. the inducement unto those duties, which we find
likewise couched in the text. And they are in regard of <list>
                     <item>our selves, human frailty, <hi>O man.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> Gods <list>
                           <item>Divine Majesty, he is a most high God, we cannot otherwise approach to him.</item>
                           <item>Divine mercy, he is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God, ready to teach us how we may.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45367:6"/>Duties they are good by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the rule. <list>
                  <item>Gods will, as expressions of it.</item>
                  <item>End, Mans felicity as means unto it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the anxious and solicitous question of the
guilty people: <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder to hear guilt talk of appearing before God. Look
on it when it came first into the world, and you will find it
running away from God. <hi>Adam and his wife hid themselves
from the presence of the Lord God, amongst the trees of the
garden, Gen.</hi> 3. 8. And surely if the Sun and Moon be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 24. 23. if the Heavens be not clear, <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 15.
if the Seraphims cover their face and feet, <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. 2. if <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
may not draw too nigh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. but did exceedingly
quake and tremble, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21. if <hi>Elias</hi> cover his face, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 13. if <hi>Isaiah</hi> cry out, I am undone, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. if
<hi>Iob</hi> abhor himself in dust and ashes, <hi>cap.</hi> 42. 6. if the 24.
Elders cast down their Crowns, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 10. I wonder with
what confidence Hypocrites dare think of meeting God. Is he
not a consuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29. and how dare thorns and
briars stand before him, <hi>Isai. 27. 4?</hi> Doth he not dwell in
light which no man can approach unto, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 16?</hi> and
what hath darkness with light, <hi>for every one that doth evil
hateth the light, neither cometh to it, Ioh. 3. 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something surely there is in it that guilty men bethink
themselves of meeting God. By nature they do not so much
as seek after him; <hi>God is not in all their thoughts, Psal. 10.
4.</hi> They love not to retain him in their knowledge, <hi>Rom. 1.
28.</hi> They are alienated, and estranged from his life, <hi>Eph. 4.
18.</hi> They would fain be without God in the World, <hi>Eph. 2.
12.</hi> They would have the holy one of <hi>Israel</hi> cease from
among them, <hi>Isai.</hi> 39. 11.</p>
            <p>If you look to the two first Verses of this Chapter, you
will find the reason of all this. God hath a controversy, plead
he will; and as he called for <hi>Adam</hi> when he hid himself, <hi>Adam
where art thou? Gen.</hi> 3. 9. so here he calleth forth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45367:6"/>
to this controversy, <hi>O my people, what have I done unto
thee? v.</hi> 3 and they who contended with one another
were to come near, and to stand together, <hi>Isai. 50. 8. Act.
25.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Now then <hi>Cum rex justus saderit in solio,</hi> When once
God citeth the Conscience to his tribunal, <hi>Prepare to meet thy
God O Israel, Amos</hi> 4. 12. When the Soul is once awakened,
and startled with this question, how wilt thou do to dwell
with devouring fire, and with everlasting burning? then <hi>the
sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulness doth surprise the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
Isai.</hi> 33. 14. When there is a noise of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
coming, then the foolish Virgins think of their Lamps,
and ask after Oyl as well as the wise. Wicked men themselves
may be so convinced of their sins, and of Gods greatness, of
the guilt that is in them, and of the terror that is in God that
out of the force and principles of a startled and awaked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
they shall be affected with notable fear of the wrath
to come, and be constrained to bethink themselves of a treaty
of peace, and of preventing that wrath ere it overtake them.
Even the Pharisees and Sadducees, a Generation of Vipers, had
some warning to flee from the wrath to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. Ay
<hi>Felix</hi> an unjust and sinful Judge, cannot but tremble at the
Sermon of this at the bar, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. Thunder will make
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> repent, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. and terror will make <hi>Iudas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> will drive <hi>Ahab</hi> into Sackcloth, and
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the second <hi>Eliah</hi> constrains <hi>Herod</hi> to do many
things. The Scullion that cares not for the foulness of the
coat, will be afraid to handle it when he sees it on fire. The
most covetous man that is, will not dare to dive to the bottom
of the Sea to gather Pearls, or put his hand into a burning
Furnace to hug his gold whilst it is melting. The robber that
threatens on the high way, bring him to the bar and he will
speak supplications. Next to mercy, there is no such Orator
to perswade guilty men, as terror. <hi>We having,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45367:7"/>
               <hi>the terror of the Lord do perswade men.</hi> He speaks of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
before the judgment seat, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. When <hi>Saul</hi>
hears of restitution, then he cryed out, <hi>I have sinned, 1 Sam.
15.</hi> 24. When <hi>Esau</hi> perceived he had lost the blessing indeed,
then he cryed out with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and
with many tears would have perswaded <hi>Isaac</hi> to repent, and
change his resolution, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. Even the worst of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
wilful Apostates that have thrown away mercy, are yet
amazed with judgment, and with a fearful looking for it,
and fiery indignation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
            <p>The Conscience thus awakened by Gods controversy, and
summoned to his Tribunal, will then from the pang and pinch
of terror be marvellous inquisitive after the ways of escape.
As soon as ever <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> lays his Axe to the root of the
tree, the people, the Publicans and Souldiers are every one ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
questions, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 9. 14. When the Plague of Locusts was
upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his House, then he sent to <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> in haste to ask pardon, and intreat the Lord, <hi>Exod. 10.
16.</hi> When God slew <hi>Israel,</hi> then they sought and enquired
early, even when their heart was not right, and when they
were not stedfast in his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 37. Fear is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
inquisitive. <hi>Watchman! what of the night, what of
the night, watchman!</hi> it doubles question upon question, <hi>Isa.
21.</hi> 11, 12. as sorrow doth complaint upon complaint. And
indeed this is an excellent inquiry how we may do to stand
before God; if men were not in this case like <hi>Pilate,</hi> who
ask'd a question but would not stay for an answer, <hi>Ioh. 18.
28.</hi> if they would not anticipate the <hi>Indicavit</hi> in the Text,
but stay for Gods own resolution. But as nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to faith than fear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 26. so nothing hath a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
operation. <hi>He that believeth doth not make hast, Isa.
28.</hi> 16. whereas he that feareth cannot stand still, insomuch
that in mens fears they are said to fly seven ways at once,
<hi>Deuteron.</hi> 28. 7. There is no passion either more solicitous in
asking counsel, or less constant in following that which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45367:7"/>
Yea many times so desperate is the hypocrisy of mens
hearts, that fear or formality force them to ask the question;
yet lust over-rules them to make their own answer. <hi>Iohanan,</hi>
and the people came down to ask counsel what they should
do, whether go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or stay in the land, <hi>Ier. 42. 23?</hi>
but receiving an answer contrary to their expectation, they
tell the Prophet plainly, <hi>that he speaks falsly, cap.</hi> 43. 2.
And another time the people came and sat before that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and enquired of God, but God tells him, <hi>they kept
idols in their hearts,</hi> and resolved they should be counsellors
that should regulate their behaviour, and God would not be
enquired of, <hi>Ezec. 14. 17. 20. 30. chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, men would fain, if possible, reconcile Gods
service and their lust together; and therefore they take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of themselves, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, making God
such a God to themselves, as <hi>Pasquilius</hi> speaks, <hi>as they had
made themselves to be unto him, they would fain be unto
themselves Arbitri religionis &amp; praeceptorum,</hi> even <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ores,</hi>
as <hi>Hilarius Pictaviensis</hi> elegantly speaketh, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
gives the reason of it in another case, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>That every man loves his own way best, as
Parents do their own children; and therefore betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to many inventions of his own.</hi> So long as sin is loved,
and lust retained, men will not go downright to the will of
God, but to carnal reason. When God called to St. <hi>Paul</hi> by
his grace, and revealed Christ unto him, then only it was that
he resolved not to confer with flesh and blood, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.
If <hi>Ahaz</hi> be commanded to believe, and for confirmation of
his faith have a sign offered him, he will not take Gods way
to trust in him, but his own way, an arm of flesh. <hi>I will not
ask, neither will I tempt the Lord, Isai.</hi> 7. 12. Spiritual
things are above the reach of carnal thoughts, Principles, and
not only above them but against them. <hi>The wisdom of the
flesh is enmity to God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. and <hi>the natural man</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knoweth <hi>nor receiveth the things of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45367:8"/>
It is the voice of flesh and blood, <hi>Nolumus hunc,</hi> We will
not have him to rule over us; and therefore as water can
move no higher than the fountain of it, so carnal principles
can carry men no farther than carnal performances. And the
truth is, Carnal men have bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gross and carnal notions of God
and his Kingdom. To be glorifyed, is to be like unto Christ,
<hi>Ph.</hi> 3. As the eye by seeing the Sun is made like unto the Sun,
so he who rejects his image here hath no true desire of his glory
there. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. Having therefore none but carnal notions
of God, they have none but carnal notions of his service too.</p>
            <p>And surely, to say truth, every man is so afraid of the wrath
of God when he begins to understand it, that though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with nothing but flesh and blood, yet he will go far to
escape it.</p>
            <p>1. All outward duties he will perform with all punctual
observation, be they never so full of strictness, costliness, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
never so numerous, never so sumptuous, he will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undertake them all; so <hi>rivers</hi> are used to express abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<hi>Iob</hi> 20. 17. But here is his misery in that point, that
then when he doth multiply them beyond number, yet he doth
dimidiate them by leaving out the sole duties of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and reasonable service, which through the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
should have lead his soul to the substance, and therefore
God objects it to them, <hi>They sacrifice flesh, Hos.</hi> 8. 13.
whereas the sacrifice of God is a broken Spirit, <hi>Psa.</hi> 51. 19.
and therefore he calleth multiplying of sacrifices multiplying of
transgressions, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 4.</p>
            <p>2. He will add unto this, outward rigorous operations, <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulositates
negotiosas,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresseth them. Many
venturous austerities, and supererogations of his own. One
Temple will not serve his turn, but he will build Temples,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 14. One Altar at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall not serve his turn,
but he will have Altars, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 11. One holy City will not
serve his turn, he will run to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and at <hi>Gilgal</hi> multiply
transgressions, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 4. Nay ordinary Sacrifices shall not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45367:8"/>
serve his turn, he will not go to the Herd, and to the Stall
only, for the first-fruit of his Cattel, but to his own bowels
for the first-born of his body; <hi>Ahaz</hi> who would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to take Gods way, would take his own, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 3.
though God commanded it not, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 32.</p>
            <p>A wicked man will part with any thing for salvation
but his sin, and he will sooner sacrifice his Child than sacrifice
his lust, and if it be possible, with the blood of his Son, will
purchase to himself an annuity of sinning. <hi>If Herods child
stand in the way of his timerous ambition, he had better
have been his hog than his son;</hi> as <hi>Augustus</hi> spake.</p>
            <p>And without question did the salvation of men hang upon
this issue, the sacrificing a first-born, as it doth indeed upon
faith, repentance, and new obedience, it would not be they,
who cast it away now by the contempt of these, would be
so merciful to the temporal life of their child as to shipwrack
upon the eternal life of their own.</p>
            <p>If men then might have the deciding of this controversy
in their own power, should we not, think you, hear multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
now speaking like those in our Prophet then, <hi>wherein
shall I come and bow before the high God;</hi> shall I offer up all
my time in Sacrifices? all my substance in devotion? shall I
change a Palace for a Cloister? and put on Sack-cloth instead
of purple? shall I nail mine eyes up to Heaven? and wear out
my lungs with sighs? shall I bruise my breast with buffets, and
torture my back with scourges? shall I wither and shrink up
my body with discipline, and make it a House of correction
to the soul that is in it? will the Lord be pleased with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of sighs, or with rivers of tears? shall I lick up the dust
of the Temple, or kiss the stones of the sanctuary hollow?
Surely to do all these, and leave out <hi>graviora legis,</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
mercy, to abound in voluntary humility, and be puft
up with a fleshly mind, to be taken wholly up with bodily
service, and to leave godliness quite out; to have a leavened
countenance and a Pharisaical Conscience; law in the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45367:9"/>
and lust in the soul that is in it; is all but like him in
<hi>Plutarch, whose lungs were putrifyed, and he went to the
Physician for a whitloe on his finger.</hi> The best outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
though not founded in will-worship but in Gods
own word, are all of them <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Idol, that was brass without, but clay within. It is to do with
religion as men do with the Ostrich, wear the fur or feathers,
but throw away the body.</p>
            <p>We do then, <hi>saith</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus, truly worship
God, when we do imitate him: And the sacrifice does not
sanctify the man, but the conscience doth sanctify the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
<hi>as old</hi> Irenaeus <hi>speaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take away this and you shall often find God vilifying his
own institutions, not as ordained by him, but as depraved by
us. Thus he calls their Sacrifices a shame, <hi>Ho.</hi> 4. 19. their

            <p>Well, but it may be they who bid so high for salvation, so
many thousands, and their very Children for advantage, had
they known a better way, would not failed to have tryed that
too. No; ignorance can they pretend none; for, <hi>Ille indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit,</hi>
he hath not been wanting to shew them what it is which
he requires of them.</p>
            <p>Such is the desperate corruption of the heart of men, even
then when they are frighted with the wrath to come, and very
anxious and solicitous to fly from it; they do yet wilfully shut
their eyes to the right way, choak, suppress, smother in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45367:9"/>
the light of saving truth; delude and cast a mist over
their own conscience, and willingly rather choose their
own wayes from wrath, than God's. <hi>Haec summa delicti
nolle agnoscere quem ignorare non possunt.</hi> So long as men
like not to part with their lusts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cannot away with the
light that discovers them. False wares love not true, but false
lights, nothing but repentance will bring men to acknowledge
the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. when men will lay apart filthiness,
then they will receive the ingraffed word, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 19. when
they will do his will, then they will know his doctrine, <hi>Ioh. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
17.</hi> when they fear him, then they will see his secret, and
have their eyes toward the Lord, <hi>Psa.</hi> 25. 14, 15. when they
are in his way, then they will take his guidance, <hi>Psa.</hi> 32. 8.
But until then they are willingly ignorant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. and
like not to retain God in their knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2. do
resolve to contend against it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8. In the things which
they know in them they corrupt themselves, and though God
hate robbery for burnt-offerings, do yet venture to hope, that
when they have robbed God of substantial duties, he will rest
satisfied with their Sacrifices; and thus they deal with God
just as Bankrupts with their Creditors; think they can put
him off with parcel payment, and compound for so much
in the hundred. So exceeding deceitful is the heart of man, as
then when it fears wrath, it doth not so much as fly from it;
hoodwinks and hides it self, like Cowards when they see a blow
coming do not ward it, but only wink that they may not see
it, and the sum of all their care is to perish by stealth.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto examined the peoples question and
found, First, The Consciences of wicked men, who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

themselves of meeting him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Being thus shaken with the fear of wrath, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous

            <p>Thirdly, Not only making questions, but as it is said of the
Mother of <hi>Sisera,</hi> making answers unto themselves, and not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45367:10"/>
betaking themselves as good men do to the will of God, I will
know what God the Lord will say; but to the dictates
and resolutions of carnal reason, and that making plentiful
offers.</p>
            <p>First, A most exact and scrupulous observation of carnal
duties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of many Arbitrary, and excogitated ways of
will-worship, and supernumerary administrations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All this not for want of means to discover a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way, but only as subterfuges, and evasions, and thickets
for a naked guilty soul which is out of love with the spiritual
and great duties of the law to shelter it self, and take sanctuary
in from the Majesty of Gods presence, and from that tempest
of wrath that did first awaken it.</p>
            <p>And now as the Apostle stopped the mouth of cavilling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters
with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom. 9. 20. O man who art thou!</hi>
and God draws <hi>Adam</hi> out of the thicket, with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>O man he hath

judge him, but if a man sin against God, who shall intreat
for him, 1 Sam. 2. 25. He is not a man as thou art, that
thou shouldst answer him, or come together in judgment, Iob
9.</hi> 32. Are calves, or rams, or children, fit to be Umpires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a sinner and his God? All thy former resolutions though
apparently full of zeal and devotion, and voluntary humility,
neglecting thy estate, thy body, thy bowels, adventuring all
for mercy, were but the poor dictates of flesh and blood; all
of them but the <hi>nudum hominem,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. as if a beggar should offer a bag full of farthings,
or his Child at his back to a Prince for his Crown.
Not thy Sacrifices, nor thy offerings, nor thy rams, nor thy
rivers, or thy Children, or thy bowels will serve the turn.
But <hi>Ille indicavit,</hi> He hath shewed thee O man what is good
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45367:10"/>
to thy self, and to God in his eyes and account. Not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and offerings, he desireth them not, he delighteth not in
them. <hi>Psa.</hi> 51. 16. but to do judgment, and love mercy.</p>
            <p>And yet we may not think that God is careless of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worship, or of any of that external order and decency
which belongs unto it. If they bring the lame, the sick, or
any corrupt thing for a Sacrifice, they shall hear of it with a
curse, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. 14. All things are to be done decently, and
in order. Thus when <hi>Ezra</hi> read in the Book of the law, the
people stood up, and when he prayed they bowed down their
heads, and lifted up their hands, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8. 5, 6. When our
Saviour prayed he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 1.
When the solemn services were ended, the people bowed the
head, and worshipped, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 29. As men use a dead
hedge to preserve a quick; even so the due observance of that
outward order in the people of God, which he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
doth serve both to express, and to bear up that awful and
reverend affectation which the soul should have of him.</p>
            <p>But there is the misery, and the mistake, that evil men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly carnal do rest, and stop at that part of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which stands in carnal ordinances, not being either able
or willing to perform spiritual services for want of spiritual

divine revelation. Look how far he is pleased to stoop unto

saith St. <hi>Basil, The Scripture doth not comply with

to the stone, but the stone to be squared by the ruler; our
straining and wrying of Gods word to our own humours, is
a sin which hath damnation attending it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. and
we find God finding great fault with such service obtruded
upon him as hath not entred into his heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 32. For as
at the omission of what he commands we despise his will, so in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45367:11"/>
obtruding what he commands not, we controll his Wisdome;
in the one we shew our selves careless to obey him; in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we shew ourselves presumptuous to counsel him. We are
the servants of it, and the servant, as the Philosopher saith,
<hi>hath no motion but from the guidance of the principal cause.
Namque coquus domini debet habere gulam,</hi> The cook must
dress his meat to his Masters palate, not to his own. That
<hi>Spartan</hi> which added one string more to his instrument in the
war than was publickly allowed him, though he mended his
musick, yet he marred his obedience, and he was punished for
it. And therefore in all our conversation, especially religious,
and toward God, it is most wisdome, and safest to keep toward
our standard, and publick rule.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the implicit reprehension of defective
and invented service, and proceed now to the great things of the
Law in the text required, judgment, and mercy, that to be
done, this to be loved.</p>
            <p>The same water with is sour in the juice of a fig-tree, is sweet

taste it now in the power and fruit of it, you will find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sweet; for the best sacrifice which any man can offer,
is a purelife, as the Father speaks.</p>
            <p>Many duties in scripture are of a narrow, and contracted
nature, some only spiritual belonging to the soul, others only
corporal belonging to the body, as the Apostle distinguisheth of
some, <hi>filthiness of the flesh and spirit;</hi> but these which are
very often twins in scripture, have a great latitude, reaching both
of them to our bodies, souls, our estates, to all that concerns
Gods glorious name which he proclaimed to <hi>Moses</hi> made up of
these two, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to handle them according to the latitude
of their common places. I shall be able only to put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of some principal particulars.</p>
            <p>To do justly reacheth, as I conceive, in this place unto a three-fold
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45367:12"/>
justice, according to the different conditions of men
Justice in administration, in negotiation, in conversation.</p>
            <p>In administration, and that both sacred, and secular. In
sacred administration, the Ministers of the word are said to
judge, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 20. 4. to be rulers over the houshold to give them
meat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 45. to have power of binding and loosing,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. to have it in their power to avenge disobedience,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. to be Stewards, Embassadors, Officers between
God and man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. and there is no office but justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to it, and that is in this case <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rightly to divide
the word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and to give to every man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
his own <hi>Dimensum,</hi> and allowance. Threats to the obstinate,
promises to gainsayers, comfort to mourners, counsel to the
unsetled. There can be no greater injustice to the souls of men
than to say peace where there is no peace, or to make sad where
the Lord hath not made sad. Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
or adulterate the word of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. to put chaff
with wheat, and dross with silver, and wine with water, and
straw and stubble with precious stones, and the language of
<hi>Ashdod</hi> with the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and leaven with sacrifice,
Samaritan contemperations of purity and Popery, of piety and
profaness. Our Saviour gives us both in a word, <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi>
they must be fed, not poysoned.</p>
            <p>In administration of civil. Thus a Magistrate and Judg is, as
the Philosopher elegantly, <hi>Tanquam argentarius,</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between that which is base, and pretious, and he is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, keeper of the tables of the Law. As the Priestslips
must preserve knowledg, so the Magistrate must preserve
judgment, and the people seek it at their mouth. So long as
there are in common-wealths contentions to be composed, enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to be punished, innocence to be protected, incroachments
to be restrained, property to be distinguished, and preserved,
and in all these manifold emergent difficulties to be resolved,
and antinomies to be reconciled; there will be a necessity of
learned, faithfull and religious Ministers, who may be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positories
of publick justice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45367:12"/>
And when such there are, it is their great work to do judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it is not enough to have it in the brain, to know it, and
in the lips to praise it. <hi>Non loquimur magna, sed vivimus.</hi>
Justice is never in its right place till it come to the hand to do
it. It is not enough for the honour, and security of a Kingdome
that justice be in the Laws, but it must be in the Judges too,
they must be a living and speaking Law. Righteousness in the
Law is but like <hi>Ezechiels</hi> vision of the dead bones in the valley,
they never have the strength of Law till the Magistrate puts
Life into them by execution. Justice in the Law is like Gold in
the mine, which while it is there only, doth no man good; but
when in the Magistrate is like gold coyned, or plate on the
Cupboard for use and honour. A magistrate is the keeper of
publick justice, as the conduit is of common water in a City.
It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and they must let it out for the use of others,
and so the phrase in scripture is <hi>Egrediatur Iudicium, Hab.</hi> 1.
4. It must run down like waters, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 24. and it is said of
it, that he should bring forth judgment unto truth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.
Ambitious hopes, shrinking fears, low passions, domestick ends,
personal interests, foreign compliance and correspondence may
prove miserable weeds and obstructions in the stream of
justice.</p>
            <p>And therefore the sins of Judges and Magistrates in their
publick administrations are called by the Prophet <hi>Mighty sins,
Amos</hi> 5. 12. Diseases in the bones of the common-wealth; for
so much the original word importeth sometimes. Moving of
Foundations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 5. Removing of Bounds, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 10.
which was one of the solemn curses upon mount <hi>Ebal, Deut.</hi>
27. 17.</p>
            <p>Therefore saith the Lord, <hi>I will pour out my wrath upon
them like water,</hi> as a man that pulleth down the sea-banks
letteth in a floud to destroy himself: whereas on the other side
upright and just Magistrates like <hi>Moses</hi> stand in the gap, and are
binders, healers, sanctuaries, hiding places unto the people from
the storm and tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45367:13"/>
2. There is justice in negotiation, which we may in no case leave
out; for if you look but a verse beyond the text, you will find
our Prophet complaining for want of it, and crying out against
<hi>scant measure, wicked balances, deceitfull and light weights,</hi>
10, 11. scant measures will fill up a full measure of guilt, and light
weights bring upon the soul a heavy weight of judgment. The
Prophet makes mention of wickedness in an Ophir, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. 8.
And therefore as <hi>Iob</hi> was carefull that the Furrows of the field
might not complain of him, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 38. so be you carefull that
your Ephah, and your balance, which are unto you your lands
and your furrows, (as the Prophet calls it the <hi>harvest of the sea,
Isaiah</hi> 23. 3.) do not cry out unto God against you: <hi>Let not
any one</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>defraud, or over-reach his brother
in any matter, for God is the avenger of those things, 1 thes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
4. 6. Take heed of severing the portion of gain from godliness,
to esteem all good profit that comes in by sordid and sinfull
acts; a snare, a temptation, a drowning follows upon it, 1 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
6. 9. He that overloads his ship though it be with gold, heaps it
up for the sea, and not for himself. Learn so to converse with
the world as not to be without God in the world. Let not the
Ephah and the sheckle wrangle with the New Moon, and the
Sabbath, as it is, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. Let not the world get into your
hearts to choke the word. Your coffers are good enough for
money, keep your consciences for God. They who go down
into mines to dig up gold and silver, carry candles with them,
and when the damp comes though it be gold they dare not
stay with it: your trades are your mines out of which you dig
your treasure; sink not your selves into them without <hi>Davids</hi>
Lanthorn, the word of God; and if your consciences feel the
damp of the Earth, covetous lust begin to work, then make
hast upward with <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Incline my heart unto thy
testimonies, and not to covetousness, Psal.</hi> 119. 26. Though
you may not carry the shop into the Temple, &amp; make that a place
of money-changers; yet you must not thrust the Temple out
of the shop; there is no place but holiness will become it. In
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45367:13"/>
the Prophet a merchant is called <hi>Chanan, Hos.</hi> 12. 7. but in the
parable a Christian is called a merchant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45. Remember
in your professions to be Christians and not Canaanites.</p>
            <p>3. There is justice in conversation, which is a sincere, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
square, faithfull conversing with men; when a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to his word, fixed to his honest resolutions, yesterday and
to day the same, this makes a man like unto God whose name is
<hi>One, Zach.</hi> 14. 9. Like unto him whose name is <hi>Amen, Rev.</hi> 3.
14. And therefore we being members of him of whom we can
learn nothing but what should be true and just one to another,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. It is said of <hi>Asper</hi> a servant of the Emperour <hi>Leo,
That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> finding him fail in performance of promise, <hi>he laid hold
of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> purple robe, and told him it was too rich a cover for
falshood.</hi> Certainly it is not fit that such a robe as the name of
Christ should be used to shroud and palliate deceit; and indeed
such kind of unjust and false men, who are like him possessed of
an unclean spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 29. whom <hi>no bonds can hold,</hi> who
care not how many they deceive, if they can have but a cloak
to palliate it; who like the Serpent will insinuate, and then sting;
like the Cockatrice weep, and then bite; like the Panther
allure with the sweet breath, and then destroy with her sharp
teeth; who make truth give place to turns, and for advantage
say and unsay, do and undo; like those in <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,
Iohns</hi> to day, and <hi>Iudases</hi> to morrow. Such men as these are
not members but ulcers in the common body, and they must
be sure that that justice which they hate will find them out at
the last; for <hi>men of bloud and deceit shall not live out half
their days, Psa.</hi> 55. 23.</p>
            <p>But we no sooner hear of sincerity, but presently mercy like
<hi>Rachel</hi> as the more beautiful calls upon us for our love to her.
I will not curiously inquire into the reason, why justice is bid
to be done, but mercy to be loved: for of Christ it is said that
he loved righteousness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 1. But surely for the punishing
part of justice, <hi>Ieremy</hi> tells us, that he did not desire the
wofull day though he did denounce it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 16. yea God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45367:14"/>
himself when he oft beateth, doth it not willingly, he hath <hi>no
pleasure in the death of a sinner;</hi> but when he saveth, when he
sheweth mercy, in that he delighteth, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
            <p>Haply to give unto a man that which he hath a just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and claim unto, men can be contented to do; 'tis violence
and robbery to withold it: but when we must give that which
is our own to another, here grudging and unwillingness may
creep in upon us. Now in justice I give a man that which is his,
but in mercy I give that which is mine own; and therefore
to prevent repining, I am called upon not only to do it, but to
do it cheerfully, heartily, willingly, to love mercy, to draw out
the soul in it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1. I shall not need to inquire the nature
or kind of it; if it were as well in our hearts and hands as it is in
our heads, we should need the less to be bid to love it. In one
word there is <hi>Misericordia donans,</hi> a bountifull mercy, and
<hi>misericordia condonans,</hi> a pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>Mercy to them; the mercy of relief to those who are in any
distress; be as <hi>Iob</hi> was, <hi>eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the poor, Iob</hi> 29. 15. To instruct the ignorant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the wandring, confirm the weak, comfort the distressed,
exhort thesluggish, support the feeble, cloth the naked, feed the
hungry, heal the sick, harbour the harbourless, wash the feet,
and minister to the necessities of the brethren.</p>
            <p>Pardon; to shew mercy to those that are overtaken in a fault,
forgiving one another, and forbearing one another. It is a
grave observation which the Historian makes, when he compares
the different dealings of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> in crimes which
were much alike, <hi>Non minus firmatum Imperiu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> That
Government was as much honoured by mercy shewed to the
one, as by the ruine of the other.</p>
            <p>I shall use but three inducements unto both these duties of
mercy.</p>
            <p>First, the excellency of it, nothing makesus so like unto God.
That which St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 36. St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
calls <hi>persection, Mat.</hi> 5. 48. When God shewed <hi>Moses</hi> his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45367:14"/>
glory, it was by his goodness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 18. His name full of
mercy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. His works full of mercy, the Earth full,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 5. the Heaven full, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 5. knowledg, wisdome,
power, greatness; Evil men may have some resemblance of,
but none can imitate God in mercy but good men: for <hi>the
mercies of the wicked are cruel, Pro.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Necessity of it unto all. For the truth is, as <hi>Solon</hi>
said to <hi>Croesus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Every man is calamity it
self, corrupting the life, distressing the conscience; sorrows
wounding the heart, and fears weakening it; death making
pleasures short, and guilt making life bitter. What difference
doth a Fever make between a Lord, and a begger, or what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
doth lightning and thunder observe more toward a Cedar
than a shrub? All have need of mercy, therefore all must
love it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The benefit of it. No grace hath more abundant
promises made unto it than this of mercy, a sowing, a reaping,
a thrifty grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>Solomons</hi> excellent houswife
stretched out both her hands to the needy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 20.
Every tear that your mercy wipes away, every sigh and groan
that it removeth, every back that it clothes, every belly that it
fills, every sinking and oppressed man that it relieves, turn all
into so many advocates, sollicitors and reall promises to procure
greater mercies for you than you have been able to extend
to them.</p>
            <p>And now that you may always be in a readiness to come
before God in these great duties of justice, and mercy; he is
always in a readiness to come unto you, and teach you what
he requires of you. <hi>He hath shewed thee O Man.</hi> Man the
author of the enmity, but God the director unto peace and
reconciliation. And ever where God requires a duty, he doth
first reveal a light, and according to the light which he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
is the account which he requires; <hi>where much is given
much shall be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely in all Gods service either sacred or civil, we must
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45367:15"/>
have an <hi>Indicavit</hi> for what we do: we can have no knowledg,
wisdome, obedience to serve Cod, but only out of the scripture,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Athanasius</hi>
speaks, out of the holy Scriptures, not out of the abundance of
our own hearts. If we pray it must be according to his will,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. if preach it must be according to his counsel, <hi>Ier.</hi>
25. 22. if hear it must be what God the Lord will say,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>That which goes unto God must first come from him; as
waters return to the sea, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as one well spake; <hi>we
must pay our tribute in the Princes own coyn,</hi> we must not
out our dead child into his bosom, and think he will own
it.</p>
            <p>And here if I had time it would be worth the pains to insist
a little on the plenitude of Holy Scripture which the Ancients
so much adored, and so it behoves all Gods Ministers both
sacred and civil never to speak any thing by the authority of
God, except we have his <hi>Indicavit</hi> and <hi>requisivit</hi> to bear us
out. Having always an eye to that dreadfull intermination,
<hi>He that speaks any thing in my name which I have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, even that Prophet shall dye, Deut.</hi> 18. 20. It
would infinitely conduce to the peace of the Church and
State, to the honour of Religion and justice, and to the avoiding
of envy or scandal, if every person in his order would regulate
all his demeanours and administrations with a <hi>Quid requisivit,</hi>
what is it that God would have me to do.</p>
            <p>And lastly since we cannot do our duty, without an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit</hi>
from him; they shall all be taught of God; therefore
his <hi>indicavit</hi> should be seconded by our Meditation; his
<hi>requisivit</hi> with our requesting; his precepts and promises
with our prayers; for he will be sought unto for what he
promiseth, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 37. That he would make his way
plain before our eyes, that so we may not only do the
things which he requireth, but in doing them to walk with
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45367:15"/>
For the very Philosopher could say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
It is not the matter but the manner makes
up the work.</p>
            <p>1. Then, it must be ambulation, a constant tenor; a good
man must be always like himself. Do what you can to gold,
it will keep its nature in the fire. That is gold in justice and
mercy indeed, which in all cases, when persons, passions,
prejudices, favour, interests offer to immix themselves, keeps
its nature intire still.</p>
            <p>2. It must be <hi>Cum Deo</hi> with an eye to God, his word the
rule; his fear the principle; his glory the end: that wha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
we do may not be for the gratifying of men, that we m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
walk honourably before them; but for the pleasing of God,
that we may walk acceptably before him; for else God will
complain of them as he did of those in the Prophet, <hi>Did you
do it to me even to me, saith the Lord, Zach.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
            <p>3. It must be done with seeking of God, but yet it must
be with denying of our selves; when we have done justice,
and loved mercy, and pleased God, we may rejoyce in it,
we may not boast of it, we must walk humbly still, like the
Moon, the nearer we come to the Sun of righteousness, the
less glory we must assume unto our selves. Our justice must
stand in fear of Gods justice, lest that consume it; and our
mercy must cry to Gods mercy, that that may cover it. If
<hi>Moses</hi> the justest and meekest man in his generation will
appear before God he must have a hiding place to cover
him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 21.</p>
            <p>When we have done the uttermost we can, we must go
to God as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, <hi>Remember me O God, spare me
according to the multitude of thy mercies, Neh. 13. 22.
Non gloriabor quia justus sum, sed gloriabor quia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptus
sum,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks. Our righteousness here
stands not in the perfection of our virtues, but in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sins. <hi>Vae etiam laudabili vitae hominum,
si remotâ misericordiâ discutias eam.</hi> But this is our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45367:16"/>
great comfort and security, that as stubble being covered
with <hi>Amianthum</hi> (as <hi>Athanasius</hi> speaks) can endure the
fire, so we have Christ and his righteousness with which men
cannot only stand before God, but walk with him too as
with <hi>Our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In faith, and confidence. Take away the Sun, and all
the Stars of Heaven would never make day: So if a man
have as many moral virtues as there be Stars in the firmament,
and were destitute of faith in Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
have not God for his God, there would be night and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
in his soul still. Without faith there is no walking
with God; for two will not <hi>walk together unless they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
agreed, Amos</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>But O what madness is it for man to disagree with God;
for <hi>Adam</hi> to arm himself with fig-leaves against his maker, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
briars to rise in rebellion against fire, or smoke to withstands
a whirlwind? Remember thy nature, that will teach thee
thy duty. <hi>For he hath shewed thee O man!</hi> And what
is man? <hi>Abraham</hi> will tell us in two words, <hi>Dust and
Ashes.</hi> Dust by his original, which came from Earth; Ashes
by desert, which carry him to the fire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 10. The
Law, a Law of fire, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 33. 2. The prison a lake of fire,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 10. the Judge a consuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18.
with whom he may not contend, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6. 10. from whom
he cannot escape, <hi>Psal.</hi> 129. 7. Consider then what thou
art O man, submit to a severe judgment, where there is a
record kept, an appeal entred, a writ of Error inforced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
every miscarriage of thine. Therefore O man do
justly, and being of the same mould with thy Brother, set
thy self in his stead, <hi>Iob</hi> 16. 4. We are all of us like leaves
of trees, as <hi>Homer</hi> elegantly. That wind which blows away
my neighbour to day, may blow away me to morrow. That
mercy that I deny to him, I may live to see denied to
my self.</p>
            <p>The rich man who withheld erums was denyed drops,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45367:16"/>
               <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. 24. Consider then what thou art O man, guilty
of sins, subject to misery, thou art forced to beg mercy,
be perswaded to love it.</p>
            <p>Again, consider thou art <hi>Adam,</hi> Earth, and that is the
lowest of all the elements: <hi>Dust thou art,</hi> said God to man,
<hi>Dust thou shalt eat,</hi> said God to the Serpent. So man is,
fitter to be a prey to Satan than a companion to his Maker.
Of this dust indeed God made a vessel, and put a treasure
of knowledg, and righteousness in it. But what reason
hath the cup to be proud of the wine, or the bag of the money
which men put into it? Thou hast received, why shouldst thou
boast, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
            <p>But we are become now broken vessels, that retain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but dregs, our drink is become <hi>Merum Resract arium,</hi>
sour and corrupt, <hi>Hag.</hi> 4. 18. The pot is become a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherd. Consider then O man, that thou art made of
Earth, though made for Heaven; in the one respect walk
with God, but in the other respect humble thy self to
do it. <hi>Te ad sidera tollet.</hi> No advancement to such an
humility.</p>
            <p>Thou hast his Majesty to awe thee, no approaching his
presence but by Humility, <hi>with that man will I dwell that
is of an humble Spirit, Isaiah 57. 15. Zaccheus</hi> must
come down if he will have. Christ abide in his House,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 5.</p>
            <p>Thou hast his mercy to aid thee, he will shew thee what
is good; <hi>The meek he will guide in judgment, Psalm</hi> 25. 9.
and therefore he hath chosen these two Humble graces as
pipes to convey mercy to the soul; by faith, which teacheth
us to deny our selves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. and repentance, which teacheth
us to abhorr our selves, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Thou hast his example to instruct thee, <hi>Who is like to
the Lord our God who dwelleth on high and humbleth
himself, Psal.</hi> 113. 5. Christ a King, one who doth justly
