            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eſides the Obligation I have to you by Nature, your Goodneſſe hath given you the greateſt intereſt that may be in my Time and Studies; of which if I have made any improvement, it is purely the Product and Influence of your Favour: The ſenſe hereof hath made me prefix your Name to this Endeavour of mine, upon no other deſign then to make a publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that my ſelf and ſtudies hold
<pb facs="tcp:56008:3"/>of you as of the chief Lord. And if the pettineſſe of what I tendr you here, be apt to diſable the juſtice of mine acknowledgments, you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelf that a Roſe or a pound of Cummin, hath often been all the Rent-ſervice that hath been reſerved upon Eſtates of no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable value.</p>
            <p>That, that I here preſent you with, is the Life of Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> one of the greateſt Ornaments of the Law, a man of thoſe high employments, and ſo great parts to go through them, that he can be no ſtranger to you, nor doubt of a kind reception, eſpecially ſeeing you are of as eminent courteſie as parts. I ſhall not venture to give any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:56008:3"/>Character of him, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to you, but rather on the contrary expect that he will plead the boldneſs of my <hi>Dedication,</hi> and aſſure my ſelf a favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my poor labours from his vaſt worth.</p>
            <p>Sir I have dealt with him as his Nurſe did, thrown him over the hedge into your Armes, leſt his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſhould periſh in the waters of <hi>Lethe:</hi> Or as ſome common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who, if he have but common civility, finding ſome perſon of great quality lying amongſt the dead bodies and ready to become one of them, will make a ſhift with a rude charity to lugger him out of the field, und think himſelf ſufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:56008:4"/>rewarded with the honour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his life: I, (as I travelled over the Memorials of the ancient <hi>Heroes</hi>) met with this worthy Knight breathing his laſt in the field of honour; and an ordinary ſenſe of humanity ingaged me (though unworthy that office) to reſcue him from oblivion; unhandſomely I confeſſe, but excuſably, becauſe I could no better, my weak capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in the very beginning of this enterprize, being overwhelmed with the plenty and copiouſneſſe of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I am confident, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was not ſo much his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as to forbid poſterity to think well of him; nor his Sentence, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:56008:4"/>ſevere, as to condemne his Name as well as his Body, to an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his Name no more deſerved to die, then my pen does to preſerve it; yet (which affords me ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,) what the Reader wants in this Book, hee'l find in his Life: with which alſo (I hope) I have a good plea for the inconſiderableneſſe of any thing, which I can offer in return of all thoſe obligations you have been pleaſed to lay upon mee; which ſince I am never able to wipe off by ſtrict and punctual ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I preſume your goodneſſe will by a favourable acceptation hold me diſcharg'd in Chancery:</p>

But becauſe you ſay the Biſhop burnt them al I will here tell the truth of the whole matter: Some were only of private matters; as about our old friendſhip and acquaintance; one of them was in anſwer to his, whereby he deſired of me to know how I had anſwered in my exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to this Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: Touching which, this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I wrote unto him again, that I had already ſet led my conſcience, let him ſettle his to his own good liking; and no other anſwer I gave him, God is my witneſſe, as God I hope ſhal ſave this my ſoul and this I truſt is no breach of your Laws.</p>

                     <note place="margin">4. The law of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy like a two-edged ſword.</note>The laſt objected crime is, that being examined in the Tower, I did ſay that this Law was like a two-edged Sword; for in conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereto I ſhould endangen

Whereto I reply, that my anſwer there was but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; if there be danger in both either to allow or diſallow this Statute and therefore like a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword, it ſeemeth a hard thing, that it ſhould be offered to me, that never have hitherto contradicted it either in word, or deed. Theſe were my words; what the Biſhop anſwered, I know not. If his anſwer were like mine it proceeded not from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of ours, but from the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our wits and learning. To conclude, I unfeignedly avouch that I never ſpake word againſt this Law to any living man; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps his Majeſty hath been told the contrary.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this full anſwer the Atturny replyed no more, but the word <hi>Malice,</hi> was in the mouth of all the

                  </note> yet for all this, for proof to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was guilty of this Treaſon, Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth to give evidence unto them upon his Oath; which he did affirming that which was ſpoken of before in their diſcourſe in the Tower: againſt whom now ſworn Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> began in this manner to ſpeak: <hi>If I were a man, my Lords, that did not regard an Oath, I needed not at this time in this place (as it is well known to you all) ſtand as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed perſon.</hi>
