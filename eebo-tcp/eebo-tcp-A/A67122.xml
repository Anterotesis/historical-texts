         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon receit of this letter containing much other laviſh and menacing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton repaired to the Right Reverend, the then Biſhop of London, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> King their Dioceſan, acquainted him with the buſineſſe, and requeſted his Lordſhip to convent M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker and himſelf, and to heare them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not refuſing, if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker could make his charge good againſt him, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch cenſure and penalty as he ſhould be deemed thereby to have juſtly deſerved; otherwiſe requiring due ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by his Lordſhips means from him who had wronged him in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But the Biſhop perſwaded M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton rather, according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walkers own Propoſition, to referre the matter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107259:5"/>
to ſuch a number of their brethren the Miniſters as were by him mentioned, and ſo to make a private end of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Whereunto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton returned this anſwer, That howſoever he deſired rather that his Lordſhip would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have the hearing of it himſelf, yet ſince that he ſeemed to like better of the other courſe by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was well content to condeſcend thereunto, ſo be that his Lordſhip would be pleaſed to aſſigne one of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains then preſent to be one of the foure to be nominated by him, though a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him; for that he cared not who they were, acquaintance or ſtrangers, ſo they be godly and learned, that ſhould heare and judge his cauſe. And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop accordingly promiſed that it ſhould ſo be, aſſigning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry Maſon, a grave and reverend Divine, being then and there preſent, to undertake that office with ſuch others as were to be adjoyned unto him in the ſame: who yet ſurviving in the City is able to teſtifie of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with the Biſhop, whether it were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107259:5"/>
according to this relation or no. For I have this onely from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton's own report (though nothing doubtfull of the truth of it) who meeting me accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Pauls Church as he came from the Biſhop, having not ſeen him long before, ſhewed me M<hi rend="sub">r</hi> Walker's letter, told me what ſpeech he had had thereupon with the Biſhop, and what by the Biſhops per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion he had yielded unto; withall requeſting me to be one of thoſe that were on his part to be named for the diſcuſſing and deciding of this difference. Which motion of his albeit I deſired to wave, wiſhing him rather to make choiſe of ſome other, both nearer at hand, and of better abilities, the City affoording ſuch not a few; yet at his inſtant requeſt, the rather preſſing it upon me, becauſe he had, as he ſaid, ſo happily light upon me unexpected, and notwithſtanding that he knew before my judgement in ſome particulars to differ from his, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both by word of mouth, and in writing alſo ſometime at his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt manifeſted to him as much, yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107259:6"/>
making no reckoning thereof, I was at length induced to condeſcend thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker undertook ſo to do; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton required onely to have M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Walker's ſaid writing delivered unto him ſome two or three dayes before the ſet time of our next meeting, that he might againſt that day prepare a brief anſwer thereunto, in writing then to be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The motion was on either ſide deemed equall; nor did M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf miſlike it.</p>
            <p>Now by this means, God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo diſpoſing it (which at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in likelihood was little dreamed of) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton, as <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.4.</note> Abel, though deceaſed, is inabled to ſpeak in his own defence, and to plead now his own cauſe as well as then he did.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walkers Parallel, and therein his Evidence produced for the proof of his charge above mentioned, you ſhall have in his own words as it was then given in; thoſe pieces of it onely that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Latine being faithfully tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word for word, as near as could be, into Engliſh, becauſe in Engliſh M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker's book with the renewed Charge is abroad.</p>

            <p>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this ſecond Errour, but am unjuſtly charged to be guilty of hereſie and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for holding one and the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with him in all points in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification.</p>

               <note place="margin">Errour 3.</note>The third Errour is, <hi>That Faith doth not justifie us, as it apprehendeth and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe; but by it ſelf, in a proper not metonymicall ſenſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I hold this Propoſition to be falſe; acknowledging and confeſſing that Faith doth not juſtifie us but onely as it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth and applieth Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe; the very condition of the Goſpel being, That by Faith we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and apply Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to be juſtified thereby, <hi>Treat. of Justifie. in explic. of the definit. of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil.</hi>

            <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>That Faith doth juſtifie us by it ſelf in a proper not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymicall ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never ſaid or thought that Faith doth juſtifie us by it ſelf.

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107259:16"/>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this third Errour, but am unjuſtly charged to be guilty of hereſie and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for holding one and the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with him in all points in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Errour 4.</note>The fourth Errour is, <hi>That for Faith properly taken, and dignified and made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, not of it ſelf but in Gods acceptation and of his mercy a man is justified, and may lay claim to remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Neither Socinus nor Servetus (in the words you bring out of them) affirm that a man is juſtified and may lay claim to remiſſion of ſinnes, for Faith any way dignified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, Socinus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth, that Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life is that by which that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes which is brought by Chriſt is obtained, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 322. <hi>col.</hi> 1.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107259:16"/>
of our Juſtification to our Saviour Chriſt and his obedience.</p>
            <p>That which is alledged out of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers is no more but this, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel being Faith, as the condition of the Law is Keeping of the Law; he that believeth in Chriſt hath done as much, that is, performed the condition of the Goſpel, as well as he that keepeth the Law hath fulfilled the condition of the Law: ſo that on his part God requireth no more to his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>And that this is certainly my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the words going before in that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh paper, and thoſe alſo that follow in the other Engliſh paper, and in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, do manifeſtly ſhew.</p>
            <p>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this fourth Errour, but am unjuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be guilty of hereſie and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie for holding one and the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in all points in the doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Errour 5.</note>The fifth Errour is, <hi>That Faith is no firm perſwaſion by which we apprehend and

lay hold upon Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe, and apply them to our ſelves as of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to us by our ſpirituall union; but that it is a truſt and confidence in Christ for ſalvation, joyned with obedience to Chriſts precepts: or (to ſpeak plainly) a confidence that Chriſt, having obtained by his obedience the kingdome and all power, will certainly give us ſalvation if we rely on him and obey his counſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Whether the three Propoſitions ſet down in this Errour, be rightly gathered from the words alleaged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker out of Socinus or no, I leave to other mens judgement. But whatſoever Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus held, I have nothing to do with any of theſe Propoſitions. Onely of the firſt I ſay, That the perſwaſion, whereof I ſpeak in the place he bringeth, is that particular aſſurance that every man (as ſome define Faith) muſt have to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>viz.</hi> that his ſinnes are forgiven in Chriſt: Whereas Faith (being the condition required on our part) muſt go before Juſtification, at leaſt in nature. But this perſwaſion followeth it, and is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107259:17"/>
bred in us by the Spirit of God after we believe and are juſtified. For it is given to us, being already adopted Sons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. and Adoption is a Prerogative vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed us upon our believing, <hi>John</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this fifth Errour, but am unjuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be guilty of hereſie and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for holding one and the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in all points in the doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Errour 6.</note>The ſixth Errour is, <hi>That Chriſts whole obedience and Righteouſneſſe ſerve firſt and immediately for himſelf to bring him into favour and authority with God; and ſecondly, onely for us: Not that it might be communicated to us in him, to make us truly and formally righteous; but onely that it might ſerve for our uſe, in that it maketh him gracious with God, and ſo both able to obtain, that Faith might be accepted for Righteouſneſſe and we for it; and alſo powerfull to give thoſe bleſsings which are promiſed to thoſe that truſt in him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is nothing in this ſixth Errour that toucheth me.</p>
            <p>All that I ſay, in the former place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker, is no more but this; That whatſoever maketh Chriſt beloved of God is ſome cauſe of Gods love to us who are beloved in and for him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 6. Now among other things for which Chriſt is beloved, his holineſſe and obedience have no mean place. Whereupon it followeth that they may be reckoned in the number of thoſe cauſes that make us beloved of God in and for his Sonne our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Treat. of Justific. of a Sinner, in explic. of the Definit. of Reconcil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter I ſay, That we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be Formally Righteous, by having fulfilled the Law and ſatisfied the Juſtice of God in Chriſt. And yet I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we are (for his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107259:18"/>
accepted of God as righteous no leſſe then if we had indeed performed thoſe things. And this was determined in the firſt Errour to be neither hereſie nor blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this ſixth Errour, but am unjuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be guilty of hereſie and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for holding one and the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in all points in the doctrine of Juſtification.</p>

            <p>But I acknowledge and profeſſe that Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for us, by paying a true price to God his Father for us: and that God doth not pardon us but for and in reſpect of that payment made for us.</p>
            <p>In the places alledged out of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings I ſay no more, but that we cannot be held to have ſatisfied the wrath of God in Chriſt, and withall to be truly and properly pardoned.

            <p>Therefore I agree not with Socinus in this ſeventh Errour, and (having cleared my ſelf of agreeing with him in any of the ſeven) am unjuſtly charged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker to be guilty of hereſie and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for holding one and the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with Socinus in all points in the doctrine of Juſtification.</p>

            <head>The Iſſue.</head>
            <p>THus have you both M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker's charge and evidence, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Anſwer in his own Defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. You exſpect now (I ſuppoſe) in the next place to heare what the Iſſue of it was. Upon the delivery in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and view of both compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was by word of mouth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debating of the ſeverall points at large, as well between M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton, as by the parties nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on either ſide among themſelves. Who albeit they agreed not with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton in all particulars; and in ſome things then debated were not all of one mind, as in that queſtion occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton's anſwer to one branch of the laſt Article, to wit, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the work of redemption the faithfull be conſidered as one with Chriſt, or no:</hi> or in plainer terms, <hi>Whether our inſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Chriſt in the order of Nature be deemed to precede the work of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or the work of our redemption in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107259:20"/>
the order of nature to go before it:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, being ſomewhat a nice ſubtiltie, they were divided; ſome holding the one part, and ſome the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet ſo farre were they from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton as guilty of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and blaſphemie in the points above mentioned, as that they profeſſed divers of them, and that ſome of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker's own choice, no one denying or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the reſt therein, to have oft taught ſome of them, namely the ſecond, to wit, <hi>That faith is a condition appointed by God to be performed on our part for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtification</hi>: which yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker affirmed to be a moſt dangerous errour.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, it was without further queſtion or contradiction of any of the whole eight then preſent, as well the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the one as thoſe aſſigned by the other, with unanimous conſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reſolved and pronounced, that there appeared not to them either here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or blaſphemy in ought that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker convinced to have delivered or maintained.</p>

            <p>Now howſoever the Doctour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon ſome pretences refuſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it as he had promiſed to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſſed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker to detain it or no, I wot not, himſelf beſt knoweth: yet for the truth of this iſſue, as it hath here been related in the behalf of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it will plainly appear by the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two of thoſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walkers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yet ſurviving (for a third is deceaſed,

And as for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Godwin, to me a mere ſtranger in regard of any acquaintance, one whom I never heard or ſaw to my knowledge, ſave once of late occaſionally at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of a friend, nor know certainly what he holdeth or hath taught, I ſay no more, but as they ſometime of their ſonne, <note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>Aetatem habet,</hi> he is old enough, and (for ought I know) able enough to anſwer for himſelf: and he ſurviveth yet ſo to do if he ſee good.</p>
            <p>But whether Peter Abeilard ever moved this Queſtion which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker ſaith he was the firſt mover of, to wit, <hi>Whether faith, or the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be imputed in the act of juſtification,</hi> is to me a great queſtion. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker's reading herein (as, I confeſſe, it may well be) is better then mine, if he can ſhew where either he did ever handle it, or is reported ſo to have done. Nor do I find in all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calvines large relation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of Servetus his blaſphemies, where ever he propounded or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any queſtion in ſuch terms, as this by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107259:27"/>
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker is here conceived in. For So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus, it is true, that in proſecution of his diſcourſes, wherein he laboureth to prove Chriſt to be ſuch a Saviour onely as was out of him before deſcribed, he is inforced to acknowledge, that Faith, ſuch as he meaneth, that is, <hi>Obedience to Chriſts commandments doth juſtifie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to ought done or ſuffered by Chriſt, any ſatisfaction made by him, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his</hi>; neither of which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth: And the like may be deduced from what Servetus held, (though his aſſertions, as Calvine alſo well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, are found oft to enterfere, and to croſſe one another) and from that alſo that Abeilard is by Bernard charged to have held.</p>
            <p>But if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker will father this upon him concerning the deniall of the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, becauſe from his poſitions it may be deduced, he might have riſen a great deal higher, and have fetched in Simon Magus, Ebion, Cerinthus, Marcion, Manes, and a whole rabble of old hereticks (and out of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107259:28"/>
ancient ſtories of the Church made a liſt as large almoſt as his book is long) from whoſe peſtilent poſitions the ſame might as well be deduced, as from thoſe things that Abeilardus and Servetus maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Again, neither is this ſufficient to prove a point to be hereticall and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, becauſe it may be deduced from aſſertions of that nature: for if we ſhall condemn as hereticall and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whatſoever by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may be extracted from thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that ſome blaſphemous hereticks have held, the like cenſure may then, yea muſt then be paſſed upon many ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox tenets, in the negative eſpecially, maintained by us againſt the Church of Rome, ſince that they follow neceſſarily from thoſe grounds that by ſuch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have been held. For example: <hi>That Christs body is not really preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, nor is ſacrificed and offered up to God in the Maſſe,</hi> doth neceſſarily follow from the opinion of <note n="c" place="margin">

            <p>And let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker conſider this calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeriouſly with himſelf: He hath put down this in his Parallel for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and blaſphemous aſſertion, <hi>That Faith [in Chriſt</hi>] (for ſo he muſt needs mean) <hi>is a condition appointed by God to be performed on our parts for the obtaining of Juſtification.</hi> Now ſhould any man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enter an action againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker, accuſing him as guilty of Judaiſme, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme and Mahumetaniſme, would he not, think we, make grievous complaint, yea with open mouth cry out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim of extreme injury done him? Yet is it as clear as the light at noon-day, that whoſoever ſhall deny Faith in Chriſt to be a condition appointed by God to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107259:29"/>
performed on mans part for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtification, ſhall have all Jews, Paganes, and Mahumetanes concurring therein with him, as in a point naturally flowing and neceſſarily following from what they hold.</p>
            <p>To go yet a ſtep further; Suppoſe a man do concurre with ſuch hereticks as have been ſpoken of in ſome point, be it a truth or an errour that is held and maintained by them, will it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he conſenteth to them and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with them in all things, or in ſuch blaſphemous opinions as they otherwiſe hold? And here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker's candour may well a little be queſtioned. To prove M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton to hold one and the ſame opinion with Servetus in all points concerning the doctrine of Juſtification, he produceth onely this one ſaying of Servetus, <hi>For one act of Faith was Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham righteous.</hi> Whether he have proved M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wotton to have ſaid the ſame or no, is not now materiall, and I leave it to be judged by what himſelf hath ſpoken for his own defence in way of anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107259:30"/>
