            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent which, I wrote this treatiſe: in which I haue layed my ſelfe open to the world; to the intent, that I may attract the loue of the vertuous, and the hate of all thoſe who continue vitious: for, I hold him to be no honeſt man, that is beloued of all men.

I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it againe and againe, that I depend on Vertue. And, if I wax poore in her

may leade me) that the world may be acquainted with the ſecrets of my ſoule, and may receiue from me a teſtimonie of my liuely faith; that ſo it may iudge the more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of mee being dead. Thus much for my ſelfe. Now, gentle or vngentle Reader; concerning thee, I diuide thee into Learned, and Vnlearned: and the Learned I ſubdiuide into Iudicial, and Not-indiciall.

As for impudent aſſes, who will reprehende vvhat their ſhallowe vvits can neither apprehende, nor comprehende, and ſo turne deſpaire into iudgement, I hold them fitter to read bills, and ballads, then my Booke.

look into this worſt of ages, ſhall finde, that the laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heathen Poets were but as wicked prophets of the wickednes to come in theſe accurſed times; wee hauing turned their lewde inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into more lewd actions. So that it ſeemes wee haue anatomized vice, and laied thoſe parts of her to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen viewe, which they in modeſty let lie vndiſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. From the higheſt to the loweſt, from the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the oldeſt, from the Eagle to the Wren, all haue corrupted their waies, and are becom degenerate from the purity of their anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.

Vice hath ſupplanted vertue: and he now a-dayes is helde the moſt abſolute man, who is the moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute liuer.

And when I was borne, I receiued the common ayre, and fell vpon the earth, which is of like nature, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weeping at the firſt as all other doe.

It were too tedious a thing here to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde the myſtery of mans conception, which in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is no leſſe pleaſing, then ſtrange, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The firſt gift man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues from Nature after his conception, is feeling; the next is moouing: and after he hath receiued the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his perfect, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect forme, ſhee giues him birth. He is no ſooner borne, but his reaſonableſoule (as di uining his troubles to com) makes him bawl and crie: and, hauing nothing but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherewith to vent his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6644:61"/>
pasſion, he ſheddeth teares. Well, as comming from a woman, he is referred to the care of a woman; who ſpends all her time (yet all little enough) to dreſſe him, to ſtill him, to watch him, and to wipe awaie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of this excrement. The firſt word hee ſpeakes bewraies vanitie: and as ſoone as his legs are able to vnderprop the burthen of his body, he goes to vanitie. He waxeth Idolatrous, and beholdes a baby made of clouts, a woodden puppie, or a paper birde, with an eye of worſhip &amp; adoration. He liued in his mothers wombe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6644:61"/>
like a plant, came out from thence like a beaſt, and ſo ſtill remaines, till inſtitution faſhion his Intellect, and make it capable of reaſon. Hauing now left to crie of himſelfe, he is ſent to ſchool; where he is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and exerciſe this wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping trade: and there hee ſpendes the third part of his life, in teares, ſighes, and ſobs. Being thus bound in obedience, and ſeruitude, he deſires to ſhake off captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will bee no more commanded, but obeyed. Hauing rule ouer others, hee cannot gouerne himſelfe; but purſues whatſoeuer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6644:62"/>
and humour, lead him to. Ifhe haue plenty, hee is riotous, luxurious, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, not accounting of the accounts hee ſhall one daie giue for it. If hee liue in ſcarcitie, he accuſeth his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, curſeth the houre of his birth, and longeth for his buriall; and as (in his owne opinion) he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, before his time; ſo hee ſeeketh by all meanes to goe out before his time appointed. But, this by the waie is certaine, that aboundance choaketh more with riot then want killeth with deſpaire. Man receiues more detriment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6644:62"/>
from this middle age, then either from his precedent, or ſubſequent. In this age he is vnruly, head-ſtrong, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; neither will hee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to information, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter of reformation. And therefore the ages of man may aptly be compared to the ſea: his youth may bee likened to the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, ſtormy: his olde age, to the lee ſhore, calme: and his middle age, to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Ocean; where rough, vnmeaſured, Sky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting billowes carrie this light balanced Barke, now hither, now thither; and now and then driue her

that the Court is a Baude that will doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, a mint of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, an exchange of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a ſhame to ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, and a Scene of all obſcene actions. And now he thinkes that Machiauell was vnfortunat, only in this that he divulged his villanie to the world: for, in this place more is acted then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee inuented. Hee was for the Theorick; theſe men for the Practique.

Theſe poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded men, make me call to minde an olde Chriſtmas gambole, contriued with a thredde, which being faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome beame hath at the nether end of it a ſticke, at the one ende of which is tied a candle, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende an apple; ſo that when a man comes to bite at the apple, the candle burnes his noſe. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is as eaſie as the trick common; we hauing before our eyes dailie examples of men diſcarded for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice done. After his ſoule hath ruminated theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, he manifeſtly ſees
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6644:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Court is not a place ſuting with his diſpoſition. Well, the Court being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, he goeth into the countrey; where he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Solitude (Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies mute mother) ſitting in a forſaken weede, ſtroking her child Abſence on the head. Being here, he feeles this dumbe, ſilent life, to be a ſtill kinde of death vnto him. Hee is heere in the world, as if he were out of the world: hee liues more like a beaſt then a man; pampring his body: but his nobler part (for which only he breathes) is barred from the mindes nurſe, Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;

and from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſtrange euents, the confirmers and conformers of the minde.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6644:103"/>
is right true: <hi>et propter vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. hiſt. lib. 1.</note>

Wherefore I exhort all thoſe, who either haue or loue vertue, to deſire to bee diſſolued, and to bee with Chriſt. Let them contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate this, that death is the Orient of Weale, and the Occident of Woe; that is, the riſing of all comforts, and the fall and ſetting of all croſſes. Death is the ſole
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6644:104"/>
ſanctuary for ſorrowe, the freedome from feare, hope's harbour, faith's faire field, the ending of a bad &amp; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a better life. Death is not ſo vgly as the world would make her; her lookes are louely: and when all the world diſdaines deſert, ſhee rewardes it. Wherefore, wee ſhould not with ſuch a fond childiſh griefe bewaile the death of our friends, whom mercy hath taken from miſerie. As when we ſee the ſunne eclipſed, wee grieue not; knowing it ſhall come to his former forme againe: euen ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it is heere; we ſhould not fall into wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6644:104"/>
lamentations for the loſſe of them, whoſe bodies wee know ſhall riſe againe; who ſhal ſee God with thoſe eyes, with which they leaue to ſee the world: For, though they die to vs, they liue to the Lord. Wherefore, wee muſt not thinke, that Dauid lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the temporal death of his ſonne Abſolon; but, that his propheticke ſoule fore-ſawe that eternall death due to Diuells and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: for, to them, death bringes damnation. The wicked man dares not, in his greateſt pasſion, call to God for compasſion; but hides himſelf from his face,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6644:105"/>
hauing all his time beene glutted with forbidden fruite. If hee looke vp, hee ſees Gods iudgement hang ouer him: if downeward, he meditates his graue vnder him; and hell vnder it: if on both ſides of him, at each hand ſitteth horrour, and confuſion: if before him, he beholdeth Perdition, his hangman, dragging him on to his ſlaughter: if behinde him, Vengeance doggeth him at the heeles; the leaſt noiſe makes him expect his purſiuants: At laſt, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth himſelfe into his cabine, thinking to lock-out Death; who, in a moment,

locketh-vp his eye-lids, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more to open, till they ſhall ſee heauen gates ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their maſter. Oh foole! reuolt from thy irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſuperſtition, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pietie; neither quake at that, whoſe power it is in thy power to conquer by an heartie penitence, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayer. Shrinke not at thy fatale blowe: thy death ſhall be life; and that, a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and eternall one. I, for my part, will account of death as of that which helps me to an vnualued bargaine; things eternall, for things momentarie: things truelie delightfull, for things falſely

deceitfull. Oh welcome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, that ſhall free this body from ſo long an apprentiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of woe. And, indeede, what is there that ſhould holde or delight me heere? except to ſatisfie the vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred appetites of the body, and vnlawfull deſires of the ſoule. But perhaps ſome wil vrge, that I am as yet in my ſpring of youth; which I grant: Yet am I glutted, and tired as much with the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this Age, as a Priam, as a Neſtor.
