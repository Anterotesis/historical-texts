            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N most humble sense of mine owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, which holdeth no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with the height of your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, place, judgement, and learning; I have emboldned my selfe to present unto your wisdomes, this voice from Heaven, calling all the people of God out of Babylon. For what voice can be more worthie of audience, than a voice from Heaven? What voice more sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than this, amongst the grave consultations of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affaires, and weightiest causes of God, of his Majestie, and of this flourishing Kingdome? Or who more fit to heare this voice directed to Gods people, than you, the representation of all the people of God in this Kingdome? You, I say, who sit in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your worthie Predecessors, by whose consent and assent, with that Higher and Honourable House, the whole Kingdome was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly set out of Babylon, so farre as (by the blessing of God) now it is. <hi>God will without mee</hi> (saith <hi>Ioseph) speake for the life of Pharaoh</hi>; and without mee effect all his good purposes for the prosperitie of his Majestie and his people: and you, without mee, well know the managing of the weightie businesses which you have in hand: neither can my candle adde any light unto your Sunne; onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:18781:3"/>
begunne to speake, let me finde grace in your eyes, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to encourage you in the doing of what you doe. Your wisdomes know, that what were the two studs of the house in which <hi>Sampson</hi> played, that is, Religion, and Iustice in the Common-wealth, if they be pulled downe or shaken, the Church and Common-wealth fall together, and all under the fall must needs perish: of the two, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion claimeth our first and chiefe care, as intending Gods glorie more immediately, and mans good, not temporarie chiefly, but eternall. And therefore, whereas heathen Governors could provide for the observation of the second Table, Christian Governors, as the gates of the world, lift up their heads, that Christ the King of glorie may enter in among them. And all godly Parlaments (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have not a few examples in Scripture) first setled the causes of God and Religion, and then the causes of the King, and of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Iustice, as all the companies gathered for the Lords battels, must say on everie side of the Host, <hi>For the Lord and for Gideon.</hi> Now of all the great and important causes of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.18.</note> which can be offered to your tractation, none is more weightie than the subject of this little Treatise, none more neerely concerning your selves, to whom the care of your brethren is now committed, as <hi>Benjamin</hi> was by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Iudah</hi>; and on whom (next to his Majestie, the breath of our nostrils, and that Higher and honourable house) the care of all our safetie is now laid. And as all the voices of the land have made you the eyes of the land, so are all the eyes of the land held upon you, to helpe us against these Babylonians, who have beene and are so busie to bring us backe into our former Babylonish Captivitie; and to oppose your selves stoutly, with our <hi>Darius,</hi> against these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esr.</hi> 6.6.</note> who like the Midianites, have too long trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us with their wiles. And because the planting of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the onely meanes to supplant the Kingdome of Babylon, and the breath of Christ can onely blast the hopes of Antichrist, a readier way cannot bee devised to effect this voice from Heaven, than to provide that the knowledge of the Sonne of God may bee propagated thorow the land, and that the blowing of the rams hornes of the Gospell may lay downe the wals of this Romish Ierico even with the ground. If your wisdomes should send men over the Kingdome, as <hi>Moses</hi> did the spies, to search the land of Canaan, they would bring you backe a true report, that a great part of this Kingdome still lieth as a barren wildernesse, destitute of the blessed means of grace, and that many great parishes are as the <hi>mountains of Gilboa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21.</note> on which the sweetshowers and raines of the Gospell fall not, or verie seldome; neither doe the happie dewes of holy doctrine fall on them in their night, nor the beames of the Sun of grace dart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the day. These faithfull messengers would informe you, that all this waste and untilled ground is left for the Babylonians, for
<pb facs="tcp:18781:3"/>
Seminaries, Priests, and Iesuites to inhabit: That these parishes are the verie thickets, in which these snakes and vermins hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who beare nothing about them but poison, treason, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. That these places of such blacke and reigning ignorance, lie open to spoile and hazard, to be drawne easily away, by the poysoned breath of the most sottish Priest, not to Poperie onely, but even to rebellions and treasons, which for most part arise out of ignorant and blinde zeale. And now who knoweth whether the supply of this want, and the remedie of so great an evill, bee reserved for the crowne of his Majesties age, and the eternall renowne of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Parlament? So noble a worke requireth no lesse noble an Agent: such a glorious and famous act well suiteth with him, who, for wisdome and understanding, is the glorie and fame of the whole earth. And now, noble and worthie Gentle-men, God forbid that you should not take to heart the miseries of your brethren wanting food, who behold our Lord Iesus Christ more grieved in spirit, to see his Country-men want Preachers, than when hee saw them in bondage under the Romans. God forbid that you should sinne against God, and not bestirre you by planting the true knowledge of God, to pull downe the strongest pillar of Poperie, that you should not move everie stone, for the beautifying of Bethel, for the setting open of the gate of heaven here upon earth, for the establishing of Gods pure worship, and for the removall of everie scandall, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Babylon. Goe on therefore (worthie men) in the Lords strength, open your mouthes for the dumbe and silent, and be faithfull mediatours for the Kingdome of Christ, as you desire him to be a faithfull Mediatour for you in the Kingdome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And from hence would arise another happie fruit, wherein the glorie of God and his Gospell would shine out in great brightnesse, to the infinite disappointment of these Babylonians; namely, a more religious and conscionable observation of Gods holy Sabbaths; whose honour is wofully violated, not without the great scandall of our religion, by ordinarie travels, both by land and by water. Oh that your wisdomes would earnestly move our highest terrene Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie upon earth, for the Sabbaths of the high God, that Gods house might be frequented, and that the wayes of Sion may be beaten on the Lords day, and not the high wayes thorow the Kingdome. What an advantage were it towards happinesse, if men carelesse of their owne salvation, were straitly bound to the meanes of knowledge? What an advantage towards your present errant and busines<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Looke backe, worthy Gentlemen, upon the zeale and former love of your famous predecessors, who pulled downe the nests of these Antichristian birds: and hating neutrality, and thoughts of reconciling two such contrary religions (which as iron and clay can never be tempered together;) awaken your zeale, to make the hopes of Babylonians utterly to perish, of ever recovering their kingdome againe in this kingdome. Cause the uncleane birds that flutter againe about us, with some hopes to roust and nestle among us, (if that only would serve their turnes) to know the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and circumspection of so grave, wise, and godly a Senate, who are skilfull not only to devise, but also to revise and revive the good and wholesome lawes enacted, and now strengthned, for the preservation of his Majesties person, for the prosperity of the Gospell, the flourishing of this kingdome, and the utter subversion of Babylonish confusion in the same. In this great worke against Antichrist, shew your love to Iesus Christ. If ever you will doe him an honourable service, this is the time; It may be the whole course of many of your lives cannot doe him so much pleasure: seeing none of you know whether you shall ever attaine such an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie.

                  <p n="1">1. Note, Babylon is not a city of God, yet in Babylon is <hi>a people of God,</hi> for the Church is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and though Babylon cannot be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, no more than a finger can be an hand, or an hand the whole bodie; yet in <hi>Babylon</hi> are some members of the Catholike Church. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> a wicked place, destinated to destruction, yet God hath some of his people hid in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for whose sake <hi>Babylon</hi> holds the word of God, though obscurely, and Baptisme in substance, though very corrupt. They aske us, Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> we say, Even in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> among themselves. Why doe they hout at our answer as insufficient, and not first contest against this voice from heaven, or blot this text out of the booke?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Babylon</hi> is cast off vnto destruction; but the Lord is not unmindfull of his people in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perdition of <hi>Babylon. Farre be it from him to doe this thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked</hi> (saith <hi>Abraham) shall not the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Babylon</hi> is hastning to destruction, but shall not be destroied, before Gods people in <hi>Babylon</hi> be called out for their safety. Hee warneth <hi>Lot</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18781:7"/>

                  <p>He warneth the congregation to get away from the Tents of <hi>Corah,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Gods people called out of Babylon, heare and answer the call, and therefore they are not Gods people that stay in Babylon: they only stay in Babylon after the call, whose names are not written in the booke of life, and of the Lamb, and who are to be rolled up in the common-destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whence must Gods people depart? <hi>from her,</hi> that is, Babylon.</p>
                  <p>As the Church of Christ is described by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. so is the Synagogue of Antichrist, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.1. Againe, as Christ, the head of his Church, hath a city for his seat and throne, which is called Ierusalem, which was a type of the Church of God; so hath the head of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian apostasie, his seat and throne, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Babylon, that great city.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now because it is granted on all hands, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon is the seat of Antichrist, it is worth inquirie what this Babylon is.</p>
                  <p>The Papists would have us to seeke for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18781:7"/>
every where but where hee is, and have sought to leade us aside to many conjectures.</p>
                  <p>Some of them tell us that by Babylon is meant the wicked world; but that cannot be, for then when Babylon falleth, the world shall fall, which it doth not; for how could the Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts bewaile her fal, unlesse they wil say they must moane her in hel?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither is the wicked world the seat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, for he must sit in the Temple of God, which is not the whole world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither are the people of God called out of the world, but in a spirituall sense, whereas here is also a locall egresse out of Babylon commanded.</p>
                  <p>Some of them say, that the Easterne Babylon in Chaldea is meant, but as truly as the former.</p>
                  <p>For 1. that was fallen a thousand yeeres before, and how could Gods people be called thence in <hi>S. Iohns</hi> time, where they had not beene of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Babylon</hi> was not that in the letter, or Babylon indeed, but <hi>Babylon in a mysterie,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">

                  </p>

                     </note> and partly by the confession of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fathers, who all speake as plaine as we, that Rome is Babylon.</p>
                  <p>But though the Iesuites at this day seeme to speake with more judgement, yet with as little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuitie; for to defend their Pope and Citie, they would shift it to Ethnicke Rome, which is without all colour of truth.</p>
                  <p>For 1. this Babylon is the seat of Antichrist, which I thinke Rome was not. For if Ethnicke Rome were the seat of Antichrist, then could not Antichrist sit in the Temple of God; and then were Antichrist already come long since, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and all their fable of Antichrist quite spoiled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Fathers acknowledged Babylon to be Rome in their time, many yeeres after it had ceased to be Heathen, and Christian.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither can it be proved that the Christians by vertue of this commandement departed from old Ethnicke Rome, but continued constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during all those bloudy persecutions raised by those Heathen Emperours.</p>
                  <p>Wee conclude therefore, that by Babylon is meant here not Rome Pagan, but Rome Papall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But why is Rome called <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not Rome in plaine termes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Besides many Reasons which might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both from the mysteries of prophecies, and from the purpose of God, who would by leaving some things obscure, exercise the mindes and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his people:</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18781:8"/>Here Rome is called Babylon, for the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and resemblance with it, so as one egge is not liker another than Rome and Babylon. For</p>

                  <p>Hence is this Papall Babylon called the <hi>great</hi> whore, the whore of Babel, the whore that sits on seven hils, and no other whore else in the world doth so, for many iust Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Vicar, the husband of the Church: as if an husband must needs have a Vicar; or as if he can be honest that is Vicar to an husband; or shee chaste that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth a Vicar to her husband.</p>

Where doe Priests and Iesuites sculke and lurke but in dens and thickets of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? When doe these Owles and Bats flutter abroad but in the twilight? Egypt covered with darknesse, was covered with Locusts and Frogs, but Goshen having light, was rid of Locusts and such vermines.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An whore exhausts a mans substance, and brings him to a morsell of bread: so the whore of Rome hath by cunning, and for things not worth thanks, exhausted the chiefe treasures of Kings and Kingdomes.

Egypt with the Israelites, to turne backe after the leekes and onyons; nor with <hi>Spalato,</hi> run backe to Babel when we have fild our purses, nor for rumor of danger turne away from the truth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for suppose God should kindle a fire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in his Church, this were but a fire of triall and castigation, whereout the Lords golden ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels should come out onely brighter and better. But if we returne to Babylon, there is nothing but a fire of destruction and finall ruine, to burne up such huskes and chaffe, as wanting substance of grace, are blowne away with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, every blast of change, and every shadow of turning.</p>
                  <p>I had now come to the second part of my text, if there stood not three sorts of men in my way, to whom I must in few words apply my selfe and this part; and being men of no good qualities, I will make what haste from them I may: The first sort of these are Romanists, the second Separatists, the third Apostates. The Romanists cudgell us for departing from Rome; The Separatists lay load upon us for not departing from Babylon: can both their blowes fall right? The Papists tell us with great audaciousnesse, that wee are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and Heretikes, because wee have departed from the Catholike Church; and keepe out of the lap of our mother Church, yea out of the Arke, out of which is no salvation.<note place="margin">

Let them bring vs a Text or voice from heaven to bring us backe againe, and we will returne; but Texts of Scriptures and heavenly voices cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Separatists say we are in the midst of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, our assemblies are Antichristian, our selves no people of God, because we leape not over the pale, and fly out with them. But first, they have not, nor can prove the Church of England to be Babylon, unlesse Babylon be in covenant with the Lord, and hath both the Deeds and Seales of that Covenant, to shew in all the substantiall parts of them rightly administred according to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now standeth to the determination of the Scriptures in all things; for thus doth the Church of England, but not so Babell: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not scarred with the windy termes of false worship, false ministry, bowing downe to traditions, or denying the power of Christ in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Church, which is both preached and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended happily amongst vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have not, nor can prove that Christ
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18781:13"/>
hath given us a Bill of divorce, as he hath to <hi>Babel,</hi> or that the reformed Churches have separated from us, as they have from Babylon. As for their discoveries, what hath a schisme of private men to doe to excommunicate whole Churches? or why get they no Churches to joyne with them? or if they could get all the Reformed Churches to them, we expect orderly admonition before rash excommunication. For if a private man must be admonished twice or thrice before excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more may a whole Church expect it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are come out of Babylon by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, in that we have pulled downe the Temples of their Idols, in that both in substance of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sacraments, our Ministery agreeth with the Scriptures; the head of Dagon is cut off, his stump cast downe, and cast out; and we labour in purging away all the scent and stinke of him, so far are we from worshipping the beast, or receiving his Image.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We cannot therefore separate from the Church of England, but we must goe out from the true Church of God, and from the Spouse of Christ, who acknowledgeth Christ for her head and foundation: and by beleeving in his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse alone, is made a member of his body.</p>
                  <p>No reason will serve these unreasonable men, for then I might now get from them: but their importunity staies me to answer one objection, and so I will leave them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But what a number of corruptions have you, an heape of mens Traditions, which Christ
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18781:14"/>
never acknowledged, but bred and borne in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; and what a number of Gods ordinances doe you want, which a true Church of Christ cannot want, and can you be a Church of Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Was not <hi>Lot</hi> got out of Sodom when he saw the smoke of the Citie? If it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then, that a little smoke of the Citie did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our eies, must it follow that we are still in the midst of Babylon?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They point us to some corruptions and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to which I say: 1. Let them shew me a soyle in the world, where Wheat groweth without some chaffe, and I will goe with them: But that is not at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. None of the corruptions which they falsly terme, are of that high nature as to call for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall separation, because none of them are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall. The least corruption that we can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly espie, which yet is not in constitution, but in execution, we must separate from, in iudgement, in affection, in practise, but to separate personally for any error not fundamentall, let them teach it them to whom all errors are alike, but we may not be so dull.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our Church being ioyned to the head Iesus Christ, and retaining the vitall parts of the Word and Sacraments; neither if wanting of something which should be present, nor if remaining some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be cast out, can thrust her from the right and title of the Church of God, but is in essence and being a Spouse of Christ. For example, cut off both a mans armes, both his legges, cut off his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18781:14"/>
eares and nose, now he wanteth many things which a man should have, but yet so long as the head stands alive upon the body, and other vitall parts remaine, he is indeed a man, although a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one. Againe, suppose a man had ten fingers on an hand, or three armes, or suppose an hand stood where the foot should stand, or the mouth were set in the forehead, here were a great aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confusion against naturall symmetrie of a mans body; yet hee is a man, though a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one; whereas, where there is no head, or no union of members to that head, there were no body, no man: So whatsoeuer they can say, though falsly, is wanting in our Church; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they say is redundant or superfluous, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded on Christ her head, and truly dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the word and Sacraments, they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw her being of a true Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To conclude with them, some things make to the being of a Church, some to the comelinesse and well being of it: if their nimble eies could finde never so many abuses not fundamentall, all these shall only make to the disgrace and vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the Church, but shall never overthrow the being of it. Whatsoever we want, let not God want his praise, nor we thankfulnesse, that we want not that whereby Gods people may enioy the ioy of their salvation.

Babylon, because they were never of us; would to God they would timely consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Lord be so earnest that his people which are in Babylon, should fly out of her; it cannot but be too preposterous and desperate for those that are gotten out to run in againe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if it be a signe of the Lords people, to depart out of Babylon; it must needs be a signe of him or her that is not the Lords, to run into her, and so to continue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is the fearefull hire of Apostasie and Apostates, of whom the spirit of the Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth lothsomely as <hi>of dogs and swine</hi> turning to their vomit and wallowing.

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:18781:15"/>Lastly, because they love to looke upon pictures, now leaving them, I will leave with them an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of such gracelesse Apostates as themselves: When Israel was in the Wildernesse, God gave them a daily harvest of Mannah from heaven, but they grew weary of the Lords provision, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the garlike, the leekes, and onyons of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and backe they will to Egypt in all haste: but all the while they remembred not the oppressions, tyranny, stripes, labours, sighs, burdens, the bricks and fiery furnaces. So doe these looke after the pompe, pride, wealth, and liberty of Romish E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; but remember not the miserable servitude and bondage, and their tyranny upon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; they remember not their traiterous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, their miserable attempts against kings and kingdomes, their furious fires, their perfidious massacres, their bloudy inquisition. They remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not what comfortlesse hopes that doctrine and Religion will afford them in the day of their death (for theres no understanding Papist dare trust unto it) and yet looke backe they will. But what is the issue and conclusion of all? As all they in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse miserably died, and never entred into the Land of rest; so these Apostates may exchange Mannah with Garlike for the present; but in the day of the Lords visitation, they shall reape accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their sowing; when greatnesse, nor wealth, when Iesuiticall subtilties, nor penall satisfactions, neither shall their painted and Poeticall Purgatory helpe or ease them: they would not be stayed by a voice from heaven, but backe they would to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;

                  <p>For the sins of Babylon, they were most tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent both against God, and against man. I may not tire your patience with the enumeration.

                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 14 8.10.17.2.</note> That place consulted, sheweth that it is not only a temporary desolation of that state and Citie, with sword, fire, famine, according to the old prophecie; but also an everlasting rejection of that whole state and kingdome of Antichrist from God, into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That whosoever communicates in the sinne of this Westerne Babel, and will not depart from her, must partake of her plagues: she and they shall drinke of the wine-presse of the wrath of God; Gods heavie indignation shall come upon them and her to the uttermost: for it is iust with God, that those who will not be divided in sinfull socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, shall be undivided in judgement and suffering; Societie in sinne brings societie in suffering. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes condemne and execute the theefe and the receiver, the murderer and consenter, the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and concealer; and as just it is, that he that will partake in the sinnes of others, shall partake also in the sorrowes of them. What can it be but danger, in not departing from her, who is departed from God, and God from her? For what is all that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18781:21"/>
in the points wherein it differs from us, but an apostasie and a Catholike departure from the Christian faith;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.</note> nay that very great Antichristian departure fore-prophesied not from the Roman Empire, but of that Empire from the Christian faith, as appeareth, 1. By their departure from the Scripture and divine writings, to humane trash, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and fables.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By their departing from the merits, doctrine, sufferings, and obedience of Iesus Christ in effect, to a new Christ, new saviours, new mediatours, new intercessours, new merits, new advocates and patrons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By their departure from the old way, and the ancient faith of the Prophets, Apostles, and of the famous Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apostles dayes, to a new faith and Religion, not knowne to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor to the Prophets, nor Apostles, nor to their successors, the Fathers and Pastors, for six hundred yeeres at least after them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What else besides ruine can he expect that staieth in such a society so addicted to the basest wickednesse: every one will say that ruine and mischiefe must be his end, that runneth and sorteth himselfe with base villaines: Who baser than the limmes of Antichrist, who are all vassals to the servant of servants; but a iust hire of those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Lord of life and liberty. What is like to bee the end of him that runnes after whores and harlots, but utter confusion? and what other can they expect that ioyne themselves to that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotry Religion, who goe an whoring from God,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18781:21"/>
like hatefull and unsatiable harlots: What can bee his end but ruine, that sorteth himselfe with mutinous and rebellious persons, plotters and contrivers of mischiefe against the persons, estates, lives, and kingdomes, of Princes and people? But such are Papists taught to bee, by the present doctrine of the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>And by such positions and principles, were the Gunpowder Traitors thrust on to their ruine, and all other that run upon their owne ruine, by rising up against our late and present So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne.</p>
                  <p>Let all good Christians and good subiects say, as <hi>Iacob</hi> of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> brethren in evill, <hi>Into the secrets of these men let not my soule come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere are reasons enow for our utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Popery. Wouldst thou be without the reach of the plagues that amate her? get out of Babylon: Fearest thou not God, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide her sinnes? Feare thy selfe, and thine owne danger; who hast heard that the Lord is comming with his mighty power to make warre upon that damned Citie and State, for her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desolation. Wouldst thou share in the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods people? open thine eares to this voice of God, <hi>Fly out of Babel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ierem.</hi> 51. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40.</note> 
                     <hi>and every man save his owne soule.</hi> Save your selves from this perverse Generation. I say not that no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish person can bee saved, but whosoever will bee saved must depart from the fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18781:22"/>
of Popery; for which Christ hath given that Synagogue a bill of divorce. I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againe to all Gods people; Get away from this people of a strange language; Get away from the den of devills and habitation of Idolls. Whosoever are now within this voice and call of God, make use of it for thine owne safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Some perhaps hearing the call of Gods people out of Babylon, they like <hi>Lots</hi> friends scorne and mocke out this warning of God: for so doe reprobates and men of gracelesse hearts, spurne and fleere, where they should stoope, and feare, and tremble: but let such know, that as the Sodomites were first strucke with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and then with a fiery shower, so are they under the former of these plagues already, and God is hastning the latter upon them, if they hasten not their repentance.</p>
                  <p>The Poets have a saying, that when <hi>Iupiter</hi> will strike a man, he first putteth out his eies: and so indeed doth the iust God, first blindeth the eies of Infidels who are willing to bee blinded, and then destroieth them: he giveth them up to the devill, who as an hangman, first covereth their eies, and then turneth them off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the time is hastning when they shall say they were warned and called out, but now cannot bee either pittied or helped. As <hi>Lots</hi> cousins though they made but a merriment of <hi>Lots</hi> admonition, yet they saw the Lord in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and then too late wished they had departed according to the voice of the Lord; but now
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18781:22"/>
God will not, and <hi>Lot</hi> cannot helpe them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they shift themselves out of the fire, when the dreadfull shower falleth. Doe thou sit out the summons at thy perill; but one of two thou must chuse, either thou must goe out of Babylon, or goe into her destruction.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter setteth downe two great perils, which tooke the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel presently upon their deliverance from the red sea: (for the way to our Canaan is strewed with crosses) The former was of thirst to the eighth verse. The lattter of warre: for seeing their thirst made them contend with God, God doth justly raise them up enemies to contend withall.</p>
                  <p>In this warre are three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:18781:25"/>1. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of
<list>
                        <item>1. Persons, <hi>Amaleck</hi> rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Israel.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Place, <hi>Rephidem,</hi> vers. 8.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The manner of the warre, which was partly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By power and Armes, vers. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By prayer of <hi>Moses</hi>: If <hi>Iosua</hi> be on the vallie, <hi>Moses</hi> must be on the hill; meanes must be used, but not trusted in, and prayer without use of meanes, where appointed and afforded, is but a mockerie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The events of this doubtfull warre, and they be three:
<list>
                        <item>1. The overthrow of <hi>Amaleck</hi> by the sword of <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> vers. 13.</item>
                        <item>2. Gods decree of destroying utterly the whole nation of the Amalekites.</item>
                        <item>3. The building of an Altar for a trophee, and the perpetuall memorie of so happie a victorie.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The verse read, containeth the second of these events, namely the severe decree for the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the whole nation of <hi>Amaleck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where are two generall points:
<list>
                        <item>1. The record or registrie of the sentence.</item>
                        <item>2. The reason: <hi>For I will utterly put out the remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The record hath two parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The writing of it, <hi>write this.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The rehearsing of it, <hi>to Iosua.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In the writing are foure things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:18781:25"/>1. Who must <hi>write</hi> it? The Lord said to <hi>Moses, Write this. Moses</hi> a Prophet of God: Hee must make Canonicall Scripture of it. And being so written, it is unalterable and permanent. It is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Kings ring, as were the lawes of the Medes and Persians, and is irrevocable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What must hee write? <hi>This:</hi> that is, the whole narration of Gods dealing for his people against the Amalekites; 1. <hi>De rebus gestis</hi>; What God had done in the miraculous defeating of them already by the power of <hi>Moses</hi> his prayer. 2. <hi>De rebus gerendis</hi>; What God had further to doe in the finall destruction of this cursed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where must <hi>Moses</hi> write this? <hi>In a booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What booke is this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Some thinke it a booke now missing, although the Scriptures yet extant be sufficient; but this booke was no other than this present hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and other his historicall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries in his five bookes, in the which this same storie is more fully repeated, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Why must he write this in a booke? <hi>for a remembrance:</hi> Israel saw the great works of God, at least all Israel could not but heare of this, and yet this is not enough; it must be written to live in their memories, and in the eyes of their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and after-generations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But seeing Israel had many great and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliverances, besides and above all this: why is this so directly appointed to be written in a booke above the rest?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18781:26"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Israel had received a farre greater deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance a little before from the Egyptians, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in the bottome of the sea, and the Lord would not have this deliverance drowned in that, but would have a thankfull memory of this also preserved, and would have the glory of it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained even above other great workes, both by a booke and an altar, and by a name. God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be enrolled in parchment; and <hi>Moses</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles it in the stones of his Altar.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other great workes were lesse dependant, and more transient in the present passages of them, but this is dependant and must bee regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred for future memory and use; for divers pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture depend upon it: and not only the present people of God then living, but even the after ages descending of them, must take knowledge of this fearefull sentence denounced against <hi>Amalek</hi> for these ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they might never make league or peace with them all their daies, because the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stood accursed before the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they might be ready in aftertimes when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God should command their kings, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves cheerefully to the execution of this sentence in the utter extirpation of this hatefull people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they should ascribe the honour of truth and iustice to the Lord, when in aftertimes they should see King <hi>Saul</hi> reiected for failing in this execution, and not destroying those sinners the <hi>Amalekites</hi> as the Lord had commanded him, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18781:26"/>
the kingdome given to <hi>David</hi> who was better than he, in that he effected the Lords whole decree, in doing what <hi>Saul</hi> had omitted, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rehearse it to Ioshua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Why to him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Because <hi>Ioshua</hi> must be <hi>Moses</hi> his successor, and served to these two purposes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That hee for his time also should alwaies stand out in hostility against them, not as a reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of private wrongs and iniuries offered them, but to beare in minde, and publiquely to execute the iudgements of God which were charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it might be an encouragement to him, who was to bee the Lords Captaine, and to leade out his people in the Lords battells, against all the rest of the Nations; in that hee seeing these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which made the first attempt and onset upon Israel so mightily revenged by God, might hence assure his faith, that God would goe on with him, as he had now begun, untill hee had given them actuall and full possession of that good land which he had promised them so long, and so often.</p>
                  <p>Now from this first part of the Text wee may note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in our way to heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> we must make account of many <hi>Amalekites</hi>; as Israel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not set forth towards <hi>Canaan</hi> but <hi>Amalek</hi> will meet them. Israel going into Egypt had no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but in their way to <hi>Canaan</hi> never wanted them. A man may goe to hell merily, and never meet with Amalekites to hinder him; hee hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18781:27"/>
wind and tide with him. But let all the Israel of God resolve in their way to meet with <hi>Amalek,</hi> to fight with <hi>Amalek,</hi> to overcome <hi>Amalek,</hi> else there is no hope of ever seeing <hi>Canaan</hi>; wee must not expect rest till we be thorow the Wildernesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We hence learne, to write up Gods mercies and deliverances in a booke of remembrance; and as Israel keepes a Register and Catalogue of Gods mercies and favours towards us, our friends, our countrey, our Prince, our Magistrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; yea build up altars in our hearts, to hold the mercies of God before our eies.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. Nothing can more hearten our faith, than the view of the monuments of Gods favour and gracious dealing of God with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The renewing of them upon our selves and memorie, perpetuateth every gift of God, and makes us as thankfull as if we had newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nothing doth more binde the Lords hands from doing us good than the oblivion of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: when as every thankfull acknowledgement of old favours is but the invitation of a new; so as it is a gainefull dutie.</p>
                  <p>Many have beene our deliverances publique and private, of the Church and kingdome, of our Prince and people, of our own persons and estates, when many Amalekites have risen against us; But where are our bookes of remembrances? where are our Altars or our Sacrifices? where is our <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova Nissi,</hi> in which we proclaime God to be our banner and covert, as the words import? It was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18781:27"/>
but one of ten of the Lepers that returned to give thankes for his cleansing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I will utterly put out the name of Amalek from under heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this second part of the text are two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Author of the reuenge.</item>
                     <item>2. The severitie of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Author or person executing this reuenge, is the Lord, who saith here, I will doe it. His arme is strong, and power unresistable; Who can turne him backe? Yea although he appointed and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed meanes to doe it, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> yet hee challengeth the revenge to be his owne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The severitie of this revenge, in that the Lord will utterly destroy him with a totall and finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and is not satisfied in overthrowing the kingdome and dominion only, unlesse he put out the name and memorie of them from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. All which noteth a great detestation and an utter abolishing of this people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Why? what cause was there of such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie in this execution?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The cause was the fierce wrath of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> against Gods people the Israelites; if <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> bee fierce against the people of God, God will bee fierce against <hi>Amalek.</hi> Now the fierce wrath of <hi>Amalek</hi> appeared against Israel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</p>

brethren: so as they forgetting bloud and kinred, nourish an unnaturall wrath, and raise an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall war against the people of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was <hi>causelesse</hi>; we reade not of any cause given them by Israel, but such an old canker as was from the beginning in <hi>Cain</hi> against his brother <hi>Abel:</hi> such an inbred envie of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his servants, joyned with a malicious desire of spoyling them, resteth with wicked men at this day, that some of them will not looke on a godly man so much as on a mastive; or if they doe, it is with a <hi>Cains</hi> countenance, cast downe on their brethren. Yet can they devise no cause more than <hi>Amalek</hi> could, only God giveth more testimony to Israel than to <hi>Amalek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As it was without cause, so it was <hi>without example: Amalek</hi> was the first enemie that set upon Israel, after they came out of Egypt: this began to all the rest, and were first in the unjust vexation of Israel; and therefore God will make them examples to all nations under heaven, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that prophecie of <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Hee looked on Amalek and said, Amalek was the first of the Nations,</hi> namely, that came out against Israel. <hi>But his end shall be destruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was <hi>Crafty</hi> and <hi>Cowardly</hi> done: they give Israel no warning, nor offer faire termes of war, but steale upon them, and fall upon the weakest; and when they were weake and weary, <hi>and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the remnant of Israel, Deuteronomie</hi> 25.20. Thus because they ioyne with force, fraud in spoyling Israel, the Lord taketh his peoples

part, and scattereth them with a terrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> In this dreadfull menace of so severe a revenge against <hi>Amalek,</hi> wee note that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all the enemies of Gods people shall be both certaine and severe, as might specially be exemplified in <hi>Pharaoh, Haman, Zenacherib, Herod, Iudas, Iulian,</hi> and other noted enemies, whom neither greatnesse nor power, nor any other meanes could save from the severest strokes of Gods revenge: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As <hi>Amalek</hi> riseth up against the people of God, so doe all the rest of the enemies: and this neere relation betweene God and his people, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this sinne out of measure sinfull, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth a most severe revenge. How furiously doe great Princes vse to revenge upon those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face their Images in their coines? But there is not the meanest of Saints, upon whom this great King of glory hath not stamped and engraven his owne Image. With what severity are the lawes executed upon Burglaries, that breake into mens houses, to rob and spoile? especially upon sacrilegious theeves that breake into, and rob Churches and Oratories? The Church is the house of God, and the Temple of God: if any man destroy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, him will God destroy. How fiercely did <hi>David</hi> revenge upon <hi>Hanun</hi> and his countrey, for offering abuse to his servants? and are not the Lords servants as neere and deare to him, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> servants were to their Lord? and yet there is a neerer relation: for the Church is the Lords
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18781:29"/>
spouse, his wife, the delight of his eies. What, saith <hi>Ahashuerosh</hi> of <hi>Haman that proud Amalekite, will he wrong the Queene in my sight?</hi> and immediatly they covered his face. Much more shall their faces be covered with shame, that wrong the Spouse of Iesus Christ before his face.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The malice of the enemie is levelled against God: whatsoever they pretend, the ground of the hatred is God himselfe, the light, the Image, and grace of God; against whom they reach as high as they can. This is directly noted in <hi>Amalek,</hi> who yet had other pretenses, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.18. <hi>He feared not God</hi>: and he that feareth not to wrong Gods people, feareth not God himselfe: Now because wicked men are fighters against God himselfe in his people, and touching them, they poare in the apple of his eie; he taketh all the wrong done to them, as done against himselfe, and bringeth the mischiefe as an arrow shot upward, upon their owne heads with such severitie, as is due to the high blasphemous and stout Giants, who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Lord himselfe into the field.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The iustice of God cannot but bring perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon his enemies, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. It is iust with God to recompence tribulation to them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you. They are mercilesse to the Church, and the Lord shutteth up his mercy from them; as they have measured to others hee measureth unto them. What law can be more iust than the law of retaliation and requitall? The Tyrants themselves cannot but acknowledge the iustice of it, as <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibezek, As I have done so God hath rewarded me.</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:18781:29"/>
Now if it be just in the Lord to bring the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a wicked man executed upon other as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as himselfe upon his owne head (which was the case of <hi>Adonibezek</hi>) how much more in the fierce revenge of the wickeds malice against the innocent servants of God?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord himselfe undertaketh to see exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution done upon the wicked, as here upon <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi>; and therefore it shall bee done to purpose. For, 1. God writeth in a booke of remembrance, all the cruelties of wicked enemies against his people, as here in <hi>Amalek,</hi> both in respect of God to punish, of <hi>Iosuah</hi> to revenge, and of <hi>Israel</hi> to rejoyce in the Lords care and partaking with them. 2. God writeth their persons to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: partly by his threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>I will curse them that curse thee. Ier.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Israel is an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thing, all that eat it shall offend, evill shall come on them, saith the Lord.</hi> And partly by his oath, for the Lord hath sworne (as against the rich men of <hi>Israel</hi> that oppressed the poore) by the excellencie of <hi>Iacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works, neither can remember them, but to destroy their names, and blot out their memories from under Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To terrifie the enemies of the Church: seeing their hatred of Gods people is a token unto them of perdition, and nothing can save them from the curse of God, and that irrevocable sentence, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 35.5. <hi>Because thou hast a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hatred, and put the children of Israel to flight, as I live, saith the Lord, I will prepare thee unto bloud:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18781:30"/>
and bloud shall pursue thee.</hi> Which was no truer against Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> than shall be certainly verified of all the enemies of God and his people.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas most men harden themselves against such burdens of the word of the Lord, by sundrie delusions and misconceits, it will not bee amisse to meet with some of them; that the rubs being removed, and the way cleered, this our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may be the more successefull.</p>
                  <p>Many sowre enemies of the Church suppose themselves out of the reach of this reproofe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they doe not by open force waste the Church of God, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, nor are up in armes against it, as Turks and Papists, and such as stand in open hostilitie against the truth, they cannot be perswaded that they are enemies. To whom I answer; that there be millions of secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand enemies, besides these who with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> raise up forces against the Israel of God, and these enemies I range into three ranks.</p>
                  <p>For they are either

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou mayest be an enemie in affection and desire, as when out of hatred thou wishest and desirest evill and hurtfull things to befall the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in whole or in part. Thus <hi>Balaak</hi> did but desire and affect to curse Gods people, and this is called a warre against Israel. <hi>Cain</hi> shewed himselfe a cursed enemie, as well in casting down his lookes upon his brother, as in rising up to slay him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18781:30"/>2. Thou shewest thy selfe an enemie also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when in words thou doest utter and pronounce hurtfull speeches against godly men: <hi>David</hi> saith of his enemies, that they invented words against him. Doest thou bely the Saints, cast names of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon them, raise or revive reports against them; and art thou not an enemie? Was not <hi>Haman</hi> that proud enemie hanged on his owne gallowes, for such inventions and suggestions against Israel?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou mayest be a cruell enemie, and carrie thy selfe closely in many under-hand practises, though thou marchest not so furiously under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans standard, as some other professed enemies doe: as if thou beest a scoffer, a derider, and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of godly men or their godly practises.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Ismael</hi> laught at <hi>Isaak,</hi> and this is called a persecution. Christ was flouted and mocked on the crosse, and this was not the least part of his passion. If thou canst vex the childe of God in his trouble, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute him whom God striketh, adding affliction to his bonds, or secretly say to thy selfe, So, so, thus would wee have it, thou mayest easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne thy selfe an enemie. 2. If thou doest unfit and disable them from doing good, or settest hand to cast them out of their godly course, thou expressest not the smallest enmitie. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi> shewed his hostilitie, not onely in swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up the Church as a Dragon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.34.</note> but also in making her as an emptie vessell, and casting her out. <hi>Pilates</hi> wife would not have her husband shew himselfe an enemie to Christ, by having an

hand against him. Wouldst thou not be an enemy then? have nothing to doe against any innocent and godly man. 3. If thou defendest not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in godly wayes. <hi>Ierico</hi> strucke never a stroake against <hi>Israel</hi> that wee reade of, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Ierico</hi> opened not the gates to <hi>Israel,</hi> it is said to warre against <hi>Israel.

He that gathereth not with Christ scattereth, and the threatning is, that not onely those that warre against the Church shall fall, but those also that stand not out for it. Whosoever then thou art, that according to thy place and meanes servest not the Church, that art not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to put both thy hands under the feet of it, to doe it all the good which is laid in thy power to doe, thou canst expect no other but to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; ranged among the Churches enemies, for truth hath spoken it, that the Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that will not serve the Church shall perish, <hi>Esay</hi> 60.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others thinke it good swimming with the streame, and that it is good policie to joyne with the stronger side: they see the enemies set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and magnifie themselves, because they have power in their hand, and grace of times to bring about all that they desire. On the other hand, they see the poore Church under hatches, without helpe in herselfe, or from others, and therefore tread over the hedge where it is lowest, to speed themselves the better in their owne projects. But to these enemies I say, 1. That all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18781:31"/>
with the wicked, be they never so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, cannot stay them from perdition, unlesse they be stronger than the Lord; and though they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie themselves against the Church, and seeme to beare all downe before them, yet must they fall: for what God hath written hee hath written. All their power is but the power of chaffe against mightie whirle-winds; all their glorie and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the poore members of the Church, is but as the strength and stinke of dung unto him, as is said of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and <hi>Iabin,</hi> and <hi>Sisera,</hi> who perished at <hi>Endor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.10.</note> and were made as the dung of the earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83.10. Who can now (besides the enemies themselves) beleeve that they stand on the stronger side, while they stand against that side, with whom the strong Lord standeth? 2. As far are they deceived in their conceit, that thinke the Church is helplesse and friendlesse, while they see few or no great ones step in to take her part.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.5.</note> For is <hi>Israel</hi> a widow? or hath the Lord forsaken her? No, no, her husband leaves her not, nor dieth away from her, as other husbands doe; but ever liveth, and ever loveth her, and will suffer no man to doe her wrong unrevenged; but will rebuke even Kings for her sake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others see no great danger in all these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, they are none of the greatest friends of these strict professors, neither doe they see it safe to be so forward, and yet they thrive and prosper well enough: to whom I answer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord is not so unmindfull of his threatnings as they suppose; Is it to bee prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

to be stricken with blindnesse of minde, and hardnesse of heart, and so goe on blindfold as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to destruction? or is it such happinesse for a malefactor, ready for execution, to have his eies covered by the hangman?<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. Forbearance we say is no payment, so as if the Lord for the time of his patience, suffer wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to goe on to fill up the measure of their sinnes, yet the longer the blow is a fetching, the heavier it will be, the smart whereof is so much the more grievous, as it commonly overtaketh them in their rest, and in their rust, and watcheth to heare them say, Peace, peace, and then sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falleth upon them: for God will avenge his elect which crie unto him night and day; <hi>yea though he suffer long for them; I tell you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>he will avenge them quickly.</hi>

And most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was that example of the Iewes, who carried the death of the Sonne of God forty yeares, and never bethought themselves; but when they thought all was forgotten, then came the Lord like a lion upon them, and teared, and spoiled, and paid them once for all, and wasted and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them with so fearefull a curse as never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell any Nation under heaven: the which lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and all their posterity even till this day. Let this move all men to feare to offer the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or injurie to the least of Gods Children. Wise men are afraid to incurre the Kings indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore it is said, that in <hi>Hesters</hi> time the feare of the Iewes fell upon the land; so let the feare of Gods children fall upon thee, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hast formerly distasted them: and let it binde thy hands and thoughts, from conceiving or acting the least evill or hard measure against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To comfort the Church of God in these threatning times, when <hi>Gebal</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi>

If we looke towards God, he hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to revenge the just quarrels of his people; that if themselves would put up the wrongs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions inflicted by the adversaries, yet the Lord will not put them up, or passe by them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging them.

If we looke to the enemies, they are many and mighty, but <hi>Amalekites</hi>; we have to doe with cruell enemies, but accursed in their persons, in their enterprises, and in all the wicked meanes of accomplishing the same: and if we looke a little into the resemblance, we shall see that as Romish <hi>Amalek</hi> have notably expressed the like cruelty with these in our text; so shall they meet with the same certaine perdition: they being written by God to destruction as truly as the former.

of men could avoid their strokes with both their swords: they make no difference of men, but strike at Princes and people, Kings and kingdoms, they smite the living and the dead, and make no bones to blow up three whole kingdomes at once with one terrible blow or stroke.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Amalek</hi> then came forth against Israel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon their deliverance from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon the fruition of Manna from heaven, and waters out of the rocke: <hi>Amalek</hi> cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Gods grace to Israel, in those means of their sustentation, nor yet in the pillar of the cloud and fire for their safety and direction. Even so the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>Amalekites</hi> presently encampe themselves against the people of God, so soone as ever they are gotten out of the darknesse and bondage of Egypt. Wilfull enemies are they against the grace of God, and against the word of his grace, which is the Mannah and Water of life, for our refection tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this our wildernesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Amalek</hi> was the first enemie that Israel had, after their comming out of Egypt, and waged war against Israel to hinder them from going into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and not onely by force but by fraud, they spoile the people of God; for they come as Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers in multitude, and destroy the fruit of the earth, and leave no food for Israel, so as Israel was exceedingly wasted. Even so the Romish <hi>Amalek</hi> and Antichrist, was one of the first enemies of the Church of the new Testament, he began in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Amalek</hi> forgetteth all kindred, and all bonds and respects of Nature; they regard not that they were of the same bloud with Israel, which might have beene some restraint to their fury. So the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>Amalekites</hi> forget all naturall bonds, and most heathenishly lay themselves in the vaults &amp; caves of blacke darknesse, for the destruction of their owne naturall and loving Prince; with purpose to spare neither root nor branch. Old <hi>Amalek</hi> would eat up and destroy their enemies countrey; these <hi>Amalekites</hi> like so many Vipers would eat up the bowels of their owne mother, and native country. Duke <hi>Medina</hi> his sword knew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Protestant and a Papist: no more doth the powder and iron barres, but send up suddenly to heaven as in a fiery chariot, even them of their owne Religion: such fiery zeale as carried <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Diazius</hi> out of one kingdome into another, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18781:34"/>
kill his owne brother <hi>Iohn Diazius</hi> with his owne hands, for surenesse, only because he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant. Old <hi>Amalek</hi> cannot equall these Savages and Monsters, with whom no respect of age or sex, no degree of honour or learning, no plea of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion nor Iustice, no instinct of humanity or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it selfe, can prevaile for a drop of mercy or pitie from them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Amalek</hi> commeth cowardly upon Israel, and smiteth the hinmost, and falleth upon the women and children in their fainting and wearinesse. The same course doe the Romish <hi>Amalekites</hi> take in their plots for seduction, and destruction. Their seducing Priests fall upon the weaker sex and sort, as the devill did at first, and overcome first the weake and faint ones, such as lag after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: as cowardly as the old <hi>Amalekites</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Israel, so also doe these. Nay they come in warlike manner after they had declared themselves enemies: but these digge deepe and fetch their counsells as low as hell; and under the habit and profession of friendship and loyaltie, cowardly lay traines and engines of death, which can no more be perceived, or prevented (but onely by the piercing eie of God) than can the issues of the next age.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Amaleks</hi> warre was ill grounded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered accordingly; for God turned it to the great good of his people; who were 1. Exercised by them. 2. Experienced in the goodnesse of God, and in his gracious deliverance. 3. Enriched and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of armour, and other necessaries by the spoile
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18781:35"/>
of <hi>Amalek.</hi> As unprosperous have beene the wars of Romish <hi>Amalek,</hi> and their plots and projects have turned against themselves, and to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the truth, and the Churches professing the same. God hath strangely discovered the treasons against the Lords people and his anointed ones, and mightily broken their armes and powers both by sea and land. Such as have risen up against the Lord have fallen before him. And though now of late they advance themselves as if all were to their hearts desire; yet wise men see them no great gainers, and were they greater than they be, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall patiently wait to see Gods whole worke together, shall doubtlesse rejoyce to see no difference betweene their gaines and <hi>Amaleks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Israel, but onely that their confusion and overthrow shall be more dreadfull and fearefull, as their sinnes have beene most Catholique and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As <hi>Amalek</hi> after a doubtfull war must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by Israel, and written to perpetuall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; so the Church hath justly deserved to sustaine a doubtfull conflict by Romish <hi>Amalek:</hi> but after the triall of the Church <hi>Amalek</hi> shall be foiled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long since written to perpetuall destruction, for when the childe is corrected, the rod shall be cast into the fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we looke to our aids and succours, we need not feare the issue of our conflict against <hi>Amalek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, 1. We never want a valorous and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to lead us and fight for us against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek.</hi> That <hi>Ioshua</hi> was a Noble Generall, with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18781:35"/>
whom the Lord was, and none was able to stand before him, so as he set his foot on the necks of five kings at once: but he was but a type and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of our <hi>Ioshua</hi> a mighty Captaine, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly leader, that great <hi>Michael</hi> that treadeth upon the necks of all Kings and Tyrants that rise up in armes against him and his people. That <hi>Ioshua</hi> was in the valley; but ours is upon the hill of his heavenly glory far exalted above all his enemies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Israel had not only <hi>Ioshua</hi> fighting in the valley, but also <hi>Moses</hi> praying on the hill; so wee have many <hi>Mosesses</hi> lifting up hands, and praiers, which are powerfull and prevalent against <hi>Amalek.</hi> And whereas we finde much unworthinesse in our praiers, and our hands grow feeble, we have an <hi>Aaron</hi> our heavenly High-Priest, strengthning our armes and praiers, which praiers joyned with the power of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> shall bring downe the proudest <hi>Amalekites</hi> that ever ware triple Crowne, and put to rout all forces levelled against the Israel of God. When the Angell came to <hi>Gedeon</hi> and said, <hi>The Lord be with thee, thou valiant man</hi>; hee replied,<note place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>If the Lord be with us, why is it thus?</hi> Why doth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> prosper? Why doe they prevaile so long? Why doe they triumph with great hopes to goe on, to carry the victory? If Romish <hi>Amalek</hi> be a people written to destruction, why see we no meanes of their overthrow?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We need not feare the braggs of those that use to triumph before victory: <hi>The end of a thing is better than the beginning,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> The issue of the doubtfull warre shall undoubtedly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18781:36"/>
joyne the Churches happy triumph with their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall overthrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After the Lord had written this sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Amalek,</hi> he staied execution foure hundred yeeres till <hi>Sauls</hi> time; but in the end (the time of his patience being expired) he forgat not the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment. So <hi>Amalek</hi> may prevaile awhile for the sins of the Church: and we must not grudge to allow the Lord the time of his patience, which though it may wait many ages, yet at last will he assuredly rise up in most sharpe revenge, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy the kingdome and memory of <hi>Amalek</hi> from under heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Church may thanke her selfe in part that <hi>Amalek</hi> prevaileth still over her. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas the Lord hath commanded us to remember what <hi>Amalek</hi> hath done to us in our way,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.17.19.</note> and repeateth it againe, <hi>forget it not,</hi> we forget the strait injunction: we remember not what they did to us in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, but have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten those furious flames and times. We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what <hi>Amalek</hi> did to us in 1588. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that they digged a sulphureous pit in 1605. wide enough to swallow three whole kingdomes. Now while wee so easily forget that which wee are commanded to remember, what marvell if God rub our memories, by suffering them to be pricks in our sides and eies still?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doe we remember the Lords Oath, to have war with spirituall <hi>Amalek.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither doe we remember that it is the dutie of all the Israel of God to fight with God in blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

out their remembrance, though the charge be very strait, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.19. <hi>Thou shalt put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven:</hi> as God taketh his Churches part against <hi>Amalek,</hi> so the Church must take Gods part in this great worke, which the Lord will effect both for them, and by them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is likely also we lift not up our hands so fervently and so constantly against <hi>Amalek</hi> as we ought. <hi>If Moses hold up his hands, Israel prevaileth.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may be wee are wanting in encouraging and strengthning the enfeebled hands of our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses.</hi> How could Israel have expected to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against <hi>Amalek,</hi> if in stead of rearing up <hi>Moses</hi> his hands, they had turned him off the hill with despight and contempt, and taken up some <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekite</hi> into his stead? How can Popish <hi>Amalek</hi> but prevaile, if Popish Priests shall finde any where better entertainement than faithfull Preachers, who are so many <hi>Mosesses,</hi> and men of God, who would stand in the gap, and are indeed the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Chariots of Israel?</p>
                  <p>Oh therefore deare brethren let us awaken our selves, and in this tempest by the loud voice of our praiers, awaken Christ who seemeth to sleepe in his ship with us. Let us ply the Lord earnestly, and binde him by his owne promise.

we shall not onely see the omnipotence of praier, but the impotencie and flight of <hi>Amalek.</hi> Did not our hands fall downe, and our praiers grow feeble, we should fill our hearts quickly with triumphant joy over them, our hands with their spoiles, and our mouthes would runne over with the praises of God, for our deliverances from the power and plots of such fierce and implacable enemies.
