         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He night as wellas the day is not exempted from
nefarious practiſes; for on the faſting-day night
28 of <hi>September,</hi> at 11 or 12 a clock, 9 or 10 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
would violently have attempted to ſet
fire on the Court of Guard-houſe in Chancery-lane, taking
thence away divers boards; but by the ſudden confluence and
flocking together of many of the Inhabitants of the Lane,
they were diſturbed in their intent and oppoſed, ſo that they
conglomorated and gathered together to the number of 20
or 25, threatening ſudden deſtruction to all oppoſers. M. <hi>Lee</hi>
an Apothecary being a ſpectator of this beginning mutiny,
came downe to give Captaine <hi>Browne</hi> information thereof,
and deſire his aſſiſtance, who replyed that there were at the
Exchangeſome City forces, but knew not whether he ſhould
meet them oportunely or no; and therefore he would beat
up his Drums for ſecurity of his owne men, while these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
continued, and matters were in the heate of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Captaine Lievtenant <hi>Flanes</hi> led 60 or 80 men into
the Lane, not advancing any further, becauſe he had certaine
information of iminent danger and deſtruction. This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
retraction in the Captaine animated one <hi>Iohn Reeve</hi> a
Cooke to be forward in this deſigne, deſiring his ſtaffe out of
his hand, and promiſing to leade them up boldly to the Gates
of Lincolnes-Inne, to affront and ſuppreſſe the ſaid Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents:
Whereupon, by his earneſt perſwaſion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
preferring of himſelfe, the Captaine at his inſtigation
reſigned and delivered him up his ſtaffe, who with a valiant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58349:5"/>
reſolution conducted his men forward with his ſword drawn
and elevated in his hand, victoriouſly captivating 3 of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
opponents priſoners, who had formerly tranſported
by their owne unjuſt paſſion, which blinds judgement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
diſgracefull puniſhment on his man, inſomuch as they
pumpt him moſt opprobriouſly for a treſpaſſe of words, in
ſaying, that the houſe that was building in Iack-an-apes-lane,
and in Chancery-lane, was a Court of Guard-houſe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they preſently carried him away, and in executing on
him their puniſhment of pumping, they upbraided him with
many menacing cominations, ſaying, that they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
his ignorance in the definition and nature of a Court
of Guard-houſe, and teach him to know what it was, and
after many bitter and reviling ſpeeches, their anger being
growne outragious, they conveyed him to the pump and
pumpt him, which diſgrace reflecting on his Maſter muſt
needs irritate and incenſe him much by this indignity thus
offered in this conflict and ſudden mutiny, he ſaid, <hi>Iohn Reeve</hi>
was wounded in both his ſhoulders, the Inhabitants by this
unexpected tumult were put into a great diſtraction, feares
and murmurs being alwayes the conſequents of ſuch teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious
raſh actions; but becauſe they were afraid to give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to their trading, that private intereſt ſtopt the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and activity of this diſordered eruption of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the various accidents aforeſaid, though moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and too lately done, were ſilenced. Thus diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though long ſtifled, daily breake out in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
