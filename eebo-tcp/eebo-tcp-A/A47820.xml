            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>There was no way, you must know, to carry the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">Committees to promote the Petitions.</note> clear, without getting a <hi>Vote</hi> of <hi>Common-Council</hi> for the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;</hi> and so making it an Act of the <hi>City:</hi> And in order to this End, we planted our <hi>Committees</hi> every where up and down, from <hi>Algate</hi> to <hi>Temple-barr,</hi> at convenient distances; some few of them in <hi>Taverns</hi> but most at <hi>Coffee-houses;</hi> as less liable to suspition. Now we did not call these <hi>Meetings, Committees,</hi> but <hi>Clubs;</hi> and <hi>there</hi> we had all Freedom both for <hi>Privacy</hi> and <hi>Debate:</hi> while the <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Southwark, Westminster,</hi> and the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> proceeded according to our Method.</p>

               <p>And what were these <hi>Committees</hi> now to do?</p>

               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>Their <hi>Commission</hi> was to procure <hi>Subscriptions,</hi> to justify <note place="margin">Their Powers and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> the Right of <hi>Petitioning,</hi> and to gain <hi>Intelligence:</hi> And then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Committee</hi> had one man at least in it that wrote <hi>short-hand.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>It was his part to go smoking up and down from One Company to another, to see who was <hi>for</hi> us, and who <hi>against</hi> us: and to take Notes of what people said of the <hi>Plot,</hi> or of the <hi>Kings Witnesses,</hi> or against rhis way of <hi>Petitioning.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Citt.</speaker>
               <p>For that, let me tell you, we had <hi>two Grand Committees,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two Grand Committees.</note> that adjourn'd from place to place, as they saw occasion: But they met most commonly at <hi>Two Coffee-houses;</hi> the <hi>One</hi> near <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> in the <hi>Strand;</hi> for you must take notice that we went on, hand in hand with our <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the <hi>Main Design.</hi>

               <p>These two <hi>Grand Committees,</hi> I tell you, nominated and appointed the <hi>Sub-Committees,</hi> gave them their <hi>Orders,</hi> and <note place="margin">The Office of the Grand Committees.</note> received their <hi>Reports:</hi> It was their Office moreover to digest <hi>Discoveries,</hi> and <hi>Informations;</hi> to instruct <hi>Articles,</hi> improve <hi>Accusations,</hi> manage <hi>Controversies,</hi> defray the charge of <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers,</hi> and <hi>Gatherers of hands,</hi> to dispose of <hi>Collections;</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the <hi>Anglicus</hi>'s and <hi>Domesticks,</hi> and fortify those that were weak in the Faith; to furnish matter sometimes for <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives.—</hi>

               <p>Now this is thy simplicity <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> for there is not <note place="margin">Stories of Prodigies startle the Common People.</note> any thing that moves the hearts of the People so effectually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the Work of the Lord,</hi> especially when the <hi>Narrative</hi> carries some <hi>Historical Remarque</hi> in the Tayl of it: As for the purpose, <hi>this or that happen'd in such a Kings Reign, and soon after such and such troubles befell the Church and State:</hi> such a <hi>Civil War,</hi> such or such a <hi>Persecution,</hi> or <hi>Invasion</hi> follow'd upon it.

               <p>I don't know what ye call your <hi>Committees,</hi> but Our Gentry had their <hi>Meetings</hi> too; and there was a great Lord or two among 'um that shall be Nameless.</p>

               <p>You told me that your <hi>Committees</hi> were to procure <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions;</hi> we were hard put to't, I'm sure, in the <hi>Country</hi> to get <hi>Hands.</hi>

               <p>Nay, the thing was well enough <hi>Citt,</hi> if we could but have <note place="margin">Several ways of getting Hands in the Country.</note> gone through with it: And you shall see now that we were put to our shifts in the <hi>Country,</hi> as well as you in the <hi>City.</hi> I was employ'd you must know, to get <hi>Names</hi> at <hi>four shillings a Hundred,</hi> and I had all my <hi>Real Subscriptions</hi> written at such a distance, one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I could easily clap in a Name or two betwixt 'um; and then I got as many <hi>School-boys</hi> as I could, to underwrite after the same manner, and after this, I fill'd up all those spaces with <hi>Names</hi> that I either <hi>Remember'd,</hi> or <hi>Invented</hi> my self, or could get out of two or three <hi>Christning-books.</hi> There are a World (ye know) of <hi>Smiths, Browns, Clarks, Walkers, Woods,</hi> so that I furnish'd my Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with a matter of Fifty a piece of these <hi>Sir-names,</hi> which I <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd</hi> my self. And besides, we had all the <hi>Non-conformist Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in the <hi>Country</hi> for us, and they brought in a power of hands.</p>

               <p>Ay, and 'tis a great blessing too, that when <hi>Professors</hi> are at so mighty Variance among <hi>themselves,</hi> there should be so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an <hi>Agreement</hi> in the <hi>Common Cause.</hi>

               <p>And that's notably observ'd, <hi>Bumkin;</hi> for so we found it here.

               <p>Why I know 'tis laid in our dish, that when we had set the whole Kingdome agogg upon <hi>Petitioning,</hi> our hearts would not serve us to go through stitch, and so we drew our own necks out of the Collar, and left the Countries in the Lurch.</p>

               <p>The great work that we look't upon was the gaining of a <hi>well-affected Common-Councill;</hi> which we secur'd upon the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> with all the skill, and watchfullness imaginable.</p>

               <p>We went the same way to work too in the <hi>Country,</hi> at all our <hi>Elections;</hi> for it is a Lawfull Policy, you know, to lessen the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Enemy.</p>

                  <hi>So that I perceive We</hi> Set up <hi>the</hi> Protestant Religion; <hi>we did not</hi> Destroy <hi>it: But they prest it Then, that the</hi> Church of England <hi>was a</hi> Protestant Church, <hi>and that the</hi> Jesuites <hi>had only</hi> Design'd <hi>the</hi> Destruction <hi>of it, where as</hi> We <hi>did</hi> Actually Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>it.</hi>

               <p>Observe here, <hi>First L'Estrange</hi> expounds his <hi>History</hi> in the <hi>Title Page,</hi> by restraining it to the <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>the</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Staleys Trial</hi> had no Relation at all to the <hi>Plot,</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> was not Try'd for's <hi>Life;</hi> and so not within the Compass of his intention exprest in the <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Epistle</hi> acknowledges a <hi>Detestable Plot,</hi> and a <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> but advises <hi>Moderation,</hi> and that the <hi>Rabble</hi> may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate Laws to <hi>Authority;</hi> for <hi>that Licence</hi> was the Cause of the <hi>Late Rebellion.</hi>

               <p n="5">5.

The Lord Chief Iustice</hi> (says he) <hi>after some Remarkes upon the</hi> Romish Principles, <hi>summ'd up the Evidence, and gave Directions to the Iury:</hi> which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Page</hi> cited in the <hi>Preface.</hi> Touching your <hi>Elsewhere,</hi> it is in plain <hi>English, No where.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Look ye, here's more Juggling. He says SEVERAL <hi>Gross Incoherences,</hi> and you have made them MANY: and then you have left out the <hi>Parenthesis, (especially in the Latter of them)</hi> which varies the Case too. And I remember again, that the <hi>Erratum</hi> was supply'd after <hi>L'Estrange</hi> had <hi>corrected</hi> it: And sure it was a Gross one too, to expose a <hi>Protestant Gentleman</hi> for a <hi>Papist, Nine times</hi> in <hi>two Pages.</hi> I could shew ye several other <hi>Material Mistakes,</hi> but One shall serve for <hi>all.

               <p n="7">7. Pray'e mark me now: <hi>L'Estrange</hi> findes <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>Press</hi> in the <hi>Other Tryals</hi> and <hi>Rectifies</hi> them, in his <hi>Own:</hi> Now if Posterity shall finde in the <hi>Right,</hi> that the <hi>Other</hi> are <hi>wrong,</hi> they are in no danger of being <hi>Misled</hi> by the <hi>One,</hi> in what is <hi>Corrected</hi> by the <hi>Other:</hi> And if they do not read the <hi>Right Copy</hi> at all, there's no harm done to the Other, but they must take it as they finde it. So that this <hi>Remark</hi> is so far from <hi>Disparaging</hi> the <hi>Proceedings,</hi> that a greater Right can hardly be done to <hi>Publick Iustice</hi> by a <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> But now let the <hi>Epistle</hi> speak for it <hi>self.</hi>

(A Judgement for our Sins, augmented by our Follies,) But the world is so miserably divided betwixt some that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing, and others nothing, that not only <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>Christianity</hi> it self is almost lost between them; and no place left for Sobriety and Moderation. We are come to govern our selves by Dreams and Imaginations; We make every <hi>Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house Tale</hi> an Article of our Faith; and from Incredible Fables we raise Invincible Arguments. A man must be fierce and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to get the Reputation of being <hi>Well-affected;</hi> as if the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of one another <hi>Damned Heretique,</hi> and <hi>Popish Dog,</hi> were the whole Sum of the Controversie. And what's all this, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Popular Licence and Appeal? When every Mercenary Scribler shall take upon him to handle matters of Faith, and State; give Laws to Princes; and every Mechanique sit Judge upon the Government! Were not these the very Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the late <hi>Times?</hi> When the Religious Jugglers from all Quarters fell in with the Rabble; and managed them, as it were, by a certain sleight of hand: The <hi>Rods</hi> were turned into <hi>Serpents</hi> on both sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Multitude not able to say, which was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and which the <hi>Enchanter.</hi> Let us have a Care of the same Incantation over again. Are we not under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a Lawfull Authority? Nor was there ever any thing more narrowly Sifted, or more vigorously discouraged, then this <hi>Conspiracy. Reformation</hi> is the proper business of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Council;</hi> but when it comes to work once at the wrong End, there is nothing to be expected from it, but <hi>Tumult</hi> and <hi>Convulsion.</hi> A Legal and Effectual provision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Danger of <hi>Romish Practices</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> will never serve Their Turn, whose Quarrel is barely to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> without understanding the Thing it self. And if there were not a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> lef<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

they could not <hi>find</hi> it. It is no new thing for a Popular Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, in the matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> to have a <hi>State-Faction</hi> in the belly of it. The first late Clamour was against <hi>Downright Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> and then came on <hi>Popishly Affected; (That</hi> sweeps all.) The <hi>Order of Bishops, and the Discipline of the Church</hi> took their Turns next; and the next blow was at the <hi>Crown</hi> it self; when every Man was made a <hi>Papist</hi> that would not play the Knave and the Fool, for Company, with the Common People.</p>
            <p>These things duly weighed, and considering the Ground of our present Distempers; the Compiler of this Abridgment reckoned that he could not do his Countrymen a better Office, than (by laying before them the naked state of things) to give them at one view, a Prospect, both of the subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Apprehensions, and of the Vigilance, Zeal, and needful severity of the Government on their behalf. To which end, he hath here drawn up an <hi>Historical Abstract</hi> of the whole matter of Fact concerning those Persons who have hither to been Tryed for their Lives, either upon the <hi>Plot</hi> it self, or in Relation to it: opposing Authentick Records to wandring Rumours; and delivering the <hi>Truth</hi> in all Simplicity. He hath not omitted any one material Point: There is not so much as one <hi>Partial Stroke</hi> in it; not a flourish, nor any thing but a bare and plain <hi>Collection,</hi> without any Tincture either of Credulity, or Passion. And it is brought into so narrow a Compass too, that it will ease the Readers <hi>head,</hi> as well as his <hi>purse;</hi> by clearing him of the puzzle of <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutories,</hi> that serve only to amuse and mislead a man, by breaking the Order, and confounding the Relative parts of the <hi>Proceeding.</hi>

not a</hi> Known Separatist; <hi>and that on the Other side, not one</hi> Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick <hi>ever struck stroke in the</hi> Kings Quarrell.</p>
               <p>And now for your Notes upon his Answer, they are so silly, that it were Ridiculous to Reply upon 'um <hi>[who knows</hi> (says he) <hi>but the Regicides were Papists in disguise, pag.</hi> 19.] And a deal of such senselesse stuff; enough to turn a bodies Stomach. And if you'd inform your self of his Malice; look ye here <hi>pag. 4. p.</hi> 9. and <hi>p.</hi> 33. how he Palliates, if not Justifies, the Late Rebellion, the Murther of the Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the drawing of the Sword against the King.</p>
               <p>Briefly, 'tis an <hi>Insipid Bawling</hi> piece of <hi>Foolery,</hi> from One end to the Other. And it is not but that I highly approve of your <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Discovery of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and Suppressing of <hi>Popery;</hi> but we are not yet to Trample upon <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Publique Orders,</hi> for the attaining even of those Glorious ends.</p>

               <p>No, not unlesse you can produce an expresse <hi>stipulation</hi> to <hi>That very purpose.</hi> But let me shew you, First, the Errour of <note place="margin">Power is from God, not from the People.</note> taking That to be a <hi>Trust</hi> from the <hi>People,</hi> which, in truth, is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> For <hi>All Power is from God:</hi> And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of the very <hi>Supposition,</hi> even in the Case of a Trust conferr'd by the People. If the <hi>King breaks</hi> his <hi>Trust,</hi> the <hi>People Resume</hi> it: but <hi>who</hi> are These <hi>People?</hi> If a <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> they are but <hi>Trustees Themselves,</hi> and may incur a <hi>Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> too, by the same Argument.

For if it devolves to the <hi>Loose Multitude</hi> of <hi>Individuals,</hi> (which you will have to be the Fountain of <hi>Power)</hi> you are Then in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> without any Government at all; and There you must either Continue in a <hi>Dissociated State,</hi> or else agree upon <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> into some Form of <hi>Regiment,</hi> or other: and whether it be <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> or <hi>Democracy;</hi> it comes all to a Point. If you make the <hi>Government Accountable</hi> upon every Humour of the <hi>People,</hi> it lapses again into a <hi>Confusion.</hi> To say nothing of <note place="margin">Soveraignty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</note> the ridiculous phansy of a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in the <hi>People</hi> upon This Account; that they can never be so brought together either to <hi>Establish</hi> or to <hi>Dissolve</hi> a <hi>Government,</hi> as to authorize it to be the <hi>Peoples Act.</hi> For there must be, <hi>First,</hi> an <hi>Agreement</hi> to <hi>Meet</hi> and <hi>Consult. Secondly,</hi> an <hi>Agreement</hi> upon the <hi>Result</hi> of That <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;</hi> and any <hi>One Dissenter</hi> spoils all, where every <hi>Individuall</hi> has an <hi>Equall Right:</hi> So that unlesse the People be all of the same minde, This Supposition will be found wholly Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Idle.</p>

               <p>Only <hi>Patience,</hi> unless you run into <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and then into that which you call <hi>Tyranny</hi> again; and so tread Eternally that Circle of <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>Confusion. In fine,</hi> the Question is this, whether people had better run <hi>Certainly</hi> into <hi>Confusion</hi> to avoid a <hi>Possible Tyranny,</hi> or venture a <hi>Possible Tyranny,</hi> to avoid a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Confusion.</hi>
