            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company had a Charter Granted to them by King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> in the 13th Year of his Reign, and afterwards Confirmed, with further Priviledges, by King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Second;</hi> wherein there is a Clauſe, That no Perſon ſhould trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> without Licenſe from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon pain of Forfeiting their Goods. And alſo a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was put forth by the Late King <hi>James,</hi> to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And altho there had been former Grants made to the Company, yet the Forfeiture was never inſiſted upon, till about Five Years ago.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the ſaid Owners and Freighters were adviſed by their Council, That the ſaid Clauſes in the ſaid Grants and Proclamation, were void in Law, and that they might lawfully Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon</hi> in the Year 1684, they freighted the ſaid Ship with <hi>Cloath</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> and ſent her to <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe took in <hi>Plate,</hi> and from thence Sailed to the <hi>Indies.</hi> and diſpoſed of her <hi>Cargo,</hi> for the Commodities of <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> ſhe Coming for <hi>England</hi> in 1686, was ſo diſabled by a Storm, that ſhe was forc'd to put in to the Harbour of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to re-fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company having Notice thereof, prevail'd with his ſaid Late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, King <hi>James,</hi> to cauſe the ſaid Ship, and all the Men and Goods in her, to be Seized by Proceſs out of the Admiralty-Court, pretending a Forfeiture, by virtue of the ſaid Charter and Proclamation, and kept them at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and would not ſuffer them to be brought up to <hi>London;</hi> and upon one of the Members of the Company's producing the ſaid King's Letter to the Court, the Judg refuſed to take Bail, altho 100000 <hi>l.</hi> or what other Bail they would inſiſt upon, was offered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> they could not get a Libel, till near Two Months afterwards, (the Ship and Men being all that time in Cuſtody), and when the Libel was put in, the Ship and Goods were libelled againſt, as Forfeited for trading to <hi>India,</hi> without the Companies Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; which (if ſo) that Court could not try; and to prevent a Prohibition, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſaid Owners might have had their Ship and Goods delivered them), they did in the ſame Libel Charge all the Sea-men with Piracy; which was a notorious Falſity, and a meer Trick, to keep the Cauſe in the ſaid Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> they finding themſelves under this Neceſſity, were forc'd to agree with Sir <hi>Joſiah Child,</hi> and Sir <hi>Benj. Bathurſt</hi> (Managers for the ſaid Company) at their own Terms; and before they could get their Men diſcharged, or any Account of their Goods, they were compelled to acknowledg themſelves to be Interlopers, and to ſubmit to the Determination of the Admiralty Court, without further Appeal, or any Action to be brought in Law or Equity, and alſo to pay them one Fifth of the whole Proceed of the Cargo; which, with other Charges, amounted to above 10000 <hi>l.</hi> They having alſo in the <hi>Indies</hi> been forc'd to Pay for their Liberty there, upon the Companies Proſecution, about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and afterwards to give them a General Releaſe of all Demands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All</hi> which Doings tend to the Subverſion of the Laws, and to the Great Damage of the Owners and Freighters of the ſaid Ship; they being remedileſs (by the Contrivances of the ſaid Company) unleſs in Parliament.</p>
