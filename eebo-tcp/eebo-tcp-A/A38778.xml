         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we may know the truth, and be aſſured that
God doth manifeſt it, to the end that all might

And not only ſo,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> but the Lord Jeſus will
raign in him for ever and ever.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 38.</note> So that all this

of the Trinity, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. The Holy
Ghoſt is ſo full in him and upon him, that it
gives its name to him; as we call a cup that is
full of wine, ſaying, give me the wine, or give
me the cup, in ſenſe is to be underſtood the ſame
thing. So the King is ſent to us under the name
of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he was full of it:
but indeed properly the Holy Ghoſt is the God
and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mathew
1. 18. 20. Luke</hi> 1. 35. And therefore the Holy
Ghoſt is called the firſt and the laſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.
13. becauſe under that name he begets Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Mathew 1. 16. 20. Luke</hi> 1. 35. and
ſeems to be elder or before Jeſus; and under
that ſame name he ſeemeth to be younger and
after Jeſus, and ſo ſent <hi>John 14. 16, 26. John
15. 26. John</hi> 16. 13, 14. and theſe myſteries are

            <p>All the Prophets of God prophecied myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;
and the ground-work of all the Prophets
is the ſpeech of <hi>Noah</hi> to his Sons,<note place="margin">Jeſus bleſſed in <hi>Shem.</hi>

by his coming in to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuffering
for his truth, brings the rebellious ſeed of <hi>Ham</hi>
to ſuch an eternall ſervitude, that they ſhall not

declared myſtically, which myſteries could not
be opened till King <hi>Charles</hi> came and finiſhed
his courſe. And at this time all the myſteries are
fulfilled, as ye have it, <hi>Revelat.</hi> 10. 7. thus, In

when he begins to ſound, the myſtery of God
ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets. Again, a Prophet of our

and he doth acknowledge it to be ſpoken
of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Coronation. Though

And that now there ſhall be a rule and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

And though the word <hi>Charles</hi> is not in

by which they are ſignified, that we might know

Independent ſaith, here is Chriſt, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian

when ye ſee theſe things begin to come to paſſe,

and where this faith is found,<note place="margin">At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Ieſus Chriſt, there was a diviſion amongſt the people, ſome ſaid of him, we know this man whence he is, but when Chriſt cometh, no man knoweth whence he is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 26. 27. others ſaid Chriſt came of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> of the Town of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> a place well known to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 40. 41, 42, 43. now the reaſon of this diviſion was the Scripture, for <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 17. their eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty, and the land that was very far off from them.

Luk. 12. 54, 55, 56, 57. therefore ye are to obſerve the ſigns of theſe times, and to compare them with Scripture.</note> 
               <hi>Tit. 1. 1. Mat.</hi> 24.

Firſt the Faith of Gods Elect is where the
abomination reigneth, though under perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that's clear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 15. Here under this ſtate
we ſee the abomination, therefore here are the
faithfull found.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the abomination cannot be ſaid to
reign but in one certain country where the Elect
are planted,<note place="margin">Namely <hi>Judea</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> and if poſſible the abomination

<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 22. And it is evidently ſeen, that
the abomination reigneth here in <hi>England,</hi>
therefore if the Elect be deſtroyed here, there
is no more ſeed left to propagate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider there is but one way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

what he may ſuffer for it, he ſhall
be ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſider, that when every other way

forced to flie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 15. 16. 23. 25. 26.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God hath his Elect over all the earth; and that he will ſend his Miniſters to gather them into this only way of ſalvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. but now there is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect viſibly ſeen, ſave theſe of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and all the Elect muſt come to unity with theſe, in forme of worſhip, doctrine, and diſcipline, before they can be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved.</note> conſider, that the falſe wayes at this

that if the faith of Gods Elect were deſtroyed

            <p>Seventhly, conſider, that if the faith of Gods
Elect were any where elſe found, it could not be
ſubject to dangers, as it ſeems to be, for if it
were deſtroyed here in this land, we ſhould find
it in ſome other. But the caſe is not ſo, for he

Mat.</hi> 24. 16. where theſe things ſhall
be ſeen, and it is evident that <hi>Iudea</hi> to be here,
for here the ſignes are ſeen, <hi>England</hi> is the place,
therefore here and no where elſe is this faith
found. And it is evident to be the faith of King

            <p>And to ſhew you, that the Romiſh Faith now
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41718:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not the Faith of Gods Elect, it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that ſome ſhould depart from the faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day of God came, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.
and accordingly they have departed, as you may
ſee their actions noted unto us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.
by their forbidding their Prieſts to marry, and
commanding to abſtaine from meats, which
things they do. And after their departing it was
determined that there ſhould be a reformation in
the Church made by publique authority accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the mind of God, which reformation or
form of worſhip is called a form of godlineſſe;
and the authors of that form are juſtified and
called good men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 4, 5. And then it
was decreed that a company of Traytors ſhould
come and deny the power of this form, and ſay
the form is not of power to make men godly,
and this you may ſee in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7.</p>
            <p>And they are compared to the Sorcerers of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe they withſtand this forme, and
the authors of it, as thoſe Sorcerers did <hi>Moſes;</hi>
who was alſo ſent of God, and gave the Law.
And theſe men privily conſpire againſt the
truth, according to the word, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 2 Tim. 3. 6. Iude</hi>
1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and from the conſpiration of
theſe men cometh the abomination that makes
deſolate, and now reigneth: and as the time of
the Papiſts departing from the faith, is called
the latter times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. So the time of theſe
are called the laſt dayes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. ſo that all
comes to paſſe in order according to the Word
and knowledge of Chriſt. And if you conſider
how God is a God of Order, and would have
all things done by lawfull authority given by

himſelfe; you may ſee upon the Papiſts depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>

him, endangereth the Faith, and the Pope
is not able to help himſelf.</p>

<hi>Luther,</hi> overthrows him, and defends the
Faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, upon this the Pope, who ſhould
have defended the Faith, becauſe it was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
office, gives the title from himſelfe, to King
<hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and calls him <hi>the Defender of the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, upon this the King would marry,
the Pope would not let him marry. The King
did marry, the Pope excommunicates him for
it. The King by vertue of his Title, <hi>Defender
of the Faith,</hi> defends himſelf againſt the Pope,
calls a Parliament, caſts out the Pope, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to reform all things according to the Word
of God; and this Parliament are called good
men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 3.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. by vertue of the ſame
title calls a Parliament, and they give the form
of godlineſſe to the Church, purely and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to the mind and word of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> takes in the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
then the Martyrs ſtand up, and ſeale the
true Faith with their bloud, confeſſing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God to his Church, and triumphing in
the flames with joy over their enemies; for the
Elects ſake.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> comes out of her
troubles, lightens the earth with her goodneſſe
and glory, as if the daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> were riſen
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41718:10"/>
from the dead,<note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 10. 16.</note> to the great comfort of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſee how God preſerved the
Faith, removed the authority, reformed the
Church, by a publique power; for it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 23</note> that when Princes were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Faith, they muſt have care of his
Church as nurſing Fathers,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> and reform it, when
need requires by their publike authority: and
whatſoever is done by private rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in private againſt authority, though they
pretend to follow Chriſt and his Apoſtles in
it, and think that a good warrant, yet it is damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
condemned by Chriſt and his Apoſtles;
for ſaith he, go not to the Deſart, nor to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Chambers, nor here nor there to ſeek me,
for I will be of no ſuch rebellious conſpiring
ſociety:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> For he ſaw that the abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
would begin in ſuch private meetings.<note place="margin">Iude 1. 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>
And the Apoſtles ſay, they ſhall privily bring
in damnable hereſies, and in ſo doing, oppoſe
men dignified with the power of Chriſt; and
for ſo doing they ſhall be deſtroyed in eternall
fire, and have their wages in hell for ever.</p>
            <p>Now concerning King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. ſome will
ſay,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16, 17.</note> might not the Pope take the title again from
him, upon his revolting from the Pope? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
no,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> for the chief gift once given, cannot
be recalled, for God goes along with it. And he
that receives the gift, is by vertue thereof made
more able then he that gave it;<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.</note> ſo that he that
gave it, hath no power to command him to give
it againe, and this I ſhall prove to you. <hi>Eſau</hi>
parted with his gift as the Pope did, and would
have had it again, but could not, though he
ſought It of God with tears. And though <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41718:11"/>
in a ſubtill way deceived his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
to get the power and bleſſing from him, yet his
Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not help it, though he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
when he came to know what he had done.
Oh ſaith he to <hi>Eſau,</hi> I have made him thy Lord,
and done thus and thus unto him, it muſt be ſo
now; what can I do for thee? as if he ſhould
ſay, I am diſabled, I have given all away from
me; and all was but a few words ſaid by <hi>Iſaac</hi>
to <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet there was ſuch power in thoſe
words, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> nor <hi>Eſau,</hi> with all they
could do, could not help themſelves againſt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for a Preface. But my matter
intended is ſhorter and more powerfull. For
you ſhall ſee all things ſet down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as they came to paſſe ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Parliament, to this very day, and
what is to come to paſſe hereafter upon this
Nation. And you ſhall ſee all this in the eighth
and nineth Chapters of <hi>Amos;</hi> who firſt ſpeaks
of the End (that was) the beginning of this
Parliament (and the ruine of the Kings Court)
&amp; then ſpeaks of everlaſting ruine to this State;<note place="margin">2 King 14. 23. 27. 28.</note>
and the renewing of the Kings Court,<note place="margin">Amos 1. 1.</note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
of his power over all the earth;<note place="margin">Amos 7. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13 14. 15.</note> and this
you ſhall ſee verſe after verſe, as all things things
come to paſſe hitherto in order.</p>
            <p>And now if you conſider,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 15. 16. 17. 18.</note> you ſhall find that
the prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> which he prophecied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioas,</hi> was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
upon him;<note place="margin">Rom 2. 28 29.</note> for he proſpered all his time,
but it was to be fulfilled amongſt the Gentiles
And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> alledgeth
this Prophecy as a thing belonging to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6. 7.</note>
and gives this note,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Known unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41718:11"/>
God are all his works, from the beginning of
the world;</hi> as if he had ſaid to us, The things that
are now in doing amongſt you, were known to
God of old, as is declared by his Prophet <hi>Amos.</hi>
For though this Prophet as others doth ſpeak to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet it belongs to the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as
many more alſo did, and the Apoſtle doth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the Scriptures, &amp;c. Now ſhall I ſhew you
the meaning of theſe two chapters, the eighth and
nineth of <hi>Amos.</hi>

               <p>This Petition was delivered upon the day da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
aboveſaid, to the Honorable, Sir <hi>Gilbert
Pickering,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Councell of State. Who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſhew it to ſome of the Houſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
told me that he had ſhewn it, and that then
it was with the Lord Generall. So that it was
publiſhed to them ſo far as poſſibly I could. I
have alſo given the Expoſition of the eighth and
nineth of <hi>Amos</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hugh Peter:,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notes of the ſame purpoſe to him, but my
requeſt is not regarded. I did alſo direct to the
Honorable Lord Mayor and Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41718:18"/>
theſe things, and delivered them on the 24.
of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1651. and received them again from
Alderman <hi>Andrews</hi> the 28. who bad me adviſe
with ſome Divines about them, and get them
printed.</p>
               <p>I have alſo delivered theſe things to the Lord
Generall <hi>Cromwells</hi> own hands, and he had
them three days alſo.</p>
               <p>And now I beſeech you all conſider that what
I ſay unto you of my own words, I ſay it with
love and humility as to men, whom I honor in
regard I believe you would willingly fear God,
and do his will. But what I ſay of you from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
I do it in faithfulneſſe to you, that ye
might fear God &amp; do his will, of which ye are as
yet ignorant. For though ye have thouſands of
inſtructors, yet the ſpirit of illumination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
is with me alone: and there is a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
upon all your Divines
and Prophets at this time,<note place="margin">Here I do not mean the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and faithful Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but I mean all others generally that pretend themſelves to be Divines, or Miniſters and Inſtructors.</note>
as you may ſee in <hi>Micah</hi> 3.
4, 5, 6, 7. and verſe 8. theſe
words are fitted for me to
ſpeak unto you. But truly I
am full of power by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the LORD, and of
judgment, and of might, to
declare to you your ſins.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor being a Priſoner at the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in 1637. for foretell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what befell the King. It was demanded by ſome, why the Author did ſcape well, ſeeing <hi>Pryn, Baſtwick,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> were ſo ſeverely dealt with? And it was anſwered, That what the Author did, was from Conſcience to forewarn the King, but what they did, was found to proceed from malice, to raiſe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the King. So it ſeems, then there was Liberty of Conſcience allowed to men in its true being, when it was found diſtinct from malice.</note> And 19. years ago, I
did declare the thing that came upon the King
and his party. I was not then regarded, becauſe
there was a neceſſity that all things ſhould come
to paſſe, as they did, elſe how ſhould the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
have been fulfilled? and truly yet I may
ſtrive to warn, but I know all will not believe
me, notwithſtanding for the Elects ſake, who I
know not but by their converſion, I muſt warne
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41718:19"/>
all, for that's my work; and 'tis Gods to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the hearts of men to believe what I ſay.</p>
               <p>And this I underſtand concerning my ſelfe,
I am a man to whom God hath given foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which I declare with all humility, love
and reſpect.<note place="margin">1635.</note> But I find that when 'tis not
regarded, then immediately judgement follows,
as the Kings party, and afterwards the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
(who not only ſlighted my love, but alſo
impriſoned me at Newgate, brought me before
the Bar in the Old-Bayley,<note place="margin">1646.</note> and would have had
my life, if God had not been on my ſide) have
found it to their coſts. So now the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and a heavier, attends the contemners of
this truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore I thought my ſelf bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to make theſe things known, to them whom
it chiefly belongs to, that is, generally the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
in love: and to clear my ſelf from
bloud. Being more ſatisfied with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and perhaps the hatred of many, then to
flatter them againſt my conſcience, to obtaine a
great reward.</p>
               <p>I know every one is more able then I to write,
and can make their matters good againſt me, to
ſeduce you, and gloſſe it over with pieces of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41718:19"/>
Scripture. But I ſay unto you, if any can bring
you ſo much Scripture together, that declares
the things paſt, preſent, and to come, as ye have
ſeen the things paſt done before your eyes,
and that makes all things ſo clear, and eaſie to
be underſtood, as this <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>And now to ſay ſomthing concerning the

had a ſtammering in his ſpeech, like <hi>Moſes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi>
4. 10, 11, 12 therefore acknowledging his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
he ſpake but ſeldome, yet when he ſpake
none could ſay more to the matter, for he drove
the naile to the head.</p>
               <p>But when he had loſt his army, and came to
diſpute for the juſtneſſe of his cauſe, God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened
his tongue, and he ſpake fluently, as many
can witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when he went for ſhelter, into the Scots
army, Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> the greateſt Champion
Miniſter in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſlew himſelf in diſputing
and ſtriving with the King.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> that drew his charge, in
his charge againſt the King, calls him <hi>a ſecond
Solomon for wiſdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> in his book called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
or no Monarchy,</hi> is forced to ſay of the
King, <hi>He was a man inclined to no vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the Plea for the Commonwealth of
England,</hi> &amp; Colonel <hi>Ioyce</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the King
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41718:21"/>
was of a far more excellent ſpirit than M. Love,</hi>
who was the moſt valiant Miniſter in all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſuffered for it.</p>
               <p>Would ye have an able wiſe, faithfull, wiſe,
undefiled, good ſpirited, perfect man, in all things
juſtified of God, of men, of his moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Look upon K. <hi>Charles,</hi> he is ſo juſtified of
all.</p>
               <p>Again conſider his great faithfulneſſe, as he
was was engaged to defend the faith and church
of Chriſt committed to his truſt at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
after he loſt his Armies and three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and was in the cuſtody of the Parliaments
Army, he might have had his three Kingdoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
reſtored to him, upon terms deſtructive to
the faith and Church of Chriſt; but rather then
ſo, he chuſeth to loſe his Kingdoms, and alſo his
life, for the defence of the faith and church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his truſt, who ever did the like, and
what glory is too great for ſuch a King?</p>
               <p>Again conſider, how perfect his love was, not
only to his friends, but alſo to his moſt deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
who took his life and Kingdoms from
him, I mean you Souldiers. So far was he from
ſeeking revenge upon you, for all you did againſt
him, that he praiſeth you for gallant valiant
men, and wiſhes that he had had ſuch men, as ye
may ſee in his book and laſt ſpeech to his Son,
and therefore ought not you in equity to requite
him with the like love? and though you cannot
give him his life again, yet to be a means to cauſe
him that is his name to reign. For you ſee by the
Word of God that he muſt reign, and will not
you, now you ſee 'tis right, be the inſtruments to
bring it to paſſe?</p>
               <p>There be two Commandements that ſound in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41718:21"/>
mine ears continually: One is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not fellow a multitude to do evill, neither ſhalt
thou speak in a cauſe to decline after many to
wreſt judgement,</hi> Exod 23. 2.</p>
               <p>The other is,<hi> Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother
in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy
Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, Lev. 19.
17. </hi>My ſilence is a ſin unto me. I ſhould hate
you, if I did not tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>The States flatterers ſay, that the power is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
in the people, derivative in the Parliament.
But the word of God ſaith, that the power is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
in God, derivative in Kings, and that
promotion comes not from the Eaſt, nor from
the Weſt, that is, from any people, but God is
the Judge, he puts down one, and ſets up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Pſa.</hi> 75. 5, 6, 7. and by me Kings reign, <hi>Pro.</hi>
7. 15, 16. Power belongs to God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72. 11. For
this cauſe <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> is ſaid to be from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
leſt any ſhould argue and ſay that he had
his Kingly power from men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>For a man to make a thing better than himſelf,
and then fear, honor, and obey it as his God, is
the groſſeſt idolatry, and men do ſo, when they
claim the power to ſet up rulers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6. for
men to make themſelves gods is idolatry. Rulers
are called Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. therefore thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are idolaters that take upon them to ſet up
Rulers, for themſelves, and God will require it.</p>
               <p>Again I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that power which is of men, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to that which is of God, neither can both
ſtand together. Chriſt ſaith (intimating the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>) Luk. 1. 77. <hi>was it from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or of men? Mat.</hi> 12. 25. is all one as if he

oppoſite to heaven but hell? again ſaith he, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41718:22"/>
38, 39. <hi>if this Councell be of men 'twill come to
nought, but if it be of God it will ſtand,</hi> is all
one as if he had ſaid, if it be of the devill it will
come to nought, but if it be of God it will ſtand;
for what's oppoſite to God but the devill?</p>
               <p>Some will ſay, there is no power but of God,
<hi>Rom</hi> 13. 1. Therefore the States power is of God.
I anſwer, that which is of men, is not of God:
The States power is of men, therefore not of
God, but in this ſenſe 'is of God. God by his
foreknowledge did foreſee this State; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to continue ſo long.</p>
               <p>But that God is the author of this State is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
For 'tis clear, that the Dragon gave him
(that is) the Beaſt or State, his power, and his
ſeat, and great authority, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. Therefore
they have not their authority or power to act,
of God; but they have their power permitted, to
continue ſo long a time, as the devils had a time,
which they claim, <hi>Mar. 1. 24. Mat.</hi> 8. 29. But <hi>Paul</hi>
underſtood that the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> was of
God, for it was encloſed in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi>
was a King, <hi>John</hi> 19. 12. 15. and <hi>Paul</hi> calls him
the <hi>Miniſter of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 4. becauſe he had
not his power of men, but of God. But ſaith he,
<hi>the powers that be (Rom.</hi> 13. 1.) hence you draw
your concluſion, that the States power is to be
ſubmitted to, though it be of men. I ſay no, for
he ſpeaks there of the power which is of God, a
Kingly power: and all the ſtop in theſe words,
the powers that be, is in regard <hi>Caeſar</hi> was not a
Chriſtian but a heathen; and therefore not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
right, yet he calls him the <hi>Miniſter of
God,</hi> in regard his power was of God, and not
of men; therefore thus much the Apoſtle ſaith
here, that the power that is of God, and not of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41718:22"/>
men, you muſt ſubmit unto, in outward affairs,
though the King be a Heathen: and whereas he
ſaith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.) <hi>there is no power but of
God;</hi> he doth abſolutely deny this power, as it
is now the States power, to be any thing elſe, but
a jugling ſhew of Sathan, admired at by them
that periſh, as he defines it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.
it hath all power in ſhew, yet it is but a deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
lying wonder, of no ſubſtance. As Juglers
make us believe they have many rare things, but
when we need ſuch things, alas, there's nothing
at all. Now the power that is of God alwayes
deſcends from heaven, as you may ſee, <hi>Rev. 10.
1. Rev. 11. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Rev. 18. 1. Rev.</hi> 20. 1.
intimating that it comes from God alone. But
the other power is ſaid alwayes to aſcend out of
the bottomleſſe pit, (<hi>Rev. 9. 2. 3. 11. Rev.</hi> 11.
7.) out of the ſea, out of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1.
11. it ſtill comes from beneath, which ſignifies
it comes from the locall and vulgar people,
whoſe ignorance is ſet forth by a Gulph or
bottomleſſe pit, which know nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of God, what's good for themſelves;
therefore the power that is of men, that is, of
the Dragon, or of the Beaſt, or of the devill, is
one and the ſelf-ſame thing, and the different
terms given to it, is only to illuſtrate, &amp; ſhew the
evill of it. Therefore I conclude, that this State
is that Beaſt, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13.) and I will prove it thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Beaſt had a ſeat of great authority
(<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2.) ſo hath this State, for it hath
judged and condemned a King, and put him to
death, by that ſeat ordained for their honor, I
I mean the High Court of Juſtice, ſo called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Beaſt beheaded them that were moſt
eminent in oppoſing him, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4.) ſo did
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41718:23"/>
did the State behead all, that by the ſentence of
the ſaid High Court ſuffered death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Beaſt is not one man, but a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men compact together (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18.) So
the State is a great number of men, of equall
authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Beaſt is ſaid to change times and laws
(<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25.) ſo do the State: they will have no
Chriſtmas, no Eaſter, no Whitſuntide, and the
ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes of <hi>England</hi> they
change.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Beaſt by the ſucceſſes of his wars, is
wondred at by all that worſhip him, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13.
4.) ſo this State is wondred at for his wars, and
proſperity therein.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Beaſt oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf
above all that is called God, or that is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
So that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of
God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.
4. Now I muſt ſpeak of the Pope, that he comes
very neer this mark; for when a King doth not
comply with the Pope, he is murthered, or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
by ſome of the Popes adherents. But the
Pope ſeems as Pilate, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 24.) to waſh his
hands from the bloud, and if they be found that
commit the murther, they ſuffer death and are
not protected.</p>
               <p>Here the Pope doth the ſame thing, but he
doth it not to glory in before the world; and to
juſtifie or ſhew himſelf a God thereby, for he
doth it privately, neither is it done to any whom
the Pope doth acknowledge himſelf inferiour to;
but only to ſuch Kings, or perſons, as did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Pope their ſuperiour once. But
this State, who firſt reverenced the King as was
due, and afterwards erected a Tribunal on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41718:23"/>
and bringing him before it; condemned to
die by a law, glorying in it before the world,
that what they did, God did, and that none ever
did the like before, neither could any do the like,
but God; is the ſame that ſits in the Temple of
God, and ſhews it ſelf to be God. For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
houſe, where they now ſit, was a church
or chappell, founded by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. as
may appear by divers antient Records. Here you
may ſee, there are conſecrated or dedicated pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
now; and that, that place muſt needs be the
Temple of God where the Beaſt ſits, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.
4. And ye have the ſame Temple mentioned,
(<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19.) <hi>Rev. 14. 15. 17. Rev.</hi> 5. 8. I do
not hereby excuſe the Pope, only I ſhew you,
that this State is the little Horn, that exalts it
ſelf higheſt, <hi>Dan. 8. 9, 10, 11, 12. Dan.</hi> 7. 8. which
by the Fathers is called the great Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Beaſt had horns like a Lamb, but ſpake
like a Dragon. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11.) So the State are
meek men like Lambs, in outward appearance,
but in their Votes, Dragons, ſpeaking againſt
the moſt <hi>HIGH,</hi> his will, and power, and
Kingdome. And many other marks I could ſhew
you, but I ſhall here forbear.</p>
               <p>You that look for Chriſts perſonall reigne
here on earth; know, that it ſhall be in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power eſtabliſhed here again, when this State
is diſſolved. You that look for the converſion of
the Jews, know that the aforeſaid King is the
means appointed by God to effect it. You that
would know how long this State ſhall flouriſh,
(<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25.) a time, times, and the dividing of
time, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 6. 7.) a time, times, and a halfe,
(<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14.) a time, times, and half a time. <hi>John</hi>
gives us this above in the ſame words, as <hi>Daniel</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41718:24"/>
doth, and then interprets it unto us (<hi>Rev. 11.
2. Rev.</hi> 13. 5.) to be 42. moneths, and that in
plain, is three yeares and a half; therefore in
<hi>September</hi> next, 1652. if not before, look for
miſhaps to the States affairs. Now I commit you
all to God, who is only wiſe, and knows all his
works, and can ſave beyond mans expectation.<note place="margin">Three years and a halfe it doth begin from the date of that Act, for to do all in the name of the Common wealth. And leſt you think that nothing remarkable came to paſſe in <hi>September</hi> laſt, not to matter your ſcuffling with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but to ſhew in a new thing, the threatning band of God upon you, from a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by which God puniſhed this Land once before; I mean, the <hi>Danes</hi> ſtopping your ſhips, your ſending a Fleet of men of War to demand them, yet to no purpoſe; And God at their return deſtroyes the greateſt of your men of War, and brings them all ſo neer their end, that the mind of God might eaſily be read therein, on the laſt of <hi>September</hi> it was done; So by his delay God would have you repent and ſet up the King.

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Beſeech you conſider ſeriouſly <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where
ye have the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the State of
<hi>England</hi> interwoven till you come to <hi>ver.</hi> 12. for
I find this State to be the worſt part of Popery
riſen up in another ſhape.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. Here are ten Kings,
yet have no Kingdome, he doth not ſay in the
plurall number, <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> but in the ſingular,
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> theſe ſaith he, receive power as
Kings, at one hour with the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>From this place it is evident, that theſe ten
are noble perſons, or men of power, in regard of
their compliance, and giving their ſtrength to
the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. Received power to be as Kings that
ſame hour, when <hi>England</hi> was made a State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. Ye have theſe ten make war with
the Kingly power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Ye have the State ſitting over Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Tongues, that is, over <hi>Wales, Scotland,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. 17. Theſe ten great ones which were
the making of the State ſhall now hate her and
make her deſolate. *<note place="margin">Theſe ten have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought the Whore to nothing, that is, the Mountain Parliament is become a Plain before them, and now they reign. And I am ſure there is a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> among them that hates confuſion, who will bring in the King ſignified by the Headſtone, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 7. but which of the ten this <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is, the Lord he knoweth.</note> For, ſaith he, God hath
put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and give their Kingdome unto the Beaſt,
untill the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41718:25"/>
Conſider then, theſe ten have interest but in
one Kingdome called their Kingdome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.
17. Now the Kings that are under the Pope,
are proper Kings; and have each of them a
Kingdom; ſo that if he had means ſuch Kings,
he would have ſaid Kingdoms; neither can it
be meant of theſe proper Kings, that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their power at one hour with the Pope, for
they came to their power, ſome by conqueſt, ſome
by bloud, ſome at one time, and ſome at another.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you once more ſeriouſly to
conſider this rlace, and remember what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
ſaith before it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9. Here is
the mind which hath wiſdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 26. 27. Speaking of the power, ſaith
he, I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and
it ſhall be no more, untill he come whoſe right it
is, and I will give it him.</p>
            <p>Now theſe three overturns in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13. are
called three woes, that follow the voice of the
5. 6. and 7. Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1. When the 5. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
ſounds, you ſee <hi>Eſſex</hi> falls from the King,
and opens the way of rebellion: as I foretold
the ſaid Earl, he ſhould do before this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began. And this woe ruinates the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
party, till ye come to <hi>ver.</hi> 12. where he
ſaith one woe is paſt.</p>
            <p>And <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 14. the 6. Angel ſoundeth, and
four Angels that were bound were looſed. This
ſignifies the tolleration and liberty to all ſorts,
to preach. And now independency gets up, and
this ſecond woe falls on the Presbyterian party,
untill you come to <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. where he ſaith,
the ſecond woe is paſt, and behold the third woe
cometh quickly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. the ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Angel ſoundeth, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41718:25"/>
then the King and Proteſtant party gets the
power again gloriouſly. And this third woe
falls on the Independent party.</p>
            <p>So that after 3. woes, or 3. overturnes, the
Crown comes to him, whoſe right it is by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 27. And the purpoſe of
God ſhall ſtand, according as he hath ſworne,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 24. And what is decreed againſt it ſhall
not ſtand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18.</p>
            <p>Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give

fulfill the remainder thereof, ſo that, as
ſure as the Parliament is diſſolved, ſo ſure
ſhall the <hi>King</hi> come to his <hi>Throne,</hi> as it is
ſufficiently proved in the aforeſaid Books:
And indeed if your Honors look into

turn water into bloud, or ſmite the earth
with a curſe, Rev.</hi> 11. 6. as it hath already
been done by theſe unnaturall civill Wars,
but rather would turn bloud into water,
and water into wine, to cheriſh the heart
of the ſorrowfull: And that the waters
and tears of repentance might waſh away
the guilt of blood, and become wine of
conſolation to this Nation, in their union
with their KING; without which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to their native and right KING,
there is no hopes of peace, certainty, and
ſafety to this Nation.</p>
            <p>Moſt Noble Worthies, whoſe actions

God thereby, and ſave an Ocean of

ſuch conditions of perfect peace from

               <hi>I</hi> Did not think to put this <hi>Petition</hi> into print ſo
ſuddainly, but that I find the general ſpirit of
the Nations, and men of all ſorts of judgements
exceedingly diſquieted, as not knowing what to do
at this time, but crying to me, as if they expected
that God will do ſome great things by me for the
ſettlement and peace of this Nation: It is truth,
I dare not deny it, and to Gods glory be it ſpoken,
that I have received Talents from him which I
muſt not hide, but ſhew to all how far God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to proceed how far God is pleaſed to proceed in
his work by me; beſeeching all men to look unto
him, who is the Man of Peace to them, I meane
<hi>King CHARLES:</hi> Every one ſaith to me, why do
not you, who have this wiſdome of God, go to the
General and ſhew him the way, and to the Councell
to ſhew them theſe things? Alas! I am at too far
a diſtance from them, for to be heard by them: Men
in ſuch places cannot hear ſuch a low voice as mine
is; It muſt be a generall <hi>Petition</hi> of the whole
Nation joyned together as one man, that they will
hear: Therefore I could wiſh that the Souldiery
did but hear a voice behind them, ſaying, Return
to your firſt Principles: You went out to fight for
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> but now there's none: I
know that God will bring in the <hi>King</hi> again, and
my hearts deſire is that I might perſwade men that
the <hi>Kings</hi> coming to his Throne might be without
bloud-ſhed, and that no party ſhould any longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a ſpirit of revenge; And to ſet you in a way
of compoſure, I could wiſh, that all (both Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and others) would Petition our worthy Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
to make their peace with the <hi>King,</hi> and to
receive him upon good and glorious terms, for the
<hi>King,</hi> and ſubjects: For if the <hi>King</hi> come in by the
ſword, you will become Slaves, and force him to
<pb facs="tcp:41718:28"/>
uſe tyranny: For Tyranny is a fit puniſhment for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
neither would I have any to Petition our
Worthies with kiſſes, or fine words, as <hi>Judas</hi> came
to our Saviour, that had his band of men to ſecond
him, or as at the beginning of theſe times the <hi>Scots
Presbyters</hi> and Covenanters came with their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on their Pikeſ-points to our late <hi>King:</hi> Let
not men preſume to do ſo now, be their party never
ſo great: For though now they think that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
hath a dependency upon them, and that there
is no Authority left ſave that: Yet there is a ſpark
of fire remaining (as it were) under the aſhes, which
is able at an inſtant to devour them all.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you, Petition in ſimplicity
and fingleneſs of heart, to deſire the General and his
Councel to make their addreſſes to the <hi>King</hi> for
peace, and ye that do this, look for life eternal: And
I beſeech you again (<hi>moſt noble Worthies</hi>) receive
all alike, and do not countenance, or diſcountenance
any, for this notion, or for that notion, or think,
that Religion is only words, but rather deeds of
common charity, and let not any be prided, or exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above their Brethren with a conceit of conqueſt,
but know, that ſuch a mind ſhall be abaſed; and
that according to our Chriſtian rule, he that
ſuffered moſt is the greateſt Conqueror: For a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
cannot conquer his <hi>King</hi> but by ſuffering meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and a <hi>King</hi> ſuffering meekly by the hand of his
people according to the mind of his <hi>King,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be Heir of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. I have
a bloudy Viſion to ſhew, but I look upon it as Gods
threatning hand, being perſwaded, that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
