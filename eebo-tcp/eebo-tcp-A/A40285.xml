            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT hath pleased God still to manifest his goodnesse to us, by delivering <hi>Sherborn</hi> Castle into our hands; wherein we found sixteen pieces of Ordinance, and one Morter piece: Yesterday, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a breach was made in the wall, wherein ten or twelve a breast might enter, I sent a second Summons to the Governour, to Surrender the Castle, which being refused by him, we possessed our selves of the breach, and beat the enemy from their works within, where they had planted 2. pieces of Ordnance, to oppose our entrance: And some of the Souldiers got into two of their Towers, and beat them from all other places of advantage within, which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Governour this day about two in the morning to send a Drum for a Parley, to whom Answer was returned, he must expect no other condition but Quarter for his life, which (upon those termes) he being unwilling to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113151:3"/>
I gave order that all things be made sit for a Storme: (The Myoners having fully wrought the Mine through the Castle wall, and foundation of the Tower:) The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy presently began to apprehend the danger, and sent a Drum to crave Quarter; but before he could get out to deliver his Message, the Souldiers were got into the Castle and works, and had the Plunder of the Castle, which by reason of their so timely entrance, could not be prevented: We took prisoners in the Castle, Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> the Governour, Colonell <hi>Giles Strangewayes,</hi> formerly a Member of the house, Sir <hi>John Walcoate,</hi> Coll. <hi>Thornhill,</hi> and others of quality, and about four hundred Common Souldiers. The reducing of this place, is of the greater concernment, in regard of the influence it had upon the dis-affected Clubmen in these parts, who (having the countenance of this Garrison) were made so bold in their attempts and meetings: I shall stay here not past a day, to settle this place, and then, after we have met and consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what is next fittest to be done for the publique ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viee, shall move hence with the Army accordingly. I remaine, Sir,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY lines commonly are the Messengers of good News; if I might be spared hence, none should have been more willing to have brought the News then my self: This day I sent you a Copy of Sir <hi>Levvis Dives</hi> Message to have Honorable Conditions; The answer the Generall returned, was in these words:
<q>
                  <p>SIR,</p>
                  <p>I Should have been as willing to gratifie you with Honorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as any man, having expressed so much Gallantry in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of your self; But the advantage <hi>I</hi> now have by being possessed of the Breach, and some of the Towers, as it may with reaon induce you to Surrender the place; so it Obligeth me in Honour to agree to no other Conditions; then Quarter for your lives, which I should be glad you would accept of, that so the Effusion of that blood, which will inevitably follow upon a Refusall, might be prevented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> It is against my nature to threaten or insult over your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but <hi>I</hi> must tell you, (and <hi>I</hi> wish you have a heart to believe it) That if you refuse this my offer, you and those with you must know, <hi>I</hi> will hear of no Termes for the future.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This answer being returned, the Governour could not brook it: Great and small shot plaid, our Souldiers rejoyced at the refusall: The Generall instantly gave Order to fit all things for a Storm, the Mines being finished: But without any Order to fall on, our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were in an instant both over the Castle walls and works; they within took down their bloody Colours, cryed for Quarter, and sent a Drum out, and an endeavour was used, they had Quarter; but it was happy for them; There was such plenty of Riches and Plunder within, which took up and busied the Souldier: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it would have been difficult to have got them Quarter. At our first entrance, some of them were slain, but none afterwards; though it were to be wished, the Souldier had that in Money,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113151:4"/>
which they took in Plunder; yet five shillings gotten in way of Spoil from an Enemy, gives them more content, then twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in a way of reward in an orderly manner; besides, being not rewarded (ten shillings a man) according to promise, when <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> was stormed, made them now more zealous to be their own Carvers. There was not a man but got Plunder, some two and three times over, as soon as they had been at home, came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and returned loaded with booty in my presence. My greatest care was to preserve Writings, but was glad to take the Souldiers leavings, and missed things there present, of great concernment; yet some was got, of the proceedings in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> was there with the Prince: The Generall intends to stay here but one day to settle their Peace, &amp; then to move with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as it may be in his Iudgement and the opinion of the Councell of War most for the Publique Service: I believe we shall go where we are not expected: The Army is Mustered, and most of it paid, and I hope will give a good Accompt of what ever Service they undertake: This businesse of <hi>Sherborn</hi> having tryed the skill and Resolution of the Souldier, more then in any things hath yet fallen out; and indeed, the Comptroller of the Ordnance, hath been a diligent and active man in managing the approaches, Bridges, Mines and Galleries. Once again, let me desire you to expidite all things fitting for Sieges, with all the speed that may be; a day lost in it, is of infinite dis-Service; above all, send Morter-peeces and Granado shels fit for them: They are at <hi>Warwick,</hi> but sent for.</p>
            <p>This being all time will give me leave to write, I rest, Sir,</p>
