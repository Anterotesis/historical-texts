            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True <hi>Account,</hi> of the Notorious Wicked Life of that Grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor, <hi>Iohn Taylor,</hi> one of the <hi>Sweet-Singers of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>SInce the late Account we gave you of the <hi>Lewd Principles,</hi> and <hi>Prophane Practices</hi> of the <hi>Sweet-Singers of</hi> Israel, (as they call themselves); we have made a much farther Impection into their Impieties; and indeed find them so Absurd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Religion and Honesty; and also, that they (the Professors of them) are so Diligent &amp; Industrious, to Recommend them to the Embraces of the Vulgar; that we held our selves oblig'd by Conscience, to exhibit this Ensuing Narra<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive, wherein the Luxurious &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Life of this Grand Imposter, <hi>Iohn Taylor,</hi> the well-disposed <hi>Reader</hi> will find, that this Impious Sect of <hi>The Sweet Singers of</hi> Israel, <hi>or, Famyly of Love,</hi> ought not only to be Excommunicated out of the Conversation of all good Christians; but indeed, to be Excluded the Benefits of a Civiliz'd Common-Wealth:</p>
            <p>But before we wade into the muddy History of this Impostor's Life, we thought good, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that we will insert nothing concerning this <hi>Iohn Tayler,</hi> but what in effect we received from his own Lips, or else, extracted from his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts which any one, for the expence of a groat or six pence, to be spent with him in drink (in the <hi>Prison</hi>) may either hear, or see.</p>
            <p>He came up to <hi>London</hi> above Twenty Year since; but being destitute of Employment (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102339:3"/>
been bred to any Trade,) she was forc'd to wander about the City, in little better Degree, than that of a Vagabond: And being destitute of Friends, that might Contribute to his Relief, it was not long ere he felt the Effects of Necessity: But by his Art and Dexterity, at last, over-came all.</p>
            <p>Being Naturally of an Inquisitive Nature, he made it for some time his business to haunt Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and Seditious meetings, where finding that many of their Teachers were much admired, and mightily treated and incouraged, by their Ignorant <hi>proselytes</hi>; and finding in himself, that he had as much Impudence, (if not Learning) as the best of them, he presently resolved to set up for himself: And as the <hi>Devil</hi> would have it, at that time (when <hi>Prophaness</hi> it self, might have bin Licens'd, so that the <hi>Prophaner</hi> could any way contribute to the Establishment of the then <hi>Usurper</hi>) there were an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start Sort of <hi>Religionists,</hi> called <hi>Ranters</hi>; whose lewd Lives, and loose Principles, did so exactly jump with the Vitious inclinations of this <hi>Iohn Taylor,</hi> that he firmly resolved, when he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd it, by foysting-in some other obsolete <hi>Tenets</hi> of forgotten <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to pitch on the Profession of no other Opinion but this; which he terms, <hi>The Sweet singers of</hi> Israel, or, <hi>the Family of Love.</hi> And having just as much Learning, as was necessary to contribute to his Purpose; that is, by the help of it he could make a shift to read <hi>English</hi> and Write it in a hand Unintelligable to any one but himself; it was his Misfortune, to light on an old <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi> of the <hi>Heresie</hi> of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102339:3"/>
of a Community with Women, or, that it was lawful for them to have Carnal knowledg of each others Wives: With many more Irrational, Irreligious, and Ridiculous <hi>Fopperies</hi>; which, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially blended among those of the <hi>Ranters,</hi> made such a <hi>Hodg-Podg</hi> of Non-Sence, that it would have pusseld <hi>Adam</hi> himself, had he bin living, to give it a Name.</p>
            <p>However, by these wicked Contrivances, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late Tyranny and Rebellion, he made a shift to delude many ignorant Adherents, and had in a good measure pickt up his Crums; when that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar care taken for the promotion of the only True Religion, which he providently imagined would be the inseparable Concomitant of his Majesties hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Restoration, frighted him from these evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and forc'd him Clandestinly, in Holes, and Corners, to whisper that damnable <hi>Heresy,</hi> which before he had the impudence to maintain, even in the Face of a Considerable Congregation. After this, we heard nothing of him for many Years, till here of late taking advantage of that merciful Indulgence, graciously permitted 10 more moderate Discenters, he has again endeavor'd to Revive his damnable Tenets; but with such ill success, that as he was preferring them to some Wiser and Honester than himself, they intercepted him, speaking Blasphemy; For which he had two fair Tryalls at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and was found Guilty of the Indictments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon deservedly Committed to the <hi>Kings Bench Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> there to remain till he Recanted his former Blasphemous Pretentions, <hi>to be the Son of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102339:4"/>
God</hi> &amp;c. and could deposite the sum of One Thousand Marks, which he was Fin'd in, for the asserting that, and many more wicked and unheard of Blasphemies.</p>
            <p>As for his behaviour, since his Commitment to that Prison, it has been so debaucht, and prophane, that even his Fellow Prisoners are both aweary and ashamed of him; if he meets with my one will treat him, he will drink liberally till he is drunk, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat &amp; affirm, his Blasphemy, <hi>That he is the Son of God,</hi> That it is impossible for him to Sin; with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of other horrid, and irreverend expressions, which ought rather to be rack't up in the Embers of oblivion, than disturb the Ears of any well mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian.</p>
            <p>Till Monday last he Continued to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with these, and such like hideous enormities, to the great exercise of the Patience of those poor Confin'd Creatures, who were by force oblig'd to be his Auditors; but then, as if the <hi>Devil,</hi> who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated him all that while, had hitherto wanted an Opportunity to effect his design, he was then so great with him, as to Prompt him to add <hi>Treason</hi> to his <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which the Sincere Loyalty of Several of his Fellow Prisoners, who over-heard him, being not able to endure to hear, and indeed the Laws of the Land warning them to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>As their duty was, they presented an Enformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him, in such manner, that order was sent to the Marshall, to keep him Close Prisoner to the Common side, till he should be sent for, from thence to <hi>New-gate,</hi> and take his Tryal at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> there to receive Sentence for his fact according to Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102339:4"/>In the <hi>Interim,</hi> for a Taste of these <hi>Sweet Singer's</hi> Devotion, we shall give you one of their Special Songs; made by this <hi>Iohn Taylor,</hi> and sent to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Muggleton</hi> (as he calls him) Which, with much Affectation, as well as Affection, they Sing to an old Ballad-Tune: The words are these extracted <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> out of his own <hi>Manuscript</hi>; and therefore, not to be mended.</p>

            <p>A Woman of their Profession (<hi>Betty Roan,</hi> by Name) came into the Room, whil'st we were with <hi>Taylor</hi>; and sung us one, of almost Half-an-Hour long, to the Tune of, <hi>Ienny come tye my Bonny Cravat:</hi> Aggravating the irreverence with such An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and wanton Gestures, as could not but engage us into a great Amazement; and could not but have Operated the like Consternation in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, or Considerate Christian, that had bin in our, Room.</p>
            <p>The Publisher of this Paper, went himself to learn the Truth of this matter; and has Deliver'd nothing in this Paper, but upon certain knowledg of the Truth of it.</p>
