            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HE is a perſon of a more exerciſed faith than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; one governed by Inſtinct, not Intellect; and who (like thoſe of old) never thinks he has enough of the Deity; till beſide himſelf: You may call him if you pleaſe, a perpetual motion, or a reſtleſs whirligig, ever Turning from bad to worſe; or the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of Divinity, carried about with every wind; leaſt conſidering whence it cometh, or whether it goeth; as even ſuch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is every one that is born of him: It may be thought, the Prophet had ſomewhat like him in his eye, in that wheel (of his) within a wheel; for of himſelf he never was, but ill-ſplit from another; like thoſe imperfect, dough-bak'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produced by the Sun on the banks of <hi>Nile</hi>; ſo that his generation is founded in Corruption, and his extraction of the ſame Parentage with Monſters, not intended, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. His Principles are like the Chaos; a confuſed lump of every thing and nothing; or a Gallimofry of negatives; nor this, nor that, nor t'other, but what he is no man knows, no, not the Angels in Heaven, nor himſelf to boot; this only excepted, that he is more party colour'd than <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coat, and patch'd together of more pieces than a Taylor's Cuſhion; Nor is his practiſe much unſuitable to his principles; he puts on Religion as a <hi>Cloak,</hi> not a G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That he talks of nothing but new light, and Propheſie, ſpiritual Incomes, In-dwellings, Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Manifeſtations, Sealings, and the like gibberiſh and canting. To which alſo the zealous twang of the Noſe, adds no ſmall efficacy.

This ſucceſs new modeſs his Conſcience, and like (<hi>Aaron</hi>'s rod) he ſwallows up every thing that lies in his way: Even Princes muſt lay their hands on their mouths, and the Nobles not ſpeak again to his words: The Poor diſtreſſed is become <hi>Hogan Mogan,</hi> and the <hi>Servus ſervorum, Dominus dominantium:</hi> The little flock claims a Kingdom <hi>in condigno,</hi> and the choſen generation ſets up for a Royal Prieſthood. In ſhort, this little Horn takes a mouth to himſelf ſpeaking mighty things, and his language is, Overturn, Overturn, Overturn. And now he makes his Doctrine ſuitable to his Text, and owns above-board, that Dominion is founded in Grace, not Nature: That the goods of this world, are properly the Elects: That himſelf and his Hyperdolins, are the only <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and all the reſt <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>: That the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be propagated, as the ſecond Temple was built, with the Sword in one hand, and the Trowel in t'other; or as the Abbot (in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3ds time) gave it in abſolution to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Gladium ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alem ſine gladio materiali nihil poſſe.</hi> What ſhall I add? He declares that <hi>quis ſuſcitabit eum?</hi> was perſonally meant of his Tribe: And yet this man has his followers, and theſe of the honorable Women too, not a few; for (to ſay truth) his converſation is much after the rate of that before the Flood, the ſons of God among the daughters of men: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in all places, whether true or falſe, being moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to that Sex: 'Twas the Devil's policy to our firſt Parents, for well he knew that to beguil <hi>Eve,</hi> was the ready way to hook in <hi>Adam.</hi> And thus he proves a ſtumbling block to the Wives; and a rock of offence to the Husbands.

And for his Grace at meat, what can I better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it too, than a <hi>Canterbury rack,</hi> half pace, half gallop; ſo his, an odd hobbling ſhuffle, between a Grace and a Prayer, and a Prayer and a Grace: Laſtly, as to his vertues, (for it cannot be denyed, but he has ſomewhat of that which <hi>Tully</hi> calls, <hi>adumbrata virtutum ſpecimina</hi>) I wiſh it might be ſaid of them, that they were other than mask'd hypocriſie, the Poet hit it:
