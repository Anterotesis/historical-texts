            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> DOE not finde it straunge (excellent King,) that when <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> hee that was surnamed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, had set foorth a certaine booke, which is not now extant: many men tooke it for a discourse
<pb facs="tcp:4650:3"/>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and many others tooke it for a Treatise of <hi>Policie,</hi> and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of estate. For, there is a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie and consent, betweene the rules of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the true rules of <hi>Policie:</hi> The one being nothing els but an order in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and the other an order, in the gouernment of an estate. And therefore, the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and erudition of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> was in a science, which was termed by a name, then of great reuerence, but now dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and taken in ill part. For, the <hi>Persian Magicke,</hi> which was the secret literature of their Kings, was an obseruation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Nature, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof to a sense poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> taking the fundamentall
<pb facs="tcp:4650:3"/>
lawes of <hi>Nature,</hi> with the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and passages of them, as an originall, and first modell, whence to take and describe a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and imitation for gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>After this manner, the foresaid Instructors fet before their Kings, the examples of the celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest, which haue great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and veneration, but no rest or intermission, beeing in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall office of motion, for the cherishing, in turne, and in course, of inferiour bodyes. Expressing likewise, the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the motions of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which though they ought to bee swifte and rapide in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of occasion and dispatche,
<pb facs="tcp:4650:4"/>
yet are they to be constant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, without wauering or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p>So did they represent vnto them, how that the <hi>Heauens</hi> do not inritch themselues by the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Seas,</hi> nor keepe no dead stocke or vntouched treasure, of that they drawe to them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, but whatsoeuer moysture they doe leuie and take from both the elements in vapours, they doe spend and turne backe againe in showers, onely houlding and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them vp for a time, to the end to issue and distribute them in season.</p>
            <p>But chiefely they did expresse and expound vnto them, that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawe of <hi>Nature,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things doe subsist and are
<pb facs="tcp:4650:4"/>
preserued: which is, that euery thing in nature, although it hath his priuate and particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and appetite, and doth follow and pursue the same in small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and when it is deliuered and freed from more generall and common respects: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, when there is question or cause, for the sustaining of the more generall, they forsake their owne particularities and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and attend and conspire to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the publike.</p>
            <p>So, we see the Yron in small quantitie will ascend and approach to the Load-stone, vpon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sympathie. But, if it bee any quantitie of moment, it leaues his appetite of amity with the Load-stone, and like a good Patriott, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:4650:5"/>
to the earth, which is the place and region, of massy bodies.</p>
            <p>So againe, the water, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like bodies, doe fall towardes the center of the earth: which is, as was saide, their region or Country. And yet, we see nothing more vsuall, in all water-workes and Ingens, then that the water (rather then to suffer any distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or disunion in <hi>Nature,</hi>) will ascend: forsaking the loue to his owne region or Country, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it selfe to the body next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning.</p>
            <p>But, it were too large a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to proceede to more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this kinde. Your Maiesty your selfe, did fall vppon a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of this <hi>Nature,</hi> in your gratious speech of thankes vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4650:5"/>
your Councell. When acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Princely, their vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and well deseruinges, it pleased you to note, that it was a successe and euent aboue the course of <hi>Nature,</hi> to haue so great a change, with so great a quiet: forasmuch as suddayne and great mutations, as well in state as in <hi>Nature,</hi> are rarely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence and perturbation. So as still I conclude, there is, as was saide, a congruity betweene the principles of <hi>Nature,</hi> and and of <hi>Pollicie.</hi> And, least that Instance may seeme to appone to this assertion, I may, euen in that perticular, with your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties fauour, offer vnto you a Type or Patern in <hi>Nature</hi> much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling this present eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in your state:
<pb facs="tcp:4650:6"/>
namely earthquakes, which many of them, bring euer much terror and wonder, but no actuall hurt; the earth trembling for a moment, and sodainely stablishing in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quiet, as it was before.</p>
            <p>This knowledge then, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the gouernment of the world, a mirror for the gouernement of a state, beeing a wisedome almost lost (whereof the reason I take to be, because of the difficulty, for one man to imbrace both Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophies;) I haue thought good to make some proofe, (as farre as my weakenesse, and the straights of time will suffer,) to reuiue in the handling of one particular wherewith now I most humbly present your Maiesty. For, surely, as hath beene said, it is a forme of
<pb facs="tcp:4650:6"/>
discourse, anciently vsed towardes Kings. And, to what King, should it be more proper then to a King, that is studious to conioyne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue virtue and actiue virtue together.</p>
            <p>Your Maiesty is the first King, which hath had the honour, to be <hi>Lapis angularis,</hi> to vnite these two mighty and warlike nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnder one Soueraignety and Monarchy. It dooth not appeare by the recordes and memories, of any true histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor scarcly by the fiction and pleasure of any fabulous narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or tradition: that euer, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antiquity, this Iland of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> was vnited vnder one King, before this day. And yet, there be no Mountaines or races
<pb facs="tcp:4650:7"/>
of hils, there be no seas, or great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, there is no diuersity of toung or language, that hath inuited or prouoked this ancient separation, or diuorce.</p>
            <p>The lot of <hi>Spaine</hi> was, to haue the seuerall Kingdomes of that continent (<hi>Portugal</hi> onely except,) to be vnited in an age, not long past: and, now in our age, that of <hi>Portugal</hi> also, which was the last that held out, to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with the rest. The lot of <hi>France</hi> hath beene, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time likewise, to haue reannexed vnto that crowne, the seuerall Duchies and portions, that were in former times dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. The lotte of this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is the last reserued for your Maiesties happye times, by the
<pb facs="tcp:4650:7"/>
speciall prouidence and fauour of God: who hath brought your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty to this happy coniunction, with great consent of harts, and in the strength of your yeares, and in the maturity of your experience. It resteth therefore, but that, (as I promised) I set before your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Princelye consideration, the grounds of <hi>Nature,</hi> touching the Vnion and commixture of bodies; &amp; the correspondence which they haue with the groundes of <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> in the coniunction of states and kingdomes.</p>
            <p>First therefore that Position, <hi>vis vnita fortior,</hi> beeing one of the common notions of the minde, needeth not much to be induced or illustrate. We see the Sunne (when he enters, &amp; while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb facs="tcp:4650:8"/>
vnder the signe of <hi>Leo</hi>) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth more vehement heates, then when he is in <hi>Cancer</hi>: what time his beames are neuerthelesse, more perpendicular. The reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in great part, hath beene truely ascribed, to the coniunction and Corradiation in that place of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, of the Sunne, with the foure Starres of the first magnitude, <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Canicula, Cor Leonis, &amp; Cauda Leonis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, the Moone likewise, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tradition, while she is in the same signe of <hi>Leo,</hi> is saide to be at the heart, or, to respect the hart. Which is not for any affinity, which that place in heauen can haue, with that part of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: But onely, because the Moone is then (by reason of the coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:4650:8"/>
and neerenesse with the starres aforenamed) in greatest strength of influence: and so worketh vppon that part, in inferiour bodyes, which is most vitall and principall.</p>
            <p>So, wee see waters and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, in small quantity, do easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purrifie and corrupt: but, in large quantity, subsist long, by reason of the strength, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, by Vnion.</p>
            <p>So, in Earthquakes, the more generall doe little hurt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the vnited weight, that they offer to subuert: but, narrow and particular Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, haue many times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned whole townes and Citties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4650:9"/>So then, this point tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the force of Vnion is euident. And therefore it is more fitte to speake of the manner of Vnion. Wherein againe, it will not be pertinent, to handle one kinde of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is Vnion, by vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: when one body, doth meerely subdue another, and conuerteth the same into his owne <hi>Nature,</hi> extinguishing and expulsing, what part so euer of it, it cannot ouercome. As, when the fire conuerteth the Wood into fire, purging awaye the Smoake and the Ashes, as vnapt matter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame. Or, when the bodye of a liuing creature dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
<pb facs="tcp:4650:9"/>
and assimilate foode and nourishment: purging and expelling whatsoeuer it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conuerte. For, these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations doe aunswere in matter of <hi>Pollicie,</hi> to Vnion of Countreyes by conquest: where the conquering State dooth extinguish, extirpate and expulse any parte of the estate conquered, which it findeth so contrarye, as it cannot alter and conuerte it. And therefore leauing violent Vnions: wee will consider onelye of naturall Vnions.</p>
            <p>The difference is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which the best obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in <hi>Nature</hi> doe take,
<pb facs="tcp:4650:10"/>
betweene <hi>Compositio</hi> and <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>; putting together and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The one beeing but a coniunction of bodyes in place, the other in quality, and consent: the one, the mother of sedition and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the other of peace and continuance: The one rather a confusion, then an Vnion, the other properly a Vnion. Therefore we see those bodies which they call <hi>ImperfectÃ¨ mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> last not, but are speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolued. For, take for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Snow or froth, which are Compositions of ayre and water: in them you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how easily they seuer and dissolue, the water closing

togeather, and excluding the ayre.</p>
            <p>So, those three bodies, which the Alchymists doe so much celebrate, as the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of things, that is to say, <hi>Earth, Water</hi> and <hi>Oyle,</hi> (which it pleaseth them to terme <hi>Salt, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi>:) wee see, if they bee vnited onely by composition, or putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, how weakely and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they doe incorporate. For, water and earth, make but an vnperfect slime, and, if they be forced togeather by agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet, vpon a little setling, the earth resides in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. So, water and Oyle, though by agitation it be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:4650:11"/>
into an Oyntment. Yet, after a little setling, the Oyle will floate vppon the toppe.</p>
            <p>So as, such vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect minglinges, continue no longer, then they are forced: and still in the ende, the worthiest getteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.</p>
            <p>But, otherwise it is, of perfect mixture. For, wee see those three bodies, of Earth, Water and Oyle; when they are ioyned in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or Minerall, they are so vnited, as without great subtiltie of Arte, and force of extraction, they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:4650:11"/>
bee seperated and reduced into the same simple bodyes againe. So as, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Compositio</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio,</hi> cleerelye set downe is this:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Compositio,</hi> is the ioyning or putting togeather of bodyes, without a new Forme: and <hi>Mistio,</hi> is the ioyning or putting togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bodies, vnder a new Forme.</p>
            <p>For, the new Forme, is <hi>Commune Vinculum:</hi> and without that, the oulde Formes, will be at striefe and discorde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4650:12"/>Now, to reflect this light of <hi>Nature,</hi> vpon matter of estate: there hath beene put in practise in gouernment, these two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes of pollicie, in vniting &amp; conioyning of states &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. The one to retaine the auncient formes still seuered, and onely conioyned in Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingtie; the other, to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induce a new forme agreeable and conuenient to the entire estate. The former of these hath beene more vsuall, and is more easie: but the latter, is more happy. For, if a man doe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely reuolue histories of all nations, and iudge truly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: hee will make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that there were neuer
<pb facs="tcp:4650:12"/>
any State that were good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures, but the <hi>Romaines:</hi> which because it was the best state in the worlde, and is the best example of this pointe, wee will chiefely insist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.</p>
            <p>In the Antiquities of <hi>Rome, Virgill</hi> brings in <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by way of Oracle or perdiction, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mixture of the <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi>:
<q>
                  <l>Sermonem ausonij patrium, mores<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tenebunt.</l>
                  <l>Vtque est, nomen erit: comisti cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore tantum</l>
                  <l>Subsident Teucri, morem, ritusque sacrorum</l>
                  <l>Adijciam, faciamque omnes vno ore Latinos.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4650:13"/>Hine genus Ausomo mistum quod sanguine surget,</l>
                  <l>SuprÃ  homines, suprÃ  ire deos pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate videbis</l>
               </q>
Wherein <hi>Iupiter</hi> maketh a kinde of partition or distribution, that <hi>Italy</hi> should giue the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and the lawes; <hi>Troye</hi> should giue a mixture of men, and some religious rites, and both people should meete in one name of <hi>Latines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soone after the foundation of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Romaines</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> mingled vppon equall termes. Wherin the interchange went so euen, that (as <hi>Liui</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) the one nation gaue the name to the place, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4650:13"/>
to the people. For, <hi>Rome</hi> continued the name: but, the people were called <hi>Quirites,</hi> which was the <hi>Sabine</hi> worde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued of <hi>Cures,</hi> the countrie of <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, that which is chiefly to be noted, in the whole conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the <hi>Romaine</hi> gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were so liberall of their naturallizations, as in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they made perpetuall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For their manner was, to graunt the same, not onely to particular persons, but to Families and linages: and not onely so, but to whole Citties and Countries. So as, in the end it came to passe, that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Communis patria,</hi> as some
<pb facs="tcp:4650:14"/>
of the Ciuilians call it.</p>
            <p>So, we read, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had beene beaten with Roddes, and therevpon charged the Officer with violation of the priuiledge of a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi>: the Captaine then sayde to him; Art thou then a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>? That priuiledge hath cost mee deere! To whome Saint <hi>Paul</hi> replyed: But I was so borne. And yet, in another place Saint <hi>Paul</hi> professeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that hee was a <hi>Iewe</hi> by tribe. So as it is manifest that some of his Ancestors were naturalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to him and to his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
            <p>So, wee read, that it was one of the first despights that was
<pb facs="tcp:4650:14"/>
done to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee had obtayned Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization for a Cittye in <hi>Gaul,</hi> one of the Cittizens of that Cittye, was beaten with roddes, by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Consul <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So wee read in <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> that, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Claudius</hi> time, the nation of <hi>Gaul,</hi> that part which was called <hi>Comata,</hi> the wilder part, were suters to bee made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Honours of beeing Senators and Officers of <hi>Rome.</hi> His wordes are: <hi>CÃ¹m de sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendo, Senatu agitaretur, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moresque Galliae quae Commata ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatur, foedera et Ciuitatem Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam
<pb facs="tcp:4650:15"/>
pridem assecuti, ius adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscendorum in vrbe honorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peterent: multus ea super re, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riusque rumor, et studijs diuersis apud Principem certabatur</hi>: and, in the ende, after long debate, it was ruled, they should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>So likewise, the authoritie of <hi>Nicholas Machiauell,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to bee contemned: who, inquiring of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the growth of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Empire, dooth giue iudgement, there was not one greater then this, that the state did so easily compound, and incorporate with straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>It is most true, that most
<pb facs="tcp:4650:15"/>
Estates and Kingdomes, haue taken the other course: of which this effect hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the addition of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Empire and territorie, hath beene rather matter of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, then matter of strength vnto them; yea, and further; it hath kepte aliue the seede and rootes of reuoltes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, for many ages: As, wee may see in a freshe and notable example of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> which though it were vnited to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile</hi> by mariadge, and not by conquest, and so descended inhereditarie vnion by the space of more then a hundreth years:
<pb facs="tcp:4650:16"/>
yet, because it was continued in a diuided gouernement, and not well incorporated and cemented with the other Crownes; entred into a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, vpon point of their <hi>Fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,</hi> or liberties, now, of very late yeares.</p>
            <p>Now, to speake briefely, of the seuerall partes of that forme, whereby states and kingdomes are perfectly vnited: they are, besides the soueraignety it selfe, foure in number. <hi>Vnion in Name, Vnion in Language, Vnion in Lawes, and Vnion in Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Name, though it seeme but a superficiall and outward matter; yet it carrieth much
<pb facs="tcp:4650:16"/>
impression and inchantment. The generall and common name of <hi>Grecia,</hi> made the <hi>Greekes</hi> alwayes apt to vnite (though otherwise full of diuisions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues:) against other nations, who they called Barbarous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>He<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tian</hi> name, is no small band to knit together, their leagues and confederacies, the faster. The common name of <hi>Spaine,</hi> no doubt hath beene a speciall meane of the better Vnion and conglutination, of the seuerall kindomes of <hi>Castile, Aragon, Granada, Nauarra, Valencia, Catalonia,</hi> and the rest: comprehending also now lately <hi>Portugall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4650:17"/>For Language, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to insist vpon it: because both your Maiesties kingdoms, are of one language, though of seuerall Dialects: and the difference so small betweene them, as promiseth rather an inriching of one Language, then a continuance of two.</p>
            <p>For lawes, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Synewes of gouernment, they be of three natures. <hi>Iura,</hi> which I will terme Freedomes, or abilities, <hi>Leges,</hi> and <hi>Mores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For abilities and Freedoms, they were amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>; of foure kindes, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>Ius Connubij, Ius Ciuitatis, Ius suffragij,</hi> and <hi>Ius Petitionis,</hi> or <hi>Ius honorum. Ius Connubij,</hi> is a
<pb facs="tcp:4650:17"/>
thing, in these times, out of vse. For, marriage is open betweene all diuersity of Nations. <hi>Ius Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitatis</hi> answereth to that we call <hi>Denization,</hi> or <hi>Naturalization. Ius suffragij</hi> answereth to voyce in Parliament, or voice in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such, as haue voyce in Parliament. <hi>Ius petitionis,</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to place in Councell and office. And, the Romanes did many times seuer these free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, granting <hi>Ius connubij, sine Ciuitate,</hi> and <hi>Ciuitatem sine suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragio, &amp; Suffragium sine Iure pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionis,</hi> which was commonly with them the last.</p>
            <p>For lawes, it is a matter of curiosity and inconuenience, to seeke eyther to extripate all
<pb facs="tcp:4650:18"/>
particular customes, or, to draw all subiectes to one place or resort of Iudicature and Session. It sufficeth, there be an vniformity in the Principall and fundamentall Lawes, both Ecclesiasticall and ciuill. For, in this point the rule houldes, which was pronounced by an ancient Father, touching the diuersity of rites in the church. For, finding the vesture of the Queene, (in the Psalme) which did prefigure the church, was of diuerse colours: and, finding againe, that Christes Coate was without a seame: hee concludes well, <hi>In ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te varietas sit, scissura non fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4650:18"/>For Manners, a consent in them is to be sought industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; but, not to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. For, nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst people, breedes so much pertinacie, in houlding their customes, as suddaine and violent offer to remooue them.</p>
            <p>And, as for Employments; it is no more, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different hand, and execution of that verse:
<q>
                  <l>Tros, TyriusuÃ© mihi, nulle discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine agetur.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There remaineth onely, to remember out of the grounds of <hi>Nature,</hi> the two conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of perfect <hi>mixture:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former is <hi>Time.</hi> For, the
<pb facs="tcp:4650:19"/>
naturall Philosophers say well, that <hi>compositio,</hi> is <hi>opus homines</hi>: and <hi>Mistio,</hi> is <hi>opus Naturae.</hi> For it is the dutie of man, to make a fitte application of bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But, the perfect fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and incorporation of them, must bee left to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Time</hi>: and vnnaturall hasting thereof, dooth disturbe the worke, and not dispatche it.</p>
            <p>So, wee see, after the grift is put into the stock, and bound; it must bee left to <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> to make that <hi>continuum,</hi> which was at first but <hi>contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> And, it is not any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall pressing, or thrusting together: that will preuent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4650:19"/>
season, but rather hinder it. And so, in liquors, those mixtures which are at the first troubled: growe after cleere and setled, by the benefit of rest and time.</p>
            <p>The second condition is: that the greater drawe the lesse. So wee see, when two lights doe meete, the greater dooth darken and drowne the lesse. And, when a smaller riuer, runs into a greater, it leeseth both his name and streame.</p>
            <p>And hereof to conclude, we see an excellent example in the Kingdomes of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> The Kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two Tribes; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Israel,</hi> contained ten.
<pb facs="tcp:4650:20"/>
King <hi>Dauid</hi> raigned first ouer <hi>Iuda,</hi> for certaine yeeres: &amp;, after the death of <hi>Isbosheth,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Saul,</hi> obtayned likewise the Kingdome of <hi>Israel.</hi> This v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion continued in him, and likewise in his sonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> by the space of seuentie yeares at least, betweene them both. But yet, because the seate of the kingdome was kept still in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and so the lesse sought to drawe the greater; vppon the first occasion offered, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes brake againe, and so continued, diuided for euer after.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse made oblation vnto your Maiestie of these simple fruites,
<pb facs="tcp:4650:20"/>
of my deuotion and studies: I do wish (and I do wish it, not in the nature of an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to my thinking,) that this happye vnion of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties two Kingdomes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; may bee in as good an houre; and vnder the like diuine prouidence, as that was, betweene the <hi>Romaines</hi> and the <hi>Sabines.</hi>
