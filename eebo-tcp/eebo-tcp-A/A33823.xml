            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PROEM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Conſtitution of our Engliſh Government (the beſt in the World) is no Arbitrary <hi>Tyranny,</hi> like the Turkiſh Grand Seignior's, or the French Kings, whoſe Wills (or rather <hi>Luſts)</hi> diſpoſe of the Lives and Fortunes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Subjects; Nor an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> where the great ones (like Fiſh in the Ocean) prey upon, and live by devouring the <hi>leſſer</hi> at their pleaſure: Nor yet <hi>a Democracy</hi> or popular State, much leſs an <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> where all confuſedly are <hi>hail fellows well met.</hi> But a moſt excellently mixt or <hi>qualified Monarchy,</hi> where the King is veſted with large <hi>Prerogatives</hi> ſufficient to ſupport <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and reſtrain'd only from Power of doing himſelf and his People <hi>harm,</hi> (which would be contrary to the very end of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and is properly rather <hi>weakneſs</hi> than pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) the <hi>Nobility</hi> adorn'd with Priviledges to be a <hi>Screen</hi> to Majeſty, and a refreſhing Shade to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50183:7"/>
Inferiours, and the <hi>Commonalty</hi> too, ſo Guarded in their Perſons and Properties by the fence of Law, as renders them <hi>Free-men,</hi> not Slaves.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> and other Nations the meer Will of the Prince <hi>is Law,</hi> his Word takes off any mans <hi>Head,</hi> impoſes <hi>Taxes,</hi> or ſeizes any mans <hi>Eſtate,</hi> when, how, and as often as he liſts; and if one be <hi>Accuſed,</hi> or but ſo much as ſuſpected of any Crime, he may either preſently Execute him, or Baniſh, or Impriſon him at pleaſure; or if he will be ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to proceed by Form of their Laws, if any <hi>two Villains</hi> will but ſwear againſt the poor Party, his Life is gone. Nay, if there be <hi>no Witneſſes,</hi> yet he may be put to the <hi>Rack,</hi> the Tortures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make many an <hi>Innocent</hi> Perſon confeſs himſelf Guilty, and then with ſeeming <hi>Juſtice</hi> he is Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or if he prove <hi>ſo ſtout</hi> as in Torments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Fact, yet he comes off with <hi>Disjoynted Bones,</hi> and ſuch Weakneſs as renders his Life a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to him ever after.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>England,</hi> the Law is both the <hi>Meaſure and the Bond</hi> of every Subjects Duty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, each man having a fixed Fundamental Right born with him, as to <hi>Freedom of his Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Property in his Eſtate,</hi> which he cannot be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, but either by his conſent, or ſome Crime, for which the Law has Impos'd ſuch a Penalty or Forfeiture. For all our Kings take a ſolemn Oath, <note n="1" place="margin">See Book of Oaths, <hi>p. 1. &amp;</hi> 3.</note> At their Coronation, <hi>to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and cauſe the Laws to be kept,</hi> which was done by our preſent moſt Gracious Soveraign: <note n="2" place="margin">Bakers Cron. <hi>ſol.</hi> 741.</note> Likewiſe all our Judges take an Oath, wherein amongſt other points, they ſwear, <note n="3" place="margin">Book of Oaths <hi>p.</hi> 216.</note> 
               <hi>To do equal Law, and Right to all the Kings Subjects, Rich and Poor, and not to delay any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Common Right for the Letters of the King,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50183:7"/>
or of any other Perſon, or for any other Cauſe; But if any ſuch Letters come to them, they ſhall proceed to do the Law, the ſame Letters notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Forteſoue</hi> (who was firſt <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> and afterwards Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> to King <hi>Henry the</hi> 6th.) in his Book <hi>de Laudibus Legum Angliae,</hi> cap. 9. <hi>Non poteſt Rex Angliae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>cannot alter nor change the Laws of his Realm at his pleaſure; For why, he Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his People by Power not only Royal, but alſo Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; If his Power over them were only Regal, then he might change the Laws of his Realm, and charge his Subjects with Tallage and other Burthens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent, and ſuch is the Dominion that the Civil Laws purport, when they cry,</hi> Quod prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi plecuit Legis habet Vigorom, <hi>The Princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has the force of a Law. But from this much differeth the power of a King, whoſe Government over his People is Politick; For he can neither change Laws without the conſent of his Subjects, nor yet charge them with Impoſitions againſt their Wills; Wherefore his People do frankly and freely enjoy and occupy their own Goods, being Ruled by ſuch Laws as they themſelves deſire.</hi> Thus <hi>Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue;</hi> with whom Accords <hi>Bracton</hi> a Reverend Judge and Law-Author in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, ſaying—<hi>Rex in Regno ſuo ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores habet Deum &amp; Legem; The King in his Realm hath two Superiors, God and the Law;</hi> for he is under the <hi>Directive,</hi> though not <hi>Coercive</hi> Power of the Law; and on the ſame Score Judge <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſpeaking of our <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> which are Coeval with the Government, ſticks not to ſay, <hi>The Laws of</hi> England <hi>were never the Dictates of any Conquerors Sword, or the Placita or good Will and pleaſure of any King of this Nation, or to ſpeak Impartially and Freely, the Reſults of any Parliament that ever ſate in this Land.</hi> And the late cited <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50183:8"/>
13 <hi>chap.</hi> has a very apt ſimilitude to Illuſtrate and Demonſtrate this, <hi>The Law,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>taketh its name,</hi> a Ligando, <hi>to bind, for thereby the Politick Body is knit and preſerv'd together, as the Natural Body by the Bones and Sinews, and Members, which retain every one their proper Functions; And as the Head of a Body Natural cannot change his Sinews, nor cannot deny or with-hold from his inferiour Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, their peculiar Powers and ſeveral nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Blood and Spirits, no more can a King, which is the Head of a Body Politick, change the Laws of that Body, nor withdraw from his People their proper Subſtance, againſt their Wills and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents in that behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Law it ſelf affirms, <hi>The King can do no wrong,</hi> which proceeds not only from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that ſo Excellent a Perſon <hi>will do none:</hi> But alſo becauſe he Acts nothing but <hi>by Miniſters,</hi> which (from the loweſt to the higheſt) are anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their doings, ſo that it a King in Paſſion ſhould command <hi>A.</hi> to kill <hi>B.</hi> without proceſs of Law, <hi>A.</hi> may yet be proſecuted by Indictment, or upon <hi>an Appeal,</hi> (where no Royal Pardon is allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) and muſt for the ſame be Executed, ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>This Original happy frame of Government is truly and properly call'd an <hi>Engliſh mans Liberty,</hi> a Priviledge not to exempt from the Law, but to be freed in Perſon and Eſtate, from Arbitrary Violence and <hi>Oppreſſion;</hi> A <hi>greater Inheritance</hi> (ſaith Judge <hi>Cook) is deriv'd to every one of us from our Laws that from our Parents;</hi> For without the former, what would the latter ſignifie? And this Birth-right of Engliſh-men, ſhines moſt conſpicuouſly in two things: 1. <hi>Parliaments.</hi> 2. <hi>Juries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the firſt the Subject has a ſhare by his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Repreſentatives in the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> (or Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) Power, for no new Laws bind the People
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50183:8"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> but ſuch as are by common conſent agreed on in that great Council.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond, He has a ſhare in the <hi>Executive</hi> part of the Law, no Cauſes being Tryed, nor any man Adjudged to loſe Life, Member or Eſtate, but upon the <hi>Verdict</hi> of his Peers (or Equals) his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of his own Condition: theſe two Grand <hi>Pillars</hi> of Engliſh Liberty, are the Fundamental Vital Priviledges, whereby we have been, and are preſerv'd more free and happy than any other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, and (we truſt) ſhall ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo; For whoever ſhall deſign to Impair, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, or Undermine either of theſe, do ſtrike at the very Coniſttution of our Government, and ought to be Proſecuted and Puniſhed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Zeal and Rigour. To cut down the <hi>Banks,</hi> and let in the Sea, or to Poyſon all the <hi>Springs and Rivers</hi> in the Kingdom, could not be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Miſchief; for this would only affect the preſent Age, but the other will Ruine and Enſlave all our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe General <hi>Paramount Priviledges</hi> which the Engliſh are Eſtated in by the Original Conſtitution of their Government, there are others more particularly declared and expreſſed in diverſe <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> of which ſeveral of the moſt remarkable and uſefull are here preſented at large to the Reader, with ſome <hi>Notes</hi> thereupon, for his better underſtanding of the ſame.</p>

And all theſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Liberties aforeſaid, which we have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be holden within this our Realm, as much as appertaineth to us and our Heirs, we ſhall obſerve. (3.) And all men of this our Realm, as well Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual as Temporal (as much as in them is) ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame againſt all perſons in likewiſe. (4.) And for this our Gift and Grant of theſe Liberties, and of other contained in our Charter of liberties of our Foreſt, the <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Earls, Barons, Knights, Freeholders,</hi> and other our Subjects, have given unto us the fifteenth part
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50183:15"/>
of all their movables. (5.) And we have granted unto them on the other part, that neither we nor our Heirs ſhall procure or do any thing, whereby the Liberties in this Charter contained, ſhall be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed or Broken. (6.) And if any thing be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, by any Perſon, contrary to the premiſſes, it ſhall be had of no force nor effect.

                  <hi>Notes on</hi> Magna Charta.</head>
               <p>THis Excellent Law holds the firſt place in our Statute Books, for though there were no doubt many Acts of Parliament long before this, yet they are not now Extant: 'tis called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Great Charter, not in Reſpect of its Bulk, but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great Importance and weight of the matters therein contained; it is alſo ſtyled <hi>Charta Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatum Regni,</hi> the Charter of the Liberties of the Kingdom, and upon great reaſon (ſaith <hi>Cook</hi> in his Proem) is it ſo called from the effect, <hi>Quia liberos facit,</hi> becauſe it makes and preſerves the people free.</p>
               <p>Though it run in the ſtile of the King <hi>as a Charter,</hi> yet (as my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> well obſerves on the 38 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) it appears to have paſſed in Parliament, for there was then a Fifteenth granted to the King, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Earls, Barons, Free-tenants and people, which could not be but in Parliament, nor was it unuſual in thoſe times to have Acts of Parliament, in a Form of a Charter: as you may read in the Princes caſe, <hi>Co. Rep. L.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe though it be ſaid here, that the <hi>King hath given and granted theſe Liberties,</hi> yet they muſt not be underſtood as meer <hi>Emanations</hi> of Royal <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> or new Bounties granted, which the people could not juſtly challenge, or had not a <hi>Right</hi> unto before; For the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> at divers places aſſerts, and all Lawyers know, that this Charter is for the moſt part only <hi>Declaratory</hi> of the principal grounds of the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> no new freedom is hereby granted, but a Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as lawfully they had before, and to free them of what had been uſurped and encroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by any power whatſoever; and therefore you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50183:16"/>
may ſee this Charter often mentions <hi>Sua Jura,</hi> their Rights, and <hi>Liberat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſuas,</hi> their Liberties, which ſhews they had them before, and that the ſame now were Confirmed.</p>
               <p>As to the occaſion of this Charter, it muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that our Anceſtors the <hi>Saxons</hi> had with a moſt equal poize and temperament, very wiſely contriv'd their Government, and made excellent proviſions for their Liberties, and to preſerve the People from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and when <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of the Land, though he be commonly called the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> yet in truth he was not ſo, and I have known ſeveral Judges that would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any Gentleman at the Bar that caſually gave him that Title; For though he killed <hi>Harold</hi> the Uſurper, and Routed his Army, yet he pretended a right to the Kingdom, and was admitted by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and did take an Oath to obſerve the <hi>Laws and Cuſtoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the truth is, he did <hi>not perform</hi> that Oath ſo as he ought to have done; and his Succeſſors <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus,</hi> King <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> likewiſe, made frequent <hi>Encroachments</hi> upon the Liberties of their People, but eſpecially King <hi>John</hi> made uſe of ſo many Illegal Devices to drain them of <hi>Money,</hi> that wearied with intollerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they reſolved to oblige the King to grant them their Liberties, and to promiſe the ſame ſhould be obſerved, which King <hi>John</hi> did in <hi>Running-mead</hi> between <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>Windſor,</hi> by two Charters, one called <hi>Charta Libertatum, The Charter of Liberties</hi> (the Form of which you may read in <hi>Math. Paris, Fol.</hi> 246. and is in effect the ſame with this here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) the other the <hi>Charter of the Forreſt,</hi> Copies of which he ſent into every County, and commanded the Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſee them fulfilled.</p>
               <p>But by ill Council he quickly after began to violate them as much as ever, whereupon Diſturbances and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50183:16"/>
great miſeries aroſe both to himſelf and the Realm.</p>
               <p>The Son and Succeſſor of this King <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who in the <hi>19th</hi> Year of his Reign, Renewed and Confirmed the ſaid Charters, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Years after <hi>Cancelled</hi> them by the pernicious advice of his Favourites, and particularly <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> whom he had made Lord Chief Juſtice; one that in former times had been a great Lover of his Countrey, and a well deſerving Patriot, as well as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Laws, but now to make <hi>this</hi> a ſtep to his <hi>Ambition</hi> (which ever Rideth without Reins) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and humored the King that he might avoid the Charters of his Father King <hi>John</hi> by <hi>Dureſſe,</hi> and his own Great Charter, and <hi>Charta de Foresta</hi> alſo, for that he was <hi>within Age</hi> when he granted the ſame; whereupon the King in the eleventh Year of his Reign, being then of full Age, got one of the great Charters, and of the Forreſt, into his Hands, and by the Council principally of this <hi>Hubert</hi> his Chief Juſtice, at a Council holden at <hi>Oxford,</hi> unjuſtly <hi>Cancelled both the ſaid Charters,</hi> (notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> was the primier Witneſs of all the Temporal Lords to both the ſaid Charters) whereupon he became in high Favour with the King, inſomuch that he was ſoon after <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> in the <hi>13th</hi> Year of that King) Created (to the higheſt Dignity that in thoſe times a Subject had) to be an Earl, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Kent.</hi> But ſoon after (for Flatterers and Humoriſts have no ſure Foundation) he fell into the Kings heavy Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after many fearful and <hi>miſerable Troubles,</hi> he was juſtly, and according to Law Sentenced by his Peers in an open Parliament, and juſtly <hi>Degraded</hi> of that Dignity which he unjuſtly had obtained by his Council for Cancelling of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foreſta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 9th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this great Charter, all the Ancient Liberties and Cuſtoms of <hi>London,</hi> are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50183:17"/>
and preſerved, which is likewiſe done by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Statutes, as 14 <hi>Edw. 3. Cap.</hi> 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The 29 <hi>Chapt.</hi> NO FREE-MAN SHALL BE TAKEN, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Deſerves to be written in Letters of Gold, and I have often wondered the words thereof are not Inſcribed in Capitals on all our Courts of Judicature, <hi>Town-Halls,</hi> and moſt publick Edifices; they are the Elixir of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freedoms, the Storehouſe of all our Liberties. And becauſe my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in the ſecond part of his Inſtitutes, has many excellent Obſervations, I ſhall here Recite his very words. This Chapter containeth nine ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That no man be taken or Impriſoned,</hi> but <hi>per Legem terrae,</hi> that is, by the Common Law, Statute-Law, or Cuſtome of <hi>England:</hi> For theſe words, <hi>per Legem terrae,</hi> being towards the end of this Chapter, do Refer to all the precedent matters in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this hath the firſt place, becauſe the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a mans perſon</hi> is more pretious to him than all the reſt that follow, and therefore it is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he ſhould by Law be Relieved therein, if he be wronged, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No man ſhall be Diſſeiſed,</hi> that is, put out of Seiſin, or diſpoſſeſſed of his Free-hold, that is, Lands or Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, or of his Liberties or free Cuſtoms, that is, of ſuch Franchiſes and Freedoms, and free Cuſtoms as belong to him, by his Free Birth-Right, unleſs it be by the <hi>lawful Judgment,</hi> that is, <hi>Verdict</hi> of his equals, (that is, of men of his own Condition) or by the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> that is, (to ſpeak it once for all) by the due Courſe and proceſs of Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>No man ſhall be Outlawed,</hi> made an <hi>Exlex,</hi> put out of the Law, that is, deprived of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Law, unleſs he be Outlawed according to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>No man ſhall be Exiled</hi> or Baniſhed out of his Countrey, that is, <hi>Nemo perdet patriam,</hi> no man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50183:17"/>
ſhall <hi>loſe his Countrey,</hi> unleſs he be Exiled according to the Law of the <hi>Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>No man ſhall in any ſort be deſtroyed (Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere id eſt quod prius ſtructum &amp; factum fuit, penitus Evertere &amp; Diruere,)</hi> unleſs it be by the Verdict of his Equals, or according to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p n="6">6. No man ſhall be Condemned at the Kings Suit, either before the King in his Bench, where the Pleas are <hi>Coram Rege</hi> (and ſo are the words, <hi>Nec ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eum ibimus</hi> to be underſtood;) nor before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commiſſioner or Judge whatſoever, and ſo are the words, <hi>Nec ſuper eum mittimus,</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but by the Judgment of his Peers, that is, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, or according to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We ſhall ſell to no man Juſtice or Right.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We ſhall deny to no man Juſtice or Right.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We ſhall defer to no man Juſtice or Right.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe we ſhall briefly explain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No man <hi>ſhall be taken,</hi> (that is) Reſtrained of Liberty by Petition or Suggeſtion to the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Council,</hi> unleſs it be by Indictment or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of good and lawful men, where ſuch deeds be done. This Branch and divers other parts of this Act have been notably explained and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued by divers Acts of Parliament, ſeveral of which you will find Recited hereafter in this Book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No man ſhall be Diſſeiſed,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, ſhall not be ſeiſed into the Kings Hands contrary to this great Charter, and the Law of the Land, nor any man ſhall be diſſeiſed of his Lands or Tenements, or diſpoſſeſſed of his Goods or Chattels contrary to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>A Cuſtom was alleadged in the Town of <hi>C.</hi> that if the Tenant ceaſe by two years, that the Lord ſhould enter into the Freehold of the Tenant, and hold the ſame until he were ſatisfied of the Arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: it was adjudged a Cuſtom againſt the Law of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50183:18"/>
the <hi>Land,</hi> to enter into a Mans Freehold in that caſe, without Action or Anſwer.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> 6. Granted to the Corporation of <hi>Diers</hi> within <hi>London,</hi> power to ſearch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they found any Cloath died with <hi>Log-Wood,</hi> that the Cloath ſhould be Forfeit: And it was adjuged, that this Charter concerning the Forfeiture was againſt the Law of the Land, and this Statute; For no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture can grow by Letters Patents.</p>
               <p>No Man ought to be put from his Livelihood without Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>No Man Outlawed]</hi> That is, barred to have the benefit of the Law. And note, to this word <hi>Outlawed,</hi> theſe words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs by the Law of the Land,</hi> do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr. <hi>[Of his Liberties]</hi> This word hath three Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it hath been ſaid, it ſignifieth the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realm, in which reſpect this Charter is called <hi>Charta Libertatum,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſignifieth the <hi>Freedom the Subjects</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have: for example, the Company of <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> having power by their Charter to make Ordinances, made an Ordinance that every Brother of the ſame Society ſhould put the one half of his Cloaths to be dreſſed by ſome Cloath-Workers Free of the ſame Company, upon pain to Forfeit 10 <hi>s. &amp;c.</hi> And it was adjuged that this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance was againſt Law, becauſe it was againſt the Liberty of the Subject, for every Subject hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to put his Cloaths to be dreſſed by whom he will, <hi>&amp; ſic de ſimilibus.</hi> And ſo it is, if ſuch or the like grant had been made by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Liberties</hi> ſignifie the <hi>Franchiſes and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> which the Subjects have of the gift of the King, as the Goods and Chattels of <hi>Felons, Out-laws</hi> and the like; or which the Subject claims by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>wreck, waife, ſtraie,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50183:18"/>
So likewiſe and for the ſame reaſon, if a Grant be made to any Man to have the Sole making of <hi>Cards,</hi> or the Sole dealing with any other Trade, that Grant is againſt the Liberty and Freedom of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that before did or lawfully might have uſed that Trade, and conſequently againſt this great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Generally <hi>all Monopolies</hi> are againſt this great Charter, becauſe they are againſt the Liberty and Freedom of the Subject, and againſt the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>No Man Exiled,</hi> that is Baniſht, or forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or ſtay out of <hi>England</hi> without his Conſent. By the Law of the Land, no Man can be <hi>Exiled</hi> or Baniſhed out of his Native Country, but either by <hi>Authority of Parliament,</hi> or in Caſe of Abjuration for Felony by the Common Law; and ſo when our Books, or any Record, ſpeak of <hi>Exile,</hi> or Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, other than in caſe of Abjuration, it is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done by <hi>Authority of Parliament,</hi> as <hi>Belknap</hi> and other Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Baniſhed into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Rich.</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>This is a Beneficial Law, and is Conſtrued benign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; And therefore the King cannot ſend any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England</hi> againſt his will to ſerve him out of this Realm, for that ſhould be an Exile, and he ſhould <hi>perdere Patriam:</hi> No, he cannot be ſent againſt his will into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſerve the King or his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, becauſe it is out of the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> For if the King might ſend him out of this Realm to any place, then under pretence of Service, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador or the like, he might ſend him into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of the World, which being an Exile, is prohibited by this Act.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>No Man destroyed—</hi>That is, forejudged of Life or Limb, or put to Torture or Death, every oppreſſion againſt Law by colour of any uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is a kind of deſtruction. And the words <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50183:19"/>
modo</hi> (any otherwiſe) are added to this Verb <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> and to no other Verb in this Chapter, and therefore all things by any manner of means tending to deſtruction are prohibited; as if a Man be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed or Indicted of Treaſon or Felony, his Lands or Goods cannot be granted to any, no not ſo much as by promiſe, nor any of his Lands or Goods ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the Kings hands before he is Attainted; For when a Subject obtaineth a promiſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, many times undue means and more violent proſecution is uſed for private Lucre, tending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, than the quiet and juſt proceeding of the Law would permit, and the party ought to live of his own until Attainder.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>By Lawful Judgment of his Peers,]</hi> That is by his <hi>Equals,</hi> Men of his own Rank and Condition. The general diviſion of Perſons by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is, either <hi>one that is Noble,</hi> and in reſpect of his Nobility of the Lords Houſe of Parliament, or <hi>one of the Commons,</hi> and in reſpect thereof, of the Houſe of Commons in Parliament. And as there be divers degrees of Nobility, as Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons, and yet all of them are comprehended under this word <hi>Peers,</hi> and are Peers of the Realm; ſo of the Commons, there be Knights, Eſquires, Gentlemen, Citizens, and Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and yet all of them of the Commons of the Realm. And as every of the Nobles is one a Peer to another, though he be of a ſeveral degree, ſo it is of the Commons; and as it hath been ſaid of Men, ſo doth it hold of Noble Women, either by Birth or Marriage.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch, as this Judgment by Peers is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lawful,</hi> it ſhews the Antiquity of this manner of Trial: It was, the ancient, accuſtomed, Legal Courſe long before this Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or by the Law of the Land.]</hi> That is, by due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Law, for ſo the words are expreſly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50183:19"/>
by the Stat. of 37 <hi>Edw. 3. chap.</hi> 8. And theſe words are ſpecially to be referred to thoſe foregoing, to whom they relate. As none ſhall be condemn'd without a lawful Trial by his Peers, ſo none ſhall be taken, Impriſon'd, or put out of his Free-hold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due proceſs of the Law, that is by the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Preſentment of good and lawful Men of the place, in due manner, or by Writ Original of the Common-Law.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeeing that no Man can be Taken, Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Attached, or Impriſoned, but by due proceſs of Law, and according to the Law of the Land, theſe concluſions hereupon do follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Perſon or Perſons which commit any, muſt have lawful Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary that the Warrant or Mittimus be lawful, and that muſt be in Writing under his Hand and Seal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Cauſe muſt be contained in the Warrant, as for Treaſon, Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Suſpicion of Treaſon, or Felony, or the like particular Crime; For if it do not thus ſpecifie the Cauſe, if the Priſoner bring his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> he muſt be diſcharged, becauſe no Crime appears on the Return; Nor is it in ſuch Caſe any offence at all, if the Priſoner make his eſcape; whereas if the Mittimus contain the Cauſe, the eſcape would reſpectively be Treaſon or Felony, though in Truth he were not Guilty of the firſt offence. And this mentioning the Cauſe, is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Warrant or Mittimus containing a lawful Cauſe, ought to have a lawful concluſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And him ſafely to keep until he be delivered by Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not until the party committing ſhall further Order.</p>
               <p>If any Man by colour of any Authority, where he hath not any in that particular Caſe, ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to Arreſt or Impriſon any Man, or cauſe him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50183:20"/>
to be Arreſted or Impriſoned, this is againſt this Act, and it is moſt hateful, when it is done by Countenance of Juſtice. King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6th. did In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate the Town of Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> and granted to them to make Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They made a by-Law upon pain of Impriſonment, and it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be againſt this Statute of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> ſo it had been, if ſuch an Ordinance had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Patent it ſelf.</p>

               <p>THe word Tallage is derived from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Tailler,</hi> to ſhare or cut out a part, and is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically uſed for any Charge, when the King or any other does cut out or take away any part or ſhare out of a Mans Eſtate, and being a general word, it includes all Subſidies, Taxes, Tenths, Aids, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions or other Charges whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Maletot</hi> ſignifies an Evil (that is, an unjuſt) Toll, Cuſtom, Impoſition or Sum of Money.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of making this Statute was this: King <hi>Edward</hi> being injured by the <hi>French</hi> King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to make War againſt him, and in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requires of <hi>Humphrey le Bohun</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Roger

And it ſeems the conteſt grew ſo hot, that <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle, <hi>Folio</hi> 99. relates a ſtrange Dialogue that paſs'd between them, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the <hi>Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> told the King, <hi>That if his Majeſty pleaſed to go in Perſon, he would then go with him, and march before him in the Van-Guard, as by right of Inheritance he ought to do; but otherwiſe he would not ſtir; the King told</hi> him plainly, <hi>he ſhould go with any other, though he went not in Perſon.

And yet (ſaith my Lord <hi>Coke)</hi> altho the King had conceived a deep diſpleaſure againſt the Conſtable, Marſhal, and others of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of the Realm, for denying that which he ſo much deſired, yet, <hi>for that they ſtood in defence of their Laws, Liberties, and free Cuſtomes,</hi> the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, who (as Sir <hi>William Herle</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, who lived in his time and ſerved him, ſaid in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d.) was <hi>the wiſeſt King that ever was;</hi> did after his return from beyond the Seas, not only conſent to this <hi>Statute,</hi> whereby all ſuch Tallages and Impoſitions are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

               <head>The Comment.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TReaſon</hi> is derived from <hi>Trabir,</hi> which ſignifies Treacherouſly to betray; when it concerns the Government and the Publick, 'tis called <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> but againſt particular Perſons, as a Wife killing her Husband, a Servant his Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is <hi>Petty Treaſon,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>High Treaſon in the Civil Law is called <hi>Crimen Laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> a <hi>Crime wronging Majeſty,</hi> but in our Common-Law-Latine, <hi>Alta proditio,</hi> and in an Indictment for this offence the word <hi>Proditorie</hi> muſt be in.</p>
               <p>Before the making this Act, ſo <hi>many things</hi> were charged as <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> That no Man knew how to behave himſelf: Now by this Statute, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Grand Crime are reckoned up, and all others excluded, till declared by Parliament. And the ſettling of this Affair was eſteemed of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Publick-Weal, That the Parliament wherein this <hi>Act</hi> paſſed, was called long after <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictum Parliamentum, the Bleſſed Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of this Statute is branched out by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> 3d. part of <hi>Instit.</hi> Fol. 3. into ſix Heads. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt concerning Death, by compaſſing or imagining the death of the King, Queen, or Prince, and declaring the ſame by ſome <hi>Overt</hi> Deed. By killing and murdering of the Chancellor, Treaſurer, Juſtices of either Bench, Juſtices in <hi>Eyre,</hi> Juſtices of Aſſize, Juſtices of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> In their Places doing their Offices.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is to Violate, that is, to Carnally know the Queen, the Kings Eldeſt Daughter unmarried, the Princes Wife.</p>
               <p>The third is, Levying War againſt the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50183:28"/>
The fourth is, Adhering to the Kings Enemies, within the Realm or without, and declaring the ſame by ſome overt Act.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, Counterfeiting of the Great, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal, or the Kings Coin.</p>
               <p>The ſixth and laſt, by bringing into this Realm Counterfeit Mony to the likeneſs of the Kings Coin.</p>
               <p>Now as to the particular Expoſition of the ſeveral parts of this Statute:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When a man</hi> doth compaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is <hi>Quant Home,</hi> which extends to both Sexes, but one that is <hi>Non compos mentis,</hi> or an Infant within the Age of diſcretion, is not included; but all <hi>Allens</hi> within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> being thereby under the Kings Protection, and owing a Local Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, if they commit Treaſon may be puniſht by this Act, but otherwiſe it is of an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To compaſs and Imagine,</hi> Is to contrive, deſign or intend the death of the King; but this muſt be declared by ſome Overt Act. But declaring by an open Act a deſign to <hi>Depoſe</hi> or <hi>Impriſon</hi> the King, is an Over Act to manifeſt the compaſſing his death. For they that will depoſe their King, will not ſtick to Murder him, rather than fail of their end, and (as King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt excellently obſerved, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly experienced) <hi>There are commonly but few ſteps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Priſons and the Graves of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By the word <hi>King,</hi> is intended, 1. A King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Coronation, as ſoon as ever the Crown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends upon him, for the Coronation is but a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. 2. A King <hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> is a King within this Act, and a Treaſon againſt him is puniſhable, thô the Right Heir get the Crown. 3. A Titular King, as the Husband of the Queen, is not a King within this Act, but the Queen is, for the word <hi>King</hi> here includes both Sexes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What is to be underſtood by <hi>the Kings Eldeſt Son and Heir within this Act?</hi> I anſwer, 1. A ſecond
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50183:28"/>
Son after the death of the firſt Born, is within the Act, for he is then Eldeſt. Secondly, The Eldeſt Son of a Queen Regnant is as well within the Statute, as of a King. Thirdly, The Collateral Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or Preſumptive is not within this Statute. <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> was in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1487. (11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.) Proclaimed Heir Apparent. <hi>Anno</hi> 39. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was likewiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Heir Apparent, and ſo was <hi>John de la Poolen,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. And <hi>Henry</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. But none of theſe or the like are within the Purview of this Statute, ſaith my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> 3 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> fol. 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Note, Whereas in the Printed Statute-Books, it is there ſaid, <hi>probably Attainted,</hi> the ſame is a great error: For the words of the Record are, <hi>Et de ceo PROVABLEMENT ſoit Attaint: And ſhall be thereof PROVABLY Attaint:</hi> And I cannot but admire, that ſuch a <hi>Groſs</hi> miſtake ſhould be ſuffered, ſince my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> has ſo expreſly obſerved the difference, in theſe words following, 3 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> fol. 12. <hi>In this Branch</hi> (ſays he) <hi>four things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</hi> 1. <hi>This word [Provablement] Provably, that is, upon</hi> direct and manifeſt proof, <hi>not upon</hi> Conjectural preſumptions <hi>or</hi> Inferences, <hi>or</hi> ſtrains of Wit, <hi>but upon good and ſufficient proof. And herein the Adverb</hi> [Provablement] provably, <hi>hath a great force, and ſignifieth</hi> a direct and plain proof, <hi>which word the King, the Lords, and Commons in Parliament did uſe, for that the offence was hainous, and was ſo heavily and ſeverely puniſhed, as none other the like, and therefore the offender muſt</hi> Prova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>be Attainted, which words are as forcible,</hi> as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on direct and manifeſt proof. <hi>Note, the word is, not</hi> [Probably] <hi>for then</hi> Commune Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum <hi>might have ſerved; but the word is,</hi> [Provably] <hi>be Attainted. Secondly, This word</hi> [Attaint] <hi>neceſſarily implyeth that he be proceeded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50183:29"/>
with, and Attainted according to the</hi> due Courſe <hi>and proceedings of Law, and not</hi> by Abſolute power, <hi>or by other means, as in former times had been uſed. And therefore if a Man doth adhere to the Enemies of the King, or be</hi> ſlain <hi>in open War againſt the King, or otherwiſe</hi> die <hi>before the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of Treaſon,</hi> he forfeiteth nothing, <hi>becauſe (as this Act ſaith) he is</hi> not Attainted: <hi>wherein this Act hath altered that, which before this Act, in Caſe of Treaſon was taken for</hi> Law; <hi>And the Statute of</hi> 34 E. 3. Cap. 12. <hi>ſaves nothing to the King, but that which was</hi> in Eſſe, <hi>and pertaining to the King at the making of that Act. And this appeareth by a Judgment in Parliament in</hi> Ann. 29. H. 6. Cap. 1. <hi>That</hi> Jack Cade <hi>being ſlain in open Rebellion could no way be puniſhed, or forfeit any thing, and therefore was Attainted by that</hi> Act <hi>of High Treaſon.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Of open Deed, per Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Factum,</hi> theſe words ſtrengthen the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>[Provablement,]</hi> an <hi>Overt Act</hi> muſt be alledged in every Indictment upon this Act, and proved. Compaſſing by bare words is not an Overt Act, as appears by many <hi>Temporary</hi> Statutes againſt it. But there muſt be ſome open Act, which muſt be <hi>manifeſtly proved.</hi> As if divers do Conſpire the Death of the King, and the manner how, and thereupon provide <hi>Weapons, Powder, Poiſon, Harneſs, ſend Letters,</hi> or the like, for the Execution of the Conſpiracy. If a Man be Arraigned upon an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of High Treaſon, and ſtand <hi>Mute</hi> [that is, refuſe to Plead] he is not to be <hi>Preſsed</hi> to death, but ſhall have the ſame Judgment, and incurr ſuch forfeiture, as if he had been Convicted by <hi>Verdict,</hi> or had confeſſed it. For this ſtandeth well with this word <hi>[Provablement]</hi> for <hi>fatetur facinus qui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium fugit.</hi> But otherwiſe it is in caſe of Petit Treaſon, Murder, or other Felony. If a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Conſpire with a Forreign Prince to Invade the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50183:29"/>
Realm by open Hoſtility, and prepare for the ſame by ſome <hi>Overt Act,</hi> this is a ſufficient Overt Act for the death of the King. Fourthly, The Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Connexion of the words are to be obſerved, <hi>viz. [Thereof be Attainted by open Deed]</hi> This (as was reſolved by the Juſtices in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term 35 of <hi>Eliz.)</hi> relateth to the ſeveral and diſtinct Treaſons before expreſſed (and ſpecially to the <hi>Compaſſing and Imagination of the death of the King, &amp;c.</hi> for that is a <hi>ſecret</hi> in the Heart) and therefore one of them cannot be an <hi>Overt Act</hi> for another, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: A Conſpiracy is had to Levy War, this (as hath been ſaid and ſo reſolved) is no Treaſon by this Act until it be levied, therefore it is no Overt Act, or manifeſt proof of the Compaſſing the Death of the King within this Act; for the Words are <hi>[de ceo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thereof]</hi> that is, of the Compaſſing of the death. Divers latter Acts of Parliament have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That compaſſing by bare Words or Sayings, ſhould be Treaſon, but are all either Repealed or Expired <hi>(except only that of the 12 Car. 2. herein after recited, which is only to be in force during the Life of his preſent Majeſty, whom God preſerve:)</hi> And it was wont to be ſaid, bare Words may make an Heretick, but not a Traitor, without an Overt Act. And the Wiſdom of the Makers of this Law would not make <hi>Words only</hi> to be Treaſon, ſeeing ſuch variance commonly amongſt the Witneſſes is about the ſame, as few of them agree together. But if words be ſet down <hi>in Writing</hi> by the Delinquent himſelf, That is a ſufficient Overt Act within this Statute.</p>
               <p>In the Preamble of the Statute of 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Repeal of certain Treaſons declared after this <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and before that time, and bringing back all things to the meaſures of this Statute) It is agreed by the whole Parliament, <hi>That Laws juſtly made for the preſervation of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50183:30"/>
Common-wealth, without extream puniſhment, are more often obeyed and kept than Laws and Statutes made with great and extream puniſhments. And in ſpecial ſuch Laws and Statutes ſo made, whereby not only the ignorant and rude unlearned People, but alſo learned and expert People minding honeſty, are oftentimes trapped and ſnared, yea many times</hi> for Words only, <hi>without other Fact or Deed done or perpetrated.</hi> Therefore this Act of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. doth provide that there muſt be an Overt Act. But words without any Overt Act, are to be puniſht in another degree, as an high Miſpriſion.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The ſecond Offence concerning Money, here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Treaſon, is, If any perſon <hi>bring into this Realm Counterfeit Money:</hi> Where note. 1.

               <p>As to the ſecond, Maliciouſly and adviſedly to publiſh or affirm during his preſent Majeſties Life, that the King is an—<hi>Heretick—</hi>or—a Papiſt—or that he <hi>endeavours to introduce Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or maliciouſly and adviſedly by Writing Printing, Preaching, or ſpeaking to utter, expreſs or declare any Words, Sentences or thing, to ſtir up the people to <hi>hatred or diſlike of the Perſon of His Majeſty</hi> or the eſtabliſht Government.</p>
               <p>Whoever is legally Convicted of any of theſe Crimes ſhall be diſabled to hold any <hi>place, Office, or promotion,</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, Civil or Military. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides be liable to ſuch puniſhments as by the Common Laws or Statutes may be inflicted.</p>
               <p>As to the third, to declare publiſh, or affirm, firſt, that the <hi>Old long Parliament</hi> of 40 is not <hi>diſſolved,</hi> or ought to be in being. Secondly, That there lies any obligation on ones-ſelf, or any other perſon from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Oath,</hi> Covenant, or Engagement, to endeavour a change of Government either in Church or State.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50183:35"/>
Thirdly, that <hi>either or both Houſes</hi> of Parliament have a Legiſlative power without the King, or any other words to the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>The perſon ſo offending ſhall incur the penalty of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> which by the Statute of 16 <hi>Rich. 2 Cap.</hi> 5. here referr'd unto, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To be put out of the Kings <hi>Protection,</hi> their Lands and Tenements, goods and Chattels, <hi>Forfeited</hi> to the King, and their bodies to be ſeized, &amp;c. But in this Act of the 13 <hi>Caroli,</hi> there are theſe Proviſo's.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the <hi>two laſt Sorts</hi> of Offences that are not Treaſon, none ſhall be proſecuted but by <hi>order of the King,</hi> under his Sign Manual or of the privy Council.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the crimes made <hi>Treaſons,</hi> none ſhall be Indicted or Convicted unleſs they be <hi>ACC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SED</hi> by two Lawfull and <hi>Credible</hi> Witneſſes, touching the Addition of the word <hi>Credible</hi> to Lawfull, (which is here again repeated) we have ſpoken before; But muſt here further obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by theſe expreſs words, this Statute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that no man ſhall be <hi>Indicted</hi> [that is, have a Bill found againſt him] upon this Statute for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſs he be <hi>Accuſed,</hi> [that is, unleſs the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be ſworn againſt him before the Grand Jury] by two not only Lawful, but CREDIBLE Witneſſes, for the words are not only, <hi>he ſhall</hi> not be <hi>Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> [which is the work of the <hi>Petty Jury,</hi> or Jury of Life and Death, as 'tis commonly called,] But he ſhall not be <hi>Indicted</hi> [which is the buſineſs of the Grand Jury] And therefore Grand-Juries beſides their <hi>general and ordinary Right</hi> and power by Law, have when any perſon is Indicted upon <hi>this Statute,</hi> a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial right and direction from the <hi>Act it ſelf</hi> to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and be well ſatisfied in the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the Witneſſes; which if duly conſidered, would perhaps much mitigate the Clamours lately raiſed againſt ſome Juries for their Returning ſome Bills before them <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> though the matters therein were roundly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50183:36"/>
ſworn unto by <hi>Legal,</hi> but probably in their eſteem and Judgment, as they were upon their Oaths, not ſufficiently <hi>Credible</hi> Witneſſes; eſpecially when their <hi>Stories</hi> were no leſs <hi>Incredible</hi> than their perſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Note that as a perſon cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed or Indicted, ſo neither can he be ſo much as <hi>Committed</hi> for any Offence made Treaſon by this Act, by or upon the Oaths of any <hi>ſingle Witneſs,</hi> though there ſhould be never ſo much preſumption that more may come in againſt him before he be brought to Trial, for the words are—<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs he be thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the Teſtimony and depoſition of Two Lawful and Credible Witneſſes, which Witneſſes at his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment ſhall be brought before him face to face,</hi> &amp;c. So that 'tis evidently intended the original ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation before the Juſtice or Magiſtrate that ſhall Commit the perſon muſt be by two ſuch Witneſſes, and that the ſame two Witneſſes (and not <hi>others,</hi> leaving them that firſt charged him out, though yet others no doubt may be <hi>added</hi> to them) muſt give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Grand Jury, and at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Trial.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is in this Act a <hi>third proviſo,</hi> that no perſon ſhall incur <hi>any</hi> the Penalties in this Act men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>unleſs,</hi> 1. He be <hi>Proſecuted,</hi> [that is charged before a Magiſtrate, or Committed] within ſix Months after the Offence Committed. Secondly, and unleſs he be Indicted thereupon within three Months after ſuch Proſecution. So that if in either of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the time be elapſed, the Grand Jury ought not to find the Bill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Provided, this Act ſhall not infringe the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> or Freedom of Debates in either of the Houſes of Parliament, or any Committee of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That a <hi>Peer</hi> ſhall be tryed for any Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Act by his Peers, but if Convicted, ſhall be diſabled to ſit in Parliament during Life. And thus much for what is Treaſon at this day.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar. cap</hi> 10.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50183:36"/>
                  <hi>All Trials for Treaſon</hi> ſhall be only according to the Courſe of the Common Law. And though the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of that Statute, being Temporary, be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet this Clauſe is ſtill in Force.</p>
               <p>The Judgment in all Caſes of High Treaſon, except for Counterfeiting Coin (for a man) is, <hi>That he ſhall be drawn on an Hurdle or Sledge to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution and there be Hanged by the Neck, to be cut down being yet alive, his Privy Members cut off, his Bowels ript up, taken out, and burnt before his face, his Headſevered from his Body, his Body divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Quarters, which are to be diſpoſed of as the King ſhall order—</hi>But for Counterfeiting Coin, only <hi>Drawn and Hanged.</hi> And in both Caſes for a Woman (for Modeſty ſake) it is only that ſhe ſhall be <hi>Burnt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons or ſignification of this horrid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a man for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> are thus by ſome rendred and Interpreted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is drawn on a <hi>Sledg</hi> or <hi>Hurdle</hi> on the ground in the Dirt, to ſhew that his <hi>Pride</hi> is brought down, for Treaſon commonly ſprings from <hi>Ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. On this Hurdle he is drawn <hi>backward,</hi> to ſhew that his Actings have been contrary to Order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and <hi>Prepoſterous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He is <hi>Hanged</hi> between Heaven and Earth, as <hi>unworthy of either.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He is cut down yet alive, and his <hi>Privities cut off,</hi> to ſhew that he was unfit to Propagate any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. His <hi>Head</hi> is ſevered from his Body, becauſe his miſchevious <hi>Brain</hi> contrived the Treaſon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His Body is <hi>divided,</hi> to ſhew that all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations and Devices are <hi>torn to pieces,</hi> and brought to nought; and into <hi>four parts,</hi> that they may be ſcattered towards the four Quarters of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heading</hi> being part of the judgment in Treaſon, the King commonly to perſons of Quality Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50183:37"/>
all the reſt, of the Sentence, and ſo they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Beheaded.</hi> But if a perſon be Attainted of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or any other Felony, if he be Beheaded, 'tis no Execution of the Judgment, becauſe there the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment always is, that he <hi>be Hanged till he be dead,</hi> which cannot be altered. So that had Count <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſmark</hi> lately been Convicted and Condemned for the Murder of Eſquire <hi>Thynn,</hi> all his <hi>Guinies</hi> or his <hi>Friends</hi> could not have preſerved him from the <hi>Gallows,</hi> unleſs they could have got an intire <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any perſon being Indicted for Treaſon may <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> [that is except againſt or refuſe] <hi>Five and Thirty</hi> Jurors, <hi>peremptorily</hi> [that is, for his pleaſure, or for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, and without aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Cauſe to the Court. But if he Challenge more, that is above three full Juries, he Forſeits his Goods, and Judgment of <hi>Peinfort &amp; dure,</hi> [that is of being <hi>preſſed</hi> to Death] ſhall paſs upon him as one that refuſeth the Trial of the Law.</p>
               <p>In Caſes of <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Felony</hi> a man cannot Challenge peremptorily above the number of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; But with Cauſe he may except againſt more. And this is by the Stat. of 22. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And certainly ſince the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which is a <hi>Law of Mercy,</hi> does in <hi>Favour of Life,</hi> not only order a man to be Tryed by a <hi>Jury</hi> of his Country and <hi>Equals,</hi> but alſo allows him to refuſe, and have Liberty of excepting againſt ſo many of thoſe as ſhall be <hi>Impanelled</hi> for that purpoſe; It cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the ſame Law ever intended that the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould be denyed <hi>a Copy of the Pannel</hi> of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſo by the Information of his Friends or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he may know their <hi>Qualities, Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Inchnations;</hi> for how elſe ſhall he know whom to <hi>Challenge peremptorily,</hi> and whom to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge with Cauſe;</hi> to allow a man ſuch Liberty of Challenge, and give him no opportunity of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50183:37"/>
is but to <hi>mock the Priſoner,</hi> to whom poſſibly the whole Jury by <hi>face and name</hi> may be utter Strangers; and ſure the wiſdom of our Laws never thought every Priſoner ſo skilled in <hi>Metopoſcopy,</hi> that meerly by <hi>looking</hi> on a parcel of men he could tell which of them were <hi>indifferent,</hi> and which biaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>

               <p>ITem, <hi>Whereas Offendors have been greatly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, becauſe the Charters of Pardon have been ſo</hi> eaſily granted <hi>in times paſt of Man-ſlaughters, Roberies, Felonies, and other Treſpaſſes againſt the Peace, (2) It is ordained and Enacted that ſuch Charters</hi> ſhall not be granted, but only where the King may do it by his Oath, <hi>that is to ſay, where a man ſlayeth another in his</hi> own Defence, <hi>or by</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.

               <head>The Comment.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Touching this Statute and ſeveral others to the ſame purpoſe, as 14. <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 14. and 10. <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 2. and 13. <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 1. and 16. <hi>R. cap.</hi> 6. &amp;c. We ſhall only give you the words of <hi>Cook</hi> in the third part of his Inſtit. fo. 236. What things the King <hi>may pardon,</hi> and in what manner, and what <hi>he cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> falleth now to be treated of.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN caſe of death of man, Robberies and Felonies againſt the Peace, divers Acts of Parliament have <hi>Reſtrained the power of granting Charters of pardons;</hi> firſt, that no ſuch Charters ſhall be granted, but in caſe <hi>where the King may do it by his Oath; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That no man ſhall obtain <hi>Charters out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Stat. 4. <hi>Edw, 3. cap</hi> 13. And accordingly in a Parliament Roll it is ſaid, [for the Peace of the Land it would much help, if good Juſtices were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in every County, if ſuch as be let to mainprize do put in good Sureties, as Eſquires or Gentlemen: And that <hi>no pardon were granted but by Parliament]</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50183:38"/>
Thirdly, For that the King hath granted Pardons of Felonies upon <hi>falſe Suggeſtions,</hi> it is provided, that every Charter of Felony which ſhall be granted at the Suggeſtion of any, the name of him that maketh the Suggeſtion ſhall be compriſed in the Charter, and if the Suggeſtion be found untrue, the Charter ſhall be diſallowed. And the like proviſion is made by the Statute of 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Cap 2. for the Pardon of an Approver.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is provided that no Charter of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Murder, Treaſon, or Rape, ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they be not ſpecified in the ſame Charter. Statute 13. <hi>R,</hi> 2. Before this Statute of 13. <hi>R,</hi> 2. by the Pardon of <hi>all Felonies,</hi> Treaſon was Pardoned, and ſo was <hi>Murder, &amp;c.</hi> At this day by the Pardon of all Felonies, the death of man is, not Pardoned. Theſe be excellent Laws for direction, and for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Realm. But it hath been conceived, (which we will not queſtion) that the King may diſpence with theſe Laws by a <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> [notwithſtanding,] be it General or Special (albeit we find not any ſuch Clauſes of <hi>non Obstante,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to diſpenſe with any of theſe Statutes, <hi>(but of late times)</hi> Theſe Statutes are excellent Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a <hi>Religious and Prudent King</hi> to follow, for in theſe Caſes, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſummae poteſtatis Regiae eſt poſſe quantum velit, ſic Magnitudinis eſt velle quantum poſſit,</hi> [As it is the higheſt Kingly power to be able to Act what he Wills, ſo it is his Greatneſs and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to Will only what he lawfully can.] Hereof you may Read more in Juſtice <hi>Standford,</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 35. in diverſe places of that Chapter, of his grave Advice in that behalf. Moſt certain it is, that the <hi>Word of God</hi> has ſet down this undiſputable General Rule, <hi>Quia non profetur Cito Contra malos ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, filii hominum ſine timore ullo perpetrant,</hi> [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sentence againſt evil men is not ſpeedily Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, therefore the hearts of the Children of men
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50183:39"/>
are ſet in them to do evil] And thereupon the Rule of Law is grounded. <hi>Spes Impunitatis Continuum Affectum tribuit delinquendi,</hi> [the hope of Impunity encourageth Offenders] <hi>Et veniae facilitas Incenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum eſt Delinquendi,</hi> and the facility of obtaining Pardon is an Incentive to Commit Offences] This is to be Added, that the Intention of the ſaid Act of 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. Was not that the King ſhould grant a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Murder by expreſs Name</hi> in the Charter, but becauſe the whole Parliament conceived, that he <hi>would neuer Pardon Murder by ſpecial Name</hi> for the Cauſes aforeſaid, therefore that proviſion made, which was (as in other Caſes I have obſerved) grounded upon the Law of God, <hi>Quicunque effude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit humanum ſanguinem, fundetur ſanguis illius; ad imaginem quippe Dei creatus est homo nec aliter Expiati poteſt, niſi per ejus ſanguinem, qui alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius ſanguinem effuderit,</hi> [whoſoever ſhall ſhed mans blood, by man alſo ſhall his blood be ſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man was Created after the Image of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be expiated otherwiſe then by his blood, who ſpilt the blood of another.] And the words of every Pardon is after the Recital of the offence, <hi>nos pietate moti, &amp;c.</hi> we being <hi>moved with Piety,</hi> &amp;c. But it can be no Piety to violate an expreſs Law of God, by letting Murder ſcape unpuniſht. Thus <hi>Coke,</hi> whereby we ſee what opinion he had of ſuch <hi>Pardons.</hi>

            <head>A brief digreſſion concerning the Nature of APPEALS.</head>
            <p>THis Diſcourſe of <hi>Pardons</hi> puts us in mind of another kind of Legal Proſecution called an <hi>Appeal:</hi> of which it may be very convenient to give the Reader ſome brief account. You muſt know then for ſeveral Offences, for which a man deſerveth death, and particularly for <hi>Murder,</hi> there are <hi>two ways</hi> to bring him to Anſwer for the ſame, one by <hi>Indictment,</hi> which is <hi>at the Kings Suit,</hi> and the other by <hi>Appeal,</hi> which is <hi>at the Suit of a Party</hi> which is wronged or injured by the Murder: as a <hi>Woman</hi> whoſe Husband, or a <hi>Child,</hi> or <hi>Brother,</hi> whoſe Father or Brother is Killed.</p>
            <p>Now upon an Indictment, if the Offender be found <hi>Guilty,</hi> becauſe its to be at the Suit of the King, it has been ſaid by ſome, may be and <hi>too often a Pardon,</hi> has been obtained (tho even <hi>That</hi> too be <hi>againſt Law,</hi> as appears by the Premiſſes) But in an <hi>Appeal</hi> all agree, the King can grant <hi>no Pardon,</hi> Nay if a perſon be tryed by Indictment, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, or Convicted and get a <hi>Pardon,</hi> yet an Appeal may be brought, and if he be thereupon Convicted, notwithſtanding ſuch his former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, or <hi>Pardon,</hi> he muſt be <hi>Hanged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word Appeal is derived from the <hi>French</hi> Verb <hi>Appeller,</hi> to Call, becauſe he or ſhe that brings it, Calls the Defendant to Judgment; but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof is all one with <hi>An Accuſation,</hi> And is peculiarly in Legal ſignification applyed to Appeals of <hi>Three ſorts;</hi> Firſt an <hi>Appeal</hi> brought by an Heir Male for ſome wrong done to his <hi>Anceſtor</hi> whoſe Heir he is. Secondly, Of wrong done to an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and is by the Wife only, if it be for the death of her Husband, to be Proſecuted. The third is of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50183:40"/>
wrongs done to the Appellants themſelvess as for Robbery, Rape, or Maim <hi>Coke 1. Inſtit.</hi> Sect. 500.</p>
            <p>Note that this Appeal muſt be brought <hi>within a year and a day</hi> after the Murder is committed. For afterwards it cannot be brought at all. And antiently it was cuſtomary not to bring an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the King, till after the year and the day, waiting in the mean time for the Proſecution of the Party, but this was found very inconvenient, for the Party was frequently compounded with, and at the years end the buſineſs was forgot, and ſo Offenders eſcaped Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And therefore the ſame was altered by the Statute 3. <hi>Hen. 7. Cap.</hi> 1. Whereby it is Enacted, <q>That the Coroner ſhall do his Office, and the Offenders may be Arraigned at any time within the year, at the Kings Suit, but if Acquitted, yet the party within the year and day ſhould have liberty to bring an Appeal againſt ſuch perſon, either Acquitted or Attainted, if the benefit of the Clergy be not before thereof had. And in order thereunto that when any perſon happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Acquitted for the death of a man, within the year, the Juſtices before whom he is Acquitted, ſhall not ſuffer him to go at large, but either to remit him again to the Priſon, or elſe to let him to Bail after their diſcretion, till that the day and the year be paſſed, that ſo he may be forth coming to Anſwer an Appeal, if it ſhall happen to be brought.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that Statute; as to the <hi>latter Clauſe</hi> whereof, you ſee the Judges have power in <hi>Caſe of Acquittal</hi> to keep the Party in Priſon ſtill, till the <hi>day and year</hi> be over. Or elſe to admit him to Bail; and tho this be left to their <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> yet it muſt not be ſuch a Diſcretion, as <hi>confounds all Diſcretion:</hi> but they muſt weigh the Circumſtances, and go according to Law and Judgment; and certainly the law intended ſuch Bail, if any be accepted, ſhould be bound <hi>Body
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50183:40"/>
for Body,</hi> for otherwiſe it ſeems no ſecurity. And therefore many wiſe men wondered the other day when Count <hi>Conning ſmark</hi> was Acquitted on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment for the Barbarous Murder of Eſquire <hi>Thynn,</hi> that he was ſuffered to go ſo ſoon abroad, for being a <hi>Stranger,</hi> he was never like to come again into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and being ſo <hi>rich,</hi> what values he to diſcharge the Forfeitures of his Sureties Recognizances, which likewiſe may be eaſily Compounded. At moſt, the <hi>Forfeieure is to the King,</hi> and what is it that to the next Heir or Kinſman? He is by this means <hi>Outed</hi> of his Legal Remedy to Revenge the Blood of his near and dear Relation—<hi>Sed haec Obiter.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The women that brings an Appeal for the death of her Husband, muſt be his Wife not only <hi>de Facto</hi> but <hi>de Jure,</hi> not only called and reputed, or cohabiting with him, but actually and legally Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him; and of ſuch a Wife the Antient-Law-Books, ſpeaks, <hi>de morte viri Inter Brachia ſua Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti,</hi> the Husband is killed within her Arms. that is whilſt he was legally in her poſſeſſion; but that the Appellant and the perſon killed, were not ever lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coupled in Matrimony, is a good Plea in an Appeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Right of Appeal for the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is annexed to her Widdow-hood, as her <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> is, and therefore if the Wife of the Dead Marry again, her Appeal is gone, even altho the ſecond Husband ſhould die within the year &amp; day after the Murder of the firſt: For ſhe muſt all the while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Appeal be brought, continue <hi>Faemini viri ſui,</hi> his Widdow, upon whoſe death the Appeal is brought: furthermore if ſhe bring the Appeal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Widdow-hood, and take a Husband whilſt it is depending, the Appeal ſhall <hi>Abate</hi> (that is be

               <p n="4">4. By the Statute of <hi>Glocest.</hi> made in the ſixth year of King <hi>Edw. 1. Cap.</hi> 9.

               <p n="5">5. As for <hi>the year and day</hi> here mentioned, it is to be acconnted for the whole year according to the Calendar, and not for twelve Months, at twenty eight days to the Month.

Now if a man be Mortally Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, on the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> and thereof Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes to the firſt day of <hi>June,</hi> and then dies; the Queſtion here ariſes whether the year and the day allowed for bringing the Appeal is to be reckoned from the giving the Wound, or the time of Death. Some have held the former: For that the Death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, hath Relation to it, and that is the Cauſe of the Death, and the Offender did nothing the day of the Death. But the truth is, the year and day ſhall be accounted only from the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> the day of the Death; for before that time no Felony was Committed: and thus it hath often been reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Adjudged, and the reaſon aboveſaid groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Relation (which is a Fiction in Law) holdeth not in this Caſe. <hi>Coke 2.

If a Man be Indicted for Murder and Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only of Man-ſlaughter, and have the Benefit of his Clergy it ſeems the Wife and Heir cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bring their Appeal. Touching which the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> 3 Inſtit. <hi>Fo.</hi> 131. cites a Caſe in theſe words: Thomas Burghe, <hi>Brother and Heir of</hi> Henry Burghe <hi>brought an</hi> Appeal of Murder <hi>againſt</hi> Thomas Holcroft, <hi>of the Death of the ſaid</hi> Henry: <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded, that before the Coroner, he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of Man-ſlaughter, and before Commiſſioners of Oyer and Terminer, he was upon that</hi> Indictment Arraigned, <hi>and confeſſed the Indictment, and prayed his</hi> Clergy, <hi>and thereupon was Entred</hi> Curia adviſare vult, <hi>the Court will conſider; whereupon he demanded Judgment, whether the Plaintiffe ought to maintain that Appeal he had brought.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That the</hi> matter of the Bar <hi>had been a good Bar of the Appeal by the Common Law, as well as if</hi> the Clergy had been Allowed: <hi>For that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, upon his Confeſſion of the Indictment had prayed his Clergy, which the Court ought to have granted, and the deferring of the Court to be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ought not to prejudice the Party Deſendant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Appeal was Commenced before the Allowance of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> ſecond point <hi>adjudged was, that this Caſe was out of the Statute of</hi> 3 Hen. 7. <hi>For that the words of that Act are,</hi>

If it fortune that the ſame Felons and Murderers, and Acceſſaries ſo Arraigned, or any of them, to be Acquitted, or the Principal of the ſaid Felony, or any of them to be Attainted, the Wife or next Heir of him ſo ſlain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have their Appeal of the ſame Death and Murder againſt the Perſon ſo Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, or againſt the ſaid Principals ſo Attainted, if they be alive, and that THE BENEFIT OF HIS CLERGY THEREOF before be not had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in this the Defendant</hi> Holcroft, <hi>was neither</hi> Acquitted <hi>nor</hi> Attainted, <hi>but Convicted by Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the</hi> Benefit of the Clergy only prayed, <hi>as is aforeſaid, ſo as the Statute being penal concerning the Life of Man, and made in Reſtraint of the Common Law, was not to be taken by Equity, but is</hi> Caſus Omiſſus, <hi>a Caſe Omitted, and left to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Third, is was objected, that every Plea ought to have an apt Concluſion, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in this Caſe ought to have been,</hi> Et petit judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſi praediit <hi>Thomas Holcroft</hi> Iterum de eadem mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, de qua ſemel Convictus fuit, Reſpondere compelli debeat. <hi>And he does ask judgment if the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> Thomas Holcroft <hi>ſhall be obliged to anſwer againe for the</hi> ſame death, <hi>he was once Convicted of] But it was adjudged that either of both Concluſions was</hi> ſufficient <hi>in Law: And therefore that excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was diſallowed by the Rule of the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, the ancient Law was, that when a Man had judgment to be hanged in an Appeal of Death, that <hi>the Wife, and all the Blood of the Party ſlain ſhould draw the Defendant to Execution,</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> ſaid, <hi>Iſſint fuit in diebus noſtris,</hi> ſo it was done in our Days.</p>
               <p>And thus much occaſionally about <hi>Appeals,</hi> which we the rather inſerted becauſe the practice thereof (through I know not whoſe negligence) has been almoſt <hi>loſt</hi> or <hi>forgot;</hi> till ſome few Years ago a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <head>Of the Names and Antiquity of Parliaments.</head>
               <p>THe word PARLIAMENT is <hi>French,</hi> derived from the three words <hi>Parler la ment,</hi> to ſpeak ones mind, becauſe every Member of that Court ſhould ſincerely and diſcreetly ſpeak his mind for the general good of the Common-Wealth, and this name (ſaith <hi>Cook. 1 Inſtit.</hi> fo. 110.) was uſed before <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Conquerer, even in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. But moſt commonly in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, it was called <hi>Michegemote</hi> or <hi>Witenage Mote,</hi> that is, the <hi>Great Mote [Meeting</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> whence our <hi>Ward-Mootes</hi> in <hi>London</hi> receive their name to this day] or the <hi>Wiſe-Moote,</hi> that is, the Aſſembly of the wiſe men and Sages of the Land.</p>
               <p>But this word Parliament is uſed in a double ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Strictly,</hi> as it includes the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power of <hi>England,</hi> as when we ſay—<hi>An Act of Parliament;</hi> and in this Acceptation, it neceſſarily includes the King, the Lords, and the Commons, each of which have a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> in making Laws, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their <hi>joint Conſent</hi> no new Laws can paſs, that be obligatory to the Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vulgarly, the word is uſed for the <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> the Lords and Commons, as when we ſay, the King will <hi>call a Parliament,</hi> his Majeſty has <hi>Diſſolved his Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Lords of Parliament are divided into two ſorts, <hi>viz. Spiritual,</hi> that is to ſay the Biſhops (who ſit there in reſpect of their <hi>Baronies)</hi> parcel of their

Biſhopricks which they hold in their Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and <hi>Temporal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commons are likewiſe divided into three <hi>Claſſes</hi> or parts, <hi>viz, Knights or Repreſentatives of the Shires</hi> or Counties; where note, that though the Writ require two <hi>Knights</hi> to be choſen, and that they are called <hi>Knights,</hi> yet there is no neceſſity that they ſhould actually have the degree of Knighthood, provided they be but Gentlemen; for the Statute 23 <hi>Hen. 6. cap:</hi> 15: hath theſe words, <hi>That the Knights of the Shires for the Parliament hereafter to be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, ſhall be not able Knights of the ſame Counties for which they ſhall be choſen,</hi> OR OTHERWISE <hi>ſuch Notable Eſquires or Gentlemen born of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as ſhall be able to be Knights, and no man to be ſuch Knight which ſtandeth in the degree of a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and under.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THere has been a great debate about <hi>the Three Eſtates,</hi> ſome zealouſly pleading, That the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> are one of the three Eſtates of the Realm, and the Lords Temporal a Second, and the Commons-houſe the Third, and the King over all as a Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by himſelf. Others as ſtifly deny this, and aſſign
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50183:46"/>
                  <hi>the King</hi> (as he his the Head of the Common Wealth) to be the <hi>first Eſtate, the Lords,</hi> as well Spiritual as Temporal jointly, to be the <hi>Second;</hi> and the <hi>Commons-Houſe</hi> the Third.

               </p>
               <p>We ſhall not preſume to undertake a deciſion of this arduous Controverſy, but in our poor opinion the matter ſeems to appear more difficult than real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, by means that the contending Parties do not firſt plainly ſet down what it is they ſeverally mean by the word <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Which may be taken, 1. For a <hi>rank, degree,</hi> or Condition of Perſons conſidered by themſelves, different in ſome notable Reſpects from others wherewith they may be compared. And in this reſpect <hi>my Lords the Biſhops</hi> may very properly be ſaid to be an <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or one of the Eſtates of the Realm, for then there will be ſeveral <hi>Eſtates,</hi> above the number of <hi>three,</hi> for ſo in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons there may be ſaid to be three Eſtates, <hi>viz. Knights, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes.</hi> And heretofore in the days of Popery, when there were 26 Abbots and Priors, that held <hi>per Baroniam</hi> too, as well as the Biſhops, called to the Parliament, and ſat in the Lords Houſe, [ſee <hi>Fullers</hi> Church Hiſtory, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. 292.] Whether they being <hi>Religious</hi> and Monaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereas the Biſhops were <hi>Seculars</hi> (no ſmall difference in their account) might not as well claim to be a <hi>diſtinct Eſtate</hi> by themſelves, as now the Biſhops do, may be a queſtion.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, When we ſpake of three Eſtates in the Conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, 'tis moſt natural to mean and intend <hi>ſuch a poize in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> or ſuch an <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> as hath a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> in the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power: For as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> excluding the <hi>Lords,</hi> ſo neither the King and Lords excluding the Commons; much leſs the Lords and Commons excluding the <hi>King,</hi> can make any Law; but this glorious <hi>Triplicity</hi> muſt be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50183:46"/>
in mutual Conjunction, and then from their united Influences ſpring our happy Laws. But in this ſence the Lords Spiritual by themſelves have no pretence to be a <hi>diſtinct Eſtate:</hi> That is, they have by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> (which I conceive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Characteriſtick or <hi>eſſential Mark</hi> of each of the three <hi>Eſtates;)</hi> For ſuppoſe a <hi>Bill</hi> paſs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and being brought into the Lords Houſe, all the 26 Biſhops ſhould be againſt it, and ſome of the <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi> yet if the other Temporal Lords be more in number than the Biſhops, and thoſe that ſide with them, the Bill ſhall paſs as the Act of the <hi>whole houſe;</hi> and if his Majeſty pleaſe to give it his <hi>Royal Aſſent,</hi> is undoubted Law. Which demonſtrates the Biſhops have of themſelves <hi>no Negative</hi> Voice, and conſequently are none of the three Eſtates of the Realm. But if any will have them called <hi>an Eſtate</hi> and mean ſomething elſe be it, if he pleaſe to explain his Notion, 'tis like I ſhall not contend with him about a fiddle faddle word.</p>

Here is a great Charge that lies upon him, it is great in it ſelf, and great becauſe it hath many great Charges in it: <hi>Serpens qui Serpentem Devorat, fit Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi> his Charge having digeſted many Charges into it, is become a <hi>Monſter</hi> of Charges. The main and great one is this; <hi>a Plot</hi> and Policy, to alter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Frame and Fabrick</hi> of this State and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. This is the great one, and it hath others in it, that gains it more Greatneſs: For to this end, he labours to infuſe into the Conſcience of his Majesty the perſwaſion of <hi>a Power not bounding it ſelf with Laws,</hi> which King <hi>James</hi> of famous memory, calls in his Speech in Parliament, <hi>1619.

The truth is, 'tis this <hi>High Court</hi> of Parliament, that only can hinder the <hi>Subject</hi> from being given up as a Prey to the <hi>Arbitrary Pleaſure</hi> not only of the Prince if he ſhould attempt it, but (which is Ten times worſe) to the unreaſonable paſſions and luſts of <hi>Favourites,</hi> cheif Miniſters, and Women; when otherwiſe inſtead of a <hi>Monarch</hi> (who as ſometimes it may happen ſhall Govern but in name) we might be ruled like the Antient <hi>French</hi> by an inſolent <hi>Major of the Pallace,</hi> who will be ſure to mind the private intereſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family more than that of the Prince or the <hi>Publick good:</hi> Or like the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire under a <hi>Weak Grand Seignior,</hi> by the <hi>Prevailing Concubine</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> who is perhaps her ſelf <hi>managed</hi> by no higher dictates than that of her <hi>chief Eunuch</hi> or <hi>She-Slave.</hi> It is ſtrange therefore to obſerve the <hi>Impotent Ambition</hi> of ſome Men (and ſuch as, with Shame let us ſpeak it, boaſt themſelves <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> too) who (provided they may trample upon and <hi>domineer</hi> over their Inferiors) care not how much their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> do the like over them. Their Souls (like moſt inſolent Mens) being mean enough to ſubmit thereunto; or who can enough deplore and abhor the ignorance and <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of ſome <hi>lazy inſignificant Gentlemen,</hi> who care not how things go, provided they may enjoy their <hi>Hawks, Hounds,</hi> and <hi>Bowling-Green Meetings;</hi> whilſt not only for <hi>Divinity,</hi> but <hi>Politicks</hi> too, they are Govern'd by their more <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Chaplain,</hi> or the Parſon of their Pariſh. Now nothing is more obvious than the deſigns of ſome <hi>idle, Covetous, Sycophant Clergy-men, who like</hi> Ivy, though it cannot grow without the ſupport of the Oak and yet will deſtroy it at laſt, do in private Parlours over the Glaſs, whilſt Healths go round, as well as in their Pulpits over their Cuſhions, ſet up <hi>Abſolute Monarchy</hi> to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unreaſonable ſtubornneſs of any Parliament that will not give away the Peoples <hi>Money,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

themſelves to be <hi>Fleec'd,</hi> as often as the <hi>prime Miniſter</hi> or Favourite think fit, they cry up the Prince like an Angel ſo long as he will be their <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner</hi> to Whip, Impriſon, or hang all that will not <hi>truckle</hi> to their own Pride and Avarice; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to give up their <hi>Souls</hi> once again to be managed by an <hi>Implicite Faith,</hi> whereby in the mean while theſe <hi>Huffiſh Sir Johns</hi> might not be troubled with thoſe uneaſy Tasks of <hi>Studying, Preaching,</hi> &amp;c. but may have nothing elſe to do, but live at eaſe, keep their <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>Horſes,</hi> with a <hi>ſilly Curate</hi> to do all the <hi>Drudgery;</hi> Whilſt they themſelves are making <hi>Addreſſes</hi> above, by Flattering and Informing at ſome great <hi>Noblemans</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> Table, and <hi>railing</hi> againſt the <hi>Whiggs</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and ſpeaking a good word for <hi>Popery by the By;</hi> Or elſe if their parts reach ſo high, by ſome Sycophant Pamphlet or Sermon againſt the Government Eſtabliſht by Law; They teach that men have no property either in their Lives or Goods, but only during the Princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If there be not ſuch a parcel of Things as theſe that call themſelves <hi>Divines,</hi> then <hi>no Body</hi> is concerned <hi>in this Character; but if there be, they are the worſt of men,</hi> and <hi>ought not only</hi> to be expoſed, but ſeverely puniſht.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſince at preſent we live under ſo happy a Government, where being ſecurely Landed our ſelves, we behold the Shipwrack of our Neighbours, and ſince (notwithſtanding the goodneſs of our Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>whom God preſerve)</hi> who has declared that he deſires nothing leſs than the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or ſubverſion of that Government (which as well by his <hi>Coronation</hi> Oath, as by his own Lenity and good nature, he thinks himſelf obliged to obſerve) yet there are ſome, who for their own private ends, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their utmoſt to remove our antient <hi>Land-marks,</hi> Introducing Popery and Slavery amongſt us; It is therefore the indiſpenſable <hi>Intereſt</hi> and Duty of all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50183:53"/>
true <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to maintain theſe Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from their Anceſtors through ſo many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations inviolable, upon which all our (Earthly) and in a great meaſure our <hi>Spiritual)</hi> Happineſs, ſafety, and well-being depends. Nor can any Man in his ſenſes but acknowledge that the only <hi>right way</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that end, is to look well to the <hi>Means,</hi> and that is by taking due care what Perſons they Chooſe for their Repreſentatives, with whom they muſt truſt their Eſtates, Lives, and Liberties.</p>
               <p>Now this Government of a Prince by and with Parliaments, whenever the Condition and Neceſſities of the State require them, however according to it's primitive Inſtitution it was the beſt of all others, yet as well in that as in Chriſtianity it ſelf, there have been found out wayes of Corruption, and that is, when either they ſit <hi>too long,</hi> or <hi>too ſeldom,</hi> or are <hi>too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolved;</hi> too <hi>frequent Diſſolutions</hi> being no leſs <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> to the Subject, than too long Seſſions. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it may be in the Electors power to avoid the Inconveniences of both, and that is by making a <hi>good Choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas if the Countrey People will ſell all that they have for a little roaſt Beef, aGlaſs of Sack, &amp; a pot of Ale, Chooſing him that will give them moſt Drink to Day, though they know him to be a Perſon who will ſell both their Religion, Liberties and Fortunes to Morrow, then frequent Diſſolutions will of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ruine us, and utterly debauch this Excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; for the honeſt Countrey Gentleman deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other private advantage but the true ſervice of his King and Country, hath no reaſon, nor is he able, once in half a Year to ſpend 4 or 500 Pound, only to purchaſe a place full of Labour, Charge, trouble and Danger, without any profit to himſelf, only to ſerve thoſe who put him to ſuch an unkind Expence. And when honeſt Loyal Gentlemen are thus diſcouraged, if this <hi>Sottiſh</hi> humour amongſt the Electors continue,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50183:54"/>
the Papiſt, and their Faction, or neceſſitous Perſons of proſtituted Conſciences, will carry their Votes; for they can afford to <hi>buy them</hi> at large rates, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to repay themſelves, though with the ruine of the Nation.</p>
               <p>This is no vain ſurmize or idle ſpeculation, but the very truth of the Caſe; and the meaneſt Countrey Man that has Eyes in his Head, and will uſe them, can not but ſee it: for did you ever know a <hi>Coachman or Groom buy his place,</hi> unleſs he deſigned to <hi>rob his Maſters Bin?</hi> Therefore whoever you put to charge in your Elections, blame him not, if he makes Money again of what he bought, and lays out his Vote in the Houſe, not for your Good and that of the publick, but that way as will beſt pleaſe the Miniſters of State, that ſo he himſelf may get a good place, or preferment, or Title of Honour by the Bargain. I ſay though he himſelf be a baſe Wretch for ſo doing, yet <hi>You</hi> cannot blame him, ſince you did not lend him your Truſt, but ſold it him, and what a Man hath purchaſed with his own Money, he may lawfully ſell again.</p>
               <p>Therefore that Man who does wilfully give his Voice for a <hi>Knave</hi> or <hi>Fool,</hi> does his endeavour to ruine both his Country, and himſelf and his Poſterity, and to be as bad or worſe than the Perſon he chooſes; and if the greater part of the Houſe happen to be <hi>Wiſer</hi> or <hi>Honeſter,</hi> it is no thanks to him; he did as much as he could to debauch it; and therefore for his part, if none elſe were concerned with him, it were no matter if he were forthwith made a <hi>Slave,</hi> and his Children <hi>Perpetual Vaſſals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The before mentioned old Lord Treaſurer <hi>Barleigh</hi> (who is thought to have been the greateſt Stateſman that ever this Nation bred) did frequently deliver as a Maxime, or rather as a Prophecy, <hi>That</hi> England <hi>can hardly be ruined, unleſs it be by her own Parliaments;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly foreſeeing that other oppreſſions, as being wrought by violence, might perhaps by violence be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50183:54"/>
in time ſhaken off again; whereas when in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary way we are undone by a Law, that can never be reverſt but by a down-right Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the parties advantag'd by that Law will never agree to the repealing of it; and a Rebellion is both ſo dangerous, and of ſo biack a Character, as men either rich or conſcientious, will not engage therein; and therefore no publick miſchief is ſo irrecoverable as that which is grown into a Law, and nothing, you know, can become ſo, but what is Impoſed upon you by Parliament. Such is the happy frame of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo prudently and ſo ſtrong have your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ſecured Property and Liberty, (reſcued by inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es out of the hands of encroaching violence) that you cannot be enſlaved but with chains of your own making, for as you are never undone till you are undone by Law, ſo you can never be undone by a Law, till you chuſe the undoing Legiſlators; and may not your enemies add <hi>Scorn</hi> to their <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and pretend Juſtice for both, when they can plead they had never trampled on your heads, had not you laid them on the Ground?</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, it evidently appears of what vaſt importance it is at all times, when ever his Majeſty ſhall be pleas'd to iſſue out his Writs for a Parliament, to chuſe (as much as in us lies) a good houſe of Commons, as we tender our Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Eſtates and Poſterity; upon our well or ill chuſing, depends our well or ill being; 'tis here as in marriage or war, there is no room for ſecond Errors, one Act may ruine a Nation beyond retrieve.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they whom you chuſe will repreſent the qualities as well as the perſons, and if you ſend up a falſe glaſs, it will repreſent you with an ugly face; you have hitherto had the repute of an antient and grave people, but if you chuſe raw Saplings, green heads, unexperienced children, the world will Judge of you, as they once did of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that you were either
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50183:55"/>
always children, or are grown twice ſo; you have long been a famous Religious Proteſtant Nation, but if you chuſe debauched ſwearing Atheiſts, men of no Religion, or ſuch as are meer formaliſts, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Popery, what can the world think but that the Nation has loſt its ſenſe of Religion, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be led back into the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs of <hi>Romiſh Fopperies:</hi> you have formerly had the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſober temperate Nation, but if you chuſe Drunkards for your Truſtees, or give your voices for thoſe that gorge you moſt with liquor, what can be ſuppoſed but that you are already <hi>Drunk</hi> with folly, and Juſt <hi>Reeling</hi> into Slavery.</p>

Touching <hi>Commitments,</hi> and what is Required to make a <hi>Legal Mittimus,</hi> ſee before Pag. 27.</p>
               <p>The Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> is a Remedy given by the common Law for ſuch as were unjuſtly detained in cuſtody, to procure their Liberty: But before this ſtatute, was Rendred far leſs uſeful than it ought to be partly by the Judges, pretending a power to Grant, or deny the ſaid Writ at their pleaſure, in many caſes, and Eſpecially by the Ill practiſes of Sheriffs and Gaolers, by putting the priſoner to the charge and trouble of an <hi>Alias</hi> and <hi>pluries</hi> (that is a ſecond and third Writ, before they would obey the firſt, for there was no penalty till the Third) and then at laſt the Judges would oft-times Alleadge, That they could not take Bail, becauſe the party was a <hi>priſoner of State,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore to Remedy all thoſe miſchiefs, This <hi>moſt wholſome Law</hi> was provided. Which we ſhall briefly Endeavour to Divide into its ſeveral Branches, and Explain it to the meaneſt Capacities, ſince no Man is ſure but one time or other, he may have occaſion to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>This Act concerneth either firſt, perſons committed for ſome other Criminal, or ſuppoſedCriminal matter, (beſides <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony,)</hi> and theſe are to have an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> Immediately; 2ly. ſuch who in their <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> are charged with <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> &amp; theſe ſhall have the benefit of the ſaid Writ after the time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Limited. 1ſt. If any Gaoler or Under-Keeper ſhall not deliver a <hi>trueCopy of the Mittimus</hi> within 6 <hi>hours</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the priſoner demands it, the Head-Gaoler or Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per forfeits to the priſoner for the firſt Offence <hi>100l.</hi> for the ſecond Offence <hi>200l.</hi> and loſes his place. Nor is there any <hi>Fee</hi> to be paid for the ſame, the Turn-key muſt deliver it at his peril. And note if the priſoner ſhould be lockt up, or none ſuffered to come at him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friend of his may demand the ſame on his behalf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever the Criminal matter be, If Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Felony be not Expreſly charged, any perſon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50183:71"/>
on the priſoners behalf, carrying ſuch <hi>true Copy</hi> of the Commitment to the Lord Chancellor, or <hi>any one</hi> of the Judges, or Barons of the Exchequer, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath made that a Copy was demanded and denied, he ſhall Grant an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> or forfeit <hi>500l.</hi> to the priſoner; But note, the Requeſt muſt be made to ſuch Judge <hi>in Writing,</hi> and Atteſted by two witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Sheriff or Gaoler do not carry up the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and Return the true cauſes of his detainour, within <hi>three</hi> days, If under twenty miles diſtance, or within <hi>ten daies</hi> if above twenty, and under an hundred miles, or within <hi>twenty daies</hi> if above an hundred miles, he forfeits <hi>500l.</hi> to the priſoner.</p>
               <p>Note the priſoner muſt pay the <hi>Charges</hi> of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying up, and the Judge when he Grants the Writ, may order how much, but it muſt not be above 12 <hi>d.</hi> a mile.</p>
               <p>If upon the Return of ſuch <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> it appear the priſoner is not charged with <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and plainly Expreſſed,</hi> or for ſuch matters, as by Law are <hi>not Bailable,</hi> the Judge ſhall diſcharge the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner upon Bail.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas it is become the common practice of Gaolers, and Keepers of <hi>Newgate,</hi> the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſundry other Gaols and Priſons, to Lodge together in one Room, or Chamber and Bed, Priſoners for Debt, and Felons, whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times honeſt Gentlemen, Trades-men and others, Priſoners for Debt, are diſturbed and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the night-time from their natural Reſt, by reaſon of their Fetters and Irons, and otherwiſe much offended and troubled by their lewd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Language and Diſcourſes, with moſt horrid Curſing and Swearing (much accuſtomed to ſuch perſons;) (2.) Be it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that it ſhall not be lawful hereafter for any Sheriff, Gaoler, or Keeper of any Gaol or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to put, keep or Lodge Priſoners for Debt, and

Felons together in one Room or Chamber; but that they ſhall be put, kept, and Lodged ſeparate and apart one from another, in diſtinct Rooms, (3.)

               <p>And to the End that Engliſh-men may more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely enjoy their due Freedoms, the prudence of our Legiſlators have thought fit from time to time to Remove Encroachments thereupon, though under pretence of Juriſdictions and Courts of Juſtice; and to prohibit any Exorbitant Arbitrary Power for the future, but that all things may be left to the calm and equal proceedings of Law; and that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Method of Trial by <hi>Juries,</hi> one of the principal Bulwarks of <hi>England</hi>'s Liberties.

               <p>THE Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> (ſo called, becauſe held in a Chamber at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Roof of which is garniſht with Golden <hi>Stars)</hi> was not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Erected, but confirmed and eſtabliſht by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of the 3 <hi>H. 7. Ca.</hi> 1. For there had <hi>before</hi> been ſome ſuch Juriſdiction, as <hi>Cook</hi> obſerves 4. <hi>Inſtit. fo.</hi> 62. yet there is reaſon to believe, That it grew up rather by <hi>Connivance</hi> and Uſurpation, than any due courſe of Law. The Crimes it pretended to puniſh were the Exorbitant Offences of Great Men, (whom Inferiour Judges and Jurors (though they ſhould not) would in reſpect of their Greatneſs be afraid to offend) Bribery, Extortion, Maintenance, Champerty, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracery, Forgery, Perjury, Libelling, Challenges, Duels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their proceedings were by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, and Proceſs under the Great Seal; and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by them Inflicted were <hi>Fines, Impriſonment, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory, Cutting off Ears,</hi> &amp;c. But whatever pretences there were for the ſetting up this Court at firſt, 'tis certain it was made uſe of as a property of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power to <hi>Cruſh</hi> any whom the Ruling <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Favourites</hi> had a mind to deſtroy; and indeed there were <hi>Three</hi> things in the very nature of this Court, which were deſtructive to the Original Conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government and Liberties. 1. They proceeded without <hi>Juries.</hi> 2. They pretended to a Power to Examine men upon their <hi>Oaths</hi> touching Crimes by them ſuppoſed to be committed, which is contrary to all Law and Reaſon; For, <hi>Nemo tenetur ſeipſum Accuſare: No man is bound to accuſe himſelf.</hi> 3. The Judges of this Court proceeded by <hi>no known Law or Rules,</hi> but were left at Liberty to Act Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, and according to their own pleaſures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Law of <hi>Engl.</hi> hates to leave to any ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power, but as it marks out the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:50183:78"/>
of Crimes, ſuch or ſuch an Act ſhall be <hi>Treaſon;</hi> this <hi>Felony,</hi> that <hi>petty Larceny,</hi> &amp;c. So it awards certain and poſitive <hi>puniſhments,</hi> proportionate to each of them. Therefore this Court being found a <hi>Grievance</hi> to the Subject, was by this Act diſſolved and taken away.</p>
               <p>And to the intent nothing of the like kind ſhould by any other name be practiſed for the future, it is Declared and Enacted, That the King and His Privy Council ſhall not queſtion or diſpoſe of the Lands or Goods of any Subjects: And if they do, each Privy Counſellor or preſent forfeits <hi>500l.</hi> to the party grieved.</p>

                  <hi>FOraſmuch as divers perſons offending in many great Crimes and Offences appertaining meerly to the Juriſdiction and Determination of the Eccleſiastical Courts and Judges of this Realm, are many times unpuniſhed for lack and want of the good and due Execution of the Writ</hi> de Excommunicato Capiendo, <hi>directed to the Sheriff of any County, for the taking and apprehending of any ſuch Offenders: (2.) The great abuſe whereof, as it ſhould ſeem, hath grown, for that the ſaid Writ is not Returnable in any Court, that might have the Judgment of the well Executing and ſerving of the ſaid Writ, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof; (3.) But hitherto have been left only to the diſcretion of the Sheriffs and their Deputies, by whoſe Negligences and Defaults, for the moſt part, the ſaid Writ is not Executed upon the Offenders as it ought to be. (4.) By reaſon whereof, ſuch Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be greatly encouraged to continue their ſinful and criminous Life, much to the diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and to the great contempt of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this Realm.</hi>

               <head>The Comment, With a Diſcourſe of the Nature of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and how to <hi>prevent</hi> or <hi>take off</hi> the VVrit <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough Excommunications pretend a Title <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and therefore his <hi>Sacred Name</hi> is therein made uſe of, and ſeveral other <hi>Spiritual Phraſes</hi> purporting that the ſame, and all proceedings thereunto, are by <hi>his</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; yet they being ſo commonly thundered out, by perſons who have immediately no Authority from our Lord, or his Word, to manage them; and for ſuch <hi>trivial Crimes</hi> as no Law of God hath ordered
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50183:83"/>
them againſt, and in ſuch a <hi>Light and precipitant</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as no part of Holy Scripture warranteth: The wiſer ſort of men do therefore look upon them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>Excommunings,</hi> or a ſort of Civil puniſhment, like that in uſe among the <hi>Romans, Interdico tibi aqua &amp; igni,</hi> than one of the ſolemn Inſtitutions of God. And therefore waving any diſcourſe of what Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Influence or Effect may be dreaded from the ſame in our dayes, which we hope are wiſe enough not to be <hi>Bug-Bear'd</hi> with that Maxim of the Canoniſts <hi>Excommunicatio ſive Justa, ſive Injuſta eſt timenda; A Church-Curſe, be it Just, or Unjust, is to be feared.</hi> All that we ſhall ſpeak to is matter <hi>of Law,</hi> for ſo it is that there are <hi>Legal Bars</hi> and puniſhments formed by our Temporal Laws, as long as the Legiſlative Power ſhall not be at leiſure to conſider of them, and (if they find it requiſite) Repeal them. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A perſon <hi>Excommunicated</hi> is forthwith <hi>diſabled to Sue</hi> in any of His Majeſties Courts; not that thereby he loſes his Right for ever, but the Excommunication may be pleaded in <hi>Abatement</hi> of his preſent Action, till the ſame is taken off by an <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Yet note, That whoſoever is Inſtrumental in procuring, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, decreeing or pronouncing the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſhall never be allowed to plead it; nor ſhall it be pleaded, unleſs the Excommunication be, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Biſhop himſelf;</hi> for the Court will receive no Certificate from any to whom they cannot write to Abſolve the perſon, if they find cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Likewiſe, though a perſon Excommunicated may be appointed an <hi>Executor,</hi> and is capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Legacy</hi> given him, yet ſo-long as he ſtands Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, he is not to be allowed to <hi>prove the Will,</hi> nor <hi>Sue for his Legacy</hi> in the Spiritual Court. But note, whereas ſome ſay a man Excommunicated can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Marry;</hi> 'tis Non-ſenſe, for Marriage is <hi>de Jure Naturali,</hi> and alike abſurd it is for any to pretend, that ſuch a perſon cannot give his <hi>Suffrage</hi> in any
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50183:84"/>
                  <hi>Election;</hi> as for Example of <hi>Parliament-men,</hi> for the ſame is an idle dream; the Law allows him a Voice, ſo long as he hath a Free-hold of Forty Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> though he were under forty Curſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a perſon (juſtly or unjuſtly) Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, continue ſo by the ſpace of forty dayes then by the Common Law, the Biſhop certifying the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chancery, (which is called a <hi>Significavit)</hi> there ſhall iſſue forth a Writ from thence to the Sheriff of the County where the party lives, to Impriſon him without <hi>Bail</hi> or <hi>Mainprize,</hi> till he hath made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Holy Church.</p>
               <p>This is called a Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> and ſuch Impriſonment of a perſon Excommunicated by a Civil Sanction, is not practiſed <hi>in any Nation in the world</hi> but ours, and if it had here too been <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> with its Brother <hi>de Haeretico Comburendo,</hi> I believe it would have had <hi>few Tears</hi> at its Funeral. But at Common Law the ſame Writ being not Returnable in any Court, the Sheriffs took their own time, and uſed their diſcretion in Executing it; to inforce which, this Statute was made, whereby it is Enacted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſaid Writ ſhall be Returnable in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> yet the Sheriff need not bring thither the Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Sheriff Return <hi>Non eſt Inventus.</hi> a <hi>Capias</hi> ſhall be Awarded with Proclamation, to come in with ſix dayes; if the party do not, he forfeirs 10 <hi>l.</hi> and thenceforwards <hi>Capias</hi> after <hi>Capias,</hi> and 20 <hi>l.</hi> forfeited on each.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But note, there are two Caſes in which though a man ſtands out never ſo many <hi>Proclamations,</hi> he ſhall forfeit nothing. And they two are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. VVhere the Party againſt whom the VVrit <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo</hi> is Awarded, hath not therein a ſufficient and lawful <hi>Addition;</hi> That is (ſaith <hi>Cowel) a Title over and above his Chriſtian and Sirname, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his State, Degree, Trade, Occupation, or Myſtery</hi> (as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50183:84"/>
Lord, Knight, Gentleman, Yeoman, Clothier, and the like) <hi>and the Hamlet, Town, Pariſh, and County</hi> where he is, or lately was converſant and dwelling. And if it be with a <hi>Nuper</hi> [late of ſuch a place] then you ſee there muſt be made out one <hi>Capias</hi> without any penalty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. VVhere it is not expreſſed in the Biſhops Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, that the Cauſe for which the party was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Cited into the Spiritual Court, was for one of theſe 10 <hi>Cauſes</hi> following, <hi>viz. 1. Hereſie;</hi> 2. Refuſing to have Children <hi>Baptized;</hi> 3. Refuſing to Receive the <hi>Communion;</hi> 4. Refuſing to come to <hi>Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; 5. Errour</hi> in Religion or Doctrine; 6. <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; 7. uſury; 8. Simony; 9. Perjury</hi> in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court; or 10. <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To know whether there be ſuch cauſe expreſſed, you may have <hi>a Copy of the Significavit</hi> at the <hi>Curſitors</hi> Office in <hi>Chancery-Lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in either of theſe caſes, all pains and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures limited by this Statute by reaſon of ſuch VVrit of <hi>Excom. Cap.</hi> wanting ſuch an <hi>Addition</hi> or <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificavit,</hi> wanting all the cauſes aforeſaid, ſhall be utterly void in Law, and by way of plea to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the party grieved.</p>
               <p>Touching the Authority of the Courts called <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiastick,</hi> whether they have truly any at all by our preſent Laws, I ſhall not here debate; they that have a mind to hear what is to be ſaid on that Theme, may read Mr. <hi>Hickeringil</hi>'s Book of <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Henry Care</hi>'s Book written in the year 1664. entituled, <hi>A true Guide for all perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Eccleſiaſtical Courts;</hi> neither of which I ever yet ſaw ſufficiently <hi>Anſwered;</hi> yet ſtill ſince moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſuch Courts do proceed and <hi>Act,</hi> we ſhall ſuppoſe them to have ſome Power, and only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Reader of the courſe of their practice, as it is uſed at this day, and his beſt courſe to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50183:85"/>
You muſt note, that perſons are uſually Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated upon <hi>Contempt</hi> or <hi>Contumacy,</hi> which may be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the party being duly Cited, Denieth, or Omitteth to appear:</hi> For if he be not perſonally ſummoned, he needs not appear the firſt time; but then their way is to Cite him by a Writ called <hi>Viis &amp; Modis,</hi> ſet up at the <hi>Doors of his Houſe,</hi> or at the <hi>Church Doors,</hi> Citing him at a certain day to appear to anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (being perſonally Cited) if he doth not appear the <hi>firſt</hi> time, or whether he be or no, if he doth not appear the <hi>ſecond</hi> time, he is <hi>Excommunicated for Contempt.</hi> If he be Cited generally: the Law is, <hi>That he ſhall appear the third day after the Service of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The Law alſo is, that <hi>if he he will give the Apparator</hi> 6d. <hi>he muſt bring him the full and true Copy of the Citation.</hi> If a day of appearance be mentioned, and the ſame be not at leaſt the third day from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; or if he hath before witneſſes given the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parator <hi>6d.</hi> to bring him a full and true Copy of the Citation, and he doth not, I conceive, he needs not appear, but liſten what they do; and if they decree him <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> he may <hi>Appeal</hi> within 15 daies, and bring from the <hi>Superiour Court,</hi> an <hi>Inhibition</hi> to ſtop their proceedings againſt him. And further, the Rule in that Law is, <hi>Totus dies debetur Delinquenti.</hi> It is enough for a perſon to appear any hour of the day (provided it be a <hi>Court-hour)</hi> wherein he is Cited to appear; ſo as though he be <hi>called</hi> before he comes, vet if he appeareth that day, he ſhall be diſcharged, or he may <hi>Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When he appeareth, he ſhall demand his <hi>Charge,</hi> which is either by a <hi>Preſentment</hi> from <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> or by a <hi>Libel,</hi> or <hi>Articles,</hi> which are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by a <hi>Promoter.</hi> Be it which it will, he ſhall demand a <hi>Copy;</hi> if it be <hi>denyed</hi> or <hi>delayed,</hi> he may bring, if he will, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> from the <hi>King's Court</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> forbidding them to proceed in that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50183:85"/>
Cauſe, till they have given a full and true Copy of his Charge, according to the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen. 5. Ca.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>If he <hi>appeareth in perſon,</hi> he ought to have his Charge the firſt Court-day; if he appeareth <hi>by a Proctor,</hi> they will uſually (to get the Proctor <hi>more Fees)</hi> give to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Court-day, to bring in the <hi>Libel</hi> or <hi>Articles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If they deliver him not his Charge the ſecond Court-day, he may <hi>Appeal,</hi> if upon his demand the Judge will not diſmiſs him; or he may, if he will, bring his <hi>Prohibition,</hi> for want of <hi>Articles,</hi> and ſtop their further proceedings.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the proceedings be upon a <hi>Promotion,</hi> and the <hi>Promoter</hi> hath Imployed a <hi>Proctor</hi> in the Caſe, the party accuſed muſt know, that no <hi>Proctor</hi> can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without a <hi>Proxy,</hi> that is, Letters <hi>Procuratory</hi> under the <hi>Promoter's Hand and Seal,</hi> authorizing him to act for him in the Caſe; and when he hath that, there muſt be an <hi>Act</hi> entred in <hi>Court</hi> to admit ſuch a perſon Proctor in the Caſe. The party charged may go or ſend to the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> and demand a <hi>ſight of both thoſe;</hi> the Reaſon in Law is this, becauſe <hi>any Proctor is liable to the Parties Action,</hi> if he mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth any perſon in the name of another, without <hi>Authority</hi> from him. And ſecondly, <hi>If there be no Act of Court</hi> admitting him as a <hi>Proctor,</hi> though the party accuſed be Conqueror in the caſe, yet <hi>he cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Coſts,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>Legal Adverſary,</hi> againſt whom they can be Recovered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. According to the <hi>Statute-Law, Every Informer,</hi> if overthrown, ſhall pay charges. According to the <hi>Civil and Canon Law,</hi> none ought to be admitted as a <hi>Voluntary Promoter,</hi> till he hath given ſecurity to pay the Charges. If overthrown, The Party Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore ſhall before he anſwereth the <hi>Articles,</hi> demand this; if it be denied by the Judge, he may Appeal to the Superiour Court. It is alſo worth the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50183:86"/>
perſons Enquiry who is Accuſed, to be well adviſed whether the <hi>Promoter</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> be not obliged to all thoſe things, that an Informer in the Secular Courts is tied to, by the Statutes 31 <hi>Eliz. 5. 18. Eliz. 5. 21. Jac.</hi> 4. The Reaſon is, becauſe thoſe Statutes ſay, <hi>Informers Upon any Penal Statutes,</hi> and commonly Promoters in the <hi>Eccleſiastical Courts,</hi> ſay ſuch and ſuch things are done contrary to the <hi>Statutes of this Realm, as well as contrary</hi> to the <hi>Canons:</hi> now what things the Statutes, which alſo name <hi>Promoters,</hi> Require of ſuch <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Promoters,</hi> the Statutes do declare.</p>
               <p n="7">7. VVhen the Party Accuſed hath a Copy of his <hi>Libel,</hi> let him demand time to anſwer; If the Judge denies him time (at leaſt till the next Court-day) let him Appeal; Having due time granted, in the mean time let him duly conſider the <hi>matter and form of his Libel.</hi> As to which let him amongſt other things obſerve theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. VVhether the matters he be Charged with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Cogniſance of the <hi>Eccleſiastical Court?</hi> If Lawyers tell him no, let that be his Anſwer, and let him haſten to bring his Prohibition, which Lies in all ſuch Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. VVhether they have put into the Libel the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motors Petition for Right and Juſtice</hi> to be done him: it is oft times left out. It is a Rule in their Law, Libellus <hi>eſt ipſo Jure nullus, ubi nihil Petitur.</hi> If he finds that this is wanting, let his Anſwer only be That the Libel is in Law utterly void, and Inſufficient, and deſire to be diſmiſſed: If the Judge refuſeth to diſmiſs him, let him Appeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let him alſo Obſerve, whether he be in the Articles laid to be <hi>one of the Dioceſs,</hi> or a Pariſhoner of ſuch a Pariſh, for it be not laid, it can never be <hi>proved,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Promotor</hi> muſt fail in his Suit; for what is not laid, cannot be proved: <hi>Quicquid deponitur Extra Articulum, deponitur Extra Legem,</hi> is a Rule in their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50183:86"/>
Law. If he be ſaid to be a Pariſhioner of ſuch a place, within ſuch a dioceſs, let him not in his Anſwer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it but ſay, <hi>He cannot determine the Bounds of Dioceſſes and pariſhes, but for that he Referreth himſelf to the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let him alſo obſerve, if the things he be Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have done, or omitted, be within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a year, and whether there hath been ſince <hi>no Act of Grace or Oblivion, which hath pardoned them; and whether they be not ſuch things as he hath been puniſhed for, or ſuch things as the Statute-Law hath Limited the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of to a leſs time than a year:</hi> For if any of theſe things be, they may be given in anſwer to avoid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the whole, or any part of the Charge. If the Judge will not accept the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> the party may Sue out a <hi>Prohibition</hi> and ſtop them.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

But it may be, in this Caſe, a <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> will be his beſt Remedy.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

When he hath given his Anſwer, which muſt be ſubſcribed by his own hand, it is uſual for the <hi>Adverſe Proctor</hi> to demand a time to prove his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, for which the Judge at his pleaſure grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two, three, four, or ſix Court-daies (uſually but two) let him alſo at the ſame time move, that he may have liberty within that time alſo, to produce any Witneſſes for his Defence; if it be denied, let him Appeal.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Let him obſerve, what time the Judge ſetteth his Adverſary to produce his Witneſſes in Court, and whom he names for Witneſſes for him. Let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſire a time to be ſet in Court for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and be careful to bring them at the time, for they muſt all be ſworn in the Court, then Examined privately by the Regiſter. Unleſs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary deſireth a <hi>Commiſſion to Examine</hi> Witneſſes, (which is not often done, becauſe it is much more Chargeable) is that Caſe, there are no Witneſſes in the Court produced and Sworn, but before thoſe Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p n="12">12. if the <hi>party Defendant will,</hi> he may deliver in to the Regiſter <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> upon which the Regiſter ſhall Croſs-Examine his Adverſaries VVitneſſes. But he muſt be very wary as to this, for he ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Except</hi> againſt any of his <hi>Adverſaries Witneſſes,</hi> whom he hath Croſs-Examined, and made VVitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let him <hi>Adviſe his own Witneſſes to be very careful that the Register ſetteth down what they ſay, in their own words, that under the pretence of putting them into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent phraſe, their whole ſenſe be not altered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. VVhen the <hi>time Probatory,</hi> ſet at firſt by the Judge, is expired, let him deſire of the Judge, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.</hi> If the Judge will grant longer time to prove, let him deſire the Advantage of the ſame time alſo, to bring more VVitneſſes for himſelf, which he may, or may not, make uſe of as he pleaſes. If once
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50183:87"/>
the Term given for proof be Expired, let him deſire <hi>Publication,</hi> &amp; Liberty to take out a <hi>Copy of the depoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. VVhen he hath got a <hi>Copy,</hi> let him diligently obſerve, if he can prove any thing contrary to what the VVitneſſes, or any of them have ſworn; if he can, let him at the next Court-day, offer a paper of <hi>general</hi> &amp; <hi>Particular Exceptions,</hi> ſhewing the Particulars which he Excepteth againſt in their <hi>depoſitions</hi> ſeverally, as well as his <hi>general Exceptions</hi> againſt them all. Let him deſire a time to bring in witneſs, to prove his <hi>Exceptions.</hi> If the Judge refuſeth to admit his <hi>Exception,</hi> or to give him due time to prove them, he may again Appeal.</p>
               <p n="16">16. VVhen once the <hi>Promoter</hi> hath Allowed to have <hi>Publication,</hi> he may again move for time, to Invalidate the proof of the <hi>Exceptions,</hi> but not to fortifie his firſt proof. If any Liberty of that Nature be deſired, the <hi>defendant</hi> may <hi>Appeal;</hi> for unleſs in a caſe for the King after Publication, no new VVitneſſes can be produced.</p>
               <p n="17">17. VVhen the party againſt whom the <hi>Promotion</hi> is, peruſeth the <hi>depoſition,</hi> let him ſtrictly obſerve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the particulars he is charged with be proved by <hi>two Witneſſes;</hi> for it is a Rule in their Law, <hi>Vox unius eſt Vox Nullius,</hi> and if the Iudge will admit the thing proved <hi>by one Witneſs</hi> a Prohibition Lyes: for the Kings Judges, will not only ſee, that thoſe Courts ſhall keep to matters truly belonging to their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; but alſo that in the proſecution of them, they ſhall keep to the <hi>Received Rules</hi> of their own Law, in thoſe main points of proof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. It is an uſual thing upon preſentments by Church-VVardens, when the party preſented calls for proof of the preſentment, to tell them, That the <hi>Church War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens preſentment is a Conviction,</hi> they being ſworn Officers. But this is contrary to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth no <hi>preſentment by Officers ex Officio</hi> to be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, If Grand Juries</hi> at <hi>Aſſizes</hi> and <hi>Seſſions</hi> do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, this is no <hi>Conviction,</hi> but the perſons muſt after this be <hi>Indicted,</hi> and <hi>proof</hi> made by VVitneſſes. If

therefore the Eccleſiaſtical Court Inſiſts on this, the perſon may appeal; or (which it may be is better) he may have a <hi>prohibition</hi> from the <hi>Kings Court</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> as ſome greater Lawyers think.</p>

               <p n="20">20. At the day ſet, the Party Accuſed, or Promoted againſt, may Appear, and ſhew to the Judge the whole ſtate of the Caſe, and plead it himſelf; or, if he will, by an <hi>Advocate,</hi> if any be at hand; or for ought I know, if there be none by <hi>Attorney,</hi> or <hi>Counſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> at <hi>Common-Law;</hi> after which the Judge will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point upon deſire a day to give ſentence.</p>
               <p n="22">22. At that day the Party muſt have a form of an <hi>Abſolutory Sentence,</hi> ready to tender to the Judge, if the Judge give Sentence againſt him he may appeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 15 days, by virtue of the ſtatute, 24. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p n="22">22, All along the <hi>Proſecution,</hi> the perſon againſt whom the <hi>Proſecution is,</hi> ſhall do well after every Court, to get the <hi>Acts of the Courts in his Caſe, under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters hand,</hi> and to keep them by him carefully. So much I thought fit to add here for the Readers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, how to behave and Conduct himſelf when Troubled in <hi>thoſe Courts,</hi> becauſe 'tis a practice very little underſtood, by means whereof greedy <hi>Proctors, Solicitors</hi> and other <hi>ill men</hi> frequently make a prey of honeſt people therein concerned.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now Recount the <hi>ways and means</hi> how to get off from the VVrit <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo.</hi>—VVe told you before, no <hi>Bail</hi> would be accepted, nor will an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> avail you, (unleſs you have a mind only to change the Priſon) nor does a <hi>Prohibition</hi> or <hi>Homine Replegiando</hi> Lie. But the ſeveral ways to help (according as the Caſe happens) are as followeth;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:50183:88"/>
1. <hi>If the Party Impriſoned hath brought a PROHIBI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, by which the Eccleſiaſtical Court hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to proceed no further, and to abſolve the Perſon, if Excommunicated, and the Judge hath diſobeyed the Writ, and ſignified and procured the Party to be impriſoned, the perſon that is impriſoned</hi> at any time in Term, upon a <hi>Motion,</hi> ſhall have firſt an <hi>Attachment</hi> againſt the Judge, and then a Writ of <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the Sheriff, to deliver the Priſoner to follow the <hi>Attachment,</hi> without any Submiſſion to the Biſhop at all, or any <hi>Caution.</hi> Such Writ may be found in the Regiſter of <hi>Original writs,</hi> pag. 66. Nay if the Attachment be granted, and the Perſon be Impriſoned, or a Writ out, commanding him to be taken, and the Term be done before the <hi>Attachment</hi> can be ſerved, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tell us, that he ſhall have the ſame VVrit during the Vacation out of Chancery: Nay, it is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men ſkilled in the Law, that he ſhall have ſuch a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> upon <hi>Affidavit</hi> made, that the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are contrary to a Prohibition ſerved upon the Judge, though no ſuch Attachment be taken out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Party impriſoned, or againſt whom the Writ is to take him, though he be not taken, hath appealed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Statute,</hi> 24 Hen. 8. 12. <hi>If he bringeth into the</hi> Court of Chancery <hi>an Authentick copy of his Appeal, he ſhall have a Writ of</hi> Superſedeas <hi>to stop the Sheriff from apprehending him, or to deliver him if he be apprehended,</hi> only this muſt be within a Year after his Appeal, that it may appear to the Court, he hath not deſerted his Appeal; you may find forms of ſuch a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> alſo in the <hi>Register of Original Writs;</hi> both theſe are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon excellent Reaſon. The Law of <hi>England</hi> will not ſuffer Eccleſiaſtical Judges, either to invade their Right, or to exalt themſelves againſt their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor yet ſuffer <hi>Inferiour Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Right, Power,</hi> and <hi>Authority of Superiour Courts</hi> in their own Order.</p>
               <p n="3">3, <hi>If a Perſon be ſued in the Eccleſiastical Courts for a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50183:89"/>
matter not within their Juriſdiction, and they have caught him upon contempt, in not appearing or not obeying their Sentence:</hi> Upon a ſuggeſtion to the Kings Courts, if it appear to them, that the Original matter was not cognoſcible in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, they will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed the Proceedings, and order the impriſoned Perſon to be diſcharged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If the impriſoned Perſon, or he againſt whom the Writ is out, though he be not taken, bring a Copy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> Significavit <hi>into the Courts at</hi> Weſtminſter, and make it appear to the Judges there, that the cauſe of Excommunication is not therein expreſſed, together with the day when it was pronounced, if he be not ſaid to be excommunicated <hi>Majori Excommunicatione;</hi> if it be not ſigned by the Biſhop, or ſaid to be done <hi>Authoritate noſtra ordinaria: if the Party Excommunioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be not expreſſed by name,</hi> the Court will deliver the perſon. Dr. <hi>Cozens</hi> mentions three of theſe caſes, and the Reader alſo may find them in the <hi>Regiſter of Writs.</hi> The firſt he ſaith he cannot find in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Articles or matter of the Libel must be expreſſed,</hi> nor indeed do I find it there, but it is in ſeveral Reports. The reaſons are, 1. Becauſe the Law will not ſuffer men to be impriſoned for every light offence, (this <hi>Dr. Cozens</hi> gives. 2. Becauſe the Kings Courts can recieve <hi>Significavits</hi> from none but the perſon to whom (if need be) they may write to diſcharge the Priſoner: Nor will the Court ſuffer a perſon to be Excommunicated, and lye in Priſon for a Crime which the Eccleſiaſtical Court hath no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in; nor yet unleſs it appeareth to the Court, he hath ſtood Forty dayes excommunicated. Again here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore whole Cities and Communities have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, therefore the perſon muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by name, or he ſhall not lie there.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let him procure the Copy of the Writ <hi>de Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato Capiendo</hi> and obſerve, firſt, if it be iſſued in Term-time. 2. <hi>If there were full twenty days betwixt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50183:89"/>
the Teſt and Return. 3. If it be made Returnable the next Term. 4. If there be due Additions in it. 5. If before it was delivered to the Sheriff, it were Entered upon Record in the</hi> Kings-Bench, <hi>and made Returnable into that Court.</hi> All theſe things are Required by the ſtatute 5 <hi>Eiz:</hi> 23; If any of theſe Errours be found, he ſhall upon motion in the Kings Bench be diſcharged, and the Writ will be declared Illegal.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If he can be delivered by none of theſe ways, he may at any Sealing in the <hi>Chancery</hi> whether it be in Term, or out of Term, upon a petition to, or motion before the L. Chancellor have the <hi>VVrit, de Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Admittenda,</hi> granted him (in caſe he hath before offered the Biſhop a Bond of 10. l: or 20 <hi>l.</hi> with Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>stare &amp; parere mandatis Eccleſiae in forma Juris)</hi> when he hath it, let him by ſome Attorney, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys Clerk ſend it, and tender a Bond and Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sureties with it to the Biſhop, and demand the Diſcharge of the Priſoner; If it be not preſently done, let him certifie ſo much, and at the next Seal move for a ſecond Writ to the Biſhop; or (which it may be is more adviſeable) let him move for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Writ to the Sheriff, (the form of it is in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter.) In that the King commandeth the Sheriff to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Biſhop to accept the <hi>Caution,</hi> &amp; to deliver the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and further commands him, that in caſe he doth it not in his preſence, the Sheriff ſhould do it himſelf. If the Sheriff yields not Obedience; upon another Motion, he ought to have a Writ to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, commanding to take ſecurity of the Sheriff to appear at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſuch a day, to ſhew reaſon why he hath contemned the Kings Writ, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it commandeth the Coroners to take the Caution of the Priſoner, and to deliver him. The Reader may find all this in the Regiſter where are the Forms of all theſe Writs, and alſo in Dr. <hi>Cozens Apology,</hi> p. 1. C. 2. who being himſelf a <hi>Judge</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, cannot be preſumed to have told us any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50183:90"/>
thing but what is <hi>Law,</hi> contrary to their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Biſhop upon taking ſuch <hi>Cautionary Bonds,</hi> doth ordinarily Inſiſt upon the perſons paying the Proſecutors charges, but it is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1. Becauſe he hath nothing to do but to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Command of the Writ, which ſpeaks not a word of charges. 2. Becauſe if the charges be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally due, the Promoter muſt have alſo a legal way to Recover them; if not, it is Extortion for the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judge to Exact them. 3. Becauſe it is no ſufficient Return to the King's Writ, which mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſuch thing, to ſay, He could not diſcharge the Priſoner, becauſe he would not pay the Promoter's Charge.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Legal Charges are ſmall, uſually the Priſoner for his Liberty will pay the charges, which are as follow.</p>

               <p>But note, the Charges are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> as the Cauſe went further or leſſer way before the <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Biſhop will not take the <hi>Caution,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you, you may have a ſecond <hi>Writ</hi> directed to the <hi>High-Sheriff,</hi> commanding him to go to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and require him to take the Caution, and to deliver the Priſoner, and requiring him to do it <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> if the Biſhop ſtill refuſe. And if the Sheriff do not do ſo, you may have a Writ to the ſame purpoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the <hi>Coroner</hi> to do it, as you may ſee in that Authentick Law-Book, <hi>The Regiſter of Original Writs, fol.</hi> 66, and 67. So careful were our Forefathers for the Liberty of the Subjects Perſons. And hereby it appears that the Biſhop is bound by Law to take ſuch Caution, that is, <hi>Fidejuſſory Caution,</hi> I mean by <hi>Bond and Sureties,</hi> and thereupon to abſolve the perſon Excommunicated, though he will not take an <hi>Oath, ſtare mandatis Eccleſiae, To obey the commands of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church.</hi> As for what ſhall be accounted ſuch <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Caution,</hi> the practice is for the Party and two Friends (for there muſt be <hi>Two</hi> Sureties) to be bound in a Bond of 10 <hi>l.</hi> (ſeldom more, or at moſt 20 <hi>l.)</hi> to the Biſhop, conditioned, that the Party ſhall obey the Commands of the Church, but ſuch Bond when entred into is but a <hi>Formality;</hi> for they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50183:91"/>
are never put in Suit, and indeed ſignifie nothing.</p>
               <p>Thus have we given our honeſt Countrey-men ſome few Directions how to act in this difficult and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Affair, being a Myſtery unknown to many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſers of the Law.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, That by the Statute of <hi>Car. 1. Ca.</hi> 11. For taking away the high Commiſſion Court, there is the following Clauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And be it alſo Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid that no Archbiſhop, Biſhop, nor Viccar general nor any Chancellor Official nor Commiſſary of any Archbiſhop Biſhop, or Viccar general, nor any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary whatſoever nor any other Spiritual or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Judge, Officer or Miniſter of Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or at the Inſtance, or promotion of any other perſon whatſoever urge, enforce, tender, give, or miniſter unto any Church Warden Sideman, or other perſon whatſoever any Corporal Oath, whereby, he or ſhe ſhall or may be charged or obliged to make any preſentment of any Crime or offence, or to confeſs or to accuſe himſelf or herſelf of any Crime, offence, delinquency, or miſdemeanor, or any Neglect, matter or thing, whereby or by reaſon whereof he or ſhe ſhall or may be liable, or expoſed to any cenſure, pain, penalty, or puniſhment whatſoever, upon pain and penalty that every perſon who ſhall offend contrary to this Statute ſhall forfeit and pay Treble damages to every perſon thereby greived and the ſum of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to him or them who ſhall firſt demand and ſue for the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And tho by the Statute 13 <hi>Car. 2. Ca.</hi> 12. part of this Statute is abrogated, yet this Clauſe is Excepted, and confirmed by an expreſs Proviſo of the ſaid laſt Act. And there are many precedents ſince His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reſtauration, where Church Wardens being proſecuted in the Spir. Court for not Swearing to the Biſhops <hi>Book of Articles</hi> of Inquiry, have moved the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> or common Pleas, and obtained a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50183:91"/>
prohibition to ſtop ſuch proceedings, as particularly in the Caſe of one <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now coming to ſpeak of the Laws upon which <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> are commonly proſecuted or threatned to be proſecuted, I muſt for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's better underſtanding, diſtinguiſh them; for the truth is, They are of <hi>two</hi> different Natures and kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some <hi>Statutes</hi> which were wholly deſigned <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts,</hi> and ought only to be Exerted againſt them, which yet ſome now would wreſt and diſtort, and make them Serve as <hi>Rods</hi> wherewith to laſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants for not coming to Church, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Laws that were indeed made againſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan <hi>Sectaries</hi> (as they call them) or diſſenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt breifly ſum up all the firſt Sort, how many and what they are, and ſhow you the Reaſons why they ought not to be turned upon ſuch diſſenters: The Statutes I mean are in number <hi>Five, viz.</hi> The 1. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Ca. 2. The 23. <hi>Elizabeth Ca.</hi> 1. The 29. <hi>Elizabeth Ca.</hi> 6. The 1. <hi>Jac. Ca.</hi> 4. and 3 <hi>Jac. Ca.</hi> 4. which we ſhall handle in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Act of the 1. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 2. Was made Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after that Queens coming to the Crown, when ſhe found nothing but Papiſts and Proteſtants in General. For the word <hi>Puritan</hi> in thoſe days was not known, (much leſs our modern Terms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <hi>Whig, Sectary,</hi> or <hi>Fanatick)</hi> and ſhe being a good Proteſtant (having been Educated therein) and reſolved to ſupport that Religion, caſting about with her wiſe Council how to do it, That the Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and <hi>moderate</hi> ſort of Papiſts might not be too much diſguſted or alienated from the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but be rather invited to cloſe therewith, It was therefore on mature deliberation Concluded to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50183:92"/>
go on gently as to the Reformation, and not to throw off all the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> at once: And therefore having a pattern of Proteſtant diſcipline made in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. time ſhe follows the ſame ſteps as near as could be in the beginning, and builds on the ſame Foundation which her pious Brother and his wiſe and <hi>honeſt Council</hi> had laid. Therefore the firſt Act ſhe paſſed, was to take off the Juriſdiction of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> (which had been Re-introduc'd by her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>unhappy Memory)</hi> and to take off all Coercive power whatſoever from Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and all was annext to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> This Act was Intituled, <hi>An Act to Reſtore to the Crown the antient Juriſdiction, &amp;c. 1. Eliz. Ca.</hi> 1. And hereby all the Laws made in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for ſettling the Popes Authority in <hi>England</hi> were Repealed. And alſo <hi>[Section the 18th]</hi> power is given to the Queen to grant <hi>Commiſſions under the Broad Seal</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to ſuch <hi>[Biſhops or Laymen, no matter which]</hi> as ſhe ſhould appoint to hold <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Courts,</hi> and none might do it <hi>without,</hi> upon pain of a Praemunire, and alſo the Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> is formed and hereby Injoined.</p>
               <p>The very next Act is That which we have now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration Intituled <hi>An Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, and Common Prayer, and Service in the Church, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament,</hi> Which amongſt other things Inflicts <hi>the penalty of</hi> 12d. <hi>for not coming to Church every Sunday and Holy-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this Act was intended againſt Papiſts may be concluded as well becauſe, the whole Act runs for the beating down of the Fopperies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how could it aim at any ſort of Proteſtants, ſince at that time of day there were none but Papiſts and Churchmen in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Twelvepence is not forfeited till Conviction, which muſt be by a Jury; to which purpoſe, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50183:92"/>
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and of Aſſize, and Mayors and Head-Officers of Corporations are Authorized To inquire, hear and determine the ſame,—But the party muſt be Indicted the nextSeſſions or Aſſizes after the Offence or not at all. So that they can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Act Proſecute at once for no more defaults than there are <hi>Sundaies</hi> &amp; Holy-days between one Seſſions or Aſſizes and another, And when the party is ſo Convicted the ſaid Courts are to make out proceſs for Levying the Twelve pences, which ſhall be Levied by the Church-Wardens for the uſe of the poor.</p>
               <p>However there being 52 <hi>Sundaies</hi> and 29 Holy-daies (appointed by our Liturgy to be obſerved) in the year, the Conſtant charge by this ſtatute for not coming to Church would be but <hi>4l. 1s. p. An.</hi> [And yet by the way, Note, That We have more Holy-daies or Feaſts to be obſerved ſince his Majeſties Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than ever the Church of <hi>England</hi> owned before. For there were antiently but 27. But upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Book of Common prayer, my Lords the Biſhops were pleaſed to add 2 New ones <hi>viz.</hi> The Converſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and whereas, in our old Common-prayer-Books, 'tis ſaid <hi>The Feaſt of St.</hi> Michael <hi>the Arch-Angel,</hi> in our preſent Books, <hi>'tis St.</hi> Michael <hi>and all Angels,</hi> Which ſeems an Affront to <hi>S. Michael</hi> at once to leave out his Title of <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> and at the ſame time bring in all <hi>other</hi> Angels (as well of the <hi>lower</hi> as Higher Hierarchies) to <hi>ſhare</hi> with him in a Feſtival, the Honour of which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo long, ſolely and Intire to himſelf—but this <hi>by the by]</hi> So that upon the whole matter, If any body ſhould be buſy to Execute this Act upon the Proteſtant diſſenters from the Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet conſidering the trouble of ſuch a Conviction, and the difficulty of proving a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>viz.</hi> that a man was not at Church, for note the words are,—ſhall <hi>repair to his own Pariſh Church,</hi> or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50183:93"/>
to <hi>ſome uſual place where Common Prayer ſhall be uſed,</hi> So that if he were at Mr. <hi>Read's Meeting-Houſe,</hi> I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he were ſafe from this Act. All this I ſay Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Labour would be more than the trouble—therefore let's proceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Act of this kind, is 23 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1. Intituled <hi>An Act to Retain the Queens Majeſties Subjects in their due Obedience.</hi> 
                  <q>And by this, to <hi>Reconcile any or for any to be Reconciled to the See of</hi> Rome, To with-draw or be with-drawn from the Eſtabliſht Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Romiſh Religion; Is made High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And that every one ſaying <hi>Maſs</hi> ſhall forfeit 200 Marks and every one that hears it 100 Marks, And every one above 16. years old not repairing to ſome Church or Chappel, but forbearing the ſame contrary to the <hi>ſaid Stat. 1. Eliz. C.</hi> 2. ſhall being lawfully Convicted forfeit 20 <hi>l.</hi> for every month, And the Juſtices at the Quarter Seſſions are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to Inquire into the Offences againſt this Act, Except Treaſon, And if any Indicted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (Except for Treaſon) will ſubmit in open Court and conform before Judgment given, he ſhall be diſcharged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this Statute was expreſsly and wholly made againſt the Papiſts is evident by the whole Scope thereof, as puniſhing ſaying of <hi>Maſs,</hi> &amp; drawing the Queens Subjects to Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> More eſpecially by its preamble (which alwaies opens and declares the Scope of a Law) whereas ſince the Statutes made in the 13. year of the Reign of the Queen our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lady, Intituled, <hi>An Act againſt the bringing in, and putting in Execution of Bulls, Writings &amp; Inſtruments, and other Superſtitious things from the See of</hi> Rome, divers ill affected Perſons have practiſed by other means than by Bulls or Inſtruments. Written or Printed to with-draw Her Majeſties Subjects to obey the ſaid uſurped Authority of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>IN RESPECT OF THE SAME</hi> [pray mark] to perſwade great
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50183:93"/>
numbers to with-draw their due Obedience from Her Majeſties Laws eſtabliſht for the due ſervice of Almighty God—For Reformation <hi>WHERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OF,</hi> be it Enacted, <hi>viz.</hi> That to with-draw to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be <hi>Treaſon;</hi> and not coming to Church ſhall forfeit 20 <hi>l. p.</hi> month—Nothing can be more plain than that this Levelled <hi>wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts,</hi> and cannot at all affect diſſenting Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Statute of 29. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 6. Is only a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the laſt Act, and therefore muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended of the ſame Perſons, viz. <hi>Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> [For as yet there were no other] whoſe Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this Statute Encreaſes for not coming to Church: For where is by the former Statute of <hi>23d</hi> it was to be only 20 <hi>l. p.</hi> month and bound to the <hi>good Behaviour</hi> after Conviction; <hi>This</hi> gives to the Queen &amp; Her Heirs, a Right to 20 <hi>l. p.</hi> month for every month after ſuch Conviction <hi>till</hi> they came to Church: And if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault be made of payment of the 20 <hi>l.</hi> a month, then to ſeize all their Goods, and 2 parts of their Real E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> But this is ſtill concerning <hi>Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,</hi> for it reſpects the ſame that were Offenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Statute of the 23. And they were <hi>only Papiſts:</hi> Therefore 'tis abſurd and unjuſt to turn the Edge on't upon Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We come now to the Statute of 1. <hi>Jac. Ca.</hi> 4. which confirms all the former Statutes made againſt Popiſh Recuſants in the Queens time, But provides for their being diſcharged, tho Convicted, upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church.</p>
               <p>And that it means and intends none but Jeſuits and Popiſh Prieſts and other Popiſh Recuſants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears manifeſtly, not only in the Title but in the firſt Section of the Act it ſelf, and ſo throughout: The Title, is, <hi>An Act for the due Execution of the Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſuites, Seminary Prieſts, Recuſants,</hi> [the 2 former words, including the Romiſh Clergy, the latter the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50183:94"/>
Laiety] <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and begins thus—<hi>For the better and more due Execution of the Statutes heretofore made [Againſt whom?]</hi> as well <hi>againſt Jeſuites, Seminary Prieſts, and other</hi> SUCH-LIKE Prieſts [That is, other Popiſh Prieſts tho not bred up in the <hi>Serminaries] as alſo againſt all manner of Recuſants</hi> [That is Papiſts tho not in Orders] <hi>Be it Enacted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That all &amp; every the Statutes heretofore made againſt Jeſuites, ſeminary Prieſts and other Prieſts, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and Religions and Eccleſiaſtical Perſons whatſoever made, ordained or profeſſed, or to be made by any Authority or Juriſdiction derived, Challenged, or pretended from the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>together with all thoſe made againſt any manner of Recuſants</hi> [That is <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtill, but <hi>Lay men</hi> not in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders nor profeſſed of any Order of Monks or Friars as thoſe before mentioned were] <hi>ſhall be put in due and Exact Execution.</hi>—Nothing can be more abſurd than to rack &amp; force this Law ſo far beſides its Scope, as to make uſe of it againſt Proteſtants agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all the Doctrines and only differing in a few Indifferent Ceremonies, When it moſt manifeſtly appears intended only againſt Jeſuits, Romiſh Prieſts, and other Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And now was diſcovered the Helliſh <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> of the Papiſts which occaſioned the making of the Statute 3 <hi>Jac. Ca.</hi> 4. Intituled, <hi>An Act for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and Repreſſing Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> So that both the occaſion and the very Title, ſhews evidently againſt whom this Act is deſigned, which alſo appears fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the preamble; the whole purport of this Act all along being only to Reinforce the reſt of the Acts againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> and for that as thereby appears, ſome of them did come to Church and heard <hi>divine Service,</hi> to ſave the Penalties in the former Acts, and yet continued <hi>Papiſts ſtill in their hearts,</hi> Therefore by this Act they were all to take the Sacrament once a year, And if they refuſed they ſhould forfeit 20 <hi>l.</hi> the 1ſt year, for the 2d year 40 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; for every year afterwards <hi>60l.</hi> untill he or ſhe have received the ſaid Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:50183:94"/>
And by the 4th Section, the Church Wardens and Conſtables are to preſent the monthly abſence of all POPISH Recuſants,—but they are not bound by this Act to preſent any but Papiſts. For from this Act we may obſerve, that none can be Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon this Act or any of the other which it refers to (which are all thoſe here before rehearſed) unleſs they be POPISH Recuſants, for ſo are the expreſs words of the Act. And without doubt ſhould any <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Officer</hi> whatſoever Preſent ot proſecute any perſon thereupon other than a Popiſh Recuſant, the perſon ſo preſented may <hi>Joyn Iſſue,</hi> that he is <hi>no ſuch perſon as theſe Acts intend, being not a Papiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter, we may conclude, It is an abuſe, and utterly Illegall, to Proſecute Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants on ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as were made ſolely and wholly againſt Papiſts, as will further appear in our next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and we have heard ſome Judges <hi>have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> ſo much.</p>
               <p>However I ſhall here add the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> in the Caſe, for tho I know and own a <hi>vote</hi> of either or both Houſes cannot Repeal a Law, nor alter its ſenſe, yet certainly the Houſe conſiſting of ſo many wiſe diſcreet perſons, &amp; a great number of them Excellently Learned in the Laws, they are as like to Interpret a doubtful Law, and hit upon the true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation how far and to what it does extend, as <hi>two or three</hi> little ſwaggering <hi>Juſtices,</hi> or any <hi>ſingle Judge:</hi> At leaſt were I an Officer, I ſhould rather incline to credit their opinion, &amp; not run an hazard by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Toils</hi> made for reſtraining the <hi>Wolves and the Foxes,</hi> to intangle &amp; deſtroy the Innocent <hi>ſheep,</hi> meerly becauſe they do not all exactly tread in the <hi>very ſame ſteps</hi> and bite punctually all of one Sort of Graſs.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I mean the Act of 35 <hi>Eliz. Ca.</hi> 1.

I ſhall here inſert the firſt Paragraph, and give you the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the reſt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For the preventing and avoiding of ſuch great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and Perils as might happen and grow by the wicked and dangerous practices of ſeditious Sectaries, and diſloyal Perſons; Be it Enacted by the Queen's moſt Excellent Majeſty, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled; and by the Authority of the ſame, That if any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, above the Age of ſixteen years, which ſhall obſtinately Refuſe to Repair to ſome Church, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or uſual place of Common-Prayer, to hear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, Eſtabliſhed by Her Majeſties Laws and Statutes in that behalf made, and ſhall forbear to do the ſame by the ſpace of one month next after,</q> without any lawful cauſe, ſhall at any time after
<q>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:50183:95"/>
forty daies next, after the End of this Seſſion of Parliament, by Printing, Writing, or Expreſs Words or Speeches, adviſedly, or purpoſely practiſe, or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make or perſuade any of Her Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or any other within her Highneſs's Realms or Dominions, to deny, withſtand, and impugn Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Power and Authority, in caſes Eccleſiaſtical, United and Annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm; or to that end or purpoſe ſhall adviſedly or maliciouſly move, or perſuade any other perſon whatſoever, to forbear, or abſtain from coming to Church, to hear Divine Service, or to Receive the Communion, according to Her Majeſties Laws and Statutes aforeſaid, or to come to, or be preſent at any unlawful Aſſemblies, Conventicles or Meetings, under colour or pretence of any Exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, contrary to Her Majeſties Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; or if any perſon or perſons which ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately Refuſe to Repair to ſome Church, by the ſpace of one month, to hear Divine Service, as is aforeſaid, ſhall after the ſaid forty daies, either of him or themſelves, or by the Motion, Perſuaſion, Inticement or Allurement of any other, willingly Joyn in, or be preſent at any ſuch Aſſemblies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, or Meeting under colour or pretence of any ſuch Exerciſe of Religion, contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm as is aforeſaid; That then every ſuch perſon ſo offending, as aforeſaid, and being thereof lawfully convicted, ſhall be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon,</hi> and there to Remain, <hi>without Bail</hi> or Mainpriſe, <hi>until</hi> they ſhall <hi>Conform,</hi> and yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to come to ſome Church, Chapel, or uſual place of Common-Prayer, and hear Divine Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Act goes on, and provides, That if the perſon do not Conform within three months after Conviction, he ſhould Abjure, that is, be Baniſht, and ſwear never to come back without leave; And if he will not ſwear ſo, then the ſame to be Felony, without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:50183:96"/>
From which Act theſe 3 things are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſame was wholly intended againſt the <hi>Puritanes</hi> or <hi>Sectaries,</hi> for the Papiſts are expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by a particular clauſe, Sect. 12. in theſe words, 'Provided that <hi>No Popiſh</hi> Recuſant, or <hi>Feme</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Covert</hi> ſhall be compelled or bound to <hi>abjure by vertue of this Act.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and her wiſe Parliament did not intend or take ſuch Proteſtant Recuſants to be within the meaning of, or puniſhable by the other before mentioned Statutes againſt popiſh Recuſants: For if they had ſo underſtood, they might have puniſhed them ſufficiently on thoſe old Laws without giving themſelves the trouble of making this new Law againſt them <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora. God and the Law do nothing in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be objected, That all thoſe Laws as well as this ought to be conſtrued to one and the ſame end &amp; ſcope, and that all the before mentioned Acts of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and K. <hi>James</hi> are equally to be applied to all Diſſenters from the Eſtabliſht Church of <hi>England:</hi> I anſwer that cannot be; for ſince in this Act no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are concerned, being particularly exempted as aforeſaid: Then it neceſſary follows, if the Popiſh Recuſants ſhall not be puniſhed by this Act made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sectaries and ſeditious Conventiclers, that then the Sectaries and Conventiclers, Proteſtant Diſſenters, that is, Proteſtant Recuſants (for that 'tis they aim at, to colour the laying the other Acts upon them) ſhall not be proſecuted upon thoſe Laws made only againſt Popiſh Recuſants; for if they ſhould, then you leave the Proteſtant Recuſants in a far worſe condition than the Papiſts, the one being provided and not the other.</p>
               <p>But ſtill note, that all that I have ſaid about this Act of the 35. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> comparing it with the others made againſt Popiſh Recuſants, is only to ſhew the nature of the one and the other: For the truth is, this Act of the 35th of <hi>Eliz. is not now in force,</hi>—As appears thus:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:50183:96"/>
1. The very words thereof ſhew it to have been originally but a temporary Act, for the laſt words of it are theſe,—<hi>This Act to continue no longer than to the end of the next Seſſion of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By ſeveral Acts it was continued till the 1ſt year of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then it was enacted, that the ſame ſhould be continued, and remain in Force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the firſt Seſſion of the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond and next Seſſion of Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and holden by Prorogation the 5th of <hi>Nov.</hi> in the 3d year of K. <hi>James,</hi> and ended the 27th of <hi>May</hi> next, and was then prorogued to the 18th, of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1606. In which Seſſion there was no continuance of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſo that there it expired, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ceaſed, and was of no more force than if it had never been, and ſo continued for many years bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In a Parliament held the 21. of K. <hi>James,</hi> ca. 28. It is (amongſt other things) enacted, <hi>'That this</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 35. of</hi> El<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z. <hi>ſhall be adjudged ever ſince the Seſſion in the Seventh Year of His Majeſties Reign of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>to have been of ſuch force and effect, as the ſame were the laſt day of that Seſſion, and from thenceforth to the end of the firſt Seſſion of the next Parliament.</hi>—</q> But the truth is, that the ſaid Statute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> was in <hi>no force,</hi> nor of any effect at the laſt day of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the 7th year of K. <hi>James,</hi> being expired and gone long before, <hi>viz</hi> in the 3. year of that King as aforeſaid. And being ſo down then this Stat. of the 21. <hi>Jacobi</hi> can no way ſet it up again; for this only ſets up what was in force in that Seſſion of the 7th of K. <hi>James,</hi> and no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So likewiſe in the 3. <hi>Caroli primi,</hi> cap. 4. this Act (amongſt others) is mentioned; but how?—<hi>That it ſhall continue to the end of the firſt Seſſion of the next Parliament, in ſuch force and effect as it was the firſt year of</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt,</hi>—when indeed it was then in no force at all.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:50183:97"/>
6. In the 16th <hi>Caroli ſecundi,</hi> cap. 4. an Act was made, Intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent and ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles.</hi> Which begins thus: <q>Whereas an Act made in the <hi>35th</hi> year of the Reign of our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lady Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act to retain the Queens Majeſties Subjects in their due Obedience,</hi> hath not been put in Execution, by reaſon of ſome doubt of late made, whether the ſaid Act be ſtill in force, although it be very clear and evident: And it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declared, that the ſaid Act is ſtill in force, and ought to be put in Execution: For providing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of further and more ſpeedy Remedies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be it enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And the laſt clauſe of this Statute of the 16 <hi>Car. 2di.</hi> runs thus: <q>Provided that this Act continue in force for 3 years after the end of this preſent Seſſion of Parliament, and from thence to the end of the next Seſſion of Parliament, after the ſaid 3 years, and no longer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now how far theſe words—<hi>It is hereby declared that it is in force, and ought to be put in execution;</hi> without ſaying, it <hi>is hereby enacted, that it ſhall be</hi> in force, might operate to give ſome Life and ſtrength to the aforeſaid expired Statute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> I ſhall not determine: But ſuppoſe it were thereby <hi>ſet on foot again,</hi> this laſt Statute is but one <hi>intire</hi> Statute, and that part which declares or inables the Statute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to be in force, is joined and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the reſt, and is altogether but <hi>one Law,</hi> and hath its period at the time before prefixed, and then that declarative part muſt die with the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>that Seſſion</hi> wherein this Statute of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. was made, ended the 16th and 17th of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Then the three Years, for which it was to continue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd, and ended the 20th <hi>Car. 2d.</hi> but after the three years it was to continue till the next Seſſion of Parliament, which <hi>next Seſſion,</hi> after the three years, began 10. <hi>October,</hi> 1667. and by Adjournments was continued to the 24th of <hi>October,</hi> 1670, being the 22d
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50183:97"/>
of <hi>Car.</hi> 2d. and then was the end of that, and with it this Conventicle Act expired, ſo that now there is no pretence of the 35th of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s being in force; for the declarative part in this Conventicle Act can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enforce or give Life to any thing longer than it <hi>lives itſelf:</hi> For if the <hi>Declaring</hi> part of this Act, after it ſelf is extinguiſht, can be read, urg'd or conſtrued as a Law to enforce and enliven another Statute, which hath no being of a Law in it ſelf, then it would neceſſarily follow, that an expired Law is as Authentick as a Law in being, which is abſurd.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, it appears, That as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diſſenters</hi> ought not to be proſecuted on the Laws made againſt Popiſh Recuſants; ſo likewiſe 'tis very evident, That both the Statute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and alſo that of the 16th of <hi>Car. ſecundi,</hi> are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and of no force. And indeed 'tis happy for the Nation that they are ſo; for had theſe two Acts been ſtill in force, being of a <hi>cruel</hi> ſanguinary nature, much miſchief might have accrewed to the people of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>So that there are now <hi>no Laws</hi> in being to puniſh the Conventiclers, and the Nonconformiſt Miniſters, who did not Conform to the Act of Uniformity made in this King's Reign; but the Act commonly called the 5 <hi>Mile</hi> or <hi>Oxford</hi> Act: And the Conventicle Act made the 22th of this King.</p>
               <p>Theſe we ſhall ſeverally conſider.</p>

            <div type="notes_on_document">
               <head>Notes upon the foregoing Act.</head>
               <p n="1">1. By the Title, Preamble and Scope of the Act it appears that the ſame is intended for ſuppreſſing <hi>Seditious</hi> Conventicles under <hi>Pretence</hi> of Religious Worſhip; that is, where the Conventiclers meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under a pretence of Worſhip, not according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but indeed to carry on ill deſigns againſt the State.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any ſuch Conventicle be, the Juſtices know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by the Oaths of <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> may make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thereof, and then the Perſons ſo offending, ſhall forfeit ſo as in the Act you have heard.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt appear upon Oath before the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Confeſſion of the Parties, 1. That it was a <hi>Seditious</hi> Conventicle, met together to diſturb the Peace, under pretence of Religion. 2. That the Worſhip there practiſed, was <hi>not according</hi> to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:50183:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo that the Informers muſt be preſent the whole time of the Meeting: for if they only hear a man Praying or Preaching, that is not contrary to the Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and how does it appear that they did not read the Liturgy? 3. It muſt be proved that there were Aſſembled five Perſons or more, beſides the Inhabitants in the Houſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If a party be Fined above ten Shillings, if he pay down the Money, or it be levied within one Week after ſuch Payment or Levy, <hi>he may Appeal</hi> from the Juſtice Convicting, to the next Quarter-Seſſions, where he ſhall have a Tryal <hi>by Jury</hi> thereupon, and undoubtedly if it do not appear to the ſaid Jury that it was a <hi>Seditious</hi> Meeting, they ought to find for the Appealer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>General</hi> Warrant from any Juſtice or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices to Conſtables, to inquire after, Seize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Conventicles in their Precincts, is not good; it ought to particularize the Houſe and Place, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Places where the Conventicle is, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles are held, and then the Conſtable ought forthwith to goe, and if he finds it ſo, to ſuppreſs it; but otherwiſe the Conſtable might be put to endleſs Vexation in hunting after Meetings to no purpoſe, whereas the Act enjoyns him no ſuch trouble; and if you go once and find no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, you are not obliged to go a <hi>ſecond time</hi> on the ſame Warrant, but ought to have a new one, nor is the Conſtable obliged to turn <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As to <hi>Breaking open</hi> Doors, you ſee the Act directs that it may be done, firſt <hi>only</hi> in an Houſe <hi>where</hi> 'tis Inform'd there is actually a Conventicle as aforeſaid (that is upon the <hi>Oaths</hi> of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.) 2. the Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt there be a <hi>Demand and Denial</hi> to enter: 3. Nor then neither without a <hi>Warrant</hi> from the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50183:105"/>
Juſtice to that purpoſe. If a Conſtable upon a light vain tale, without two perſons Swearing it, that there is at ſuch a Houſe a Meeting, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Warrant ſhall venture to break open the Doors, and there be found no Conventicle, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liable to be Indicted for <hi>Burglary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. There is no power given to break Doors for <hi>Levying</hi> the Penalties, therefore let the Conſtables and Officers be wary what they do in that Caſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſtables would do well to know and aſſert the Dignity of their <hi>Office,</hi> they are not to run up and down like Lacquies after the Capricio's of every Juſtice, and ſpend the Lords day Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hunting after Meetings; if the Juſtices are upon ſufficient Oath Inform'd of a Meeting, and will make out a Warrant ſpecifying where it is, you'l goe, but to ramble about with them from this place to that, you are not obliged; no more are you to ſeize or Impriſon perſons on the verbal Command of any Juſtice, unleſs in viſible Breach of the Peace, but you muſt have a Warrant, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the perſons <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Offence,</hi> before you can lay hold of him, or elſe you may repent it, when ſued another day for falſe Impriſonment.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Since by the Statute of the 29 of <hi>Car. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Cap.</hi> 7. It is Enacted in theſe words, <q>Provided alſo that no Perſon or Perſons upon the Lords day ſhall ſerve or Execute, or cauſe to be ſerved or Executed, any Writ, Proceſs, <hi>Warrant,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Judgment or Decree, (except in caſes of Treaſon, Felony, or Breach of the Peace) but that the ſervice of every ſuch Writ, Proceſs, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be void to all Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoever; and the Perſon or Perſons ſo Serving or Executing the ſame ſhall be as lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſuit of the party grieved, and anſwer Damages to him for doing thereof, as if he or they had done the ſame without any Writ, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,

                  <p>Whereas ſuch has been the goodneſs of God, and the prudent care of our Anceſtors, that to our ineſtimable Happineſs, we are born and live under a mild and Righteous Conſtitution, where all theſe miſchiefs may be prevented, where none can be <hi>Legally</hi> condemned, either by the power of Superior Enemies, or the <hi>raſhneſs</hi> or <hi>Ill will</hi> of any Judge, nor by the bold Affirmations of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Evidence:</hi> For by a fundamental Law in our Government, No mans Life (unleſs it be in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ement, which is a Supream Court, and 'tis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will never do any man wrong) ſhall be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any Crime whatſoever, but upon being

found <hi>Guilty</hi> on two ſeveral <hi>Trials</hi> (for ſo may that of the Grand and Petty Jury be called) and the Judgment of twice Twelve men at leaſt, all of his own Condition and Neighbourhood, and upon their Oaths, <hi>[Coke 3. part of Inſtit.</hi> p. 40.] That is to ſay, <hi>Twelve</hi> or more to find the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, and Twelve others to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the General Iſſue of <hi>Not Guilty:</hi> All which Jurors muſt be honeſt, ſubſtantial, Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial men, and being Neighbours of the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, or place where the ſuppoſed Fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, cannot be preſumed to be unacquainted either with the matters charged, the Priſoners courſe of Life, or the Credit of the Evidence: And all theſe muſt firſt be fully ſatisfied in their Conſciences, that he is <hi>Guilty,</hi> and ſo unanimouſly pronounce him upon their Oaths, or elſe he cannot be condemned. For the Office and Power of theſe Juries is <hi>Judicial:</hi> They only are the Judges, from whoſe ſentence the Indicted are to expect <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death;</hi> upon their Integrity and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Lives of all that are brought into Judgment do ultimately depend; From their <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> there lies no <hi>Appeal:</hi> By finding Guilty or Not Guilty, they do complicately reſolve both Law and Fact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judges</hi> are made by Prerogative, and many times heretofore they have been preferred by <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Miniſters</hi> of State, and may be ſo again in Time to come; and ſuch advanced as would ſerve a preſent Turn, not always thoſe of the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Skill in the Laws: Their places are ſo Honourable and Profitable, and their Tenure ſo Tickliſh, viz. <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> meerly during pleaſure, that they lie under no ſmall Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which perhaps with ſome may be never the leſs unlikely to prevail, for their having generally been wont before to take <hi>Fees;</hi> They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50183:110"/>
in ſo many Cauſes, that they are the oftner ſubject to be tempted, and are ſo few that they may be the eaſier corrupted: They cannot be Challenged, and may be apt to think themſelves above any Action, and thence be encouraged to ſtrain a point now and then. The major part of them agreeing, is enough: they are never ſworn at each particular Trial, nor ever at all but once, and that exceeding generally: I ſay all theſe things may poſſibly ſometimes happen to Biaſs ſome Judges (for I intend not the leaſt Reflection here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by on any of thoſe <hi>Honourable Perſons</hi> who at preſent deſervedly ſupply our ſeats of Juſtice.) But nothing of that kind can reaſonably happen to a <hi>Jury.</hi> For, 1. They are return'd by a ſworn Officer. 2. Muſt be men of a clear Reputation, and competent Eſtate. 3. Being Neighbours, they may know ſomething of the buſineſs on their own knowledge. 4. Their Office is but a trouble, not accompanyed with any great Honour, nor any profit at all. 5. They are all ſolemnly ſworn to each particular Cauſe. 6. The party may challenge 35 in caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and 20 of them in Felony, without ſhewing any cauſe, and as many more as he can aſſign cauſe againſt. 7. Of the Grand Jury Twelve at leaſt muſt joyn in the Verdict, and of the <hi>petty Jury</hi> every man of the Twelve muſt conſent upon his Oath, or elſe 'tis all nothing. And laſtly, if they give a corrupt Verdict between Party and Party, they are liable to an <hi>Attaint.</hi> [But I do not find any Attaint lies in Criminal Cauſes, where the King is a Party.]</p>
                  <p>Now let any man of Sence conſider, whether this method be not more proper for <hi>bolting</hi> out the Truth, for finding out the <hi>Guilty,</hi> and preſerving the <hi>Innocent,</hi> than if the whole deciſion were left to the Examination of a Judge, or two or three, whoſe <hi>Intereſts Paſſion, Haſte,</hi> or <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of

buſineſs may eaſily betray them into Error.</p>

                  <p>The Office of a Grand Jury, or <hi>Grand Inqueſt,</hi> (for by both thoſe Names 'tis promiſcuouſly call'd) is principally concern'd in two things, <hi>Preſentments</hi> and <hi>Indictments,</hi> the difference of which is thus: The <hi>Firſt</hi> is when the Jury themſelves of their <hi>own knowledge</hi> or Inquiry do take notice of ſome Crime, Offence or Nuſance, to the injury of the Publick, which they think fit ſhould be Puniſhed or removed; and in Order thereunto do give the Court notice thereof in Writing briefly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Form, onely the Nature of the thing, and the Perſons Name, and the Place. And this is call'd a <hi>Preſentment,</hi> being the matter whereon to form an Indictment, from which the Preſentment differs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50183:113"/>
in theſe two reſpects. 1. In that is always <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> the Act of the Grand Jury. And, 2. That is not yet drawn up <hi>in Form;</hi> whereas Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are commonly drawn up either by the Order of the Court, or at the Inſtance of ſome Proſecutor, and are brought before, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Grand Jury, and the Witneſſes Sworn attend them, who Examine the ſaid Witneſſes, and as they think fit, Return the Indictments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors'd either <hi>Billa Vera,</hi> [that is a true Bill,] or <hi>Ignoramus, [We are Ignorant]</hi> that is, we do not find the matter, or there does not appear to us ſuch ſufficient Grounds for the Accuſation, that the Perſons Life and Reputation ſhould be brought into queſtion.</p>
                  <p>From whence it appears that the end of their Office is likewiſe two-fold. 1. To inquire after, and give notice of all Crimes, Offences, Nuſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the County for which they Serve, which by reaſon of their Inhabitancy and Eſtates therein they are preſumed to have beſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſcover, and to find Bills againſt Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors where there are good Grounds for the ſame, that ſo they may be brought to Trial if they are forth-coming, or may be proceeded againſt to the Outlawry if they are fled, for their ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. 2. To preſerve the Innocent from the diſgrace and hazards which ill men may deſign to bring them to, out of malice, or through ſuborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other ſiniſter ends; for ſo tender is the Law of the Reputation and Life of a man, that it will not ſuffer the one to be ſullied, by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties holding up his hand at the Barr, and the other endanger'd by a Trial, untill firſt the Matter and Evidence againſt him have been ſcann'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and found by a Grand Jury upon their Oaths againſt him. Therefore you ſee by their Oaths, They are ſworn not only to Inquire, but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50183:113"/>
diligently to inquire, not to be negligent or ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor to take things upon truſt or hurry them over careleſly, but to weigh the Circumſtances and ſift the Witneſſes, and ſearch out the Truth of ſuch Informations as come before them, and to reject the Indictment if it be not ſufficiently proved; and if they have reaſonable Suſpicion of Malice, Subornation or wicked Deſigns againſt any mans Life or Eſtate in ſuch as offer or come to Swear to the Bill of Indictment, they are bound by Law as well as in Conſcience to uſe all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to diſcover the Villany; and if it appear to them (whereof they are the Legal Judges) to be a Conſpiracy or malicious Conſpiracy againſt the Accuſed, they are bound not only to reject ſuch Bill of Indictment, but forthwith to Indict all the Conſpirators with their Aſſociates and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and that this is a main part of the Grand Juries Office, appears not only from Legal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but by an expreſs Statute, <hi>viz. 25 Edw.</hi> 3, 4. and 42 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3, 3. which ſayes, <hi>That for preventing Miſchiefs done by FALSE ACC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SERS, none ſhould be put to anſwer, unleſs it be by Indictment or Preſentment of good and lawful People of the ſame Neighbourhood where ſuch Deeds be done,</hi> that is to ſay, by a Grand Jury.</p>
                  <p>The Grounds upon which Grand Juries are to proceed in giving their Verdicts, are either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From their <hi>own knowledge,</hi> and ſo they may find an Indictment againſt a perſon thô there be <hi>never a Witneſs at all</hi> to it, and a Petty Jury may in like manner find a perſon <hi>Guilty</hi> of a Felony or Murder whereof he ſtands Indicted, thô <hi>no Witneſſes</hi> appear againſt him to prove it, and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the Juries being always of the <hi>Vicinage,</hi> the Law ſuppoſes they may know the matter of their own knowledge, and therefore in all ſuch Caſes when a Jury is charged with a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50183:114"/>
Priſoner, and after the Indictment read, Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fail to appear, the Court always ſpeaks thus to the Jury: <hi>Gentlemen, here is</hi> A. B. <hi>ſtands Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch a Crime, but here's no Witneſſes come againſt him, ſo that unleſs on your own knowledge you know him Guilty, you muſt Acquit him;</hi> and certainly if the Juries knowledge of a mans <hi>Guilt,</hi> is enough to <hi>Condemn</hi> him, I ſee not why their perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Priſoners <hi>Innocency,</hi> or of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Swearing <hi>falſely,</hi> ſhould not be ſufficient to <hi>Acquit</hi> him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other ground upon which the Grand Juries are to Proceed, is <hi>Teſtimony of Witneſſes,</hi> and this is call'd <hi>EVIDENCE,</hi> becauſe it ought to be ſuch as may make the matter clear, manifeſt, plain and <hi>evident</hi> to the Jury; and of this <hi>Evidence</hi> the Jury are the proper and <hi>only</hi> Judges, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought (according to their Oath) <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently Inquire</hi> into the Quality, Repute, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Witneſſes, the likelyhood of what they Depoſe, and whether they do not Swear out of Malice, Subornation, Self-Intereſt, Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ſome ill deſign; which to Diſcover, they will do well to Examine them apart, to note their Variations and Contradictions, to ask them ſudden queſtions, and what queſtions are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, not the <hi>Judges,</hi> but the <hi>Jury</hi> only can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; for they may know how to make uſe of them towards Diſcovery of the Truth, thô the Judge does not, and 'tis <hi>They</hi> are upon their Oaths, not he, 'tis <hi>they</hi> muſt ſatisfy their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Judge has nothing to do to Intermeddle, he is bound by their Verdict: Let Witneſſes be never ſo rampantly poſitive, yet if the Jurors have good and reaſonable grounds not to believe them, they will, they muſt remain as Ignorant to the parties Crime as before: we find this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerted for Law in our Books, as <hi>Stiles</hi>'s
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50183:114"/>
Reports, <hi>L.</hi> 11. thô there be Witneſſes who prove the Bill, yet the Grand Inqueſt is not bound to find it, if they ſee cauſe to the contrary, ſo <hi>Coke L.</hi> 6. The Judges uſe to determine <hi>who</hi> ſhall be Sworn, and what ſhall be produced as Evidence to the Jury, but the Jury are to conſider what Credit or Authority the ſame is worthy of. If a Grand Jury are not Judges of Evidence, they ſignifie nothing. If (as ſome would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us) becauſe People Swear deſperately, thô they do not believe them, they ſhall be bound to find the Bill, then they ſignifie nothing, and are no ſecurity to preſerve Innocency. A lewd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man once reſolv'd to Indict the then Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for a Rape, ſhe Swore it no doubt very heartily, according to this new Doctrine of going according to Evidence, the Jury muſt preſently have found the Bill, the Arch-biſhop muſt have been Committed to Priſon, Suſpended from Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction, his Goods and Chattels through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England</hi> Inventoried by the Sheriffs; would it, think you, in that Caſe have been a good Excuſe for the Grand Jury, to have ſaid, that thô they believ'd in their Conſcience the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ſwore falſe, yet ſhe Swearing it poſitively, they as ſo many Pariſh Clerks were but to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to her Oath of the Fact, and to find <hi>Billa Vera</hi> againſt that eminent Prelate? And if the Jury be Judges of the Credibility of Evidence in this Caſe, and may go contrary to it, why I pray may they not have the ſame Liberty where they find good Cauſe in others?</p>
                  <p>If an Indictment be laid againſt a man for Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal words, ſaid to be utter'd in a Colloquium, or Diſcourſe, thô the Witneſſes roundly Swear all the expreſs words in the Indictment, yet unleſs they will Relate and ſet forth the Subſtance of the <hi>whole talk,</hi> 'tis impoſſible the Jury ſhould Judge
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50183:115"/>
of the matter; for the <hi>foregoing and ſubſequent</hi> words may render Expreſſions that are Innocent and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which taken to halfs, may be rank Treaſon; as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>To affirm the King has no more Right to the Crown of</hi> England <hi>than I have, (which is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jeſuits, of his Majeſty, if once Excommunicated by the Pope) is deteſtable Treaſon:</hi> And two men at ſome diſtance, not well Hearing or Remembring, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly deſigning againſt his Life, ſhould Swear—That he ſaid, <hi>The King had no more Right to the Crown than he had:</hi> Now that the Man did utter theſe very words is true, but if you ask the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the reſt of the Colloquium, they ſhall tell you there was much more Diſcourſe, but they cannot remember it; what ſatisfaction is this to a Jury? or would it not be hard for a Man to be put to hold up his Hand at the Bar under the frightful Charge of Treaſon in this Caſe? Or if a Miniſter in his Sermon ſhould Recite that of the <hi>Pſalms, The Fool hath ſaid in his Heart there is no God:</hi> Jeſuited Evidence now may come and Charge him with Blaſphemy, and Swear that he ſaid, <hi>There was no God:</hi> and ask them what Expreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he uſed, may excuſe themſelves and ſay, 'Tis a great while agoe, we cannot remember a whole Sermon, but this we all poſitively Swear, <hi>He ſaid there was no God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inquiry of a Grand Jury ſhould be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Title, a <hi>Grand Inquiry;</hi> elſe inſtead of ſerving their Countrey, and preſenting real Crimes, they may Oppreſs the Innocent, as in the Caſe of <hi>Samuel Wright</hi> and <hi>John Good,</hi> at a Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> about <hi>December 1681. Good</hi> Indicts <hi>Wright</hi> for Treaſonable words, and Swore the words poſitively; but after a Grand Enquiry, the Grand Jury found that <hi>Wright</hi> only ſpoke the words as of others, thus, <hi>They ſay ſo and ſo—</hi>and concluded with this—<hi>They
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50183:115"/>
are Regnes for ſaying it;</hi> and alſo <hi>Good</hi> at laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>Wright</hi> was his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and Corrected him for Miſdemeanours, and then to be <hi>Reveng'd</hi> he comes and Swears againſt him, which he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he was Inſtigated to by one <hi>Powel;</hi> ſo the Grand Jury finding it to be but Malice, Return'd the Bill <hi>Ignoramus:</hi> whereas if they had not Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd him ſtrictly, they had never diſcover'd the Intreigue, and the Maſter had Cauſeleſly been brought to great Charge, Ignominy and Hazard.</p>
                  <p>The Judicious <hi>Dalton, p.</hi> 539 ſays well, <hi>No leſs care or Concern at all lies on the Grand Jury, than does on the Petty Jury:</hi> People may tell you, <hi>That you ought to find a Bill upon any probable Evidence, for 'tis but matter of Courſe, a Ceremony, a Buſineſs of Form, only an Accuſation, the party is to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another Jury, and there may make his Defence:</hi> But if this were all, to what purpoſe have we <hi>Grand Juries</hi> at all? why are the wiſeſt, beſt men in a County (for ſuch they are or ſhould be) troubled? why are they ſo ſtrictly Sworn? Do not Flatter your ſelves, you of the Grand Jury are as much upon your Oaths as the Petty Jury, and the Life of the man againſt whom the Bill is brought, is in your Hands: The Lord <hi>Cook 3. Iuſtit.</hi> 33. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls the Grand Jury-men all wilfully forſworn and Perjured, if they wrongfully find an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if in ſuch a Caſe the other Jury thro Ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould find the perſon <hi>Guilty</hi> too, you are Guilty of his Blood as well as they: but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he get off there, do you think it nothing to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a man upon your Oaths, of horrid Crimes, your very doing of which puts him, thô never ſo Innocent, to Diſgrace, Trouble, Damage, danger of Life, and makes him liable to Outlawry, Impriſonment, and every thing but Death it ſelf, and that too for ought you know may wrongfully be occaſion'd by it, your raſh Verdict gaining Credit, and giving Authority to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50183:116"/>
another Jury to find him Guilty: for if the Petty Jury find a man Guilty never ſo unjuſtly, the Law ſuffers no Attaint or other Puniſhment to lie againſt them, for this very reaſon, becauſe another Jury, <hi>viz.</hi> the Grand Inqueſt as well as they, have found him Guilty. If a Grand Jary find a Bill wrongfully againſt a perſon, and it prove never ſo much to his damage, he has no Remedy: for being upon their Oaths, the Law will not ſuppoſe any malice. One of the Grand Jury cannot afterwards be of the petty Jury, and why? Becauſe, ſays the Law, he has once already found the party Guilty, and if he ſhould not again, he muſt perjure himſelf. From all which it appears, what a weigh and ſtreſs the Law puts upon the Verdict of a Grand Jury; and 'tis remarkable too, that the Law directs them only to ſay, either, <hi>Billa vera, It is true,</hi> Or, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, We know not;</hi> and never, <hi>That it is not true:</hi> Which ſhews, That if they be doubtfull, or not fully ſatisfied, The Indictment muſt be Endorſed not <hi>Billa Vera,</hi> We know 'tis true, but <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> We doubt it, We do not know it, We are not certain it be true. If they find a Bill where they ought not, they wound their own Conſciences, and do an irreparable damage to the party; but where they do not find the Bill, there is no harm done to any body, for another Indictment may be brought when there is better Evidence.</p>

Do we not ſee in moſt General Iſſues, as upon Not Guilty pleaded in Treſpaſs, breach of the Peace, or Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though it be matter in Law, whether the party be a Treſpaſſer, a breaker of the Peace, or a Felon, yet the Jury do not find the Fact of the Caſe by it ſelf, leaving the Law to the Court, but find the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Guilty or Not Guilty generally; ſo that though they Anſwer not to the Queſtion ſingly, what is Law, yet they determine the Law in all matters where Iſſue is Joined. Is it not every dayes practice,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50183:117"/>
when perſons are Indicted for Murther, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry does not only find them Guilty or Not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but many times upon hearing and weighing of Circumſtances, brings them in either Guilty of the Murder, or elſe only of Man-ſlaughter, <hi>per</hi> miſadventure, or <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> as they ſee Cauſe? Beſides, as Juries have ever been veſted with ſuch Power by Law, ſo to exclude them from, or Diſſeize of the ſame, were utterly to Defeat the End of their Inſtitution. For then if a perſon ſhould be Indicted for doing any Common Innocent Act, if it be but Cloathed and diſguiſed in the Indictment with the name of Treaſon, or ſome other High Crime, and proved by Witneſſes to have been done by him, the Jury though ſatisfied in Conſcience, that the Fact is not any ſuch offence as 'tis called, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (according to this fond Opinion) they have no power to Judge of Law, and the Fact charged is fully proved, they ſhould at this Rate be bound to find him Guilty: And being ſo found, the Judge may pronounce Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for he finds him a Convicted Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his Peers: And ſo Juries ſhould be made meer Properties to do the Drudgery and bear the blame of unreaſonable Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But all this is abſur'd, and abhorr'd by the Wiſdom, Juſtice and Mercy of our Laws.</p>
                  <p>In every Indictment, Information, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are certain words of Courſe, called matter of form, as <hi>Maliciouſly, Seditiouſly, with ſuch and ſuch an Intention,</hi> &amp;c. And theſe ſometimes are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Juſt and reaſonable Implication in Law, and ſometimes are thruſt in meerly to raiſe a pretence or Colour of Crime where there is really none. So that every Jury-man ought well to underſtand this Diſtinction, where the Act or
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50183:117"/>
naked matter of Fact charged, is in it ſelf a Crime or offence againſt Law; as killing of a Man, Levying of War againſt the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there the Law does in pleadings require, and will ſupply thoſe words; and if the Jury do find, and are ſatisfied, That the ſubſtance of the Charge is ſuch a Crime, and the perſon Guilty thereof, they are bound to find it, though no direct proof be made of thoſe Circumſtantials. But where the Act or matter of Fact is in it ſelf Innocent or Indifferent, there the purport of theſe Words (as that it was done <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> or with <hi>ſuch</hi> or <hi>ſuch a deſign)</hi> is neceſſary to be proved: For elſe there is no Crime, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no fit matter to be put to Trial. In which Caſe, the Grand Jury is bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Law to return an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and a Petty Jury <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>

Tis a notable Caſe before the Chief Juſtice <hi>Anderſon</hi> in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> daves. A Man was Arraigned for murder, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was ſo ſtrong that 11. of the Jury were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for finding him Guilty, the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> man refuſed, and kept them ſo long that they were ready to ſtarve, and at laſt made them comply with him, and bring in the Priſoner not Guilty: The Judge, who had ſeveral times admoniſht this Jury-man to join with his Fellows, being ſurprized, ſent for him, diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him privately; to whom upon promiſe of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he at laſt own'd that he himſelf was the man that did the Murder, and the Priſoner was Innocent, and that he was reſolv'd not to adde Perjury and a ſecond Murder to the firſt.—But to ſatisfie you that a Jury is no way puniſhable for going according to their Conſcience, though againſt ſeeming Evidence, and the Reaſons why they are and ought not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd for the ſame, I ſhall here Recite an Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caſe, that of <hi>Buſhel,</hi> in the two and twentieth year of His Majeſty, Reported by the Learned Sir <hi>John Vaughan,</hi> whoſe Book is Licenſed by the preſent Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> and all the Judges then in <hi>England:</hi> the ſaid Caſe begins <hi>fol.</hi> 135. and continues 150. The whole well worth Reading: but I ſhall only Select Certain Paſſages.—</p>
                  <p>The Caſe was this:</p>
                  <p>BUſhel <hi>and others of a Jury having at a Seſſions not found</hi> Pen <hi>and</hi> Mead <hi>(Two Quakers) Guilty of a Treſpaſs, Contempt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Aſſembly and Tumult, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50183:118"/>
they had been Indicted, were fined forty pound a man, and Committed till they ſhould pay it.</hi> Buſhel <hi>brings his</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>and upon the Return it appeared he was Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,—For that contrary to Law, and againſt full and Clear Evidence openly given in Court, and againſt the Directions of the Court in matter of Law, they had Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted the ſaid</hi> W. P. <hi>and</hi> W. M. <hi>to the great Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which upon ſolemn Argument was by the Judges Reſolved, to be an Inſufficient Cauſe of fining and committing them, and they were diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards brought Actions for their Dammage.</hi> The Reaſons of which <hi>Judgment</hi> are reported by Judge <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and amongſt them he Uſeth theſe that follow, which I ſhall give you in his own words.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 140. <hi>One fault in the Return is, That the Jurors are not ſaid to have Acquitted the perſons Indicted, againſt full and manifeſt Evidence,</hi> Corruptly, and Knowing the ſaid Evidence to be full and manifeſt againſt the Perſons Indicted; <hi>For how manifeſt ſoever the Evidence was, if it were not manifeſt to them, and that they Believed it ſuch, it was not</hi> a Finable fault, nor Deſerving Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Difference the Law of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jurors for falſe Verdicts, principally Depends,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Fol. 141. <hi>I would know, whether any thing be more Common, than for two men, Students, Barriſters, or Judges, to deduce Contrary and oppoſite Concluſions out of the ſame Caſe in Law? And is there any Difference that two men ſhould Infer diſtinct Concluſions from the ſame Teſtimony? is any thing more known, than that the ſame Author and place in that Author, is forceably urg'd to maintain contrary Concluſions, and the Deciſion hard which is in the Right? is any thing more frequent in the controverſies of Religion, than to preſs the ſame Texts for Oppoſite Tenets? How then comes it to paſs, that two perſons may not apprehend with Reaſon and Honeſty, what a Witneſs, or many ſay, to prove in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of one plainly one thing, but in the Apprehenſion of the other clearly the contrary thing? muſt therefore one of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:50183:119"/>
Fine and Impriſonment, <hi>becauſe he doth that which he cannot otherwiſe do, preſerving his Oath and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And this is often the Caſe of the Judge and the Jury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Fol. 142. <hi>I conclude therefore, That this Return, charging the Priſoners to have Acquitted</hi> P. <hi>and</hi> M. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt full and manifeſt Evidence firſt, and next without ſaying that they did</hi> know and Believe that Evidence to be full and Manifeſt <hi>againſt the Indicted perſons, is no</hi> Cauſe of Fine and Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>In the Margent of that Fol. 142. it is thus Noted: <hi>Of this Mind were ten Judges of Eleven; the Chief Baron</hi> Turner <hi>gave no Opinion, becauſe not at the Argument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the ſame</hi> fol. 142. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> The Verdict of a Jury, and Evidence of a Witneſs, <hi>are very</hi> Different <hi>things, in the Truth and Falſhood of them: a Witneſs ſwears but to what he hath</hi> heard <hi>or</hi> ſeen <hi>generally, or more largely, to what hath fallen under his Senſes: But a</hi> Jury-man <hi>ſwears to what he can Inferr and conclude from the Teſtimony of ſuch</hi> Witneſſes, <hi>by the Act and force of his</hi> Underſtanding, <hi>to be the Fact Inquired after; which differs nothing in Reaſon, though much in the</hi> Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>from what a Judge, out of Various Caſes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by him, Infers to be the Law in the queſtion before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the meaning of theſe Words,</hi> finding <hi>againſt</hi> the Direction of the Court, <hi>in matter of Law, be, That if the Judge having heard the Evidence given in Court (for he knows no other) ſhall tell the</hi> Jury <hi>upon this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Law is for the Plaintiff, or for the Defendant, and you are under the pain of Fine and Impriſonment to find accordingly; and the Jury ought of duty ſo to do; then every man ſees, that the Jury is but a troubleſome delay, great Charge, and no uſe in determining Right and Wrong; and therefore the Tryals by them may be better Aboliſhed than continued: which were a</hi> ſtrange new found Concluſion, <hi>after a</hi> Tryal ſo Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for many hundred Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is true, if the Jury were to have no other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Fact, but what is Depoſed in Court, the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50183:119"/>
Judge might know their Evidence, and the Fact from it, equally as they, and ſo direct what the Law were in the Caſe; though even then the</hi> Judge <hi>and</hi> Jury <hi>might honeſtly differ in the Reſult from the Evidence, as well as two Judges may, which often happens; but the Evidence which the Jury have of the Fact, is much otherwiſe than that.
