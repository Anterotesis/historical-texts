            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nay further, the Prieſts had divers other advantages for the increaſe of their maintainance, beſides the Super-Tenths, Firſt-Fruits, and Primogenitures, <hi>viz.</hi> all things to be reſtored, when there was known no right Owner, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 8. Alſo they had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115363:3"/>
their ſhare in the ſecond ſort of Tythes (which were to be ſpent in feaſting in <hi>Jeruſalem, Deut.</hi> 14. 23.) And alſo in the third ſort of Tythes which were Triennial, and laid aſide every three years for the <hi>Levite</hi> and the Poor, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 29.</p>
            <p>Now when this moving Church (I mean the Tabernacle) was at laſt fixed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it into a glorious Temple, new Officers of the <hi>Levites</hi> were conſtituted; as Porters, Singers, Treaſurers, with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Progeny of <hi>Aaron</hi> alſo then increaſing, was divided into 24 Ranks, or Orders, and every one to ſerve in courſe, and burn Incenſe, by turns, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23, 24, 25 <hi>Chapters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt, in the fulneſs of time, when our ſecond High Prieſt the Lord Jeſus appeared, (who ſprang from the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and not of <hi>Levi,</hi> and who was made a Prieſt, not after the Law of a Carnal Command, but after the power of au endleſs life; and who diſanulled the Commands going before (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> emphatically expreſſes it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.) He put a full end and period to all the Ceremonies of the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miniſtry, to Circumciſion the Paſsover, all Sacrifices Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yea, and Cuſtomary Laws and Maintainance too, of the old <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſthood, (for ſince the Prieſthood is changed, the Law muſt needs be changed alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12.) Neither did He or his Apoſtles in the leaſt go about to maintain or eſtabliſh Primitials, Tyths, Super-Tenths, Primogenital Redemptions, or any other Levitical ſetled Maintainance or Deodands whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but freely lived of the Free will Offerings and Retribution of the Saints, which had a Community of all things amongſt themſelves: as <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33, 34. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>But a little while, after the Apoſtles themſelves ordain'd that, every man poſſeſſing his own Eſtate, Weekly Offerings for the Saints ſhould be made proportionally as God had bleſſed them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By theſe Examples, Monethly Contributions came in Cuſtom in the Primitive Churches; as may at large be ſeen by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Apologet. Chap.</hi> 39. <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>A while after that, by theſe Examples enlightning the pious Intentions of our Fore-Fathers, Lands began to be given to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115363:3"/>
Church-Treaſury, to be diſpoſed of to pious uſes, as, perſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, Widows, Orphans, and the like. The Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having Food and Rayment (according to the Apoſtle) were to be content therewith, <hi>Concil. Antioch. An.</hi> 340, <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who lived 400 years after Chriſt, ſpeaks not the leaſt of Tythes.</p>
            <p>Their firſt re-introduction, or reſurrection, was about <hi>Anno</hi> 800. or 900. when the Popes and their Councils began to be in power, and began to transform their High Prieſt the Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old Garb and Roabs of <hi>Aaron,</hi> with his Crown, Miter, Surplice, Ephod, Canonical Girdle, Scarlet Robes, Tippet, and the like, juſt as old <hi>Aaron</hi> was apparel'd; to whom, as to <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> alſo, they cry'd up firſt-fruits, Tythes, and ſuch like Jewiſh Contributions, to be due even <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> Nay, and that his Holineſs might want nothing of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Formalities, their Cathedrals, with Altars, Candleſticks, Lavers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fonts, Organs, Choriſters, Porters, Treaſurers, and ſuch like <hi>Nenethims</hi> of our Days, with all the Judaical Ceremonies and Bravery, were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: ſo that they ſeem'd not long ago to act the Jew, better than the Jews themſelves do in their own Synagogues.</p>
            <p>The Pope having got this Spiritual Revenue annexed to his Church and Popedom, as an Eternal Property; He began now to make proportional Subdiviſions in Pariſhes, and reſtrain the payment of Tythes to ſuch and ſuch Parochial Churches, not onely to limit the Charity which before lay in common, but he begun then alſo to introduce his Appropriations, and to entail certain Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Livings to one certain Succeſſion of Spirituall Men; and ſo to uphold his Monaſteries, Priories, Abbies, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and the like. He drew off the Tythes of many large and fruitful Pariſhes, and appropriated them to ſuch and ſuch p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Monaſteries; exempting alſo ſuch Lands, as the Monks held in any place, from being Tytheable to the Incumbents of the ſaid Pariſh. Thus the Templars and Ciſtertian Order and others came to be Tythe free: for He who uſurp'd their firſt Impaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might well ſtretch his power to their Exemption. Nay, ſee how his pretended Holineſs ſtretches his Uſurpation! for having gotten the praedial Tythes, that is the Farm-Tythes, or increaſe of the Earth and Firſt-Fruits into his Clutches: He could not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115363:4"/>
be content with that, but He muſt plead for Perſonal Tythes alſo to be <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> and challenge a Tythe from all mens Callings whatſoever, (whether Mechanical or Theoretical;) as may be ſeen in the <hi>Decretals</hi> of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9th. 123.</p>
            <p>But then though it was generally believ'd, that the Tythe ought to be paid, and that the miſguided zeal of our Forefathers had wrought them into that Creed; yet were they not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſolely to Eccleſiaſtical uſes, but to the relief of widows, Orphans, and the Poor, (as in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Statutes alſo at large doth appear): Nor was any man's charity limited to this or that place, but he might give his Tenths or Lands whither he pleaſed; and that made many of our Abbies in <hi>England</hi> inricht with far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off Gratuities and Donations (as may amply be ſeen in the late <hi>Monaſticon Anglicanum.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th perceiving the Popes Uſurpation, and knowing himſelf to have as much (if not more) right over the Churches Revenue, than his pretended Holineſs had, He wiſely demoliſhes the Abbeys, and impropriated the Popes Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, or ra her re-imburſed the Tenth to the Lay-Nine parts again, from which they were at firſt extra<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed; and ſo the Tenths became Lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>poſſeſſions in <hi>England</hi> again, as well as <hi>Charles Martel</hi> had made them in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have impartially drawn down the Genealogy of Tythes from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> High-Prieſt; and from Him, and His Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical, to theſe our preſent Days.</p>
            <p>Now to make ſome coherent Deductions from all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; I ſhall draw this Concluſion.</p>
            <p>That ſince the Primitive Inſtitution of Tythes was onely Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical, and peculiarly deſigned for that Nation, upon a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Precept; ſince they were paid at the firſt to the <hi>Levites</hi> (who were not to touch the Prieſts Office leſt they dyed) and not to the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> ſince amongſt the Jews themſelves, there was no Civil Law, nor coercive power for the recovery of them; ſince they were not appropriated to the <hi>Levites</hi> onely, but exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the relief of the poor and diſtreſſed Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans; ſince the Judaical Prieſthood was totally changed at the coming of our High Prieſt, and not onely theit Ceremonies,

but all other their Laws, Rites, and Cuſtoms extinguiſh'd and aboliſh'd thereby: Since Tything was no way mention'd, much leſs uſed in the Primitive Churches; ſince it was the Pope only that re-introduced them, and preach'd up the Judaical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and their Decimal Contributions again, and at laſt enforced them upon us (by his Eccleſiaſtical Courts) as a Duty; and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at his pleaſure ſome of his Beloved Orders, with Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the ſame; ſince all our Laws made for the payment of the ſame, have been made by Papiſtical Parliaments, or thoſe Popiſhly, Prelatically, or Presbyterianly affected, or Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelves as parties: and laſtly ſince Tythes are an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more unjuſt, irrational, and unconſcionable in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of ours, (as I ſhall hereafter make appear): certainly all moderate and indifferent perſons, muſt needs be evinced that our Clergy at this day have ſmall Intereſt or Title, much leſs any Divine Right, Claim, or property to them.</p>

            <p n="3">3. That the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had them paid by God's peculiar Commandement by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And <hi>Malachi,</hi> chap. 3.

            <p>
               <hi>Ye Tythe Mint and Cummin</hi> (Luke 10. 7.) ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as a thing he approved of: alſo, 1 <hi>Cor..</hi> 1, 13. With many other ſuch like places in the New Teſtament, which plead for Miniſters maintainance. The Heat of all which Objections, I think I ſhall cool, and allay with theſe mild enſuing Anſwets.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To the firſt I anſwer, that the Tythe that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> (at the famous interview of thoſe two great <hi>Perſonages)</hi> was a Gratuity, and not any accuſtomary Due or Tribute: for I never read that He paid any before, or ever after to him. That was alſo a Tenth onely of the ſpoyls and plunder that he had taken from the <hi>Tetrarchs,</hi> or four Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; and not any Tenths of his own, either perſonal, or real Eſtate: And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> avouches it to be ſo: for the Original words there <hi>(chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Tenth of his ſpoyls, or of the principal and prime goods of the Heap. And the Learned <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> a Jew himſelf, and therefore one who could beſt interpr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t the qua<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity, as well as quantity of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Offering, ſayes, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Tenth of what was gotten by the War, and ſo not any Praedial or perſonal Tythes, or Divine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> it was onely a voluntary and conditional Obligation of his, and not any Cuſtomary Tribute, or neceſſary Duty; for if ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was bound to perform Tything, whether he bad vow'd or no; and whether the Condirion of God's part had been performed yea or no: But ſuppoſe that Tythes were a Sacred Tribute, commanded by God himſelf to be paid by <hi>Jacob:</hi> this proves nothing that they ought to be paid ſince our Saviours appearance. No more do the other Texts of <hi>Malachi,</hi> or any other part of the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As for the Texts of the New Teſtament (as <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. or any other Evangelical Evidence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they neither joyntly nor ſeverally; ſimply, nor compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively prove, that our Saviour nor his Apoſtles, have by any Evangelical Precept, preciſely appointed any ſuch <hi>quantum,</hi> or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115363:5"/>
               <hi>meaſure,</hi> as a tenth portion of our increaſe or profits, to be paid to the Evangelical Miniſtry: All that can be ſqueez'd out of any of the Texts there, is that a proportionate competency, and handſome maintainance may be given to the Goſpel Miniſtry, that ſo the Miniſters of the Goſpel may live of the Goſpel, which we ſhall not with hold from an honeſt, godly, and ſincere Clergy, that they may live as well of their Goſpel, as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Altar did of the Altar.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To thoſe who claim Tythes by an Eccleſiaſtical Right, or Church Property, eſtab<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſht by Popes, General Councils, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Conclaves, and the like, and their Decretals, Conſtitutions, Canons, &amp;c. To theſe I ſhall need to ſay no more, but that the Primitive Church of Chriſt had no ſuch Cu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om amongſt them: Beſides, ſince we have diſcarded the Popes Supremacy, few of the Prelacy, or Presbytery either, will own this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Some (whoſe Wits will needs go a Wool-gathering) will challenge them by a right of Donation, which is as poor a <hi>Plea,</hi> as may be; for what Right hath any King or Ruler (becauſe <hi>Lord Paramount)</hi> to give the Tenth of the Increaſe of my Labours; or, at worſt, by the ſame right that he gave them, why may not his Succeſſor revoke them: and how can a primitive Injury be made good by Succeſſion, or a Traductional Cuſtom validate and make that good, which was injurious and compulſory in its firſt Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Others therefore claim this Revenue by a Civil Right, and Temporal Laws of this Land, made and confirm'd by ſeverall Kings and Parliaments; and by this means, they ſay, they have as good Right and Title to the Tythes, as others to their Free Rents, Lands, and poſſeſſions. To theſe I anſwer, That the Law is the Conſervator, but not the Giver of Right and Property: It gives nothing, but commands a quiet enjoyment of what was before given. Beſides, they are no Tythes if they be called a Temporal or Civil Right; but rather Rent-charges, or Lay-fees: whereas I have demonſtrated before, that they were always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and acknowledged, and received, as Eccleſiaſtical Rights and Dues: But if they be Temporal Rights, I hope none will deny, but if a Temporal power firſt ordained them, a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115363:6"/>
Power may likewiſe diſordain and reverſe them. I ſhall therefore conclude all with theſe few Queries, which I ſhall leave to the Deciſion of every indifferent and unprejudic'd Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If theſe Spiritual Rents or Tythes muſt continue, ſhould they not I pray you be paid, according to their Primitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and to the end for which they were firſt commanded, that is for the uſe of ſtrangers, Fatherleſs and Widows, and to the Officers, over Cathedrals, Churches, and Chappels, which are the <hi>Koathites, Goerſhonites,</hi> and <hi>Mararites</hi> of our days; and not to any Prieſt or Parſon at all, who are onely to receive a <hi>Super-Tenth</hi> from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Entail of this Church-Inheritance cannot be cut off by Man (but by God onely) why ſhould not the Firſt Fruits alſo be paid to the Miniſtery, which of old was <hi>Aarons</hi> ſole properly, and his Succeſſors peculiar Inheritance? And why, I pray you, ſhould theſe firſt-fruits be now reduced to a certain and determinate value, which before was appointed as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Retribution, and in what meaſure and quantity the Owner pleaſed to give to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Prieſthood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Tythe (according to all the Levitical Formalities and Rites) muſt be paid; why ſhould not the ſecond and third, as well as the firſt Tythes be paid to them, with all other Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal and Official Fees; as Redemptions, Fifths, Deodands, and the like: Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why ſhould not their Cities, and fair Suburbs be aſſigned and ſet out apart for them, as was of Old? <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 5. and then farewel Nobility and Gentry: we ſhould all be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on preſently by the ſurmounting Clergy. For, What a vaſt Revenue would even the Redemptions of our Firſt-Born be, in ſuch a populous Nation as ours is? (eſpecially if both Poor and Rich ſhould pay alike, as of Old they did)? And all this would but run in as one ſtream into the Church-Corban, or Treaſury, which none might pick the Lock of, but St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keyes; (that is, the Clergy themſelves to make uſe of all their pleaſure) which I am afraid would employ it to little better ends, than the old <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Prieſts did their Co<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Judas</hi> his Recantation and Reſtitution of them, why ſhould it be diſputed, Whether they ſhould be returned and repayed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again or no?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Tythes muſt continue, why ſhould not that branch, or part of them, that has lain ſo long under alienation from <hi>H.</hi> 8. till this day, be reſtored, and a re-appropriation made of all the Impropriations whatſoever? nay, and all the Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of Cathredrals, Abbyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monaſteries, Nunneries, Covents, and the like, be reſtored to the <hi>Primitive Uſes</hi> again, and all the <hi>Popiſh Exemptions</hi> themſelves be exempted: and then if all Tythes were paid in kind, and by all men whatſoever; and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all <hi>Alienations</hi> whatſoever, inſtead of having a <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould have all <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Tenth of every mans Increaſe ſhould be given to theſe men of God, why ſhould it be of the praedial Tythes, or viſible Increaſe onely; and ſo the poor Husbandman (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all Lands leſs fruitful than that of <hi>Canaan)</hi> be the deepeſt pay-maſter; is it not meet, that in great Cities and places of Commerce and Trade (where Lands are the leaſt part of their ſubſiſtency; and where the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Sixthly, and laſtly, Whether the <hi>Moſaical Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and the payment of them by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (after their ſettlement in the Land of <hi>Canaan)</hi> was not a more equal way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than it can be in our Land of <hi>England;</hi> Theirs being a Land which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounded with Corn, Wine, Milk, and Honey, and a compleat affluence of all things; and ſo was no great charge and trouble to the Countrey Farmers, or Occupyers of Land there: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours, for the greateſt part of all <hi>England,</hi> being ſo wild, barren, and naturally unfertele, that the Tythe of many a mans Increaſe, is more then the Rent of all his Lands: Nay, and many mans pains, charges, and expences, in manuring, liming, plowing, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Renting of his Grounds, above the one moiety of his whole years Increaſe and profit: And is it not Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yea both, that if I pay a Tenth of my Increaſe to the Parſon, He ſhould re-pay or deduct a Tenth of all my neceſſary Charges and Expences whatſoever disburſed, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that Increaſe?</p>
