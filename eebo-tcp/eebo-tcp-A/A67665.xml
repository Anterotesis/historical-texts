            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>ALL you that Married Men and Women be</l>
               <l>Give Ear unto this woful Tragedy,</l>
               <l>That now befell a <hi>French man</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who liv'd together in continual Strife;</l>
               <l>One <hi>Denis Hobry</hi> about Four years ſince</l>
               <l>Took to his Wife a Woman Born a <hi>French,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whom he Abus'd at ſuch inhumane rate,</l>
               <l>That ſhe a thouſand times wiſh'd him ill Fate,</l>
               <l>And thought within herſelf to end the Strife,</l>
               <l>If ſhe were forc'd, to take away his Life:</l>
               <l>The cauſe that mov'd him to thoſe Tyrannies,</l>
               <l>Was her averſion to his Villanies;</l>
               <l>At length into a private Room ſhe fled,</l>
               <l>Intending never to Embrace his Bed,</l>
               <l>Where ſhe remain'd four Months, and then by chance</l>
               <l>Her Husband went beyond the Seas to <hi>France</hi>;</l>
               <l>But when return'd, he Courted her again,</l>
               <l>Tho firſt he feared it was all in vain.</l>
               <l>He ſwore a thouſand times to pleaſe her Mind,</l>
               <l>And prove a Husband, faithful, chaſte, and kind.</l>
               <l>His Words prevail'd ſo much, that ſhe did yield,</l>
               <l>Upon theſe Terms, to give him up the Field,</l>
               <l>That he would firſt confeſs before a Prieſt</l>
               <l>And two Witneſſes more, as he own'd Chriſt</l>
               <l>To be his God, ſhe was his lawful Wife,</l>
               <l>And would no more vex her during his Life.</l>
               <l>Father <hi>Gaſper</hi> wrote this every Word,</l>
               <l>Who placed it afterwards upon Record.</l>
               <l>But ſcarce two days, or three at moſt, were paſt,</l>
               <l>When he on her the old Reproaches, caſt.</l>
               <l>In two months time he went to <hi>France</hi> again.</l>
               <l>And gave the Woman juſt cauſe to complain;</l>
               <l>For, nothing that he could come at or find,</l>
               <l>But he brought with him, and left none behind.</l>
               <l>When three months paſſed he returned home,</l>
               <l>And with diſſembling Words to her did come;</l>
               <l>Whom ſhe receiv'd, expecting his good Will,</l>
               <l>But ſoon found him to be the ſame Man ſtill.</l>
               <l>She often beg'd of him, with weeping eyes,</l>
               <l>A Separation, or that otherwiſe</l>
               <l>He would be civil; who gave this Reply,</l>
               <l>He would her ruine; which caus'd her to cry,</l>
               <l>And think to take his Life, or loſe her own,</l>
               <l>Which ſhe did often tell him in her moan.</l>
               <l>Long ſhe endur'd, at laſt ſhe told her Caſe</l>
               <l>To Neighbours that dwelt near about the place,</l>
               <l>And ſaid, ſhe fear'd Miſchief would be the end</l>
               <l>Of his ill Actions, or he ſoon would mend.</l>
               <l>Three months being paſs'd, one time ſhe took a Knife,</l>
               <l>With an intent to take away his life:</l>
               <l>But God did then bellow on her his grace,</l>
               <l>Which made her give her Husband longer ſpace.</l>
               <l>So twice ſhe did intend upon her Bed</l>
               <l>To ſtab her Husband, and to leave him dead:</l>
               <l>And to Himſelf ſhe did declare her mind,</l>
               <l>Who dared her in a moſt fooliſh, kind.</l>
               <l>Now he was going from her into <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſhe told him, If that it were his chance</l>
               <l>E're to come back, and follow the old Rule,</l>
               <l>She muſt become unto him ſomething cruel:</l>
               <l>Who promis'd her moſt earneſtly, and ſwore</l>
               <l>He never would abuſe her as before.</l>
               <l>In three weeks after he return'd again</l>
               <l>Unto his Wife, who did him entertain;</l>
               <l>And ſaid, dear <hi>Hobry,</hi> welcome thou to me</l>
               <l>So that you henceforth a good Husband be.</l>
               <l>I will, ſaid he, taking a thouſand Oaths,</l>
               <l>If you'll me furniſh preſently with Cloaths.</l>
               <l>She anſwered Him, The Times were very dear,</l>
               <l>And hardly ſhe her honeſt Debts could clear.</l>
               <l>He hearing her, moſt wickedly did curſe,</l>
               <l>And ſwear he would to her be ten times worſe</l>
               <l>Than e're he was; who then this Anſwer had</l>
               <l>From her, That he already made her mad,</l>
               <l>For that it was moſt commonly his way</l>
               <l>When he did want, to threaten night and day,</l>
               <l>If ſhe could not him furniſh, no Excuſe</l>
               <l>Could get place with him, but ſtill her abuſe.</l>
               <l>One <hi>Yard</hi> to her did openly declare,</l>
               <l>That for her Ruine her Husband did prepare.</l>
               <l>Thus they continued in the ſame degree.</l>
               <l>To th' Twenty Seventh of laſt <hi>January</hi>;</l>
               <l>When ſhe, about Ten of the Clock at night</l>
               <l>Took her Repoſe, bearing no kind of Spight</l>
               <l>Or Malice to her Husband, as before,</l>
               <l>But open, for his Coming, left the door;</l>
               <l>Who came at Five a Clock next Morning home.</l>
               <l>And did in Rage and Gholer fret and fome,</l>
               <l>And to his Wife, as dead as in a grave</l>
               <l>(With Sleep,) a blow upon the Stomach gave,</l>
               <l>Which made her ſtart; What, you are drunk (ſaid he,)</l>
               <l>If I am not, 'tis like you are, quoth ſhe:</l>
               <l>He anſwer'd I with Rogues all night did ſit,</l>
               <l>Which made me mad, and you muſt pay for it;</l>
               <l>Whereupon he gave her another Blow</l>
               <l>Upon the Breaſt, which did renew her Woe:</l>
               <l>To weeping ſhe immediately did fall,</l>
               <l>And he then took her in his Arms with all</l>
               <l>His force, till he did ſtop her Vital Breath,</l>
               <l>So that ſhe wiſhed for a ſudden Death:</l>
               <l>He forc'd on her ſuch barbarous Violence</l>
               <l>In ſpight of what ſhe did in her Defence;</l>
               <l>Forcing much Blood from her, ſhe cried out</l>
               <l>To her Land-lady, who did not hear the Shout:</l>
               <l>Unto the Neighbours I'll (ſaid ſhe) complain;</l>
               <l>Wherewith he threw her on the Bed again,</l>
               <l>And bit her like a Dog kept in a yard.</l>
               <l>Shall this ſaid ſhe, be always my Reward?</l>
               <l>Yea, anſwer'd he, be ſure thyſelf to keep</l>
               <l>Well, and with that he fell in a dead Sleep;</l>
               <l>Which ſhe beholding, and feeling the ſmart</l>
               <l>Of his ill uſage to her; in her Heart,</l>
               <l>What ſhall I do, (ſaid ſhe) muſt I, now Die?</l>
               <l>Or Murther him that makes me, thus to Cry?</l>
               <l>With that ſhe ſtarted full of Wrath and Evil,</l>
               <l>Being thereto Spurr'd by th' inſtinct of the Devil,</l>
               <l>And pull'd his Garter off his Leg in haſt,</l>
               <l>Being a Pack-thread, which ſhe thought no waſt,</l>
               <l>And doubling it about his Neck ſhe drew</l>
               <l>The ends ſo feſt, that ſhe him quickly Slew;</l>
               <l>But ſoon Repenting, hop'd he was Alive,</l>
               <l>And thought that Brandy would him then Revive:</l>
               <l>When all was done, her labour was in Vain,</l>
               <l>For Life once loſt, can ne'er be had again.</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Monday</hi> following the Corps was there,</l>
               <l>For ſhe could not convey it any where</l>
               <l>Untill ſhe brought her Son out of the <hi>Strand</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who durſt not ſpeak againſt her <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Command:</l>
               <l>When he beheld the Corps lye at this rate,</l>
               <l>He did bemoan his Mothers wretched Fate:</l>
               <l>What will you do? you muſt (ſaid he) now Die,</l>
               <l>Or out of <hi>England</hi> you muſt quickly Flie:</l>
               <l>She told him Money ſhe had none in hand</l>
               <l>That would buy Paſſage to another Land;</l>
               <l>My way ſaid ſhe is to Cut off his Head,</l>
               <l>His Thighs and Arms, now that he is Dead,</l>
               <l>And none can tell what Country man he's then,</l>
               <l>Though he were found by the moſt wiſe of Men.</l>
               <l>At Four or Five paſt Noon, this Curſed Wife</l>
               <l>Cut off her Husband's Head with a ſharp Knife:</l>
               <l>His Arms and Thighs came off, his Legs again,</l>
               <l>And though his Neck did Bleed, he felt no Pain.</l>
               <l>At Eight a Clock this Night through <hi>Caſtle-ſtreet</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Drury-lane</hi> ſhe went, and none did meet,</l>
               <l>Until at <hi>Parkers lane</hi> to pleaſe her will</l>
               <l>She laid the Corps near by a naſty Dung-hill:</l>
               <l>She did in Linnen next the Thighs convey</l>
               <l>Into a Privy that's in the Savoy,</l>
               <l>Where ſhe again the Arms and Legs did caſt,</l>
               <l>Nothing remaining but the Head at laſt;</l>
               <l>She then adviſed with her Son to know</l>
               <l>Where they might cloſely put the Head alſo;</l>
               <l>Who ſaid the Water was for it the Place,</l>
               <l>But ſhe then fear'd ſome Man might know his Face;</l>
               <l>And ſhe at laſt reſolved to this end.</l>
               <l>To throw't into the Privy of her Friend,</l>
               <l>A Fringe-maker, that lives by the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For they do ſtill two Privies there imploy.</l>
               <l>The Corps being found, and all the truth well known.</l>
               <l>She did her ſelf no word of it diſown;</l>
               <l>But did confeſs that no untruth is here,</l>
               <l>For God will not let Murtherers go clear.</l>
               <l>She is now Burn'd, and beggs of all Mankind</l>
               <l>And Women too, Wiſdom by her to find.</l>
