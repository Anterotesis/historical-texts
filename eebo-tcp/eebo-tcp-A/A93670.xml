            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

clearly, evidently and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
(by reaſon or authority) or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153615:5"/>
and condemne as erroneous, that
which all the viſible Churches in the

            <p n="10">10. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing Proteſtants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that the Roman Church is infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with errours in Faith, which they
pretend to have purged in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
I demand that it be evidenced,
when any of theſe pretended errours
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153615:5"/>
begun to be publickly taught &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of ſome approved Authours of
any age, who affirm, that the publick
profeſſion of the ſaid errours <hi>begun
in or about their time.</hi> For ſeeing they
were publickly practiſed through all
Chriſtendom, if that publick practiſe
had ever begun in any age ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
it muſt have been taken notice
of: whereby their inſtances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in the Lungs, of a beard
growing white, &amp;c. are ſhewed to be
nothing to the purpoſe; becauſe they
are either wholly ſecret, or inſenſible,
and no way publick and notorious, as
theſe were. And ſeeing Faith by S.
<hi>Paul. Epheſ. 4. v.</hi> 1. 2. is ſaid to be <hi>one,</hi>
and reckoned up with the unity of
God and Chriſt, and ſo muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
<hi>one,</hi> how Proteſtants, and thoſe
of the Roman Church can properly
be ſaid to have <hi>one</hi> Faith, when the
the one believes, what the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes?
And as opinions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
one another cannot be ſaid to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153615:6"/>
be one opinion, how can Faiths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
one another be ſaid to be
one Faith? neither is it enough to ſay,
that they are <hi>one</hi> in that wherein they
agree, for ſo they will be <hi>one</hi> only in
part, or partially, and not abſolutely
and entirely: and as the leaſt difference
deſtroyes the perfect unitie of God &amp;
Chriſt, ſo will it do that of faith; and
though my opinion agree with that of
another in many things, but diſagrees
in many others from his, we can never
be ſaid abſolutely (as it muſt be in
faith) to be of the ſame, or one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="11">Queſt. 11. Whither it be not a great
argument, to induce any rationall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
man, to judge that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Authours are put to great
Straits, and to deſperate acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
when being aſhamed of
the firſt refuge of their beginners, in
flying for the defence of their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to an inviſible Church; and no
leſs of the ſecond, in alleadging for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153615:6"/>
their predeceſſours and continuance
of the viſibilitie of their Church, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius,</hi>
the Waldenſes, Albigenſes,
Wicleffeſts, Huſſites, and other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly
condemned hereticks, they
confeſs, that they have <hi>now</hi> no other
means to ſave their viſible ſucceſſion,
but by acknowledging, that they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other
Churches joyning with her againſt
them in all the points of difference
betwixt them, and her; and ſo are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to acknowledge her, and all
thoſe who are united to her, to be true
Churches of Chriſt, and conſequently
to hold no fundamentall errour at all;
&amp; conſequent to this, to acknowledge,
that their firſt Authours &amp; Churches,
both in <hi>England</hi> and other countries,
wronged the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and
thoſe others inſufferably, firſt, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
them of Superſtition, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
Antichriſtianiſme, &amp;c. which are
fundamentall errours in Religion, and
deſtructive of Salvation. Secondly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153615:7"/>
upon this pretext in deſtroying, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and alienating to ſecular uſes ſo
many thouſands of their Churches,
Monaſteries, Towns, Citties, Caſtles,
Villages. Thirdly in maſſacring and
putting to cruell torments and death,
ſo many Prieſts and Profeſſours of
the Roman religion. Fourthly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
their Biſhops and Clergie-men
of their reſpective Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
dignities, Seas, Benefices and
Churches, and ſetting up others, they
yet living, in their places. Fifthly in
making it no leſs then high Treaſon,
(which is yet in force) either to be
Prieſts, or to communicate with them
in many ſpirituall Church offices and
Sacraments. Sixthly in continuing to
this day, in a violent detaining of their
Churches, benefices, dignities, and
ſpirituall functions, from all thoſe of
the Roman Profeſſion, and holding
them in their own hands; and all this,
becauſe they maintain certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
errours, which they now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153615:7"/>
not to be fundamentall, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of Salvation; &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that thoſe of the Roman Church
have ſuffered, and ſtill ſuffer all theſe
intollerable injuries, for that which
even theſe modern Authors acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be no more then a veniall or
ſmall ſin: for if it were mortall, it
would deſtroy Salvation, ſo long as
one willfully continues in it; which
they affirm, it does not.</p>
            <p>Further by this acknowledgement,
theſe modern Proteſtant Authours
muſt confeſs, that their former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who were of a contrarie mind,
in charging the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and
the reſt with her, of ſuperſtition, and
Idolatrie, &amp;c. and all thoſe, who then
joyned with them, and all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Churches and Proteſters, both
without and within <hi>England,</hi> who at
this day hold it as a point of their
faith, to accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
in the ſame manner, erre damnably
againſt Chriſtian Truth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153615:8"/>
are no true Churches of
Chriſt. For it cannot be leſſe then a
damnable errour to make it a point of
their faith, and religion, to condemne
any one, much more all the viſible
Churches of the Weſt, nay and of the
Eaſt too, and ſo of whole Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for nine hundred years together,
of grievous ſuperſtition, when upon
better examination, the Doctours of
the ſame Proteſtant Church are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by force of Truth to confeſs,
that thoſe Churches neither are, nor
ever were guilty of any of thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid

Proteſtant diſtinction of errours in
faith, fundamentall and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
I demand firſt, what they
underſtand by fundamentall errours?
for if they mean any nicetie in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or Theologicall diſcourſe, it
belongs not to the knowledge of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153615:10"/>
unlearned: either the refore they muſt
underſtand by a fundamentall errour,
ſuch an errour in faith, as deſtroyes
ſalvation howſoever that comes to
paſs, or they ſay nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe. This therefore ſuppoſed
to be their meaning, I demand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
a Catalogue, &amp; preciſe number
of the fundamentall errours in faith,
that is, how many, &amp; which are thoſe
errours in faith, which deſtroy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
for what helps it a Chriſtian to
know, that there are ſuch deſtructive
and damnable errours, unleſs he know
whether he hold any ſuch errour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or no? And how can he ever be
certain of that, ſo long as he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
which are fundamentall errours,
which not? If this Catalogue be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
I demand at leaſt ſome evident
means, or marks, to diſtinguiſh er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in faith, deſtructive of ſalvation
or damnable, from others conſiſtent
with ſalvation, or veniall: which is
neither to deny any of the Articles
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153615:11"/>
contained in the three Creeds (as
ſome Proteſtants have thought;) for
one of them puts the Proceſſion of the
Holy Ghoſt from the Father <hi>and the
Son,</hi> the deniall of which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do, nor can hold to be a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
errour, unleſs they affirm the
Grecian Church to erre fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
&amp; ſo denie it to be a true Church
of Chriſt; which were quite againſt
the ſaid Proteſtants, ſeeing they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the contrarie. Nor is the Creed
of the Apoſtles alone a ſufficient rule
to determine fully, which are funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points, which not; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſome things in it, which
(by reaſon of the lightneſs of the
matter they contain,) come not by
far ſo near the radicall and primarie
miſteries of Chriſtian faith, as do
many points controverted betwixt
Proteſtants and thoſe of the Roman
Church, and therefore cannot with
any ſhew of truth be termed funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
by Proteſtants, ſuch as are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153615:11"/>
the circumſtances of time &amp; perſons,
as that our Saviour ſuffered <hi>under
Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>no other judge,</hi>
that hee roſe <hi>the Third,</hi> and <hi>no other
day,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe ſome points, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to the ſubſiſtence of Chriſtian
faith according to Proteſtants, are not
expreſly defined in that Creed; as that
the Holy Scriptures are the divine
word of God, which is the preciſe
number of the Books of Canonicall
Scripture; whither, there is any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word of God, or no; or any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c. ſo that a Chriſtian finds
not all fundamentall points of faith
ſet down expreſly in the Apoſtles
Creed. Neither is the Scripture a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
rule to know which are, which
are not fundamentall points. For there
are a thouſand, nay a million of Truths
expreſſed in Scriptures, which touch
not immediately the foundation of
faith, as Proteſtants term it; and no
ſmall number of points, according to
them, fundamentall, which are not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153615:12"/>
expreſſed in Scripture, as the number
of Canonicall Books, the entire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
puritie of the originall, in any
copie, or copies, which is come to the
hands of Proteſtants, &amp;c. which in
their principles are ſuch points of
faith, that true faith, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſalvation, cannot be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. For if ſole Scripture, (as
they affirme) be the rule of faith, and
all that is in Scripture is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and nothing to be believed, but
what is in Scripture, or evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from it, ſeeing faith is neceſſarie
to ſalvation, the determinate belief of
all that is true Scripture, from which
only (they ſay) the true points of
faith are drawn, muſt be neceſſarie to
ſalvation, and ſo a fundamentall point
of faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I demand, how any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
can affirm, that the denyall of
any point of faith whatſoever, being
ſufficiently propounded as ſuch, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with ſalvation, ſeeing all ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153615:12"/>
denyalls, or disbeliefs, include this
damnable malice, of attributing falſity
to that which is revealed by God
himſelf, as all points of faith are, how
ſmall ſo ever the matter be, which is
revealed in them; which appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in this example.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that this ſentence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Tertiâ die reſurget,</hi> he ſhall riſe

our Saviour ſhould riſe again, (which
Proteſtants grant to be a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

ſuppoſe that ſome Chriſtian, to whom
this whole ſentence of Scripture is
ſufficiently propounded, ſhould firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe the ſubſtance, or myſterie
of the reſurrection, becauſe he eſteems
it to be a fundamentall point, but

ſeeing both the one and the other is

in that ſentence of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
whither he that diſbelieves that
the reſurrection happened upon the

be ſaved?</p>
            <p n="16">Queſt. 16. I demand farther, that

that errour muſt either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from ignorance &amp; want of light,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153615:15"/>

a Harlot &amp; abominable willfull
deceiver of the world, and a ſeducer
of Nations in teaching, contrarie
to the known truth: not the firſt, for
if ſhe could erre out of ignorance, to
what purpoſe do Proteſtants appeal
to her determination in a lawfull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

in difference betwixt them and thoſe
of the Roman Church, ſeeing ſhe may
through ignorance erre in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of them, as being not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
according to them.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be ſaid, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the whole viſible
Churches fallibility in points not
fundamentall, nay though it ſhould
actually erre, and that errour ſhould be
evidently diſcovered, yet even thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153615:16"/>
who had thus evidently diſcovered
the ſaid errours, were to conform
themſelves to thoſe erroneous defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a generall Councell. For if
this conformity be underſtood of an
internall conformity in judgement, it
is wholly impoſſible, ſeeing that were
to judge the ſame thing to be true, and
not true, at the ſame time, and to judge
againſt an evident knowledge: and if it
be underſtood of an externall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and profeſſion only, it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
impious and high hipocriſie,
in reſiſting the known truth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
to believe that as a divine
Truth revealed by Almighty God,
which they evidently know to be a
moſt falſe errour in faith. Secondly,
if one were to ſubſcribe &amp; externally
to conform himſelf to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of lawfull generall Councells,
which one perſwades himſelf, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
knows to be erroneous, till an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Councell be aſſembled to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them, why did not Proteſtants
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153615:16"/>
afford this externall conformity to the
definitions of the Generall Councell
of Florence, of Lateran, and to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Councell of Nice, (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
till ſome other lawfull generall
Councell came to correct their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
errours, they having no other
reaſon to reject the authority of the
ſaid Councells, then that they define
many things againſt the Proteſtant
doctrine. Thirdly, ſeeing it was never
yet ſeen, nor can be ever made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that any lawfull generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
revoked any definition in matter
of faith, of any former lawfull gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councell, what hope is there,
that they ſhall now begin to do, what
was never done before them? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if it were ſuppoſed, that any ſuch
revocatorie definition ſhould iſſue
from them, that party, whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſhould be condemned by ſuch
revocations, would accuſe that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of errour, as much as the contrary
party accuſed the former Councell of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153615:17"/>
errour in defining againſt them; and
ſo the controverſie would remain as
indetermined as it was before: neither
would it be poſſible ever to determine
it fully by a generall Councell: for the
party condemned would ſtill expect
another Councell to revoke that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition;
which ſeems to him evidently
erroneous; and ſo there would be no
end of new determinations and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet further, ſeeing lawfull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councells do not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
even under pain of Anathema, or
being accurſed and excommunicated,
all Chriſtians to believe and profeſs
the doctrine which they teach them,
not only to be true and free from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
but to be divine Truth, revealed
by God himſelf; if they ſhould erre in
any ſuch definition, they muſt make
God the Authour of errour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
which quite deſtroyes the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of God, and conſequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the main and primary founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153615:17"/>
of Chriſtian faith, and therefore
muſt neceſſarily be held to include a
fundamentall errour: ſo impoſſible
and implicatorie a thing it is, for them
to erre in matter of faith, and not to
erre fundamentally. For either that
erring Councell muſt define ſome
poſitive errour, or that which God
never revealed, to be revealed from
God, or that ſome true revelation of
God is an errour; both which contain
no leſs malice then this, <hi>to make God a
lyar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">Queſt. 21. Seeing S. <hi>Paul, Epheſ. 4.
v.</hi> 14. affirms, that our Saviour had
appointed Paſtours and Teachers, till
the day of judgement, as a means to
preſerve Chriſtian people from being
carried about with every wind of
doctrine, theſe words <hi>every wind of
doctrine</hi> cannot be underſtood disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively;
for then if thoſe Paſtours
preſerved them from being ſeduced
in one only point of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
it would not be true, that they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153615:18"/>
preſerved them from being carried
about with <hi>every wind</hi> of doctrine; but
they muſt be underſtood conjunctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, that they preſerve them
from being carried away <hi>with any
wind</hi> of doctrine whatſoever, which
ſhould chance to be buzzed into their
ears by falſe Teachers. Now ſeeing
ſuch winds of erroneous doctrine are
raiſed as well in points, which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
account not fundamentall as in
fundamentalls, the meaning of the
Apoſtle muſt be, that by means of
thoſe Paſtours Chriſtians be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

been inſtituted by our Saviour only to
found his myſticall Body the Church,
but not to build it up, and to ground,
or initiate the Saints, but not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
them.</p>
            <p n="22">Queſt. 22. If it ſhould be anſwered,
that theſe and ſuch like promiſes, or
inſtitutions of Chriſt, are only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
that is truly intended on his
part, but yet may be fruſtrated by the
malice of ſuch as corrreſpond not to
his intention; and therefore, though
he intended, that theſe Paſtours ſhould
performe the ſaid offices in the
Church, yet that it involved this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
if they were not wanting on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153615:19"/>
their parts, but by their failing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Chriſt is made fruſtrate
and of no effect.</p>
            <p>I anſwer to this prophane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
objection, firſt, that if Chriſts
promiſes and inſtitutions be thus inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
and conditionall, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the promiſes, that
Chriſt hath made for the preſervation
of his Church, yet by the malice of
Chriſtians, or others, the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church may utterly faile and
come to nothing; Secondly that it
may erre even in fundamentall points
(contrarie to the doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants)
and ſo become a Synagogue of
Satan. Thirdly, that the ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
of the coming of the Meſſias, of
the redemption of mankind, of the
ſaving of ſome at the laſt judgement,
&amp;c. have no abſolute certainty in
them, and ſo by the malice of men
might have been, or may be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.
Fourthly, that by this there is
no certain credit to be given to any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153615:19"/>
promiſe, or inſtitution of God or
Chriſt, in the whole old or new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
For a thouſand different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
may be invented, which not
being performed, or put, the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fails: thus one may ſay, (upon the
like grounds) that as the promiſes of
benefits, or bleſſings, might be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the malice and demerits of
wicked perſons, ſo the Threats and
Thundrings of puniſhments upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
may be hindred by the vertues
and good works of Saints: and becauſe
we have no rule to know, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of goodneſs or malice is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to fruſtrate ſuch predictions,
we remain wholly uncertain, whither
they ſhall be abſolutely verified, or
no, unleſs therefore this principle be
ſetled, that all divine inſtitutions and
predictions, are to be held abſolute,
and never to be fruſtrated, whenſoever
it is not evidently apparent, that they
are conditionall, and may be hindred,
there can be no certainty, that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153615:20"/>
or prediction in the whole
Scripture ſhall be abſolutely fullfilled.
Seeing therefore it is not evident, that
this inſtitution <hi>Epheſians</hi> the 4. &amp;c. and
others of the ſame nature concerning
the Church, are conditionall, they are
to be ſuppoſed to be abſolute, and not
to be fruſtrated by any malice of men
whatſoever. Fifthly, no Proteſtant,
who holds the whole viſible Church
cannot periſh, nor all her Paſtours
prove willfull Seducers, can apply
this anſwer to the Text now cited, viz.
<hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. &amp;c. for if it be hindred
by the malice of the ſaid Paſtours,
they muſt with joint conſent mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
and wittingly teach falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be the doctrine of Chriſt,
which were to teach fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and to fall of from Chriſt. If
this ſolution may paſs for current,
who can be certainly aſſured, that
there is any true Church of Chriſt,
viſible or inviſible, exiſtent now in the
world: for all the promiſes, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153615:20"/>
the continuance of it to the worlds
end, may be as well ſaid to be as well
conditionall &amp; fruſtrable by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of men, as this <hi>Epheſians</hi> the 4. &amp;c.
and who knows, that the ſaid malice
is not already grown to that height,
that it hath deſerved, that God ſhould
take his true Church quite out of the
world; and ſo that there is now no
true Church at all exiſtent in the
whole world.</p>
            <p n="23">Queſt. 23. Whither it be not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that unlearned Proteſtants, who
cannot determine differences in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
either by force of argument, or
places of Scripture, but muſt wholly
depend, in the choice of their faith,
upon the authority and credit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Teachers, are not obliged in

and credibility of Doctours, before all
others, which all circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered,

the greater authority.</p>
            <p n="24">Queſt. 24. Whither that authority

of Doctours, where thoſe of one ſide

Queſt. 27. Whither, this equality
in perfections &amp; incomparable exceſs
in number conſidered, all unlearned
Proteſtants are not obliged, both in
prudence and conſcience, to preferre
the authority of the Roman Doctours
before that of Proteſtants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to follow the Roman, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Proteſtant doctrine?</p>
            <p n="28">Queſt. 28. Whither upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
conſiderations, the authority of
the Proteſtant Doctours, in all things
wherein they contradict the Roman,
is not contemptibile, and unable to
ſway the judgement of any prudent
Chriſtian, to frame any morall eſteem
of it: for though in matters, wherein
they are either ſeconded, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
by an authority incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
greater then their own, they may
deſervedly be eſteemed, for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
abilities and morall qualities
worthy of credit, yet in all things
where in they ſtand in oppoſition, and
contradiction againſt an authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153615:22"/>
exceeding theirs, they
deſerve nothing but to be ſlighted &amp;
contemned by all thoſe, who are to
be led by the ſole force of authority.
Thus when Proteſtant Doctours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that either Scriptures or Fathers
are for them, and againſt the Roman
Church, what they ſay in this is not
to be regarded, ſeeing the authoritie
of the Roman Doctours, abſolutely
greater then theirs, unanimouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the quite contrary. Thus when
they affirm that the Roman Church is
full of errours, and ſuperſtitions crept
in they know neither when nor how,
their accuſation is to be ſlighted, being
clearly and conſtantly contradicted
by a far greater authority. Thus
they ſay, that Proteſtants may
be ſaved, living and dying willfully in
their religion, they deſerve no credit
at all, for the quite contrary is moſt
conſtantly defended by the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
ſtronger authoritie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Doctours: and the like is to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153615:22"/>
affirmed in all the points of difference
betwixt the two Religions. So that a
Proteſtant is not to conſider the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
&amp; authority of his Doctours ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
or in matters out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,

credit nor eſteem.</p>
            <p n="29">Queſt. 29. I demand further, that if
the authoritie of all the Doctours of
the whole body of Proteſtants, be ſo
inconſiderable, in compariſon with
that of the Roman Doctours, how
much leſs will be the authoritie of any
one ſect, or party of them; and then
how minute and ſcarce perceptible
will be the authoritie of a <hi>Lawd,</hi> an
<hi>Hammond,</hi> a <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> a <hi>Fern,</hi> a

Queſt. 30. All this is demanded,
ſuppoſing that the Roman Doctours
were only equall to thoſe of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in all the forenamed qualities,
conducing to the perfect authoritie of
a Maſter in Chriſtianity: But now I
demand, whether thoſe, who have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of Teaching in the Roman

the mentioning in compariſon with
the generall Councells conſenting
with the preſent Roman Church,
(even according to their own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
as the ſecond of Nice, the great

            <p>What proofs of learning have the

            <p>Where find they amongſt theirs
that zeal, to paſs into the heart of ſo

to plant the Goſpell, even with the
undergoing of unheard-of torments,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:153615:24"/>
and ſuffering moſt cruell Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as many of the Roman Clergie
have done within theſe late years? let

Chriſtian faith to the Pagans.</p>
            <p>What means have the Proteſtant
Miniſtry, with their wives, goods and
families, to apply themſelves to ſtudy

            <p>Where is that unanimous conſent
in all points of faith (ſeeing they are
perpetually jarring, not onely one
with another, but the ſame Miniſters
diſſenting notoriouſly now, from
what they taught twenty years ago)
amongſt them, compared to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and agreement of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours?</p>
            <p>What Miracles have any of their

either of their doctrine againſt the

            <p>I could inſtance in many more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
but theſe may ſuffice for theſe
ſhort demands. Whence appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that whoſoever profeſſes to be
led by the ſole authority of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctours, and Paſtours, muſt either
deſerve the eſteem, I ſay not only of
an unchriſtian, but even of an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man, if he adhere to ſo undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and contemptible an authority,
as is that of the Proteſtant Miniſtry in
compariſon of the Roman Doctours,
who ſo incomparably outſtrip them,
not only in multitude, but in all the
motives and perfections, which give
credit to the authority of a Chriſtian
Teacher.</p>
            <p n="31">Queſt. 31. Whether hence be not
evidently diſcovered, not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
pride of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
originall beginners of any Sect in
Proteſtancy, in preferring their ſole
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153615:25"/>
authority before that of the Prelates
and Doctours of all the viſible
Churches in Chriſtendom, exiſtent
when they begun firſt to preach their
doctrine, but the extream madneſſe of
all the ignorant laity, who followed
them, upon their ſole authority, and
preferred one ſingle perſon upon his
bare word, (without any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſignes or manifeſt proofs from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
atteſting his authority) before all
the Doctours, Prelates, Councells,
Churches within the precincts of
Chriſtendom, both of that preſent
time and for nine hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
and if thoſe were infeſted with
ſo deep a freneſie, how can any man be
judged deſervedly diſcreet and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
who approves of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in this particular, and ſides with
them, (at leaſt in ſome article or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
in the oppoſition of the whole
Chriſtian world, as all Proteſtants do,
even to this day.</p>
            <p n="32">Queſt. 32. Hence I farther demand,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153615:25"/>
that ſeeing on one ſide the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
religion, having the divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for its authour, cannot admit of
any thing imprudent, as properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, in the choice of it: and on
the other, that the Proteſtant religion,
or any ſect whatſoever ſprung from
it, or exiſtent in it, cannot be prudently
choſen, by any unlearned perſon, who
is ſufficiently informed of the nullity
of that authority which propounds it,
compared with the authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the Roman religion; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſay, thoſe particulars conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Proteſtant religion, in any
ſect of it whatſoever, can be eſteemed
the true Chriſtian religion?</p>
            <p n="33">Queſt. 33. Hence, I preſſe farther,
whether the proving that Proteſtant
religion cannot be prudently cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
or retayned, by any unlearned
perſons, who are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
of the eminent authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the Roman religion, is not a
ſufficient argument to them, that no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153615:26"/>
ſect amongſt them in any point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it differs from the Roman, hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any ſolid ground in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
or true relation to Gods holy
Spirit, or coherence with true reaſon;
ſeeing a religion, which cannot by
them be choſen prudently, cannot
poſſibly proceed from any of theſe
three; whatſoever fair ſhow Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
each reſpectively to his ſeverall
ſect, make vainly of them.</p>
            <p n="34">Queſt. 34. And upon this, I demand
yet farther, whether the Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
have any obligation to urge
any other argument then this, either
from Scripture, Fathers, or reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Proteſtants, till they have
cleared their religion from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of imprudence, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their followers in the election
of it, or perſiſting in it, as is a fore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p n="35">Queſt. 35. On the contrary ſide; I
demand whether the Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
have any obligation in rigour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153615:26"/>
of diſpute, to uſe any other argument,
for perſwading unlearned perſons, to
deſert the Proteſtant, and imbrace the
Roman religion, then this of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in adhering to the Proteſtant,
and of prudence in uniting themſelves
to the Roman Church, ſo long as the
ſaid unlearned Proteſtants, perſwade
themſelves, that they proceed pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in preferring their own before
the Roman. Seeing this erroneous
perſwaſion is the firſt ſtep which muſt
be redreſſed relinquiſhing the one; and
the contrary perſwaſion, the firſt ſtep
which muſt be fixed, in approaching
to the other. Now when unlearned
Proteſtants once confeſs that they are
convinced in this, and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from Proteſtancy, but object that
the prudentiall motives to preferre
the Roman religion before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
as they convince that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
is wholly improbable, and ſo
to be deſerted, ſo they convince no
more then that the Roman is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153615:27"/>
and ſo is in great likelyhood to be
the true religion, but convince not,
that it is ſo much as morally certain?
to Proteſtants brought thus far, there
is an obligation put upon Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
to prove at leaſt the morall
certainty of it; to ſuch as acknowledge
that it is morally certain that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
religion, is the ſole true ſaving
religion, but deny, notwithſtanding,
that it thereby follows that it is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
certain; riſes an obligation to
prove, that it is alſo infallibly certain,
and when one is once convinced of
this alſo, but yet doubts whether this
infallibility be divine, and ſo the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all infallibilities, there will be
alſo an obligation to ſhew to ſuch as
are brought on ſo far, the moſt high
divine infallibility of the Roman reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Hence therefore I demand,
whether our late Proteſtants, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,
proceed not prepoſterouſly,
and unreaſonably, in preſſing Roman
Doctours, to demonſtrate the divine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153615:27"/>
infallibility of the truth of the Roman
religion, before they themſelves
grant, that it is either infallible in any
degree, or morally certain, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or prudentiall. For though it be
neceſſary, to prove all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in their due circumſtances, yet
there is no neceſſity, to prove them
all at once to every adverſary, but by
degrees the one in order after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with correſpondence, to what of
them is denied, or called in queſtion,
by thoſe with whom we treat, for thus
we proceed orderly, and logically <hi>à

notioribus, ad ignotiora,</hi> and hold a
correſpondence with nature, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<hi>ab imperfectionibus, ad perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiora,</hi>
ſtill obſerving the ſtop, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
of our adverſary, and ſtill ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and going forward along with
him. And if this methode had been
ſtrictly held by our late controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
the adverſaries mouths had been
ſtopped long before this.</p>
            <p n="36">Queſt. 36. Seeing theſe demands are

thoſe who are unlearned, and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

ſay conſidered, it is finally demanded,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153615:29"/>
whether by proving, that the Roman
faith only can be prudently imbraced
(which is already done) it is not made
inevitably clear, that the Roman on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

true Faith, wherein Chriſtians may
be ſaved.</p>
