            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(whoſe <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> was warrant and reaſon

whole Schoole) conſidering the birth of
all Mankind to be after one manner, and
their deathes a like certaine, expreſt his conceit by the

there was a way of wiſedome and vertue, and a way of
ignorance and vice propounded to all; and as Men
walkt in the one or in the other, ſo was their liues, and

one of theſe ends. <hi>Ioſuah</hi> 23. 14. Now as life is the moſt

            </p>
            <p>This then concerneth euery man to looke to; and is
a Doctrine fitting all perſons, all places, all times. For if
the way of life bee ſo hard to finde that few attaine it,
and that thoſe who ſuppoſe themſelues to be in it may
bee out of the way, vvee cannot bee too wary and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in this inquiſition, nor need wee feare the loſſe of
our time in ſeeking, but rather the loſſe of our ſoules
for lacke of ſeeking.</p>
            <p>This Text containes one of thoſe wiſe obſeruations
which <hi>Salomon</hi> aſſiſted by the Spirit of God made, out of
his extraordinary experience in the paſſages of this
world: and thought ſo needfull to bee vnderſtood of
all, as he repeates it againe <hi>verbatim</hi> in the 16. Chap
25. verſe, and in diuerſe other places in a diuerſe manner
of words to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Wee obſerue heerein two principall parts:<note place="margin">Diuiſion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. An erroneous opinion of <hi>Priuacie,</hi> in theſe words;
<hi>There is a way which ſeemes right to a Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. An infallible iudgement of <hi>verity,</hi> in theſe words;
<hi>But the end thereof are the Yſſues of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt part we note.</p>
            <p>1. The ſubiect or matter propounded; <hi>There is a way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The quality or condition of that way; <hi>It ſeemes
right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:17493:3"/>
3. The Iudge of that quality: <hi>A mans ſelfe;</hi> The ſpirit
of priuacy.</p>
            <p>In the other part, the publike Iudgement, we obſerue,
1. The <hi>end</hi> or purpoſe and ſcope thereof, compared
with or oppoſed to the beginning or pretence.</p>
            <p>2. The certaine <hi>ill quality</hi> oppoſed to the ſeeming
good quality; It did but ſeeme good or right, but it is,
certainly it is <hi>the way of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Iudge of this <hi>Quality, Salomon,</hi> the Publique
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> directed by the Spirit of God, oppoſed to
the erring partiall ſpirit of a Mans ſelfe, of priuacie, to
whome the way ſeemes good.</p>
            <p>So the vvay ſeemes right, but it is wrong; It ſeemes
the right way to life, but it is the ready way to death; It
ſeemes good in Mans eyes, but it is not ſo in Gods eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>And thus it muſt heere be vnderſtood of the wayes
of God, or the wayes of Man. The way of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
after a two-fold manner.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. His reuealed will in his Word, of which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal. 18. 3. The way of the Lord is an vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This laſt is likewiſe two-fold. 1. Either <hi>via legis &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datorum.</hi>
2. Or <hi>via gratiae, promiſsionis &amp; Euangelij.</hi> The firſt
of theſe wee walke in vvhen vve performe obediently
that vvhich is commanded; the ſecond, when we beleeue
faithfully that vvhich is promiſed. So the firſt reſpects o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
life, action, vvorkes; the other, knowledge,
faith, hope, and the affection of loue, which performeth
all the Law by being accepted in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But of theſe vvayes as the firſt of all heere ſpoken of,
vvhich is that of Gods Counſell, is too deepe for any
of vs; yea or for <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe to vvade in, (though
the shalloweſt fooles vvilbe buſieſt in it) ſo the other,
<hi>his reuealed will,</hi> is the rule of our vvayes, and neither of

                  <p>Then this is ſpoken of the vvayes of Man; and they
are likewiſe twofold.</p>
                  <p>Either the vvay of <hi>knowledge and vnderſtanding:</hi>

                  <p>Now if any man expect I should ſub-divide the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

vs, and ſuch as in ſome times, and with ſome
hot-headed perſons, breed great combuſtions in the
Church, I shal not need, neither truly ought I to do it;
becauſe all of vs (except the <hi>Heretiques</hi> who are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut off from the body of Chriſt by vs all, or thoſe <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes</hi>
who ſeparate and cut themſelues off, as perſons
that haue no way, that haue no tract of Antiquity, or
any footeſtep to follow directly in the Scripture) agree
in the way it ſelfe, though perhaps ſome of vs may vary
either in the manner of walking in that way, or in ſome
ceremony and circumſtance of deuotion or diſcipline,
which is as the hedge, and ditch, and fence of this way,
and no eſſentiall part of the way it felfe, but rather for
the order, eaſe, and conveniencie of the Traueller.</p>
                  <p>And thus thoſe whom our aduerſaries miſcall <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
Proteſtants, Puritans,</hi> walke as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes did out
of <hi>Egypt</hi> to fetch their good old father thither, to whom
their brother <hi>Ioſeph</hi> knowing their ſtubborne, croſſe,
proude, and peruerſe natures, gaue them this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

vary from their rigide rules. But for the way it ſelfe, all of
vs agree in one, &amp; with vs the whole Catholike Church,
both <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Abiſsins,</hi> as the learned know; and as it

hangs betwixt vs and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themſelues to be only in the way as perſons that
cannot poſſibly erre from it, and all others to be out of
the way, that in all points walke not ſtep by ſtep, and
hand in hand with them. Like a man, who vvould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

toll of the Paſſengers for his priuat benefite.</p>
                  <p>Now whilſt I ſay, wee vvith all the <hi>Catholique Church</hi>
agree about the way, and our only difference is vvith
<hi>Rome:</hi> I neither intend to affirme, that either our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with all is ſo intite, nor our variance from thoſe
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo diſtant, as ſome of ours and ſome of theirs
would beare the world in hand.</p>
                  <p>Only whilſt ſome Churches ioyne with vs in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17493:7"/>
of our faith, and in all the fundamentall points of
Religion (abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation) we dare not
judge them for erring in ſome matters of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For what haue wee to doe to iudge another
mans ſeruant? he ſtands or fals to his owne Maſter.
Yet whilſt I ſay, vvee vvill not iudge, I shew there is
cauſe and feare of iudgement, which they may auoyd,
vvho vviſely leauing ambiguous and vnneceſſarie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
reſt and build vpon that which is generally and
vndoubtedly agreed vpon. Theſe &amp; ſuch like I forbeare

or by his Reaſon (for I ſpeake of the naturall man, that
is, of Nature corrupted, not as God made man righteous,
but as man hath corrupted his owne wayes.) By his
Senſe if he iudgeth, he finds himſelfe often deceiued; for
a ſtraight ſticke put into the water, ſeemes crooked in
his eyes, an eccho beguiles his eares; his feeling, taſting,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17493:8"/>
ſmelling, all of them are ſubiect to deception. And for
his Reaſon, the beſt it can doe, is to diſcourſe probably
of the leaſt common accident of a Plea or a Flie; and
then whatſoeuer he brings, may be controuerted ſo by
another ſeeming reaſon, that the Iudge who should
from this baſe, ground his determinations, had need do
it with caution, and leaue roome to retract and reuerſe
his ſentence. Much more is man puzzeld and loſt, when
he climes vp to higher contemplations, to conſider the
hidden things of Nature, as wee may plainely ſee by
Gods arguments to <hi>Iob, Iob.</hi> 38. 39.</p>
                  <p>If then the ſpirit of a man cannot infallibly iudge
of the things of a man, of his owne ſoule and body, or
of ſuch things as are ſubiected to his gouernment, how
shall he be thought a competent iudge to determine
the things of God, though we graunt him to be of as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

<hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Preiudice:</hi> Man naturally abhors all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by his aduerſarie, and the hate of the perſon
wil not ſuffer him to intertaine the truth of his diſcourſe,
but rather ſeeke arguments to oppoſe it, his iudgement

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Partiality;</hi> Man naturally affects what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceeded from himſelfe immediately, or from his

In which regard God himſelfe diſputes this point

with an interrogation, with an expoſtulation,

20. 21. If therefore a multitude of men (how learned,
wiſe, or holy ſoeuer they bee) should ioyne againſt
the Scripture, their authority muſt not carry it, for they
all erre, and their interpretation is priuate, though their
perſons, their places, their profeſſions be publique.</p>
                  <p>And one or a few men expounding with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
doth not expound by a priuate ſpirit (though his
perſon perhaps bee priuate) but by the ſpirit of Truth
which directed the holy Pen-men of the Scripture; and
his opinion and interpretation is Catholique and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe,
whatſoeuer his perſon bee. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vvas a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
teacher, yet interpreting ſome Scriptures to proue
rebaptization, his interpretation therein vvas priuate,
becauſe againſt the generall ſenſe and ſcope of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And <hi>Augustine</hi> vvas a Bishop, and ſo a publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at whoſe mouth we are to ſeeke wiſedome, yet
when hee brought Scripture interpreted by himſelfe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17493:10"/>
contrary to the generall ſcope, to prooue Children
should receiue the Lords Supper, his interpretation was
worthliy reiected as of a priuate ſpirit. All the founders
of Hereſies haue beene publike perſons, ſuch as were
<hi>Nouatus, Arrius, Eunomius,</hi> and with theſe diuerſe Bishops
of <hi>Rome</hi> haue ioyned eyther as authors of Hereſies, or
Sectators of ſuch; and heerein they were all led by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
ſpirits. Therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, lib. 3.
cap. 3. <hi>De verbo. That the Spirit of interpretation</hi> (which in
S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſenſe is publique) <hi>is often giuen to priuate men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then the Scripture muſt be expounded by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the darker place by the place more cleere. Man
muſt not ſeeke a fortification in Scripture for his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but he muſt be carefull to raiſe his opinion and
Iudgement, out of the Scripture, euidently confirmed &amp;
explaned by it ſelfe, and by conference and coherence
of the ſame with it ſelfe; and this is publique interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
whatſoeuer is contrary, is from the ſpirit of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacy.

                  <p>All this that I haue ſpoken then, is not totally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
man from determining queſtions and doubts in
Diuinity, but to shew by what rule he ought to iudge;
that is, by no other rule then by the Scriptures: for I
gladly acknowledge, that whereas there is an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
and fundamentall Iudge, Chriſt himſelfe (the beſt
interpreter of the Law being the Law-maker) ſo he
hath placed a miniſteriall Iudge, which is the Church,
which muſt interpret Scripture by Scripture, and euer
be wary not to contradict the vvill of the Law-maker
Chriſt. Now the Romish Sinagogue conſidering the
Church of Chriſt in a threefold manner: 1. Firſt, as it is
<hi>Eſſentiall;</hi> 2. Secondly, as it is <hi>repreſentatiue:</hi> 3. And thirdly,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17493:10"/>
as it is <hi>virtuall.</hi> They make the <hi>repreſentatiue</hi> part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the Miniſtery; and this Miniſtery to flow from the
<hi>Pope</hi> as from the head; and to this part that is to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
they attribute that power which God hath giuen to the
whole Church. Now the <hi>Pope</hi> being thus inveſted in
abſolute power with an opinion of infallibility, laying
aſide the Scriptures, iudgeth without them; nay, againſt
them; nay, iudgeth them, and yet muſt not be chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of error.</p>
                  <p>This wee iudge vnreaſonable, that a Man should make
his owne will the Churches lawe, and iudge in his owne
cauſe without examination. And therefore wee shew,<note place="margin">Amor &amp; odium &amp; proprium commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faciunt ſaepè Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem non congnoſcere verum. Ariſtotle: lib. 1. Rhe.</note>
that man who iudgeth by his ſenſe or reaſon, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
qualified for ſuch a buſines; or if he were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſo adapted, yet is he vnfit to iudge in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which wholly concernes himſelfe, in regard of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
or preiudice, to both which he is ſubiect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in queſtions betwixt vs and the South-Church,
<hi>Presbiter Iohannes</hi> is an vnfit Iudge; and in queſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
vs and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
is as vnmeet: and in controuerſies betwixt vs and <hi>Rome,</hi>
the <hi>Pope</hi> is not a competent Iudge. <hi>Eccleſiasticus. 8. 14.
Goe not to Law with a Iudge, for they will iudge for him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore ſeeke a Iudge who iudgeth not by
the outward apparance, whoſe ſence and reaſon cannot
be deceiued, who is neither preiudiciall not partiall;
who ſearcheth the reines and the heart; for vaine is the
iudgement of man, to whom this way ſeemes right,

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, the glory of God is moſt aduanced heere in
this our <hi>way</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> by two affections of <hi>feare</hi> and
<hi>loue,</hi> and by the true fruits and effects of them. Now that
<hi>Religion</hi> which traines a man vp to feare God, and to loue
God, as God ought to be feared and loued, giues God
the trueſt glory, and ſo muſt neceſſarily be the truth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this <hi>feare</hi> and this <hi>loue</hi> is then moſt rightly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
and cherished in the ſoule of Man, and ſo Gods
glory moſt aduanced, when mans nature is truly ſet
foorth, and he thereby humbled in himſelfe, and ſo
taught to <hi>feare;</hi> and when Gods power and mercy is ſo
expreſt, as he hath beene pleaſed to reueale it to mans
comfort; That ſo man ſeeing his owne wants and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17493:12"/>

                  <p>1. Firſt, for <hi>Faith</hi> the foundation; Our Aduerſaries
teach a faith which only beleeues the power of God to
ſaue man: wee teach a faith which beleeues both his
power and will. Theirs teacheth feare; ours both feare
and loue; Theirs cloudes his mercy; ours giues true glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

but in this they erre, that they make it (that is, the
charity of man) to be the cauſe which moues God to
ſaue vs; nay, which deſerues and merits ſaluation of God.
And this Charity they teach ſo to depend vpon Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
as thereby they exalt the nature of man, conceale
his fall, and make the decree of God to be grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17493:13"/>
the mutable and vnconſtant will of man. We on
the other ſide teach, that our ſaluation wholly proceedes
from the charity and loue of God, and that all meanes
conducing to that end, riſe from the ſame fountaine of
loue; and ſo our charity, as an effect of that charity of
God to vs, ſerues not as a <hi>cauſe moouing</hi> God to ſaue, but
followes as a <hi>cauſe declaring</hi> whom God will ſaue. And
that our Charity, as it is a fruite and effect of Gods Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is true charity; and the works proceeding from that
charity of ours, good, but imperfect; good, as done by
a perſon accepted, imperfect as done by a ſinner, as done
by a babe which growes and labors towards perfection;
which perfection is not wholly to bee attayned, till this
imperfection be wholly put away, and corruption hath
put on incorruption. And therefore for <hi>merit,</hi> wee are
farre from it, as a doctrine oppoſite both to our charity,
and to the charity of God. To our charity, becauſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is a free worker, not reſpecting the wages; if she
thinkes to merit, she is not Charity. To the Charity of
God; becauſe if God gaue for the merit of our workes,
heauen were not properly a gift, nor grace were not
grace; nor charity, charity: for charity is free. Thus euen
<hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe in his integrity could not merit, becauſe
bee had nothing <hi>but what he receiued,</hi> he was indebted
for his daily bread, and for the grace he had to ſee and
acknowledge this loue of God: ſo whilſt we are giuing
thankes for benefites receiued, wee are not paying our
debts, but running farther in; for euery grace that wee
haue is a new obligation: <hi>To him that hath shalbe giuen,</hi>
and wee are receiuing whilſt we thinke our ſelues gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
                  <p>Againe, they teach, Though Chriſt dyed for vs, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17493:13"/>
though Gods grace guide and direct our actions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
yet there are ſome ſinnes left to be ſatisfied and
diſcharged by our ſelues, either in this life by workes of
merit or pennance heere, or heereafter by punishment
in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Now this they doe teach, not euer perhaps
becauſe they ſo beleeue, but becauſe it is a profitable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and they know they may eaſily vndertake to pardon
all that come into <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Beſides, it is a great glory
for their <hi>Hierarchy</hi> to be ſticklers in ſo large and ſpatious
a roome as they fancy or faine it to bee; not only to
haue all earth, but all Purgatory alſo within the verge
of their Inquiſition. Now vvee teach the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſee this doctrine derogatory to Gods infinite
mercy and glory, and to the infinite merits of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.
As if God had <hi>forgot to be gratious,</hi> or as if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours
merits and actions were imperfect as our workes
are; or rather indeed as if our workes were perfect to
merit &amp; ſupererrogate, and his imperfect, not able to do
inough for all, vvhen our Sauiours death did ſatisfie for
all the faithfull, and vvas ſufficient for many vvorlds
more, and his merits vvere ſuperaboundant for vs, and
for all that beleeue and repent.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly they ſay, that after the vvords of conſecration,
the bread is changed into the body of Chriſt, as he was
borne, as he ſuffered. This they doe to exalt the dignity
of their Preiſthood: vvee teach the contrary, that it is
his body and truly eaten, but both by faith, after a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
manner, as the Angels eate Chriſt in heauen by
contemplation. And this vvee teach, both becauſe vvee
haue good teſtimony of <hi>Scripture,</hi> vvith the whole cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
thereof, and the <hi>Analagie of faith</hi> ſo to expound
it, as alſo becauſe it makes more for the glory of God,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17493:14"/>
and the humiliation of man, when our Aduerſaries doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
doth the contrary. For doth it not call in queſtion
the truth of Gods word, the truth of Chriſts body, when
we are led to imagine ſuch a body as might be borne of
the Virgin, or not born; might be crucified, or not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
being neither to be felt, nor ſeene, nor taſted, yet to
be taken vvith the hand, eaten with the teeth, receiued
into the ſtomach? And doth it not exalt man, vvhen it
makes him able to make his Maker? And with his word
to make him ſo, as it should be in his power according
to his intention &amp; will to haue him preſent or not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?
What is this elſe, but to ſit in the ſeate of God, and
to be exalted aboue all that is called <hi>God?</hi> Like in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
to that of the great Earle of <hi>Warwickes</hi> in the time
of H. 6. in temporals, vvho choſe rather to be called
<hi>Primus Comes Angliae,</hi> then <hi>Rex Angliae;</hi> and thought it
more honor to make a King, then to bee one.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they ſay they humble man more then we, and
exalt God more then wee: 1. They humble man more
whilſt they tell him his ſinnes are ſuch as he muſt not
preſume to go to God, but by meanes of Saints or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
2. They exalt God more, whilſt they exalt his
ſeruants, and giue aſmuch reuerence to the Saints as wee
to God. To this wee anſwere, they arrogate to man,
whilſt they will ſee me wiſe aboue that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
they derogate from God whilſt they make his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
common to the Saints, and can only colour it with
a diſtinction; nay, whilſt they make him and Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeuere <hi>Iudges,</hi> and the Saints and Angels merciful, and
ſo their <hi>Mediators.</hi> They ought not to do euill that good
might come of it; this is euill to lye of God, whilſt they
faine him to bee what he is not, and deny him to bee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17493:14"/>
what he is. And of this kinde, and to this ende are all
their fictions in the <hi>Legend,</hi> to proue the Saints merciful,
and God ſeuere; yea the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be more
pitifull then <hi>Chriſt</hi> her Sonne and Sauiour, in whom she
was bleſſed more <hi>as a childe, then a Mother.</hi> That they
may do this the more ſafely, they contend and ſay, That
beſides the written word of God, there are many other
decrees and dogmaticall points and traditions neceſſarie
to be beleeued to ſaluation, which the Church (that is,
<hi>themſelues</hi> alone) haue in cuſtody vpon truſt and credit.
Now wee teach the contrary, aſwell becauſe wee haue
cleere teſtimony of the Scriptures and Fathers general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as of a cloude of witneſſes to proue the contrary, as
alſo becauſe it makes more for the glory of God in
things of abſolute neceſſity toward ſaluation, to gouerne
by poſitiue lawes of his owne, rather then by arbitrary
and changeable lawes of Man; and that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
to vs his will by his owne Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, who
came to ſaue vs, rather then to leaue vs to the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
relation of Man, who for ought wee know may be
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> and ſo intends to deceiue vs, though perhaps
he comes in sheepes clothing, or may ſeeme an Angell
of Light to bleare our eyes with apparance.</p>
                  <p>Wee might ioyne in this iſſue vvith them vpon all
the queſtions controuerted, but theſe shalbe ſufficient
to giue light to ſee the reſt at more leiſure. In the meane

To this end they are called Marchants, <hi>Reuel:</hi> 18. 23.
Becauſe for gaine and glory they ſophiſticate <hi>Religion,</hi> as
Marchants their wares, and thus make marchandize of
heauen and earth, and of God himſelfe. And as the
Marchants in <hi>London</hi> haue foreigne commodities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

and they in the Country haue meanes againe to

by Mettals: Or as <hi>England</hi> vvith theſe commodities
furnisheth other Countryes, and ſupplies her owne

her children vvooll, and <hi>Spaine,</hi> vvith Figges, Rayſons

things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature, shalbe able to ſeperate vs from the loue of

make this only a probable perſwaſion, no certaine faith:
but others ſeeing this too groſſe a dallying with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
ſcope of the Text, ſay, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> vvas aſſured of
the certainty of his ſaluation, of the happy end of his
<hi>right way</hi> by extraordinary reuelation only. But let it
be ſo; was it reuealed to him for others that beleeue too?
he ſaith ſo; for he ſaith nothing shalbe able to <hi>ſeperate
vs:</hi> Now then if it be reuealed to him for others, let vs
beleeue the reuelation, and apply it with vnfained faith
to our owne hearts in particular, as he did to his. And by
the way, obſerue what it is that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> builds his
faith vpon, ſo that nothing can preuaile againſt it. Is it
vpon <hi>Peter</hi> that rocke? Is it vpon Indulgences or Pardons
of man? Is it vpon perſonall righteouſnes, inherent iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,

                  <p>Whereas therefore our Aduerſaries accuſe vs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
preſumption, for teaching a faith that may aſſure vs
of our ſaluation, and (to elude this cleere place of Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> and diuerſe other the like) ſay, This was reuealed to
him by extraordinary fauour. Wee know and confeſſe,
that hee as a worthy inſtrument of Gods glory, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
builder, had many things reuealed vnto him for the
edification of the Church, but for this particular it was
no otherwiſe reuealed to him then it is to euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Chriſtian, in vvhom the Spirit of God dwels, as in

to cry <hi>Abba Father</hi> with teares and grones that cannot be

of the reuelation, not in the matter reuealed: <hi>Wee
know</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. Ep. 3. 14.) <hi>that wee are tranſlated

his commandement, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee know, that he abideth in vs, euen by that Spirit which

and loue are inſeperable: Againe, <hi>wee are tranſlated,</hi> not

Chriſt himſelfe hath ſilenced all pretences and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
and giuen abſolute authority to the Scripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17493:17"/>
and interpreted by the Spirit of God to reſolue
all ſcruples in caſe of conſcience.<note place="margin">Luk 16. 19</note> And this wee may ſee
cleerely in the Parable of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> where <hi>Diues</hi>
after he had failed of his perſonall ſuite, and could not
obtaine a drop of mercy for himſelfe, yet requeſted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to ſend one to his friends to forewarne them of
the ſtate he was in, not that they might pray for him, for
that vvas to no purpoſe, <hi>the tree was falne,</hi> but that they
might by repentance and amendment auoyde the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
themſelues. To whom <hi>Abraham</hi> giues this anſwere,
<hi>They haue Moſes and the Prophets, let them heare them;</hi> ſo he
turnes them to the Scriptures wherein the will of God
is reuealed to euery man, what they should shun, what
they should doe, what they should beleeue, and how
they should liue. And when <hi>Diues</hi> perſiſting in his ſuite
ſaith; <hi>Nay father Abraham, but if one went vnto them from
the dead they will repent. Abraham</hi> replies definitiuely and
reſolutely, <hi>If they heare not Moſes and the Prophets, neither
will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi> So wee
ſee, he that doubts the Scripture, or beleeues any thing
againſt it, vnder pretence of reuelations from heauen,
or hell, or Purgatory, or the like fictions of Ghoſts and
Spirits appearing, is in a wiſe caſe, and may be drawne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
into a fooles Paradiſe, but neuer into the true Paradiſe,
and ſo wander in this <hi>way</hi> which <hi>ſeemes right,</hi> but the <hi>end
thereof are the Yſſues of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To shut vp this point, obſerue the certainty of this
iudgement, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> before in the 1.
Ep. 3. Chap: 14. verſe, ſpeakes in the preſent. Tence, <hi>we
know that wee are tranſlated,</hi> to note the certainty of
their tranſlation to glory; ſo heere <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the
way of Death, and the end thereof</hi> is ſo, to note the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17493:17"/>
of the thing. And this is a plaine proofe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
aſſiſtance to diſcerne the end and determination of
a thing before the end be come; when otherwiſe it were
too late to doe it. For it is too late for <hi>Diues</hi> to repent
in hell, when the end is come; he should haue attended
better to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to the <hi>Prophets</hi> before, and beleeued
the word of God, not the foolish traditions of his <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
againſt the Word,</hi> or the idle old-wiues tales of his
<hi>foremothers, beſides the Word:</hi> he should haue attended
the admonition of the faithfull <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> and
not to the fained Legend of his flattering Pataſites,
trencher-fed Chaplaines. The perfection of all humane
judgement, is to iudge by the end and iſſue; and euen
heere wee often erre too: but if man goes farther of
himſelfe by nature, it is but coniecture and preſumption
ariſing from long experience in obſeruation of like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
as the effect leades vs to the cauſe; but yet
euen then wee cannot ſay it is, or certainely it shall bee,
but it may be ſo, it may ſo fall out, it may be the end of
Death. But the Spirit of God ſees the end before it
comes; he ſees the thoughts afarre off, and iudgeth, and
warneth men aforehand inwardly by good and holy
motions, outwardly by the Scriptures; and he that will
not beleeue the holy <hi>Spirit of God in the Scriptures,</hi> it is
but iuſtice, if God giue him ouer to a reprobate minde,
that he should be ſeduced and beleeue lies, who would
not receiue the truth of God, but was tranſported with
reſpect of times, perſons, places, and other humane
Motiues.</p>
                  <p>And heere before wee part, I giue the intelligent
Hearer this one obſeruation by the way, that of all the
controuerſies betwixt vs and our <hi>Romane Adverſaries,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:17493:18"/>
we are not chalenged for doing any thing in the ſeruice
of God which wee ought not to doe: for wee beleeue
with them all the Articles of the <hi>Creede:</hi> wee pray as
Chriſt himſelfe hath taught vs, wee liue (at leaſt wee
teach, that allmen should liue) as God hath commanded
vs in the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> Only the exceptions they take at vs,
are for omiſſions, becauſe they ſay, wee do not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wee ought to doe; and our exceptions are againſt
them. 1. Firſt, for omitting ſome things which God
commandeth; 2. Secondly, for doing ſomething that
God commandeth, not after the patterne preſcribed, but
after another manner invented. 3. Thirdly, for doing
many things which God hath directly and expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
prohibiting in the meane time what God hath
commanded. Now I deſire you ſo to obſerue this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
that you may take it vp rightly, and vnderſtand
what I meane.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore againe, the queſtions and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
betwixt vs, are not for the things wee doe, but of the
things that they doe. As for example, they dare not
finde fault with vs for praying as Chriſt taught vs, <hi>Our
father, &amp;c.</hi> But the queſtion is, whether or no they doe
as they ought, whilſt they pray to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> The
queſtion is not, whether wee may pray to God without
<hi>Images</hi> or no, but whether wee may pray by, at, in to, or
before Images, with any reference to them, as they doe.
And ſo for <hi>Latin Seruice,</hi> for the <hi>Communion</hi> in both kinds,
the queſtions are about the things that they do, not
for the things wee do: ſo the doubt is vpon their ſide;
and ſuch a doubt it is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> would gladly haue
graunted Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (of happy Memory) liberty
for her and her people to do theſe things as wee now

doe them; (as witneſſeth the learned <hi>B B.</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> in his

haue ſubiected her <hi>Crowne</hi> to his <hi>Myter;</hi> for that was the

or looſing; which iuriſdiction in this caſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crciſeth
after a foure-fold manner.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>By pronouncing them Apocrypha.</hi> 2. By <hi>eluding their
genuine meaning and ſence,</hi> by a foraigne and forced inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretaton

Iranſlation</hi> to be <hi>Authenticall,</hi> and the only true one.</p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, by <hi>purging all humors that offend his humor.</hi> In
which regard wee ſee how the Auncient <hi>Fathers</hi> haue
beene shaued, clipt, ſcoured, washt, let blood, purged,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17493:19"/>

their owne Men and faction, haue beene dieted, and caſt
into a ſweat, and hardly recouered with the application
of their <hi>Catholicon.</hi> And all theſe acts of theirs iuſtified
and defended with aſmuch eagerneſſe and shew of zeale
and truth, as the honeſteſt cauſe. Well may wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
feare and flee from his cenſure, as from a Iudge full
of preiudice, full of partiality; becauſe it is in his owne
cauſe, where he will not limit his <hi>Prerogatiue royall,</hi> but
extend it beyond all degrees of compariſon. Yet though
he be our Aduerſary, let vs heare him a little, and ſee
what notes and Land-markes he giues vs, to know and
diſtinguish the true way from the falſe by, that wee may
follow them, if they both ſeeme and bee infallible; and
that wee may beware of them, if they only ſeeme right,
but leade to the way of death, and then ſeeke out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that wee may cleerely ſee to be true.</p>
                  <p>Neither will the time permit, nor is it needfull to
bring forth all the marks of the true way, which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hangs out. The principall only I will
briefly touch and point at. But before wee do it, I muſt
lay downe this ground of their owne which they giue
to diſcerne true notes by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>True Notes of the Church must be ſuch as are able to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the abſolute definition of the Church; ſo farre, that being

where they were firſt euill, before the grace of God
wrought their wils to deſire to bee good: therefore <hi>Quae
naſcentia mala ſunt, ea creſcentia peiora;</hi> And ſo <hi>Antiquit as
ſine veritate, est vetus error. Error</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> may dwell
together.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, they brag of <hi>Multitude,</hi> as of a certaine
note. But the moſt paſſengers trauaile (as our Sauiour
ſaith) in the broade <hi>way</hi> which leades to <hi>death:</hi> ſo that
heere it may be ſayd as <hi>Liuy</hi> ſayd of old in his firſt Decad:
<hi>Ferè fit maior pars, vincit meliorem.</hi> And therefore it is
that our Sauiour comforts his Church heere with
thoſe gratious words,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 32</note>

ſucceede one an other in euill places: this note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

though they could agree together no better then
the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or the <hi>Secular Preiſts</hi> and
<hi>Ieſuits,</hi> yet they bound themſelues in a common band
of obedience vnder one head the high Preiſt, and the
then viſible Church of the Iewes, againſt our bleſſed
Sauiour and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>5. Fiftly, they call themſelues the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi>
and preſume to carry it by that name. But the Iewes
before them did boaſt of the <hi>Church, the Church, the

fuit ſic,</hi> there was a time when it was otherwiſe, when
their traditions (now growne fuſty with age) were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties,
or ſtale newes. Thus likewiſe they called Saint
<hi>Paules Doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 24. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Hereſy.</hi> More they could not ſay againſt
<hi>Luther,</hi> or can ſay againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>6. Sixtly, they bring <hi>viſibility</hi> for a note. But this is
not a note of the thing, but the thing it ſelfe which wee
ſecke: for could the true Church be diſcerned to be the
true Church by all, there were an end of this argument,
and no farther vſe of theſe notes. But becauſe though
her <hi>being</hi> be viſible, and her <hi>true being</hi> bee viſible, yet her
<hi>being true,</hi> is not viſible to <hi>all;</hi> wee inquire for notes
whereby wee may not only diſcerne her <hi>true being,</hi> but
the <hi>being of her truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe notes (with diuerſe others of the
ſame kind) are not ſuch as are required by their owne
rules, as able to <hi>conſtitute the being of the true Church:</hi> for
a falſe Church may haue all theſe and more too; they
are <hi>not proper,</hi> for other ſocieties haue them; And if
theſe would carry it, then the South-Church might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for ſupremacy, and the Eaſt-Church would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
carry it againſt all pretenders as the Mother Church,
<hi>For she is before Rome in time, she hath larger bounds, and
multitudes of people; Almost all the Apoſtolique ſeas, moſt of
the Patriarches, An Empire, Seauen vniverſall Counſels, The
Syrian language wherein Chriſt ſpake, The Greeke, wherein the
Scriptures of the new Teſtament was written;</hi> She hath <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion</hi>
euen from the Apoſtles themſelues lineally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption, They are <hi>at Vnity</hi> vnder one Chiefe,
and they call themſelues <hi>Catholiques;</hi> And yet for all
theſe, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (and that rightly) makes ſuch
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17493:21"/>
exceptions againſt her, as wee doe againſt the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since therefore theſe notes are not <hi>eſſentiall,</hi> but <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall;</hi>
not <hi>proper,</hi> but <hi>common;</hi> not <hi>permament,</hi> but <hi>tranſient,</hi>
wee ought to be wary how wee altogether truſt to their
probable direction, ſince all, or the moſt part of theſe are
ſuch notes as may accompany this <hi>way</hi> which ſeemes
right and is not ſo, and ſo may be made meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare
and intangle our affections with preiudice and
parciality, and ſo to blinde our iudgements, that hauing
theſe wee shal be ſatisfied with shew and apparance,
though wee walke as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> did three days iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with the multitude of our friends,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 44.</note> and neuer miſſe
Chriſt, as if he were none of our Company.</p>
                  <p>And I pray obſerue (to hold vs to our Allegory of a
<hi>way</hi>) if there were doubt of two wayes, which were the
right or the wrong way, and one that would vndertake
to direct you to finde out the right, should ſay; You
shall know the right way by theſe markes, It is an <hi>old
way, a beaten way, a way where Paſſengers trauell one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
It is a way by it ſelfe, or one way,</hi> it is called <hi>the old way,</hi>
and it is <hi>viſible;</hi> what were a man the better for theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections?
would he not thinke ſuch a guide out of his
wits? Eſpecially when he shall ſee both wayes alike <hi>old,</hi>
alike <hi>beaten;</hi> both vvayes to haue paſſengers <hi>ſucceſsiuely,</hi>
alike <hi>frequent,</hi> both wayes to be <hi>intire and ſingular,</hi> both
wayes to be <hi>called old,</hi> and both wayes to <hi>be viſible?</hi> Thus
both wayes doubtleſſe he would be wilde except he had
better directions: And yet this is the caſe of the Church,
which ſome would thus marke out to the beleefe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of all men. But to conclude, all theſe are no
true markes; but the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the true and vnfallible
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17493:22"/>
Euidence to bound the Church out, to him that vvill
be heedfull to obſerue, and faithfull to beleeue, and
humble to obay, as we hope to manifeſt. Heere then it
were meete, I should giue you ſome infallible and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
note of the true <hi>way,</hi> hauing showne, or rather
pointed at the defect of theſe which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
produceth. But then I should offer violence both to
your patience, and to the Text; the time not permitting
ſo large a diſcourſe, and my Text leading me to diſcouer
<hi>the falſe way with ſeemes right,</hi> but giuing no warrant to
proceede farther. Only to conclude all, ſince it is within
my Commiſſion to manifeſt the <hi>falſe way,</hi> I will giue
you one note, a ſure one, whereby you may know when
you are <hi>out of the right way,</hi> that ſo you may shun error
and ſeeke truth, and enſue it till death, that in the end
you may finde euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>Briefly Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and
the life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>no man commeth to the Father but by me.</hi> He is the

cals all Scripture <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15</note> and he

exhorts all men to follow him as he keepes in this <hi>way,</hi>
and vvalkes after Chriſt Ieſus and no otherwiſe. For ſo

                  <p>Now then I do not ſay vvhereſoeuer thou ſeeſt the
Scripture ſet forth for a ſigne, there Chriſt is vvithin:
<hi>there is the true way, the true Church.</hi> But I ſay whereſoeuer
thou canſt <hi>not ſee the Scripture,</hi> be aſſured thou art out <hi>of
the way:</hi> for the Scripture muſt be euer in thy eye, being
that ſetled Land-marke by vvhich thou muſt try and
know, and to vvhich thou muſt reduce and bring all
thy other coaſt-marks and ſea-marks. So it is that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
vvhich agrees vvith the verity of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that
<hi>multitude</hi> vvhich vvorship God according to the rules of
the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that <hi>Suceſsion</hi> vvhich ſuceeed in the truth of
doctrine deliuered in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that <hi>vnity</hi> vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues
the Trinity taught in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that <hi>Catholique
Church</hi> vvhich is founded vpon, and vniuerſally agreeth
vvith the truth of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that <hi>viſible congregation</hi>
vvhich are ſeene to God, and vvhich ſee God as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueales
himſelfe in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that become notes by
vvhich thou maiſt ſafely trauaile in this doubtfull vvay
of mortality. So that the <hi>Scripture muſt euer be preſent to
make theſe infallible,</hi> though perhaps it be not of abſolute
neceſſity, that all theſe be euer preſent vvith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make the Church true. The <hi>Heathens</hi> of old burnt
the books of <hi>Numa</hi> becauſe he bewrayd therein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
miſteries of their Idolatries. The <hi>Turks</hi> at this day
keepe their people in ignorance; no man muſt ſee into,
no man muſt diſpute or argue of their Sect.</p>
                  <p>And thus our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> deale vvith the
Scriptures; &amp; reſembling heerin the Heathens &amp; Turkes,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17493:23"/>
vvould yet make the vvorld beleeue, that they are the
only Chriſtians. And leſt they should ſeeme <hi>inſanire ſine
ratione,</hi> they haue a ſeeming reaſon why they permit not
the Scriptures to be in the mother-tongue of euery Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
publiquely to be read by them; leſt forſooth (<hi>as
the Rhemiſts ſay</hi> in their preface) they should hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
as vvith <hi>fire, or water, or kniues, or ſwords,</hi> or the
like. And vvhy do they not put out the Sunne becauſe
it hurts the gazers eyes? or why put they not out their
eyes to preuent hurting, eſpecially ſince they miſ-leade
many a man to luſt and vanity? To argue from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of things indifferent, to remoue the lawfull vſe of
them, is an abuſeof ſence and reaſon; But in things of
this kinde, of abſolute neceſſitie, it is an intolerable and
preſumptuous foolery. Nature cannot bee ſo blinde as
to ſuffer any but naturals to beleeue this their doctrine,
and to vvalke in this their way:<note place="margin">Pro. 4. 18. 19.</note> for <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The way

But the path of theiuſt is as the shining light, that shineth more

                  <p>True; but vvill ſome ſay, <hi>All Heretickes</hi> hang out this

both right and ſeemes ſo;<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 24.</note> 
               <hi>euen the vvay of life vvhich lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I proceed to exhort you to walke in this
<hi>vvay:</hi> for it is better not to know then not to practiſe
what wee know. An honeſt Turke which knowes not
the will of his Maſter, is to be preferd before a prophane
Chriſtian, who knowes his Maſters will and doth it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17493:28"/>
not,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 47</note> and therefore shalbe <hi>beaten vvith many stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>vvay</hi> then in this ſence of <hi>Salomon.</hi> is the cuſtomary
courſe of life which a man chiefely vſeth, whether it bee
in vertue or in vice. The whole race of mankinde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
walke in the roade and way of ſin and death: But
ſome are regenerate and called out of this way by faith
and repentance: others will not obay Gods word, but
rather chooſe to liue in <hi>the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi>
And they are ſayd to be in their <hi>vvay,</hi> becauſe ſin reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in them, tramples vpon them, &amp; by cuſtome takes
away the ſence of conſcience; obdurating their hearts,
as a way is hardned by the feete of many paſſengers, ſo
as a plow cannot pierce the ſame. Thus men haue their
darling and beloued ſins which is their <hi>vvay,</hi> out of
which you can by no meanes put them; as a Hare ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before Greyhounds, will haue her accuſtomed way
and muſe, or die for it; ſo theſe.</p>
            <p>And thus a man is not ſayd to be in his <hi>vvay</hi> when
hee ſinneth of frailty, he then hath ſlipt out of his <hi>vvay,</hi>
and leaues not till he returne into his <hi>vvay</hi> by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
but vvhen he ſins by cuſtome then he is in his
<hi>vvay.</hi> And a notorious ſinner is not ſayd to be in his
<hi>vvay</hi> if now and then hee comes to Church, prayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
the Sacraments, and forebeares groſſe ſinnes, or
does ſome ſingular and ſolitary good: for he is not well,
till he be out of this <hi>vvay</hi> againe, and like <hi>a dog returnes
to his vomite.</hi> Therefore a man is iudged wiſe or foolish,
good or bad, and to be in, or out of his <hi>vvay,</hi> by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
actions, not by a ſpeciall ſingle fact. For <hi>nemo
omnibus horis ſapit; Semel inſanivimus omnes,</hi> and in <hi>many
things wee offend all.</hi> It is therefore the generall courſe,
proceeding, and perſeuerance in vertue or vice that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17493:29"/>
brings life or death to our <hi>wayes:</hi> for the crowne of glory
is at the end of this race of vertue, &amp; here death is at the
end of this race of vice: <hi>the end there of is the iſſues of death.</hi>

O Lord open their harts, that as they ſee their

            <p>Wayes <hi>are either</hi> 1. Vicinales. 2. <hi>Or</hi> Priuatae. 3. <hi>Or</hi>

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>1. <hi>Vicinales vi.e.</hi> Or vvayes of vicinity or neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
are betwixt ſtreete and ſtreete, neighbor and
neighbor, houſe and houſe, in Cities or townes. And
theſe may be compared firſt vvith thoſe opinions in our
Religion, or conditions and manners in our liues,
vvhich vvee take vp by imitation of our Parents, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Predeceſſors or the like. Thus by imitation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of others vvhome vvee reverence for knowledge
or deuotion, by the cuſtome and conſent of times and
places, wee are led as it were blindfold, to take vp vpon
truſt all matters of faith without examination of their
principles or grounds; vvhen if vvee vvere not kept
backe from ſearch by ignorant ſuperſtition, vve should
finde, that, <hi>As man naturally begets man to ſin according to
his depraued Image, and man is apter to follow man in euill
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17493:31"/>
then in good; ſo both in Faith and manners wee are often miſ-led
and corrupted by our naturall parents and ſuperstitious prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsors:</hi>
by which reaſon, as the tares ouergrow the wheat,
ſo the foolish ouergrow the wiſe, the ſuperſtitious ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
the truly religious; and the godleſſe, the godly; and
ſo <hi>ſtultorum infinitus numerus,</hi> the vvhole Earth is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
vvith ſuch people.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, wee ſend our children beyond the Seas
into <hi>Fraunce, Italy, Spaine, Germany;</hi> they returne not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen
from thence, but Frenchmen, Italians, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
Germans; They do not only bring home the
Language, which vvas the pretence of their trauell, but
their religions, manners, cuſtomes, diets, geſtures,
cringes, vices, diſeaſes: ſo that nothing heere now
ſeemes good to them, but all that they bring home
that ſeemes right in their eyes, they hate to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
preiudice hath ſo taken vp their affections and
iudgements aforehand.</p>
               <p>Thus young men taſte according to the company
which firſt enters and ſeaſons them. By which meanes
ſome ſmell of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
number become like <hi>ſalt vvithout ſauour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, ſome vices by their propinquity and
neighborhood to vertues, do ſo reſemble them,that they
can hardly be diſtinguisht from them: and ſo deceiue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a ſoule, who takes a ſpetious vice for a wholeſome
vertue, and reſteth ſatisfied with the shadow in ſtead
of the ſubſtance, as children are pleaſed aſwell with
counters and counterfeit coyne, as vvith pure gold and
currant mony.</p>
               <p>So <hi>prodigality</hi> is often taken for <hi>liberality,</hi> or for <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Spirituall pride</hi> is taken for <hi>Humility: Single inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17493:31"/>
or impotencie,</hi> is taken for <hi>chaſtitie; Temeritie</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for <hi>Fortiude: Securitie</hi> is taken for <hi>peace of conſcience:
Preſumption</hi> is taken for <hi>faith: vaineglory</hi> for <hi>Piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion:
cholericke folly,</hi> for <hi>zeale:</hi> And <hi>deadnes of heart, and
dulneſſe of affection,</hi> for <hi>Contentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, ſome <hi>naturall vertues,</hi> for neighborhoods
ſake, and for ſome reſemblance betwixt them, are often
miſtaken, for <hi>Theologicall vertues;</hi> And this point would
bee vvell obſerued; for it deceiues many both in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others, and in iudging themſelues too, vvhilſt
either they conſider not the difference, or marke not
the proper concurrants to both, or diſtinguish not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>morall</hi> or <hi>ciuill honestie</hi> vvhich a Turke may
haue, lookes like <hi>true ſanctitie,</hi> vvhich the true Chriſtian
onely hath. So <hi>hiſtoricall Faith,</hi> vvhich vvicked men may
haue, and the diuels haue, lookes at firſt blush, to ſome
that haue eyes to ſee no farther, like <hi>iuſtifying Faith,</hi>
vvhich the Elect onely haue: So <hi>naturall loue,</hi> vvhich
Ethnickes haue, is miſtaken for <hi>Chriſtian Charitie:</hi> for that
a vvorke be <hi>good,</hi> that is, <hi>accepted of God,</hi> it muſt proceede
out of <hi>Faith,</hi> and be done in <hi>obedience to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and to the end <hi>to glorifie him.</hi> Now this cannot be
vvithout <hi>knowledge,</hi> that is the ground of all: for <hi>how
shall they beleeue on him,of whom they haue not heard?</hi> Rom.

vvorkes of Ethnickes are called good, either by reaſon
of their apparence onely, or that the ſubſtance of the
worke is in it ſelfe good, although in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
obiect, end, and other circumſtances it bee euill.
And againe, <hi>Opera Ethnicorum non idcircò mala dicuntur,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17493:32"/>
quod fiant ſimplicitèr, ſed quòd non fiant benè.</hi> The vvorkes
of Ethnickes are not therefore ſaid to bee euill, as they
are ſimply done, but for that they are not done well as
they ought to be.</p>
               <p>For that a <hi>naturall</hi> vertue be chriſtened, (as I may ſay)
vvithout vvhich it cannot be acceptable to God, there
muſt concurre theſe circumſtances:</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, that it be done in a right vvay, a right faith,
a right religion, which is onely in the faith of Chriſt:
<hi>other foundation can no man lay,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 11.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, that it be warranted by a ſpeciall faith;
that is, firſt, a certaine knowledge out of Gods word,
that it is a worke pleaſing to him, and not contradictorie
to his will: ſecondly, vvith a full perſwaſion that his
perſon, vvho performes it, is reconciled to God, in and
through Chriſt Ieſus; and ſo his worke, yea all his works
accepted, as the perſon and ſacrifice of <hi>Abcl</hi> was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God, Gen. 4.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, that it be done to a good end, that is, to
glorifie God, <hi>to teſtifie our loue and thankfulneſſe to him,</hi> for
his infinite loue to vs; and to <hi>make our owne election ſure.</hi>
And all workes done otherwiſe, how great ſoeuer they
be, how glorious a shew ſoeuer they make, either in our
owne eyes, or in the eyes of the world, are thoſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
vvhich often beguile good men, (I meane, men
of good natures, of good naturall diſpoſitions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
aud vvhich S. <hi>Augustine</hi> cals <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering

<hi>Their wayes ſeeme right in their owne eyes, but the yſſues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

they ſay, three grieuous faults. 1. Sinne againſt

weake brethren. 3. Infringe their Chriſtian liberty.</p>
               <p>2. In our particular calling, wee haue our priuate
walkes alſo, euery one neglecting the maine end at
which they should driue, and ayming obliquely, either
at priuate gaine, at vaineglory, or the ſatisfaction of
ſome baſe humor and paſſion. And to begin with the
Diuine, becauſe he should leade others right: The end
of his vocation is, by <hi>preaching</hi> to acquaint men with
the will of God, by <hi>praying</hi> to turne the wrath of God
from the people, and to obtaine a bleſſing vpon his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,

conſcience to miſ-leade others, ſo he may be head of a

yeeres he meetes no checke, but gets preferment, his
ſtudy then is to grow with the time; and then he cannot
diſtinguish the warts, moles, ſcarres, and corruptions of
the Church, from perfections and graces: his ſtudy is
not to diſcharge one Cure well, but to procure and
charge himſelfe with many; to heape ſteeple vpon
ſteeple, as if he ment to climbe vp to heauen that way.
And after all to retire himſelfe to a Prebendary out of
the vvay, where like a bird in a cage he may be fed fat,
and prouide to purſchace ſome new and higher prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

But we muſt let him alone, he is in his <hi>way,</hi> it is in vaine

he hold himſelfe ſtrictly in his courſe to accomplish
this end of his calling and profeſſion? Alas no. But he
demeanes himſelfe for the moſt part, as a man placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the Lawe; And what he doth is either againſt the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17493:33"/>
Lawe, or without a Lawe, as it were by his princely
prerogatiue,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>non eſt iuſto lex poſita, &amp;c. There is no Lawe for
a Lawyer.</hi> Thus he may take what cauſe he liſt in hand,
though he know it be vniuſt: for his office (he ſaith)
is not to Iudge, but to pleade; and he ſpeakes therefore
with more affection and earneſtnes againſt the truth,
then for it: Becauſe a good cauſe will ſpeake for it
ſelfe, but he deſerues praiſe that maintaines an ill cauſe
well; and for this he shall be famous, and get Clyants,
and ſo get wealth which is that he aymes at.</p>
               <p>Againe, he may take what fees he will, though the
Law limits his takings, and cals the exceſſe, extortion.
He is the expounder of the Lawe, he is <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> the
tongue of the Law, and ſaith, That the intention of the
Lawe was to limit men that they should take no leſſe,
and it limits ſuch as can get no more.</p>
               <p>Againe, other Trades muſt do their worke, if they
wil haue wages; and muſt acknowledge the benefit they
receiue, and the Benefactor: but heere the Maſter is
the ſeruant; and whereas in all other vocations there
lies an <hi>Action in the Caſe</hi> againſt ſuch, as hauing taken a
valuable conſideration for their paines, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their worke; He, nothwithſtanding his fee, may
ſpeake or hold his peace as he pleaſeth: for though he
hath two handes to take fees on both ſides, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be at two Barres at once, and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> we know,
had as much for holding his peace, as <hi>AEſchines</hi> for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The Doctrine of Reſtitution he likes not, it is a
popish point; in all other things he can be content to
be Catholique, to be vniuerſall, to be for euery man:
To be for a man in one caſe, againſt him in another,
though the caſes reſemble: nay, perhaps to be both for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17493:34"/>
the plaintife and defendant in one caſe; and though he
cannot pleade for both, becauſe he hath but one
tongue, yet he may giue counſell to both, for that one
toungue is double; and takes fees of both, for that's the
end of all. His <hi>wayes</hi> ſeeme good and right; for can
he walke wrong who hath the Law, the rule of Equity
in his hand, and whoſe office it is to guide others right in
the way? Yes doubtleſſe, the end shewes, that <hi>Malè par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
malè dilabuntur, the iſſues of all are the wayes of death and
deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next looke vpon the Marchant as it were the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and all Mechanicks as vnder-Officers of commerce,
the end of their Profeſſions is, or should be, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue
Iuſtice to ſupply the neceſſities of each other,
and ſo of the State. But ſee how they propound priuate
gaine to themſelues, as the only maine end and ſcope of
all their labours. And vnder this couer what one can
cheate or cooſen his neighbor of, either by ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wares, or falſe waights and meaſures, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cloſe deuiſe or conveyance, he thinkes it tolerable,
nay laudable, a part of his trade, a miſtery (as he cals it)
of his profeſſion; without which he could not be a good
husband, or thought fit to deale in the world, or ſet vp
for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus perhaps he will be curious in the duties of the
firſt Table, which touch not the corruptions of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
but for workes of mercy commanded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, he knowes not what they meane, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they are ſuperſtitious and popish workes, though
he heare God himſelfe ſay,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I will haue mercy, and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
He will not ſweare perhaps; for that is too open
a ſin for his purpoſe; in this point perhaps he will be an
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17493:34"/>
Anabaptiſt: but if lyes will ſell his euill-conditioned
commodities, he will let none lye by him, nor no man
lye beyond him. He will not breake the Sabaoth, no
not to eate, no not to feed others, not to doe good, he
is a ſtrict Sabbatarian, a Iew in opinion; but that day
or any other he will not ſticke to cooſen his credulous
brother, and aſwell may you truſt a Iew as truſt him.
Thus he growes rich, and treaſures vp wrath for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and in his whole dealing shewes himſelfe a wrong
Marchant, but a right <hi>Iudas,</hi> who wil gaine by the fayned
shew of godlineſſe, or by any other courſe. <hi>His way
ſeemes right to himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the end thereof be the Yſſues of

               <p>In the third place wee haue <hi>Publique wayes,</hi> common
roads, the <hi>Kings high-way,</hi> which reſembles publique
iudgement, publique authority, and the Common
Lawes of the Land. For becauſe all men thinke their
owne wayes good, bee they wayes of priuacie, or wayes
of neighborhood, therefore God hath appointed Kings
and Iudges to bee life-tenants and Deputies in his
ſteade, to defend weake <hi>truth</hi> from ſtrong <hi>falſehood</hi> and
oppreſſion, and to decide euery controverſie accordin
to the right rule of reaſon and Equity contained and
expreſſed in the Lawes where they gouerne. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
vndoubtedly, if euery man might be his owne
Iudge, the Thiefe, the Murtherer, all would be quit, and
the Iudge and Iewry should ſmart for it; the Plaintife
and Defendant, all vvould be ſauers, and the Lawyer
should pay for all, who now is like to get all. To auoyd
therefore this confuſion, God hath ſet Caeſar to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
indifferently betwixt party and party, and giuen
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17493:35"/>
him a Lawe and direct rule how to doe it, and that he
might do this freely without partiality, without feare or
any other thing that might miſ-leade his iudgement,
God hath ſet him aboue all, exempted him from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iudge but himſelfe, and the Lawes which are his
rule and iudge. Now to the end he might be fully and
compleately furnished, God puts an other ſpirit into
him, as wee ſee in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after in the 70. Aſſiſtants,
and in <hi>Saule, Dauid, Salomon</hi> and others who were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
indued from aboue with Graces fitting their
imployments; and this Spirit vvhilſt it continues vvith
them, doth neuer contradict the publique voice, that is,
the Lawe of the State, but ioynes with it and ſpeakes
the ſame language, from whence perhaps that common
ſpeech aroſe, that the <hi>voice of the people is the voice of God,</hi>
if it bee ioyned vvith the voice of the King; and this
voice is to be heard and obayed for conſcience ſake,
being heere oppoſed to the Spirit of priuacie, which will
rule, though vvithout reaſon; and the more weake it is,
is for that the more vvilfull.</p>
               <p>Now this Spirit of priuacie (whoſe vviſedome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in vvilfulnes) may be in a publique Perſon, when
for his owne or peoples ſinne he hath loſt the publike
ſpirit vvherewith God indues Princes. So the publique
ſpirit departed from <hi>Saule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 14.</note> and a priuate mad ſpirit

vpon purpoſe to enſnare and betray him; to deale falſely
vvith him in all his faire pretences; and laſtly, to croſſe
and contradict his owne religious Law for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> vvas in the like caſe, vvhilſt by the vncleane

                  <hi>As a roaring Lyon, and a ranging Beare, ſo is a wicked

                  <hi>For the holy Spirit of diſcipline
will flie deceite, and remooue from thoughts that are without
vnderſtanding: and will not abide when vnrighteouſnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

and vvrote that booke called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> to bemone

               <p>1. Firſt, <hi>Salomon,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar</hi> muſt not rule vvithout a
Lawe, nor by his abſolute power make any, but ſee to
the execution of thoſe that are made. It inclines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
too much towards tyranny for a <hi>Magistrate</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
an abſolute authority vvithout limit, and the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour</hi>
who rules vvithout a Lawe, or againſt Lawe,
vvalkes in no <hi>way</hi> himſelfe, but balks his owne <hi>high-way;</hi>
for a <hi>way</hi> is fenced, but the champian fields are for the
wild-gooſe-chaſe; and corners and holes for ſiniſter
actions. When as publique perſons should do publique
actions in publique,<note place="margin">Gen. 23. 10.</note> in the <hi>Gates of the City,</hi> in the <hi>Kings
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17493:36"/>
high-way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 15</note> in the eye of all. For chamber-workes are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious,
and carry a shew of priuacy and parciality. And
ſo it is ſayd by <hi>Liuy,</hi> that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> made the name of a
King odious at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he ruled all <hi>Domesticu
conſilijs</hi> by chamber-Councell, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
<hi>Lewes</hi> the 11, in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Thus Kings though they bee
in ſome ſort aboue the Law, becauſe they are diſpeuſers
of it, are not yet without a Lawe, becauſe they muſt
rule themſelues and others by it. And thus much the
crowne that a King weares teſtifieth, which is a type of
the loue, and acknowledgement, and conſent of the
people in his gouernement; and lets him ſee, that there
is a verge, a hoope, a compaſſe for the heades of Kings,
aſwell as of ſubiects, and that wee come to manifeſt in
the ſecond conſideration.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, Gods Lawe is <hi>Caeſars</hi> verge, which
<hi>Caeſar</hi> muſt neither tranſgreſſe, nor ſuffer to bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt.
Where God hath ſet no Lawe, there <hi>Caeſars</hi>
Lawe (<hi>I meane the Lawe of the Land, which is the
hedge to this high-way of the King</hi>) muſt ſtand. And this
muſt agree with the equity of the Lawe of God, from
vvhence it originally takes life and ſtrength. For as
where it agrees with Gods Lawe, wee muſt obay it for
conſcience ſake; ſo where it contradicts or croſſeth the
Lawe of God, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> giues a generall rule,
<hi>It is there better to obay God then man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19.</note> To cleere this:</p>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt thy conſcience tels thee, the <hi>Religion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the King, or ſome ceremony vſed in the
Church according to the Lawes eſtablished, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
but contrary to the truth; If thou canſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
this by the word of God, then thy Conſcience tels
thee right, and thou art not to doe what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17493:36"/>
by man, though he ſpeakes humane Lawe, but
yet thou art to ſuffer vvhat is inioyned by him, ſo
ſpeaking with the Law, or ſo doeing as Executor
of the Lawe: and both theſe wayes thou obayeſt
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> too; God actiuely, doing vvhat he vvils;
and <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſiuely, ſubmitting thy will to Gods
holy ordinance, and obaying the Magiſtrate for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake. But if thy conſcience tels thee this or that,
and cannot proue what it tels thee, but by shifts and
shadowes; then it is not truly thy conſcience, at leaſt
no true but a lying conſcience that ſo miſleads thee; nay
rather, it is thy phantaſie, thy imagination, thy peeuish,
preiudiciall, and froward conceit; And thou art bound
to reſiſt, and breake thine owne crooked and peruerſe
vvill, aud to ſubiect it to the will of <hi>God,</hi> who hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
thee to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> For <hi>Conſcientia non eſt contra ſcientiam,
ſed cum ſcientia,</hi> Conſcience is ioyned with knowledge;
thats the ground, otherwiſe thou ſetſt vp an Idol in thy
owne heart, and worshippeſt it, vvhilſt thou obayeſt an
erring and ignorant conſcience. For an <hi>Idol</hi> (ſaith Saint
<hi>Paule) is nothing in the world;</hi> and ſuch is thy conſcience, a
bug-beare, a Scar-crow, a <hi>Chimera</hi> of thine owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
imagination, or maleuolent invention: And
howſoeuer it may ſeeme right to thy ſelfe &amp; thy Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
or Sect maſters, <hi>the Yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, as the Lawes of God muſt guide our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in our rellgious duties, ſo the poſitiue Lawes of
the Kingdome muſt be the <hi>high-way</hi> wherein euery one
muſt vvalke in actiue obedience. And Kings and Iudges
are the diſpenſers and diſpoſers of theſe Lawes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to reaſon. Neither shall they need in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſatisfie euery priuate, curious, and contentious
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17493:37"/>
head, which pretending conſcience, vvill diſobey, or
to ſatisfie euery delinquent with arguments, for then
his worke were infinite; but ſtrictly and directly to open
the booke, and to execute the Lawe of the Land, and
euery liege-man is to acquieſſe therein. For the Iudge is,
or ought truly to bee, <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> and doth but tell vs
the Lawe, and shew vs the high-way in which wee muſt
walke; and if wee liſt not to walke in it, wee muſt be
content to ſuffer for our willfull folly, or walke out of
the vvay, out of the reach of the Lawe. And there is
great reaſon for this, for God hath ſet Kings as his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to execute Iuſtice and Iudgement, he expects it at
their hands; and where any euill fals out for lacke of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
the fault is the Magiſtrates, if there be Law to
preuent it; of him shall the ſoule be required which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
for lacke of gouernment; as the ſoule shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at the Paſtors hands, which perisheth for lacke
of inſtruction in the truth. Great reaſon is it therefore
he should haue power ouer ſuch as he muſt anſwere ſo
ſtrictly for, that he may punish them, or compell them
to come in, or keepe them for drawing others out of his
folde.</p>
               <p>So wee ſee, <hi>Iudg. 17. Micha</hi> ſets vp an Idol contrary to
Gods Lawe, he will haue a parlor-worship, a religion
by himſelfe: The reaſon of this error of knowledge and
conſcience is giuen there; <hi>Then there was no King in Iſrael,
but euery man did what ſeemed good in his owne eyes.</hi> So the
King is to ſee to Religion, and if Idolatry increaſeth, or
ſects, or ſchiſmes ariſe, it is counted the Kings fault,
if there bee a King; the fault ariſing heere for lacke of
a King: that is, of a fit perſon to execute the Lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Idolatry. Likewiſe in <hi>the 19. Chap. of Iudges,</hi> the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17493:37"/>
Leuites wife is defiled after an vnſatiable &amp; brutish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
The reaſon of this villaine, this iniuſtice, this error
in practiſe, is giuen as before, <hi>Then there was no King, &amp;c.
So all diſorders</hi> of life are for <hi>lacke of execution of Iustice:</hi>
for God gaue the People a Lawe in this caſe; ſo they
lacked not a law, but a Magiſtrate to execute it. Againe,
in the 21. Chap. of <hi>Iudg:</hi> There are two barbarous facts
mentioned; the firſt, the bloudy deſtruction of <hi>Iabes Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead;</hi>
the other, the rape of certaine virgins by fraude and
force, who came out, without feare of trechery, ſecurely
truſting to their owne innocence, and the peace of the
State. The reaſon of theſe diſorders is giuen as before;
<hi>Then there was no King in Iſrael, but euery man did what
ſeemed good in his owne eyes:</hi> There vvas a Lawe, but there
vvas none deſigned to execute it.</p>
               <p>Prayſed be God, vvee haue both King, Lawes,
Prieſts, and Iudges; how haps it then, that there are (I
do not ſay ſinnes, for there vvill be ſinnes as long as
there are men,) but ſuch common, open, crying ſinnes,
ſuch raigning, roaring, raging ſinnes, ſuch beaten roads,
common high-vvayes of ſinnes and ſinning, as if there
vvere no King, no Lawe, no Prieſt, no Iudge in <hi>England?</hi>
I ſpeake not of them, vvhich may pretend their excuſe
from the fraylty of our natures, and our procliuenes to
ſin, but of ſuch as are committed with a high hand, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
like theeues by the high-vvayes ſide at nooneday,
and robbing God of his glory, the Common-wealth of
their honor, and that vvith violence, vvith applauſe,
shaddowing their vnlawfull actions vnder the pretence
of Lawe it ſelfe, vvhich should reforme them. And
ſome of theſe for the manifeſtation of this point, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to bring to the barre to anſwere for themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:17493:38"/>
But ſee I shall not neede; for impudent <hi>Sacriledge</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
of himſelfe to confront the Pulpit and the bench
too; It is not a <hi>ſcarlet</hi> gowne that can fright <hi>Diues;</hi> for
he vvent in purple euery day. If Iuſtice helpe not, he
vvill ſtrangle <hi>Deuotion:</hi> for vvho vvill giue to God, if
the Diuell enioyes vvhat is giuen? Or vvho vvill giue
to the Clergie, to the poore, to charitable vſes, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt,
the prophane perſon, the vncharitable vvretch,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as he doth. It lyes only in the hands of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
to ſtop his mouth; for he hath got ſuch counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and ſupportance as he ſits in judgement, and hath
giuen ſentence (like the Man of ſinne) againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
that tithes are not due to them <hi>Iure Diuino;</hi> and
therefore he and his may ceize vpon them vvith <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
Impropriations, Prohibitions,</hi> like an other three-headed
<hi>Cerberus, Iure diabolico.</hi> The Country-people like
well, and vvill ſoone learne this leſſon, they thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it vvas no conſcience to pay tithes, but all being
due by almos, it vvas no theft, no ſacriledge, but vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and good huſbandry to keepe aſmuch backe as
they might; vvee expected reformation, and a reſtoring
of the oyle to the lampes, as God had lent theſe times
more light then others: But now there is cauſe to doubt
rather ſubſtraction, then to hope for reſtitution; much
leſſe to expect addition: <hi>Simony, Sacriledge,</hi> all are let
looſe and armed, and <hi>Iudas</hi> hath ſufficient colour to
ſaue like a theefe his oyntment from Chriſts members
and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> vnder pretence of charity, and releeuing
the poore; though Chriſt ſees the thiefe in <hi>Iudas</hi> heart;
and though <hi>Salomon</hi> knowes howſoeuer this <hi>way may
ſeeme right to themſelues, yet the end thereof is deſtruction to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17493:38"/>
the Church, and death to many a poore ſoule.</hi> But they are in
their vvay, rather vvilling to pay tenths to Sathan, then
to God; It is therefore ten to one, if one of ten, haue
grace to returne and to reſtore. God is iuſt, who, whilſt
they withdraw their hands and hearts from good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
his grace from their hearts; they may heare, but
they profit not to obedience and practiſe; He will not
ſuffer ſuch to gaine grace by the preaching of the Word,
vvho for their owne priuate gaine vvould ſtarue the
Preachers of the Word.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vſurer</hi> comes next as a brother in euill to <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
This muſt not now be called a ſinne, it is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
out of the Pulpit to be none; and it is growne to
be a profeſſion too, and the <hi>Vſurer</hi> is a free-man of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
company, but not <hi>free</hi> in any good cauſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
It was a ſin ſo vgly heeretofore, as none durſt
practiſe it, ſcarce durſt name it, but vvith the ſigne of
the croſſe, as if they had ſpoken of a Diuell: but it is now
ſo common, as he is ſcarce thought an honeſt man that
is not one: for he cannot be honeſt that is not rich, and
he cannot be rich vvithout this trade. This is the gulph
wvith ſinks and ſwallowes our Marchants, Clothyers,
Farmers, Owners, all. Men complaine of the Law, (and
that vvorthily) but this, this is the rocke that Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
all, and ſpoiles all trading and commerce, whilſt
the venter and hazard is the buyers and the ſellers; but
the certaine gaine fals betwixt both to the <hi>vſurer.</hi> This
Man payes neither duty to God nor the King, for his
trade hath no warrant from either. God forbids it, the
King tolerates it, as ſome States doe the practiſe of the
Stewes, or as our Sauiour ſaid of Diuorces, <hi>Moſes for the
hardnes of your hearts; ſuffered you to put away your wiues, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17493:39"/>
from the beginning it was not ſo;</hi> the time hath not beene
long, ſince this ſinne came in requeſt for a vertue; nor
will it bee long ere the practiſers shall ſee, <hi>that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the way ſeemes good in their owne eyes, yet the Yſſues
thereof are the wayes of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, the <hi>vſurer</hi> and the Sacrilegious perſon, who are
coupled like dogges, comes three together in a cluſter:
1. The <hi>Foreſtaller,</hi> 2. The <hi>Ingroſſer,</hi> 3. The <hi>Depopulator;</hi> as
ſeuerall <hi>ſpecies</hi> of one <hi>Genus;</hi> birds of a feather, who hang
together of a ſtring, and it is pitty they should not euer
ſo hang.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Foreſtaller</hi> (I meane not the petty foreſtaller of a
Fayre or Market, but the foreſtaller of Commodities in
a vvhole Country) bites cloſer then a Gooſe; for the
Gooſe eates all aboue the earth, but this beaſt eates
vp all commodities before they ſpring, aſſoone as they
are ſowne in the Earth, and therefore is a right earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme.</p>
               <p>2. Neither when I ſpeake of Ingroſſers, do I intend
petty perſons, who ingroſſe vp this or that commodity;
but the Ingroſſer of Farmes, who like another <hi>Cain</hi> takes
poſſeſſion of all, and will not indure any man to thriue
or liue by him. Euery Farme, euery trade, euery Sheepes-courſe
is his. Nothing fatts him but a deere yeare, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
drownes him but a deepe and long ſnow: for if
that melts not the ſooner, hee melts. He hath in his
hands perhaps what would imploy and maintaine ten
houſeholds, and he ſcarce keepes one. Thus he beggars
himſelfe, whilſt he is not able to ſtocke all his Farmes,
nor giue them that compaſſe,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Oecon. lib. Sterquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</note> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith is the
beſt; namely, to <hi>compaſſe the ground about often with the
owners feete:</hi> hee beggars his Landlord, whilſt once in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17493:39"/>
ſeauen yeeres he hangs his Leaſe on the hedge,<note place="margin">quod agro eſt opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> and
truſts to his heeles; he beggats the poore, whilſt he will
affoord them no abiding place in the Earth, nor no
imployment to preſerue them from Idleneſſe; and he
beggars the whole State, whilſt he breeds beggars, and
makes the ground vnfertile for lacke of tending; which
if it were in the hands of more, that could manure and
follow euery part; would yeeld more increaſe to the
<hi>Occupier,</hi> to the <hi>Maſter,</hi> and to the State of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The laſt of theſe is the <hi>Depopulator,</hi> who to inhanſe
his Rents, puls downe all the petty Tenements and
Farmes, and will haue none dwell neere him. Aſſoone
as this is done, he lackes neighbors; thus the iuſtice of
God vvhips him by his owne hand. Then he hyes to
the City, vvhere the <hi>Dicing-houſe</hi> vpon the right hand,
and the <hi>Drinking-houſe</hi> vpon the left hand, and the <hi>Drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing-houſe</hi>
before him, ſpends all that is left; or if any be
left, the <hi>tyre-woman,</hi> and the <hi>taylor,</hi> dogs and hawkes, and
Coach-horſes diuide it; and amongſt theſe he waſtes
all that, wherewith his predeceſſors feaſted themſelues,
and their poore neighbours. There are Lawes againſt
theſe, but often it concernes the <hi>Iury,</hi> the <hi>Iuſtices;</hi> nay,
the <hi>Iudges</hi> themſelues, and therefore the Lawes muſt be
ſilent in this caſe; for theſe <hi>wayes are good in their owne
eyes, though the Yſſues of them be the wayes of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There come next to hand three others, who depend
of thoſe that went before, and whoſe profeſſion is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with a kinde of warrantable deceite; namely, the
<hi>Malſter,</hi> the <hi>Brewer,</hi> the <hi>Alehouſe-keeper;</hi> theſe drinke vp the
State, as the other did eate it vp; and for their ſakes,
drunkenneſſe is thought a tollerable, nay, a neceſſary
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17493:40"/>
euill. Their pretences are the prouiſion for the poore,
or the raiſing of the price of corne, that the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may liue, and that the rackt Rent may not vndoe
him; but what he gets of theſe at the Barne dore, he
leaues at the Buttery-hatch. Mothes are no worſe in
cloth, ruſt in yron, nor whules in Mault, then theſe in
the Common-wealth. For ſince theſe were ſet vp, and
manly exerciſes cryed downe, our bodies are weakened
and corrupted, our ſpirits dulled, and made effeminate,
and we fitted for ſlauery, being euery day ouer-maſtered
and made ſlaues by drunkennes and exceſſe. And yet
there are ſome vvho ſuppoſe this trading to be as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the State, as <hi>Tobacco</hi> or the trade of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
and for my part I am eaſily induced to beleeue
them, vvhilſt I know the equall diſcommodity of all;
and <hi>ſee, that though their wayes ſeeme good to themſelues, yet
the Yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next theſe, the bribing <hi>Officer</hi> appeares, as in a
clowde; for his wayes are darke and paſt ſearching out,
except to him that can hold a candle before the Diuell.
<hi>Mammon</hi> brought him in, <hi>Mammon</hi> keepes him in, and
the exceſſe of his wife, child, ſeruants, giues notice to
all eyes, that ſuch brauery is not to be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bribes. And therefore vvhen poore men come to
paſſe any thing how iuſt ſoeuer, they are warned to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
their purſes vvide; and ſo whatſoeuer the cauſe bee,
their <hi>reedles eye</hi> shalbe made bigge enough for the <hi>Cable

               <p>God himſelfe muſt viſit for theſe ſinnes, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

               </p>
               <p>Now I haue proceeded ſo farre I vvill conclude
with him that is the cauſe of all this, and that's the
<hi>Courtly Thiefe;</hi> who begges a <hi>Patent,</hi> that all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to call him thiefe, he is rather a <hi>Beggar;</hi> not a beggar by
the Kings high-way, but a <hi>Beggar</hi> of the Kings <hi>high-way;</hi>
ſo that no man may paſſe vp and downe in courſe
of Lawe and Iuſtice but hee takes cuſtome. Surely he
hath begg'd ſo long, that he hath almoſt made vs all

               <p>But vvhat should I need to dwell longer vpon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
when not only this or that member, this or that

vpon <hi>Religion,</hi> are not our aduerſaries on all ſides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed?
Do not all places ſwarme with ſchiſmes, ſects,

was there euer ſuch defect of charity, as if indeed it
were true which ſome ſlander vs withall, that wee teach

that you had need of a Iury to inquire of their Sexes?
Conſider well if there be ſuch a thing as modeſty and

courage, manhood, and honour left amongſt men.
Looke vpon the higheſt, if they make any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

their dogs and horſes, and perhaps their sheepe, deere,
hogges; for theſe muſt all be fed before them:) Looke

all men, if ſinnes of all kinds doe not abound: See if
you can diſtinguish the man from the Maſter, but that
perhaps the man goes brauer, ſweates lowder, and
wilbe drunke ſooner. And if his Maſter keepe from
Church for conſcience ſake, he will keepe from thence
becauſe he hath no conſcience. Looke euery way if it
be not a shame to ſeeme good, much more to bee ſo:
If it be not a glory to regard neither God nor King, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

deſperate moode, iuſtle ſober and ſilent Iuſtice
from the wall into the Channell. Behold if <hi>want</hi> hath

want of ſtrength, want of courage, want of wit, want
of conſcience, want of grace; ſo that wee reſemble the
people of <hi>Laish</hi> ſpoken of in the 18. Chap. of the
Iudges, 7. 10. verſes, and ſo are a careleſſe, ſecure, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

               </p>
               <p>This is all true, all men ſee it and confeſſe it; but
where is the cauſe of this? Our ſinnes; they are both the
cauſe &amp; the effect; for ſinne is punished with ſinne: And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17493:42"/>
we that are euill Cuſtomers to defraud God of his due,
muſt looke to haue ſtrict &amp; ſeuere Searchers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers,

<hi>cauſa proxima</hi> of ſinne? Sinne is a cauſe indeed of ſinne,
but it is <hi>cauſa remota,</hi> ſo that euery eye cannot diſcerne
that cauſe. Why, the next cauſe of ſinne which euery
eye may ſee, is the lacke of <hi>Execution of good Lawes;</hi> wee
haue them, but thy lie as <hi>Henry</hi> the fifts Bowes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes

you of any thing, I am ſo confident of your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
Yet becauſe I know as you are the eyes of the
State, the eyes of his Maieſtie, ſo you muſt ſee by othermens
eyes, and heare by other mens eares, I turne me
therefore to them.</p>
               <p>Honorable Gentlemen, the King hath made you Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,

what you can, inform where you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, that the higher
power may. I know you know, you were not made Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of peace, to the end to be ſilent, but to ſpeake. He
is vnworthy of his place, vvho attaines it onely for his
owne grace, to hurt his enemies, profit his followers, to
vphold his faction and partie; and therefore attends his
profit or pleaſure rather then his calling, vvhere withall
he thinkes his conſcience is not charged; but that it is
enough for him to ſit on the Bench, to tell the Clocke,
and keepe his Cushion warme. You know, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe the contrarie; the Church, the Common-wealth
expects more from you, and I excite you to this
in their names.</p>
               <p>And you Gentlemen of the Grand-Enqueſt, and of
other Iuries, with chiefe Conſtables, and pety Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
I turne me to you: Conſider you are the eyes and
eares wherewithall <hi>Iuſtice</hi> ſees and heares; without you
shee is blind and deafe: let not preiudice or partialitie
take vp your affections therefore aforehand. Be not like
Band-dogs muzled for feare of biting: remember the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie,
authority and vſe of your places, and diſgrace
them not by your vnworthy cariage. The pooreſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
is an eye to the richeſt and wiſeſt Magiſtrate: but
few of them I feare haue eyes to ſee it; and that their Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates
would witneſſe, if they were ſtrictly examined,
which commonly are nothing but matter of forme, and
yet without either matter or forme.</p>
               <p>Conſider, I beſeech you, how Policie hath ſet one eye
ouer another, and how many eyes there are ouer-loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

their Counties and Corporations, vſing to chooſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
according as they were directed by letters or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Command, as if they had no freedomes, or wanted
ſufficient men of ther owne to ſupply thoſe places.
And remember alſo how before this laſt Parliament
his Maieſtie (hearing and beholding vvhat packing,
plotting, and vndertaking there had beene vſed in this
important buſineſſe) did command all men to forbeare
writing and vnderhand ſolliciting for the place, either
on their owne behalfe, or others; and aduiſed the people
to choſe freely, &amp; not to betray their owne liberties in
the choice. Better counſell you cannot haue.</p>
            <p>When therefore you heare of a Parliament towards,
let the Miniſters prepare the people, and warne them of
the worke in hand, and let ſuch as are Freeholders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
together, and (neglecting both their Landlords, or
great neighbours, or the Lord Liftenants themſelues)
looke vpon the wiſeſt, ſtouteſt, and moſt religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and be carefull to chooſe ſuch as haue no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie
vpon Greatnes, nor ſeeke change of the State,
Lawes, and Religion, nor hunt ambitiouſly for place,
honor, and preferment; for there is danger in theſe: but
he that is religious, vvill ſtand for his Countries good;
and in chooſing ſuch, you shall pleaſe God and the
King, and profit your ſelues, and your poſterity.</p>
            <p>Finally, let none amongſt you bee ſeene idlely to ſit
at home, whilſt theſe things are doing in the full Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as if it did not concerne you: but ride, runne, and
deale ſeriouſly herein, as for your liues and liberties
which depend heereupon. And as you ſee ſuch as are
contrary minded bandy themſelues together for their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17493:45"/>
party, to chooſe one of their opinion for their turne,
ſo ſee you doe the like, that you may countervvorke
them and hold the liberty you haue got; and the Lord
proſper you, and make you of one minde as one man,
that the Goſpell may ſtill flourish among you, that
<hi>mercy and truth may meete,</hi>
