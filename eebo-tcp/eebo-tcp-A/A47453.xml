            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BY the following Dialogues it is Apparent,
that by Industry alone a Man may get so
much Reputation almost in any Profession as
shall be sufficient to amuse the World, tho' he
has neither Parts nor Learning to support it. The
Person who makes the Chief Figure in them,
has certainly nothing but a bustling temper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him, and yet has gained so much upon
many People, that they will scarce believe the
Evidence of their own Senses; but 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that those who are not past cure may now
be undeceiv'd.</p>
            <p>I have treated him under two Characters:
as an Author and an Editor. In the former I
have consider'd his own personal Capacity: In
the other, his Judgment in the choice of his
Friends, and of the Discourses that he Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes.</p>
            <p>I know it may be said, he Writes in Hurry,
and has not time to correct and finish it. But
then who obliges him to Write at all? What
occasion is there for it? Or what is the use of
<pb facs="tcp:97227:3"/>
it? Besides he Publishes Notes forsooth, and
Peices of no more than 4, 6, or perhaps 8 lines;
and what time can there be required for the
Composal of such? 'Tis plain a Man that is
himself once possess'd of any Subject, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it to another, if he has but Language. If
his Head be clear, and the Things rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
in it, there can be no Difficulty in the
conveying them thence. But where a Man has
no real Parts; and is Master of only Scraps
pick'd up from one and from another, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of this Book or that, and these all
in confusion in his Head, 'tis obvious what a
Writer he must needs make. No, our <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actioneer</hi>
should have kept to his old way of
bustling, vying with Dr. <hi>Salmon</hi> at Auctions,
mustering up Books for a shew, and of
acting by Signs, Scrapes and Wriggles. Half-Sentences,
and broken Phrases, with these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances,
pass'd pretty well upon some. But
he must appear in Print, stript of them, and
now all's out; the World having got at length
the true Measure of his Abilities.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may seem strange, that I who am
no Member of the <hi>R. S.</hi> should deal so freely
with the Person, and some Correspondents, of
one who is slipp'd into the Post of Secretary to
that Illustrious Body. But I am mov'd by the
Respect I have for Natural Studies, and a fear
least those Men who have made such great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in it, and thereby gain'd the Applause
of all the Learned World, should lose any part
of it by the trifling and shallow Management
of one who wants every Qualification that is
<pb facs="tcp:97227:3"/>
requisite for such a Post. All who read his
<hi>Tranactions</hi> either in <hi>England,</hi> or beyond the
Seas, cry out that the Subjects which he writes
on are generally so ridiculous and mean: and he
treats of them so emptily; and in a Syle so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and unintelligible, that it is plain he's so
far from any usefull Knowledge, that he wants
even common Grammer. This is so Notorious
from every line he has published, that his own
Words will be the best Proof of what I say,
and I have been so carefull in producing them,
that I defie him to shew he is once Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Nay, there is so little need of that, that
I challenge any Man with all his Art to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Bulls and Blunders which he so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
pours forth.</p>
            <p>His Correspondents are most of them so like
himself for Learning and Understanding, that a
Man may almost swear they were cast in the
same Mold: Indeed he has had a very lucky
hit in the choice of them.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to see that Excellent Society in
any hazard of being Eclipsed by the wretched
Gambols of these People. Learned Men abroad
have ever verry justly had a vast esteem for
the English Society: But I find that now like to
decline; they having no other way of judging
of it but by the <hi>Philosophical Transactions.</hi> The
World every where looks on them as a kind
of Journal of the R. Society, tho' there's no
Ground for that Opinion; for they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> who all along declar'd
the R. Society were not concern'd in those
Transactions, but that they were a Work of
<pb facs="tcp:97227:4"/>
his own and some Friends. At that time they
were carry'd on in such a manner that they met
every where with Approbation, and were of
real use. But since this new Secretary-ship all
agree a more useless Paper no where appears,
and I was concern'd that such a one should pass
for a Work of the R. Society.</p>
            <p>'Tis their Vindication that has drawn me to
undertake this, and if I can but disabuse the
World by it I have my end. I can truely say
that I have no personal Prejudice to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Transactioneer</hi> or any of his Friends; For
I am but little known to any of them: And
if they now think I have no design to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
myself to their Acquaintance, I fancy the
Reader will not believe they are mistaken.</p>

               <p>Pray Sir let me desire you to give

            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>The Dignity of the Subject will

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, His meaning is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
'Tis as much as if one should say,
this Elephant is an Apple-Tree. Now I hope
'tis plain? There are some tatling People
likewise that say, they cann't tell what he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97227:8"/>
means by <hi>Astroitidis</hi> neither: They say
there is no president of any such word; but
if they look into the <hi>Jamaican Catalogue</hi>
they'l find thousands of like kind. Why a
Person of his Figure may make Presidents
Man! For what follows, one poor simple
Fellow that read it thought it had been a
Charm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Verry like! But pray Sir how are
we to interpret him, when he says, the
<hi>Limestone Marble</hi> that was <hi>found in Wales</hi>
and was a <hi>Coral,</hi> and the <hi>Lapidis,</hi> and the
Lord knows what, <hi>grew in the Seas ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to</hi> Jamaica? Besides what he has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
its being <hi>found</hi> and <hi>found</hi> again has
almost confounded me I must confess. His
Intelligencer says, 'twas <hi>found in Wales.</hi> He,
that it <hi>grows in the Seas of Jamaica:</hi> That
<hi>it is frequently found Fossile</hi> (mark the
Phrase) in <hi>England:</hi> That he <hi>has some of it
found here, which was many years since found
out by Mr.</hi> Beaumont: That <hi>there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things found in the Seas of</hi> Jamaica, <hi>not
to be found in these Parts, (i. e.</hi> in <hi>England)
which are frequently to be dug up in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Parts of</hi> England, <hi>where</hi> yet after all
<hi>they do not grow.</hi> This in my sense is to
say it was <hi>found in Wales</hi> but <hi>grow in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica:</hi>
'Twas <hi>frequently found in England,</hi>
and by way of reinforcement 'twas <hi>found
here,</hi> and <hi>many years since found.</hi> And that
<hi>there are many things growing in those Seas,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97227:8"/>
are frequently dug up</hi> (or found) <hi>in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
parts of</hi> England, <hi>where yet they do
not grow,</hi> or are not found. This to a Man
of Ordinary Understanding is pretty odd!

               <p>I profess, it argues much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Judgment, and insight into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
and Constitution of a Human Body.
But for a farther Confirmation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Judgment, I shall add, a Caution he
hath seasonably given to the World, relating
to the use of <hi>Cynocrambe,</hi> see Numb. 203.
for <hi>Matthews and his Wife and Three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
having been lately very ill and like to
dye</hi> by eating too much of it. Our Learned
Annotator, gives the following Advice,
<hi>Whether the Quality or Quantity of this Herb
were the Cause of its Effects I know not, but
I think, that every body will do well to be
cautious and wary in the use of it in such
Quantities after such a warning.</hi>

               <p>Truly, I think, the Author has
done extraordinary well to caution the
World; for if it had such dreadful Effects
upon <hi>Matthews</hi> and his Wife; it would have
been a great Reflection upon the Prudence
of such People, as, through Indiscretion,
should have suffered by it, <hi>after so fair a

more for the benefit of Mankind; for after
he hath informed us,<note place="margin">Numb. 253.</note> That <hi>there are many
People who are of Opinion, that the swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stones or Pebbles is very beneficial to the
Health, because they see Birds languish unless
they swallow Gravel or small Stones.</hi> He
adds, <hi>I was consulted, but was always against
this Practice in Men, for I knew one that
dyed by the use of them.</hi> Now what a vast
insight into the Effects of Non-Naturals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Human Bodies must a Man have to be
thus aware of them. <hi>I was always against

is a Rarity that few People have thought
worth their while to write Dissertations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
or indeed, worth their Notice; but I
can assure you, our Virtuoso, who is indeed
the wonder of his Age, values it at a high
Rate, and hath taken care to adorn several

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97227:12"/>
values any thing that comes from the <hi>Indies</hi>

               <p>A great deal of satisfaction, indeed

               <p>
                  <hi>Why, the Learned Author hath
made this useful Comment upon it, says he,</hi>
Whatever pleasure the <hi>Chineses</hi> may take in
thus picking their Ears. I am certain most
People in these Parts who have had their
Hearing impaired, have had such Misfortunes
first come to them, by picking their Ears too
much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Why then were they brought into

               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>The chief design was to entertain
the Philosophical Secretary; for he took as
much satisfaction in looking upon the Ear-Picker
as the <hi>Chinese</hi> could do in picking
his Ears. And truly I think that Learned
Naturalist is obliged in Gratitude to make
some sutable Return of our English Rarities
to the <hi>Chinese.</hi> And I hope in time to see in
the <hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> not only the
Pictures and Descriptions of all the old Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zors
and ill-shapen Knives in <hi>China;</hi> but it
is to be hoped that the Rarities of our own

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Yes by all means; especially since
they may be purchased at so cheap a Rate;
for any Cobler about the Town will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to communicate an odd figured Knife

            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Contribute to the Advancement
of Natural Knowledge? There's no doubt
of it, or any thing of less moment; for there
is not an odd coloured or an ill shapen Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Kingdom, but the Secretary will
manage it so as to make it contribute to the
general heap of Transactions; he makes it
his peculiar Business; and of late he's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               <p>Numb. 247. This Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
gives an account of a kind of <hi>Down of a
dark yellowish snuff colour, shining like silk,
some of it a quarter of an Inch long;</hi> and that
which makes it more remarkable, is, not
only its being like Snuff and like Silk
but it also resembles the <hi>Lanugo of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

at the same time.</hi>

make of it?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I profess, we are much obliged to
the Doctor, for he's a great Promoter of
Philosophical and Innocent Mirth; for there
is scarce any thing that is Comical and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting,
but he takes care to place it in the

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97227:14"/>
we are oblig'd to the Doctor for from beyond
Seas; for says he, N.</hi> 232. A Fellow of the
College of Physitians and Royal-Society did me
the favour sometime since, to shew me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Number of Fossile Bones and Shells
of several sorts he had lately come to his
Hands from <hi>Maryland.</hi> One of these Fossiles
I had the favour to carry home with me to
compare with the Tongue of a Fish I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and comparing them we
found a perfect agreement of the Tongue that
was dug up in <hi>Mary-land,</hi> and that taken from
the Pastinaca Marina, frequent in the Seas
of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> A part of one of the joints of
this Tongue was dug up in <hi>England.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>You mistake the Design, it was
never intended to advance Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
For who's the wiser for knowing
that the Bones of a dead Fish have been dug
up, or where? No, the true use of the
Story is to amuse the Ignorant; for if they
Talk of things that are out of the way; we
presently make an Harangue about <hi>the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibulum
of a Pastinaca Marina found Fossile</hi>

As for Example, Numb. 240. He gives us
Account of one Edmund Melleon, Born at

of his Cubit Two Foot Two Inches; of his Arm
Three Foot Two Inches and a half; from the

<hi>Pall-Mall</hi> at <hi>London</hi> lived one <hi>Clark,</hi> who was
called the Posture Master; that had such an
absolute Command of his Muscles and Joynts,
that he can (i. e. could) dis-joynt almost all his
whole Body. He was a well grown Fellow, yet
he would appear in all the Deformities that
can be imagined, as Hunch-backed, Pot-bellied
Sharp-breasted; he dis-joynted his Arms,
Shoulders, Legs and Thighs, that he will
(instead of would) appear as great an Object
of Pity as any Man, and he has often Impos'd
on the same Company where hath been just
before to give him Money, as a Cripple. He
turns his Face into all shapes, so that by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

            <sp>

               <p>Yes Sir, and therefore your Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>They are frequently run a-shore
on the <hi>Orkney</hi> Islands, Numb. 222. <hi>They are
thrown up pretty frequently in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and are no otherwise regarded than as
they serve to make Snuff-Boxes.</hi> Yet they
shew them much more favour than we do
our Beans; for they are devoured by
Horses and Hogs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>These are strange Beans indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, says he, <hi>I have had a
great desire to see what these Beans were,</hi>
they talked so much of them, thinking they
might be something more than Beans.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>And did he get a sight of them at
the last?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and discovered, that <hi>Three
of them grew in</hi> Jamaica,. <hi>The First is called
Cocoons, by me Phaseolus maximus perennis
folio decomposito Lobo, maximo contorto.</hi> It
is well figuered <hi>by the Name Perim Kaku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valli
in the Hortus Malabricus, and ill figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in another Place;</hi> and ill described in
this Place.</p>
               <p>The Second sort of Bean is called the Horse-Eye-Bean,
for its resemblance to the Eye of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97227:17"/>
that Beast, by reason of a Hilus almost sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
it.</p>
               <p>The Third kind of Bean, is called the Ash-coloured
Nickar, as being very like a Nickar.</p>
               <p>The Fourth kind of Bean, is well described
and ill figured by <hi>Clusius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now I come to the Navigation; for</hi>
How these several Beans should come to the
Scotch Isles and one of them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> seems
very hard to determine. <hi>Yet our Author says
too;</hi> It is easy to conceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>How can that be? <hi>Hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and easie to be determined too!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>If you'll have patience you'll see
it is hard to determine; for they might be
toss'd with Storms and driven out of the
most Obvious Road; but <hi>it is easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that growing in</hi> Jamaica <hi>in the Woods,
they may either fall from the Trees into the
Rivers, or be any other way conveighed by them
into the Seas. It is likewise very easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that being got to the Sea, and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it,</hi> and the Neighbourhood denying
them the Liberty of Landing in their own
Country, they may take a Resolution of
Transplanting themselves into another
Country, <hi>and meeting with a stop on the
main Continent of</hi> America, <hi>is forced</hi> (mark
the Grammar, they <hi>is forced) through the
Gulph of</hi> Florida, <hi>or</hi> Canal <hi>of</hi> Bahama, <hi>going
there constantly</hi> East <hi>and into the</hi> North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican-<hi>Sea.
But how they should come the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97227:17"/>
rest of their Voyage I cannot tell;</hi> (for they
could give no Account of themselves, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Beans being brought</hi> North <hi>by the
Current of the Gulph of</hi> Florida, <hi>are put in
the westerly Winds way, and may be supposed
by this means at last to arrive in</hi> Scotland;
litle thinking, that after so long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a Voyage, instead of Propagating their
Species, <hi>they should be turned into Snuff-Boxes,
and no otherwise regarded.</hi>

               <p>Phoo! There was no need of giving

            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Gentleman! He's a Doctor of
Physick, and understands the Structure of a
Mans Body so well, that not the least Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
can happen in any Part of it, but he
presently gives you the Rationale of it. To
confirm what I have said in this Respect. I
need alledge no more, than what he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
concerning Suffocation, for when the
Point was Debated at <hi>Hartford</hi> Sizes about
Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi>'s being Drownned; he very
Learnedly delivered his Opinion of Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97227:18"/>
in the following words; and says,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And does he prove it too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Prove it? Therer's no need of
proving it, 'tis self-evident; nevertheless,
to convince those who do not use to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
by the Gullet, he adds, <hi>Drunkards who
swallow freely a great deal of Liquor, and those
who are forced by the Civil-Law to Drink a
great quantity of Water have no Suffocation,
or Drowning upon them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Truly those are Two Instances
sufficient to convince any Reasonable Man,
that he may be Drunk, or Drink Water
without being Drowned: But what's this
Learned Man's Definition of Drowning?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He says,</hi> He takes Drowning in
a great measure, to be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho'
it is very likely, when one struggles (he may
to save himself from being Choaked) swallow
some Quantity of Water, yet that is not the
cause of his Death; but that which goes into
the Wind-pipe and Lungs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>If <hi>swallowing Water</hi> is not <hi>the cause
of his Death;</hi> how does that which goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wind-pipe cause it, does not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
swallow that? Or does he swallow it
<hi>to save himself from being choaked?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:97227:18"/>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Swallow it to prevent Choaking?
By no means; he does not swallow it at all.
<hi>It goes into the Wind-pipe;</hi> and tho' Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
swallowed will not Choak; yet when
it goes into the Lungs it will; which this
Learned Physitian thus Demonstrates, <hi>In
Prescriptions when People are very weak,
or forced to take Medicines, I have observed
some Spoonfuls in that Condition (if it went
the wrong way) to have Choaked or Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Person;</hi> whence it appears, that
Choaking is not caused by swallowing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but by its entrance <hi>the wrong way.</hi> In
which Case it may be said <hi>to go into the
Lungs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But what's this to the Question
first Debated?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Virtuos.</speaker>
               <p>Why, The Qustion being put
Whether the Woman was Strangl'd and so
<hi>Suffocated;</hi> or whether she was Drowned?
Our Learned Evidence, only offers to shew,
That if she was Suffocated or <hi>Choaked</hi> by
Water, it must get into her Lungs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in those that are <hi>Choaked</hi> or Strangled,
nothing at all gets into them. So that the
Sum of our Doctor's Evidence proves, That
if she was Strangled or Choaked before
she was thrown into the Water, she could
not be <hi>Choaked</hi> again in the Water, except
<hi>Water went the wrong way,</hi> as <hi>in Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c. And thus much might be sufficient
to shew our Doctor's great Skill in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97227:19"/>
of a Body: One of the main Points
necessary in an Accomplish'd Physitian. But
as a further Instance of his great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I shall add another Passage of his
Evindence, which is, That <hi>without force
after Death little Water will get into the
Stomach, because for that it should swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is necessary, which after Death cannot
be done.</hi> In which Passage the Phrases not
only come very Naturally from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
(as <hi>for that it should,</hi> &amp;c.) but he very
Judiciously tells us, that Men cannot swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after Death, and therefore those who
would put Water into a Dead Man must
use force to get it in. Which I think, is
a demonstration of the Doctor's great Skill
in Anatomy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed, and if all you have
said of him be True, he's not only a great
Physitian, but a Botanist, and a Naturalist,
and every thing. Pray where does he live,
and what are his Hours? I have something
to communicate to him, which perhaps
may be acceptable.</p>

               <p>His Hour in an Afternoon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97227:19"/>
you must be sure to Compliment
him; and he'll take it very kindly, for the
Envious World so seldom does it, he'll be
both surpriz'd and mightily pleased at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I shall take care to Compliment
as well as I can; and I don't know well
how I can fail, for I can think of none of
his Performances but I must either hold my
Tongue, or Compliment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>SIR, I am very glad I have
the Happiness to meet
with you, so opportunely;
I have been just now Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Friend of yours concerning some
Passages in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions:</hi>
And the great Character he hath given you,
and the Learned Passages of your own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
which he hath Collected together to
justify that Character, have made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
till I had the Happiness, to pay my

            <sp>

               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the chife end of my Visit now,
next to paying my Respects to you, is to
Communicate some Philosophical Matters,
which if you think fit to Publish in your
<hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> are at your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, at present I shall only offer
you a Definition of a Shell, and a Crust.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>I desire a sight of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Shell properly is such a hard

                  <note place="margin">N. 219.</note>

an Oyster-shell: A Crust is such a hard sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

you light of any thing of this Nature you
will oblige me very much in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, and do the World a great deal of
service.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I am obliged to the

               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, you have taken a great deal
of Pains already; for the Compiling so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Philosophical Volumes in <hi>Quarto,</hi> must
take up a great deal of Time, nor could
they be made fo Polite and Correct, without
as great Application.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>It is indeed, a Laborious Work;
for besides Compiling of so many Volumes;
the great Correspondence which I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to keep, is no small trouble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>It cannot chuse but be troublesome,
but your Happy Choices and the Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Returns they make you recompense the
Trouble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>If it were not for that, it would
be a meer peice of Slavery; but as you say,
the Discoveries and Improvements which
are Communicated by my Correspondents
make me value the Trouble much less; for
I think, for Weight, Usefulness, and other
Circumstances, the Papers I have Published
in the <hi>Transactions</hi> are not inconsiderable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Inconsiderable! You have quite
out-done Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> for the World ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought he Published enough; but you
heap Philosophical Relations together at
such a Prodigious Rate, that you Publish
<hi>Transactions</hi> as fast again as they desire you.
The World is quite over-powered with them.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly I have used my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Diligence and Care, that not the least
thing in Nature should escape my Notice,
And I am infinitely obliged to my Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents
for their Industry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Truly they are to be commended;
But methinks it would be of great use to the
World, if the most Considerable Passages
in those Papers were Collected together,
and Published for the use of the Learned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>I have done that already; and
if you please <hi>I</hi> will give you an Account of
those which I have a more peculiar Relish
for, and value at the highest Rate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir. it will be a very great Favour,

               <p>I can never be to seek where
to begin then, as long as there is such a
Personage as Mr. <hi>J—Pet—r</hi> in the
Philosophical World. He's a F. of the <hi>R. S.</hi>
indeed! I made him so. 'Tis my way of
Rewarding my Friends and Benefactors.
We now begin to call it <hi>Our Royal-Society</hi>
(<hi>mus Pet.</hi> C. 5.) One would never think it
that looks upon him, but he's certainly the
Darling of the <hi>Temple Coffee. House Club.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what's that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Oh lay! Why don't you know?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97227:22"/>
Where can you have lived? Why you must
be an utter Stranger to Philosophy, and all
<hi>pretty Things?</hi> never heard of the <hi>Temple</hi>
Club? Oh for shame, let's see you there a
<hi>Friday</hi> Night. I'm President there, and I'll
assure you there are many <hi>odd Things.</hi> And
Mr. <hi>Pet—r</hi> is, Gad he's every thing.
He's the very Muffti, the Oracle of our Club.
For my part I never saw any thing like him
exactly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>No, I believe not.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Oh then I perceive you know

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>No, I wonder at that, you ought
to be acquainted with him. I'll be the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of bringing it about. Sir, he and I
are all one. You must know we club No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
laying them up in a kind of Joynt-Stock,
and have all things in common:
Sometimes he draws, and sometimes I, as
we have occasion. But he pays in most
plenteously. By my good-will I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be without him. I call him the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and he me <hi>Don.</hi> I own I

               <p>Yes, I knew 'twas quicker and
cheaper than at <hi>Leyden</hi> or <hi>Padua,</hi> so I was
Dubb'd Doctor there. <hi>En passant,</hi> whip and
away. But for Mr. <hi>Pet—r</hi> he's an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and has Treated on the same Topicks
that I have. Have you read the <hi>Musaeum

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>No really; but I observe, all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
smile when they mention him, I believe
he's mighty Diverting.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>The most of any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But how should a Man of his Parts
be otherwise? Oh the <hi>Specimens of Modern
Magnificence and Improvement,</hi> he has given
the Learned World (<hi>Trans. N.</hi> 236.) His
First <hi>Century, consists of several Animals and
Plants wholly New. (Trans.</hi> N. 224. And
pray mark how Considerable they are; and
how much Mankind are indebted to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Study. The <hi>Animals</hi> are <hi>Snails,
and Beetles, Caterpillars, Spiders,</hi> and others
of the like sort: The Plants <hi>Rushes, Thistles,
Mosses,</hi> with abundance more of equal
worth. But above all, <hi>Butterflies</hi> are his
main Delight. He gives'em strange Cramp
Names, and values himself for being the
first Catcher. <hi>Papilos leucomelanos,</hi> says he, <hi>is
not yet clearly Described by any Author,
Trans. N.</hi> 224. And perhaps had never been
<hi>Described,</hi> wo the day! had it not been for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97227:23"/>
this <hi>Author.</hi> He looks as big upon his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanick
Acquisitions. Say he, Be it known
that <hi>I have this Year (besides several before)
received near</hi> 20 <hi>Volumes in Folio filled with
fair and perfect Specimens of Trees, (Mus
Pet.)</hi> But he's most lucky in the assigning
the Reasons of the Names of his Rarities.
He has <hi>Shells called BLACKMOORS
TEETH, I suppose,</hi> says he, <hi>from their
WHITENESS. (Trans.</hi> N. 224.) Now
we are on this Subject, I ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, he values nothing that has not
as many Titles and Names as the King of
<hi>Persia.</hi> He will find in one Author or other
20 Names for the same Thing! And thinks
it impossible <hi>to Enumerate the many Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that will occur from thus synomizing of
Authors</hi> (ib.) and Elsewhere he speaks very
big of the <hi>English,</hi> that is himself and me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>as
to their Critical Methods in their Discoveries
of Non-descript Species, and their Judicious
References to the synonimous Names of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Writers, whereby the terrible Vices of
Confusion and Multiplicity have been much
Corrected. (Trans.</hi> N. 236.) There's my Style
too exactly: Only a little more clear. He's
as successful in his Descriptions as in his
<hi>Synonimizings.</hi> Take an Instance in his
<hi>Tortoise,</hi> says he, <hi>'Tis guarded along the Back

Use to the Curious, is, the great Skill
in Botanicks, Observable in my other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents,

it hath not only been discovered by

eating of the said Popy Pye, whilst hot, was
presently taken with such a kind of a Diliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
as made him fancy that most that be

being a White Earthen one, after having
purged by stool into it; he broke it into peices,

were all Gold.</hi>

               <p>O dear Sir! There was an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity to be exact in Particulars, for
had he only told us, that the Herb Purged
and caused a <hi>Dilirium,</hi> how must we have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97227:25"/>
known that he made use of an Earthen-Chamber-Pot,
that he purged into it, and
then broke it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Truly as you say we should have
been altogether at a loss there: And to speak
Truth; the most diverting Circumstances
would have been wanting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, The Pleasant Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
set off the Story, for People purge into
Chamber-Pots and are <hi>Dilirious,</hi> that never
took <hi>Papaver Corniculatum.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But pray, What does this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Advancement of Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact,</speaker>
               <p>If it encreases Knowledge, it
certainly advances it: And pray, Does not
a Man know more that knows the Chamber-Pot
was broke, than he that hears of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium,</hi>
and Purging? But these were not
all the Effects of <hi>Papaver Corniculatum.</hi>
For, <hi>The Man and Maid Servants, having
also eat of the same Pye, strip'd themselves
quite naked, so danced one against another
a long time.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Truly they had more satissaction
in their <hi>Dilirium,</hi> than the Master could
have in breaking a dirty Chamber-Pot, one
would think. But did not the Master and

               <p>If they had, it would have
been <hi>Papaver Corniculatum</hi> inddeed, but I
cannot tell that; only <hi>The Mistriss, who was
gone to Market, coming home, and saying

turned her brich against her, and purging

               <p>After they had been about Two
Hours in Bed, One of the Children fell very
sick, and so did the other Two presently after,
which obliged the Man and his Wife to rise,
and take the Children to the Fire, where they
<hi>spewed</hi> and <hi>shit,</hi> and within half an Hour fell
fast asleep.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, I think this <hi>Cynocrambe</hi> is

I think 'tis worse, for</hi> they took the Children
to Bed as they were asleep, and they themselves
went to Bed too, and fell faster asleep too than
ever they had done before. The Man waked
next Morning about Three Hours after his
usual time, went to his Labour at Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,</hi>

long, and frequently dipped his Chin in it as
he was at Work.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, Expatiate no more upon

               <p>O good Sir, Pardon me, be as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial

boiled Herbs and Bacon for Supper; the
Children Purged; the good Man Slept lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than ordinary; went to Work at Mr.
<hi>Newports;</hi> filled his Hat full of Water,
and was so discerning as to think his Chin
was all the Day in the Fire, tho' he dipped
it often in Water. A very Philosophical
Relation, I must needs say, and very fine

               <p>Sir, He had the Misfortune to
be Scratched by the Tooth of a <hi>Porpos,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after the death of it, so that <hi>tandem

               <p>Truly I think the Doctor had been
happy had he never been sick any where

Author, I fear a Metastasis of the

               <p>I should be concerned for
him should it be so. But I shall proceed
to Relate, what I just now promised
you, <hi>viz.</hi> Some of the most Remarkable
Observations in Physick and Chirurgery,
And first, I shall give you an account
of two Medicated Springs, the one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to me by a <hi>Welch</hi> Philosopher,<note place="margin">A Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spring.</note>
and the other by a <hi>French Man;</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the first is as follows. <hi>There is a
Rill about an Ell broad between two Collines,
covered with Wood, about twelve yards from
this Spring; The Rill, which falls from a
Rock eight or nine foot high, which makes a
very grateful Noise.</hi> Numb. 233.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>A very fine Description of a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
Spring;</hi> surely that <hi>grateful Noise</hi>
will invite several Curious Persons to take
a view of it: But is that the only Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Quality?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Trans.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that our Philosopher take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. But he tells us farther,</hi> The Spring
comes out of a pure white Marle; I thought
there had been no white Marle in Wales, for
the Earth is red.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>An Admirable Thought indeed!
And it's a Wonder there is any Chalk in
<hi>England,</hi> for the Soil is not of that Colour;
this Ingenious Conclusion puts me in mind
of those Verses in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Melibaee, putavi</l>
               <l>Stultus ego huic Nostrae similem—</l>
               <l>Sic Canibus catulos similes, sic Matribus haedos</l>
               <l>Noram; sic Parvis componercere Magna
solebam.</l>
               <p>And he must needs be a Man of Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sagacity in my Opinion, to conclude all
things he knew not, were like those he had
before his Eyes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>But that's not all that may be
said, for our Philosopher, for he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adorned his Account of this Spring with
a Description of a Tree that grows over it,
for says he, <hi>About the Spring spreads an
Old Oak with Hoary Moss on the boughs
whereof two Crutches.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gont.</speaker>
               <p>A great Ornament indeed! And
That <hi>grateful Noise, the Hoary Moss</hi> and <hi>the
two Crutches in the Oak</hi> must needs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to the Advancement of Natural
Knowledge, and to the understanding the
Nature of this Medicated Spring.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Truly I must needs own, the</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:97227:30"/>
French <hi>Philosopher hath quite outdone him
in that Point, for in his Account of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Waters at St.</hi> Amands, <hi>he tells us not
what Trees grow about it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 247.</note> 
                  <hi>But that</hi> most
Sick People are willing to drink some, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to swallow in great Glasses, their Health
along with that Water. <hi>And likewise, That</hi>
Acid Spirits have not fermented at the first
with that Water, but afterwards it hath
made some little Bubbles, which remained to
the sides of the Glasses, wherein were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Liquors. <hi>Now this Story I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
mightily, especially for the Elegancy

               <p>Yes, It is Extraordinary, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as fine as your own: <hi>Remained to the

and much better than <hi>stuck to them,</hi> Besides
he hath said something of the Nature of the
Waters.</p>

                  <hi>And he farther tells us;</hi> One

<hi>as Hogs do in our Country. But to proceed

Many in the High-lands, who pretend not to
any Skill in Surgery; do venture to cut the

and prescribe for a Remedy thereafter, a peice
of Bread and Cheese.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's very remarkable indeed, for

               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>I think indeed I may as well

               <p>Pray what may it be?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>That's a hard Question to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But I am sure it is True. For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an Account of it from one of my

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Num. 233. He tells us,
That <hi>the Inhabitants of St.</hi> Kilda <hi>are every
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97227:31"/>

               <p>That's odd indeed; But how do
they Cure it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>The usual remedy is Giben drank

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>So that the Qualities of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are as occult as the Cause of the
Cough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, The Cause of the
Cough is evidently the Chamberlins Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thus much being said relating to
Physick, I should immediately proceed
to tell you <hi>the Symptoms of Two Brass
Farthings,</hi> But I think it more Instructive to
communicate to you some Cautions about
Marrying too soon, and some things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Midwifry. And First it hath been
observed,<note place="margin">Arguments against Marrying soon.</note> Numb. 233. That <hi>Anna George,
who continued in the State of Virginity till the

in Nevis</hi> who Married before she was in the

this misfortune. <hi>Her Navel did begin to

               <p>Pray Sir, don't Compliment
me; what I do is for the good of Mankind,

               <p>Truly Sir, you are very Modest,

               <speaker>Tranct.</speaker>
               <p>Ay! Pray forbear any thing of that
Nature; It's better to pass our time away in
Inquiries after Knowledge, than Compliments.
And therefore I shall proceed to acquaint you
with several promiscuous Observations in
Natural History, which I am infinitely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to my Correspondents for, and which
you will say the World will be obliged to
me for putting them in the <hi>Philosophical
Transactions.</hi> And First, I shall let you
know, That <hi>of late the poor People have set
their Wits, as if it were on the Tenter-hooks,

the Language of your Correspondent so

very exact in getting from a person who was

be too tedious at this time.</hi> See Numb. 205.
I thought likewise to have told you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>They may imitate, but they'll

               <p>O dear, mighty Diverting.
But pray have you heard of such a Bird as
the <hi>Scart?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Because I am going to tell you
something of it, which is Remarkable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97227:36"/>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what's that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why, Numb. 133. we are told,
That</hi> all Tribes of Birds are observed to have
their Sentinels.<note place="margin">A Scart that stood Sentinel, surpriz'd.</note> The watchfulness of the
Scart is true to a Proverb. I know one who
by surprizing the Sentinel, catched 300 in a
Night.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's Remarkable indeed: So
that if a <hi>Virtuoso</hi> hath a mind to catch
Scarts, he must endeavour to surprize the
Sentinel. Is not that the Philosophical use
you make of this Story?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, That's the way to
catch Scarts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's sure of mighty use in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy: To know how to catch
Scarts, makes a Man much wiser.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly, it's something, to
know how to surprize them. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
Numb. 225.<note place="margin">Fish diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> we are informed, That
<hi>Fish are not only different from other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
but likewise differ very much from one
another, there being scarce a Species of them,
that hath not remarkable differences.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's really very true, for the Herring
is much different from the Lobster, and the
Lobster differs much from the Whiting, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97227:36"/>
the Whiting from the Cockle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>But besides this more obvious
Observation it's worth Remarking. That
<hi>Fish have their Blood Naturally less hot than
ours. So that the Natural Heat of Ours
would be a Fever in them and Mortal:</hi> For
which Reason they Drink no strong Liquors,<note place="margin">No Fish dye of a Fever,</note>
such as Ale, Beer or Wine; but live conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in the Water, and drink nothing
else. But whether they do this by Instinct,
or Tradition I am not yet informed; but
this I can say. I never heard, that so much
as one ever dyed of a Fever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's very Remarkable indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they dye of other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
for</hi> Fish are found to dye in Water
frozen over. <hi>Occasion'd by the freezing of
the Water.</hi> Their Fins and Tail assist them
in their Passage through the Water, whether
they will; but the dilation of the Air in the
Bladder makes them capable of Swimming, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner as the dilating of the
Lungs, and Thorax bear him up in Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Very well observed indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Flat Fish have none of this Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for they are able by reason of their
Breadth to keep themselves upon the Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But I think a broad Stone is as apt

<hi>Wrotham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> about Two Acres, which
is far from the Sea, or any Branch of it, and
a Place where there are no Fish-Ponds, but a
scarcity of Water, was all overspread with
little Fishes, conceived to be Rained down,
there having been at that time a great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
of Thunder and Rain: The Fishes were
about the length of a Man's little Finger, and
judged by all that saw them to be young Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
The Field belonged to one <hi>Hare</hi> a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<hi>But why they should fall into this Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's

your farther Account of the late Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</p>

                  <hi>The next Story I shall relate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The effects of <hi>Greatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ax</hi> his stroaking.</note>
                  <hi>is this, Numb.</hi> 256. Mr. <hi>Greatrix</hi> coming
to our House, and hearing of my Brother's
Illness, desired to see him, he ordered the
Boy to strip himself to his Shirt, which he did,
and having given present ease to his Head by
only stroaking him with his Hands, he fell to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97227:42"/>
rub his Back, which he most complained of.
But the Pain being frightened, presently fled
from his Head to his Right Thigh; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it there, it fell to his Knee, from
thence to his Leg, but he still pursued it to
his Ancle, thence to his Foot, and at the last
to his great Toe. As it fell lower, it grew
more violent, especially when in his great Toe,
it made him roar out; but upon rubbing it
there, it <hi>stole out at his Toe-end;</hi> and the
Boy cryed out, it's quite gone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, this Story is very Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical,
Medicinal, and Circumstantial.
And first, for the Circumstances, That
<hi>Greatrix</hi> has a desire to see the Boy; That
he desired the Boy to strip; seem very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Preparatives for the Cure, which to
me is not a little surprizing; for how this
Humour should be so <hi>frightened,</hi> and have
such an Antipathy to <hi>Greatrix</hi>'s Hand as to
run away from it, and that too where there
was no Passage or Vessels for it to pass
through, I cannot comprehend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is indeed very strange. But
this</hi> Greatrix <hi>hath done more than that;
for</hi> a Smith whose Name was <hi>Peirson,</hi> near
us, had Two Daughters, extremely troubled
with the Evil; the one in her Thigh, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in her Arm: He Cured them both at my
Father's, one of them lives still in the Town,
I was with her Yesterday, she is a healthy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Mother of several Children, she
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97227:43"/>
shewed me her Arm. <hi>But whether the other
shewed her Thigh, or not, I think not at all
material to relate. But this</hi> Greatrix <hi>had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
very excellent Quality,</hi> for he would
presently take off Fits of the Mother, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Glove on their Heads.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, was your Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Compos Mentis,</hi> when he sent you that
Relation, or was he in a Fright?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Because he seems to be out of
Breath, or to Breath short in his Account of
the Smith's Daughters; one would think,
his inconnexion an effect either of some
disaffection of his Intellectuals, or that he
was mightily surpriz'd at something.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Truly, I cannot tell that; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

               <p>If you have not Faith enough
to believe what my Correspondents Discover
and Relate? perhaps it may be because you
have not Application enough to search into
the Causes of Things. Pray what think you
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97227:43"/>
of the Operation of a Blister, when it Cures
a Fever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That it hath a very good Effect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Any Body would conclude that;
but a mighty <hi>Scot</hi>'s <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> and one of my
particular Acquaintance hath made a long
Discourse upon this Subject; and indeed,
he's so sensible of the Length of it himself,
that like an Orator, with unparallell'd Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
after a long Proaemium, he thus
speaks to his Auditors, Numb. 252. <hi>Do but
think then, had I insisted on Vesication in
general; what had I done for Time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
to you O my Hearers, in a Discourse
about a Blister. Any one but your selves,
should be ready to believe, that there can be
nothing of that Consequence in the thing.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's a great Compliment upon
the Auditors; but methinks he chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
it home upon you, because your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
extends it self so far as to take notice
of things, in which <hi>others see nothing of that
Consequence.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">A long discourse more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than a Blister.</note>
                  <hi>but thus he proceeds,</hi> and that they would
rather throw away Medicine altogether, at

               <p>This is most sharp Wit; but pray,

                  <hi>no, be not afraid of it;
I'll take care it shall not be so painful to
you, I shall only take notice of a few of the
wittiest Sentences, and the most valuable
Passages.</hi> I must beg leave to tell you, <hi>says
he,</hi> that I have employed Microscopes to look
upon this Fly, and its Powder, to see if
I could discover any sharp Instruments,
Swords, Daggers, or the like sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miture,
in these Warlike and Wounding
Creatures.</p>

               <p>That's an Admirable Passage. <hi>Dead
Flies, Warlike and Wounding Creatures!</hi>
Your Correspondent truly, was in the right
to disarm such sort of Creatures; for if they
are able to make use of <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Daggers</hi>
after they are dead, there's no safety amongst
them. But what Arms were discovered by
your Correspondent.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>None at all;</hi> For, <hi>says he,</hi>
whatsoever else I found, I could meet with no
Arms at all, which makes me think, that
if they have any, as needs they must, they
are concealed, and are to be discovered in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

since</hi> a great Man complained of Experientia

               <p>Very Learnedly concluded. Then

               <p>
                  <hi>Ay, with all my heart Sir,
Numb. 254. p. 248. we are told, That</hi> the
<hi>Barbary Moor,</hi> when he rises in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
washes himself all over, and dresses, then
goes to their Giama or Church, says his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and returns home, where his Wife, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
or Slave hath his Breakfast ready for
him, which is sometimes made of Barley, or
Wheat Gruel—I have been often Treated
with warm Bread, fresh Butter and Honey in
a Morning, as also a Hasty-pudding with But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In <hi>Sufe</hi> I had a Bag of Honey presented to
me with Poppy Seeds in it, it made me sleepy,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97227:46"/>
but I sound my self well and in good Temper
of Body after it.</p>
               <p>They seldom use a Knife, and a Fork is a
strange thing amongst them. They are dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
at this way of Carving, and never flinch
tho' they burn their Fingers, for that would
look mean; when they have done they lick
their Fingers, as Plow-Men do in our Country.
After they have eat the Meat, they dip the
Bread in the Sauce or Broth, and eat it. For
their Meat to be strongly seasoned is no great
fault and if one should say, it's too high of Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they will reply, It's better to be Ah then
Faugh.</p>
               <p>They have good Capons, Snipes, Pipers and
Antelopes. They'll eat a Fox if fat, but not
if lean; whence the Proverb, <hi>Hellel Deeb,
haram Deeb.</hi> A Fox is lawful, and a Fox is
Unlawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> Fat lawful, Lean unlawful.</p>
               <p>When the Moors have feasted, every one
washes his Hands and Mouth, thanks God—they
talk a little, or tell some Story, and then
lie down to rest, where I shall leave them at
the present, and do beg your Pardonfor so
firesome and frivolous a Discourse</p>

<hi>But not to pass too much Time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

Jeremiah Skelton,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> observing a Storm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
said, I think it will be Rain, I will go
and gather in some of the Corn—While at
this Work, bringing in a Burden and casting
it upon the Barn floor, the Tempest begun as
he came forth again; whereupon he stept aside
for shelter into the Barn Door, and while
there, was struck with a dreadful flash of
Fire. <hi>A Young Woman</hi> that lived with her
Father in the House that belong'd to this
Farm, leaves the House, and not seeing the
Young Man about the Barn, goes with speed
and tells the Family he was related to, That
she feared he was slain. They came to the Barn
and found it even so, a sad Spectacle! His
Clogs driven from his Feet, one not to be found
and the other cloven, and his Hat not to be
found after search. This Young Man would
have been 22 Years of Age next <hi>June,</hi> is said
to have been sober and hopeful, was Buryed
at <hi>Luddenden</hi> the Monday following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this, I have but Two more Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Matters to add, the first is, an Account of
the Generation of Fleas. See Numb.</hi> 249.
p. 2. At last is discovered by the Indesatigable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97227:47"/>
Industry of <hi>Signior D'iacinto Cestone,</hi> the
true way of the Generation of Fleas, their
Worms, and entire Metamorphoses which have
hitherto been obscure, tho' sought after. The
Fleas bring forth Eggs (or a sort of Nits)
from these Eggs are hatched Worms; these
Worms make to themselves Bags like Silk-Worms,
and from out of these Bags come
Fleas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus given you an Historical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Generation of Fleas. I shall
proceed to a Discourse of</hi> Coffee, <hi>Numb.</hi>
256. p. 311. Of the Berries Boyled in Water,
<hi>is made a Drink,</hi> and drank much amongst the
<hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and also now in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the manner of its being first made a
Trade of in</hi> England, <hi>I shall give you the
following Account,</hi> Anno 1652. One <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
came over into <hi>England,</hi> and Marryed
the Daughter of one Alderman <hi>Hodges</hi>—This
<hi>Hodges</hi> setled to drink Coffee with <hi>Edwards</hi>
with much delight. After this, <hi>Edwards</hi>
set up one <hi>Pasqua</hi> for a Coffee-Man—The
Ale-house keepers fearing it would spoil
their Trade, Petitioned the Lord Mayor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. Upon this <hi>Hodges</hi> joined as a
Partner with <hi>Pasqua</hi> one <hi>Bowman,</hi> at the
last <hi>Pasqua</hi> dyed, and <hi>Bowman</hi> kept the
Trade—and when he dyed left his Wife,
who had been <hi>Hodges</hi>'s Cook-Maid, pretty
Rich; but she dyed Poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Painter</hi> was <hi>Bowman</hi>'s first Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<hi>Bowman</hi> dyed, and after a Year his Wife
let the House to one <hi>Batler,</hi> whose Daughter
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97227:48"/>
                  <hi>Marryed</hi> Humphrey Hodskins Bowman's <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Apprentice.</hi> And after some time the
Trade grew universal; but what was the
Rise of <hi>Batsons, Wills,</hi> or <hi>Richards,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this I have been told,</hi> Coffee hath greatly
encreased the Trade of Tobacco and Pipes,
Earthen Dishes, Tin Wares, News Papers,
Coals, Candles, Sugar, Tea, Chocolate, and
what not? Coffe-hauses make all Sorts of
People sociable, they improve Arts and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and all other Knowledge. And a
Worthy Member of this Society, has thought
that Coffee-Houses have Improved Useful
Knowledge very much.</p>
               <p>I thought to have proceeded to give you
an Historical Account of the most Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Trades in <hi>England,</hi> as Chimney-Swep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Tinkers, Pedlars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what
were the Names of those that were first of
that Employment, as also the Names of
their Apprentices, and who they Marryed:
But since I have pressed upon your Patience
so long, I shall force no more upon you than
you are willing to bear. But pray, let me
ask your Opinion of these <hi>Philosophical
Transactions,</hi> and what Thoughts you have

a great deals of Pains to Improve Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and let nothing pass that's worth
Noting?</p>

               <p>Much Pains, it must be allowed
ye have taken, 'tis pity ye had not consider'd
to what Purpose.</p>

               <p>Why, is there not a great deal
of Natural Knowledge to be learned from
what I have wrote, and Published?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, one may learn how prettily
You and your Correspondents are Employ'd:
But nothing that will make a Man wiser,
or more a Philosopher; for what am I the
wiser, for knowing <hi>the Mice creep into holes,
or how nastily the</hi> Moors <hi>pull their Meat?</hi> Nor
is what you have acquainted me with, of the
Generation of Fleas; any more than what a
Lowzy Beggar could have told many
Years ago. And as for your Coffee Story,
I take it to be a Tale fit to be Related only
amongst Old Women, and Mechanicks.</p>

such Improvements?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, it's not all, for your
Correspondent tells us, That <hi>Coffee</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
the <hi>Tobacco Trade,</hi> and consumes
<hi>Pipes</hi> and <hi>Candles.</hi> But I suppose, any
Coffee-Woman knows that, without the
assistance of your Friend to inform her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Transact.</speaker>
               <p>Well, since I see you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not to think so well of my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents
as I could wish; I beg
your Pardon for entertaining you so long
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97227:49"/>
with such Philosophical Relations, which
I perceive, instead of diverting, have made
you uneasie. But yet, I must tell you, my
Correspondents will not be discouraged
from pursuing their Design, though the
whole World Laugh at them.</p>
