            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The Right Honourable CHARL'S Lord Herbert, Eldest Son to the Marquess of Worcester, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>My Lord,</p>
            <p>YOur Lordship's favour for Learning in General, has encourag'd me to begg your Patronage of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheets, which contain a remarkable piece of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man History, though form'd into Play. I have yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plea for Pardon, since I impose not on your Lordship's Protection a work meerly of my own Compiling; having in this Adventure Launcht out in <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Bottom. Much of what is offered here, is Fruit that grew in the Richness of his Soil; and what ever the Superstructure prove, it was my good fortune to build upon a Rock. Upon a clofe view of this Story, there appear'd in some Passages, no small Resemblance with the busie <hi>Faction</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:97177:3"/>
our own time. And I confess, I chose rather to set the <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel</hi> nearer to Sight, than to throw it off at further Distance. Yet there are none that can apply any Part (as Satyr) on themselves, whose Designs and Practises are not of the same Cast. What offence to any good Subject in Stygmatizing on the Stage, those <hi>Troublers</hi> of the State,<unclear> that</unclear> out of private Interest or Mallice, Seduce the Multitude to <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> against Persons that are not only plac't in Rightful Power above them; but also the Heroes and Defenders of their Country.</p>
            <p>Where is the harm of le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting the People see what Miseries <hi>Common Wealths</hi> have been involv'd in, by a blind Compliance with their popular Misleaders: Nor may it be altogether amiss, to give these Projecters themselves, examples how wretched their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is on the uncertain Crowd. Faction is a Monster that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten makes the slaughter 'twas designed for; and as often turns its fury on those that hatcht it. The Moral therefore of these Scenes being to Recommend Submission and Adherence to Establisht Lawful Power, which in a word, is Loyalty; They have so far a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Claim to your Lordship's Acceptance: This Virtue seeming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in Your Lordship, and deriv'd from your Ancestours with Your Blood. We cannot cast an Eye on the sufferings of His late Majesty, but we find in broad Letters, the Allegiance and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Your Lordship's most honourable Grand-Father, who stopt at no Expence of Blood or Fortunes on His behalf; nor was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence wanting to Crown his Singular worth with a Signal Glory.</p>

            <p>Pardon my Lord this Start, for the Subject is scarce to be thought on without Transport. Nor has the same Fidelity to the Crown been wanting to compleat the Character of the present Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Worcester;</hi> whose Eminent Virtues have rendred him an Ornament both of our Court and Age. What Expectations then the World conceives of Your Lordship is easily imagin'd, and what Instances of Noblest Qualifications Your Lordship has already given, the World needs no Information: Besides the Goodness of Your

Lordship's Temper, and the Justice of your Principles; your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Books, and Judgment in Affairs, so far transcend Your Years, as would secure me from Flattery, though I should Launch into a Panegyrick. But I come to beg Protection, not to give Praise; My greatest Ambition being to Subscribe my Self,</p>
