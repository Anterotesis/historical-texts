            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>There's no ecclipſe as writers do define,</l>

                  <l>And that he was of body tall and long,</l>

                  <l>His countnance ſterne, and often times would riſe</l>
                  <l>Into ſuch rage that he did ſeeme halfe mad,</l>

                  <l>The reaſon why I this to your Grace ſay,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For if King <hi>Thoas</hi> now condemn'd ſhould be</l>

                  <l>The <hi>Grecians</hi> will ſhew vs like crueltie,</l>

                  <l>Of them durſt ſtand againſt him, and appeare</l>
                  <l>Before his face, and did ſo hotly chaſe,</l>
                  <l>And kill, and beat them downe in euery place,</l>

                  <l>That they began for feare of him to flie,</l>
                  <l>So that deſpight of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> he won</l>
                  <l>The field of them, and with ſuch crueltie</l>
                  <l>Purſued them, that ere it was full noone</l>
                  <l>That day, he had conſtraind them to retire</l>
                  <l>To ſaue their liues, and ſhun his furious ire.</l>

                  <l>Till that <hi>Achilles Myrmidons</hi> began</l>
                  <l>T'incloſe him round about on euery ſide,</l>
                  <l>And with moſt great deſpight vpon him ran,</l>
                  <l>And he to them in furious wiſe did ride,</l>
                  <l>And though alone he was amongſt them all,</l>
                  <l>Like Lyon fierce vpon them he did fall,</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>And in ſuch furious wiſe did them aſſayle,</l>

                  <l>That in ſhort ſpace he did ſo much preuaile</l>
                  <l>Gainſt them, that he their number did decreaſe:</l>
                  <l>For ſome he ſlew out right, and ſome he bore</l>
                  <l>Downe to the ground, &amp; ſome he wounded ſore,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And ſome he maim'd, and ſome he cleft in twaine,</l>
                  <l>And hackt and hewed them moſt cruelly,</l>
                  <l>And did the fight ſo valiantly maintaine</l>
                  <l>Againſt them all, with ſuch dexterity,</l>
                  <l>That they could not his hautie heart ſubdue,</l>
                  <l>But ſtill he ſeem'd his courage to renew.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>And them with force and valor great t'aſſayle.</l>
                  <l>And by no meanes to giue them any reſt.</l>
                  <l>But what could all his power and ſtrength preuaile,</l>
                  <l>When as he was ſo mightily oppreſt;</l>
                  <l>And that three thouſand knights did neuer ceaſe</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>And more and more on euery ſide him held</l>
                  <l>At ſuch a bay, that cowardly, in th'end</l>
                  <l>They kild his horſe, whereby he was compeld</l>
                  <l>To fight on foot, and yet he did defend</l>
                  <l>Himſelfe ſo valiantly that they well felt</l>

                  <l>By any meanes from midſt of them to get,</l>
                  <l>For they did him ſo furiouſly aſſayle:</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And hackt and heawd his armor in ſuch wiſe,</l>
                  <l>That naked both with head and necke he ſtood</l>
                  <l>In midſt of all his furious enemies</l>
                  <l>Without reliefe. Yet like a Lyon wood</l>
                  <l>He ſhewd himſelfe a valiant Champion,</l>
                  <l>And neuer ceaſt to ſmight and beat them down.</l>

                  <l>Smot off his head, and not contented ſo;</l>

                  <l>He cauſd his mangled body to be bound</l>

                  <l>Drewt after him along vpon the ground</l>
                  <l>Throughout the field, his choler to aſſwage,</l>
