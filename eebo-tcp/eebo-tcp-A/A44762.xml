            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They have bin surreptitiously printed in Oxford, and els where, but mistaken in divers places; They come forth now, not only corrected, but enrich'd by the Authour himselfe. When they were expos'd first to the world, they found extraordinary good acceptance, and have been very much sought for since, as well for the richnesse of the stile and matter, as for the gallant worth of the Author, which is so well known at home and abroad.</p>

But truly Sir, I was never so unfit for such a task; all my Papers, Manuscripts, and Notes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been long since seized upon and kept from me. Adde hereunto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Moneths close restraint (the sense wherof, I find hath much stupified my spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sicknes, a high burning feaver, with the new disease, whereof my <hi>Body</hi> as well as my <hi>Mind</hi> is yet somewhat crazie: so that (take all afflictions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I may truly say, I have passed the <hi>Ordeal,</hi> the fiery Tryall. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes I hope; for out of this fatall black <hi>Cloud,</hi> which now oresets this poore <hi>Island,</hi> I hope there will breake a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sun-shine of peace and firme happinesse: To effect which, had I a <hi>Jury,</hi> a <hi>grand-Jury</hi> of lives, I would sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them all, and triumph in the oblation.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am a Free-born <hi>Subject</hi> of the Realm of <hi>England</hi>; whereby I claim as my native Inheritance, an undoubted right, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and portion in the Laws of the Land; And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth me from a <hi>Slave.</hi> I claim also an interest and common right in the High Nationall Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> and in the power, the priviledges and jurisdiction thereof, which I put in equall ballance with the <hi>Laws,</hi> in regard it is the <hi>fountain whence they spring</hi>; and this I hold also to be a principall part of my Birth-right, which great Councell I honor, respect, value, and love in as high a degree as can be; as being the <hi>Bulwark of our liberties, the main boundary and banke which keeps us from slavery, from the inundations of tyrannicall Rule, and unbounded Will-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And I hold my self obliged in a tye of indispensable obedience, to conform and submit my self to whatsoever shall be transacted, concluded, and constituted by its authority in Church or State; whether it be by making, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging, altering, diminishing, disanulling, repealing, or reviving of any Law, Statute, Act, or Ordinance whatsoever, either touching matters Ecclesiasticall, civill, common, capitall, criminall, martiall, maritime, municipall, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; of all which, the transcendent and uncontrollable jurisdiction of that Court is capable to take cognizance.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the three things which the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain thank'd the gods for, one was, That he was born a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and not a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> For such was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and after them, of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the flourish of their Monarchy, to arrogate all civility to themselves, and to terme all the world
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100858:4"/>
besides <hi>Barbarians</hi>: So I may say to have cause to rejoyce, that I was born a vassall to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; that I was born under so well moulded and tempered a Government, which endows the subject with such Liberties and infranchisements that bear up his naturall courage, and keep him still in heart; such Liberties that fence and secure him eternally from the gripes and tallons of <hi>Tyranny:</hi> And all this may be imputed to the Authority and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this High Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> wherein there is such a rare co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of power (though the Soveraignty remain still entire, and untransfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the person of the Prince) there is such a wholsome mixture 'twixt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Optimacy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy</hi>; 'twixt Prince, Peers, and Communalty, during the time of consultation, that of so many distinct parts, by a rare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation and unanimity, they make but one <hi>Body Politick,</hi> (like that sheafe of arrows in the Emblem) one entire concentricall peece, and the results of their deliberations, but as so many harmonious diapasons arising from different strings. And what greater immunity and happinesse can there be to a People, than to be liable to no Laws but what they make themselves? to be subject to no contribution, assessement, or any pecuniary levy whatsoever, but what they Vote, and voluntarily yeeld unto themselves? For in this compacted <hi>Politick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> there be all degrees of people represented; both the Mechanick, Tradesman, Merchant, and Yeoman, have their inclusive Vote, as well as the Gentry, in the persons of their Trustees, their Knights and Burgesses, in passing of all things.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this Soveraign Surintendent Councell an Epitome of this Kingdom only, but it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to pursue this comparison a little farther; as the heavenly Bodies, when three of them meet in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> do use to produce some admirable effects in the Elementary World: So when these <hi>three States</hi> convene and assemble in one solemne great <hi>Iunta,</hi> some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and extraordinary things are brought forth, tending to the welfare of the whole Kingdom, our <hi>Microcosme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>HE that is never so little versed in the Annales of this <hi>Islle,</hi> will find that it hath bin her fate to be four times <hi>conquered.</hi> I exclude the <hi>Scot</hi>; for the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his Country, and the quality of the Clime hath been such an advantage and security to him, that neither the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> would fly thither, for fear of freezing their wings; nor any other Nation attempt the work.</p>

It is well known what Laws the <hi>Roman</hi> had; He had his <hi>Comitia,</hi> which bore a resemblance with our Convention in <hi>Parlement</hi>; the place of their meeting was called <hi>Praetorium,</hi> and the Laws which they enacted, <hi>Pleboscita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Conquest succeeded next, which were the <hi>English,</hi> there being no name in <hi>Welsh</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> for an English man, but <hi>Saxon,</hi> to this day. They gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Parlement,</hi> though it were under other names; as <hi>Michel Sinoth, Michel Gemote,</hi> and <hi>Witenage Mote.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Well, after his Majesties arrivall to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the treaty of Marriage went on still, (though he told them at his first comming, that he came not thither like an <hi>Embassador,</hi> to treat of Marriage, but as a <hi>Prince,</hi> to fetch home a Wife;) and in regard they were of different Religions, it could not be done without a dispensation from the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pope</hi> would grant none, unlesse some Capitulations were stipulated in favour of the Romish Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in <hi>England,</hi> (the same in substance were agreed on with <hi>France.</hi>) Well, when the dispensation came, which was negotiated solely by the King of Spains Ministers; because His Majesty would have as little to do as might be with <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, who died a little after, sent His Majesty a Letter, which was delivered by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> whereof an answer was sent a while after: Which Letters were imprinted and exposed to the view of the world; because His Majesty would not have people whisper, that the businesse was carried in a clandestine manner. And truly besides this, I do not know of any Letter, or Message, or Complement, that ever pass'd 'twixt His Majesty and the <hi>Pope,</hi> afore or after; some addresses peradventure might be made to the Cardinalls, to whom the drawing of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100858:8"/>
those matrimoniall dispatches was referred, to quicken the work, but this was only by way of civill negotiation.</p>
                     <p>Now touching that <hi>responsory</hi> Letter from His Majesty, it was no other than a Complement in the severest interpretation, and such formalities passe 'twixt the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the great <hi>Turke,</hi> and divers Heathen Princes. The <hi>Pope</hi> writ first, and no man can deny, but by all morall rules, and in common humane civility His Majesty was bound to answer it, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considering how punctuall they are in those Countries to correspond in this kind, how exact they are in repayring visits, and the performance of such Ceremonies; And had this compliance been omitted, it might have made very ill impressions, as the posture of things stood then; for it had prejudiced the great work in hand, I mean, the <hi>Match,</hi> which was then in the heat and height of agitation: His Majesties person was there engag'd, and so it was no time to give the least offence. They that are never so little vers'd in businesse abroad, do know that there must be addresses, complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and formalities of this nature (according to the Italian Proverbe, <hi>That one must sometimes light a candle to the Devill</hi>) us'd in the carriage of matters of State, as this great businesse was, whereon the eyes of all Christendome were so greedily fix'd; A businesse which was like to bring with it such an universall good, as the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the quenching of those hideous fires in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the establishing of a peace through all the Christian World.</p>
                     <p>I hope none will take offence, that in this particular which comes within the compasse of my knowledge, being upon the Stage when this Scene was acted, I do this right to the <hi>King</hi> my Master, in displaying the <hi>Truth,</hi> and putting her forth in her own colours, a rare thing in these dayes.</p>
                     <p>TOuching the <hi>Vocall Forrest,</hi> an Allegoricall Discourse, that goes abroad under my name, a good while before the beginning of this <hi>Parlement,</hi> which this <hi>Gentleman</hi> cites (and that very faithfully.) I understand there be some that mutter at certain passages therein, by putting ill glosses upon the Text, and taking with the <hi>left</hi> hand, what I offer with the <hi>right</hi>: (Nor is it a wonder for trees which lys open, and stand exposed to all weathers to be nipt) But I desire this favour, which in <hi>common</hi> justice, I am sure in the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> cannot be denyed me, it being the priviledge of every Author, and a received maxime through the World, <hi>Cujus est condere, ejus est interpretari</hi>; I say, I crave this favour, to have leave to expound my own Text, and I doubt not then but to rectifie any one in his opinion of me, and that in lieu of the <hi>Plums which I give him from those Trees, he will not throw the stones at me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100858:9"/>Moreover, I desire those that are over criticall Censurers of that peece, to know, that as in Divinity it is a rule, <hi>Scripturae parabolica non est argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ativa</hi>; so it is in all other kind of knowledge. <hi>Parables</hi> (whereof that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is composed) <hi>though pressed never so hard, prove nothing.</hi> There is another <hi>Rule</hi> also, That <hi>Parables</hi> must be gently used, like a Nurses breast; which if you presse too hard, you shall have <hi>bloud</hi> in stead of <hi>milke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as the Author of the <hi>Vocall Forrest</hi> thinks he hath done, neither his <hi>Countrey,</hi> nor the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Learning</hi> any prejudice thereby (That <hi>maiden fancy</hi> having received so good entertainment and respect abroad, as to be translated into divers Languages, and to gain the publick approbation of some famous Universities) So he makes this humble protest unto all the World, that though the designe of that Discourse was partly <hi>Satyricall</hi> (which peradventure induc'd the Author to shrowd it of purpose under the shadowes of <hi>trees,</hi> and where should Satyres be but amongst Trees?) yet it never entred into his imagination to let fall from him the least thing that might give any offence to the High and Honorable Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> wherof he had the honor to be once a Member, and hopes he may be thought worthy again; And were he guilty of such an offence, or <hi>piacle</hi> rather, he thinks he should never forgive himselfe, though he were appointed his own Judge. If there occurre any passage therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that may admit a hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, let the Reader observe, That the Author doth not positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, or passe a judgement on any thing in that Discourse, which consists principally of concise, cursory narrations, of the choisest Occurrences and Criticismes of State, according as the pulse of time did beat then: And matters of State, as all other sublunary things, are subject to alterations, contigencies and change, which makes the opinions and minds of men vary accordingly; not one amongst twenty is the same man to day as he was four years ago, in point of judgement, which turns and alters according to the circumstance and successe of things: And it is a true saying, whereof we find common experience, <hi>posterior dies est prioris Magister</hi> The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the former dayes Schoolmaster. Ther's another Aphorisme, <hi>The wisedome of one day is the foolishnesse of another,</hi> and 'twill be so as long as there is a man left in the world.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude with this modest request to that <hi>Gentleman of the long Robe</hi>; That having unpassionately perus'd what I have written in this small <hi>Discourse,</hi> in penning whereof, my <hi>conscience</hi> guided my <hi>quill</hi> all along as well as my <hi>hand,</hi> he would please to be so charitable and just, as to reverse that harsh sentence upon me, <hi>To be no Friend to Parlements, and a Malignant.</hi>
