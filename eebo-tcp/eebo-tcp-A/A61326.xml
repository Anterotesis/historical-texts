         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Author's Preface
TO HIS
EXPOSITIONS
UPON
Sir <hi>GEORGE RIPLEY</hi>'s
Compound of <hi>Alchymy,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Canon of <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>
flouriſhed in
the days of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fourth, King of
<hi>England,</hi> to whom
he wrote an Epiſtle,
as in the beginning of this Book ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth:
a true Artiſt he was, as
every one who hath attained the
knowledge in this Maſtery can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.
He wrote, among other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
theſe <hi>Twelve Gates</hi> of <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51319:3"/>
which with the <hi>Preface, Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation,
Erroneous Experiments</hi> by
him warned of, his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the
King, <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Wheel,</hi> I ſhall
unfold.</p>
            <p>For his Experience herein he was
eminent, yea his Writings indeed
are, in my opinion, for the fulneſs
of them, and eminent deſcriptions
of things, to be preferred before
any that I have read or ſeen, yet I
have ſeen many.</p>
            <p>I would detract from no candid
well-deſerving Author, but would
ingenuouſly give them their due;
yet <hi>Ripley</hi> to me ſeems to carry the
Garland.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, I have cauſe
to honour <hi>Bernard Treviſan,</hi> who
is very ingenious, as in all his
Writings, ſo eſpecially in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of his to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:51319:3"/>
which let me ſeriouſly profeſs, I
receiv'd the main Light in this
hidden Secret. I ſhall not name
the place, but read the Epiſtle, and
read it again and again, for in it
is moſt excellent truth, and Naked
truth.</p>
            <p>Next to him, or rather before
him in ſome reſpects, is an Author
whom I will not name; yet truly all
Chymical Writers are therein to
be preferred by any man, by how
far he gets good by them: one
commends <hi>Raymond Lully</hi> before
all, yet I remember not that ever I
got good by reading of him: ſome
in good ſooth, who are not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of this Secret, write more
edifyingly to the informing of a
<hi>Tyro,</hi> then thoſe whom skill hath
made crafty, eſpecially in ſuch
places where they intend nothing

leſs then to diſcover ſuch Secrets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I learned the Secret of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
<hi>Magnes,</hi> from one; of their
Magical <hi>Chalybs,</hi> from another; the
uſe of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Doves, from a third;
the <hi>Air,</hi> or rather the <hi>Camelion</hi> of
the Philoſophers, from another;
the groſs Preparation of their <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi>
in another; the number of
<hi>Eagles,</hi> in another: but for opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the true Matter, and ſigns
of the true <hi>Mercury,</hi> I know none
like <hi>Ripley,</hi> though <hi>Flammel</hi> be
eminent. I know what I ſay, as
knowing experimentally the truth,
and what is errour.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, I have had
experience of miſleading Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writers, and have made many
toylſom laborious Experiments,
though but young; and therefore
having at length, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved
<pb facs="tcp:51319:5"/>
mercy of God, arrived
at my Haven of Reſt, I ſhall
ſtretch out my hand to ſuch as are
behind.</p>
            <p>I have wrote ſeveral Treatiſes,
ſome in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but eſpecially
in <hi>Latine;</hi> one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treatiſe
touching the Stone, very plainly
written, but not perfected, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
ſlipt out of my hand, and
perhaps may come abroad into the
World; if it do, I ſhould be ſorry.
Two <hi>Latine</hi> Tractates, one intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Brevis manuductio ad Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Coelestem,</hi> another, <hi>Fons Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micae
Philoſophiae,</hi> I wrote, which
for eſpecial Reaſons to me known
I reſolve to ſuppreſs. Two other
<hi>Latine</hi> Treatiſes, the one intituled,
<hi>Ars Metallorum Metamorphoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> the
other, <hi>Introitus apertus ad occlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
Regis Palatium,</hi> I lately wrote,
<pb facs="tcp:51319:6"/>
which perhaps thou mayſt enjoy.
Two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poems I wrote, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the whole Secret, which
are loſt. Alſo an <hi>Enchiridion</hi> of
Experiments, together with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
of Meditations, in which
were many Philoſophical Receipts
declaring the whole Secret, with
an <hi>Aenigma</hi> annexed; which alſo
fell into ſuch hands, who I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
will never reſtore it. This
laſt was written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with
many other which I wrote for mine
own recreation, and afterwards
burned.</p>
            <p>But now at length ſtudying how
to profit the Sons of Art to my
utmoſt, I have rather reſolved to
unfold <hi>Ripley</hi>'s Knots, and ſo thou
mayſt have two Witneſſes in one;
for by the unfolding of him thou
ſhalt both ſee the depth of the
<pb facs="tcp:51319:6"/>
Man, and diſcern that both he and
I were truly, and not Sophiſtically,
intruſted with this Divine Science
and Art; in which it is not notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
as many men conceive the Art
to be, but real Experiments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
taught me by the only God
and Maſter of Nature, that was my
Guide; having ſeen and made the
Secret Water of the Philoſophers,
and known the uſe of it by ocular
experience, to the effecting of the
admirable <hi>Elixir.</hi> Theſe Writings
peruſe, for they are not Fancies,
and ſo with the help of the moſt
High, thou ſhalt attain thy wiſh.</p>

thought fit to clear the ſence of the old

words, more ſignificant to the preſent ſpeech,
and yet doubtleſs not differing from the
mind of the Author; which change of
words, I durst not preſume to alter, but
that I ought rather in justice to the Author
to let them paſs; and for this reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that whomſoever ſhall deſire to ſee the
difference, may eaſily compare all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and in performing this ſervice, I hope I
have done my duty faithfully, and wronged

EPISTLE
TO
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth,
UNFOLDED.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
written to a
King, who was in his
Generation, both wiſe
and valiant; ſo it doth
comprize the whole
ſecret, both learnedly
deſcribed, and yet artificially vailed.
Yet as the Author teſtifieth, that in this
Epiſtle he doth plainly untie the main
knot; So I can, and do teſtifie with him,
that there is nothing deſirable for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51319:11"/>
true attaining of this Myſtery, both in
the Theory and Practick of it, which is
not in this ſhort Epiſtle fully taught.
This then I intend as a Key to all my
former writings, and aſſure you on my
faithful word, that I ſhall not ſpeak one
word doubtfully or Myſtically, as I have
in all my other writings, ſeeming to aver
ſome things, which taken without a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
are utterly falſe, which we did only
to conceal this Art. This Key therefore we
intend not to make common; and ſhall
intreat you to keep it ſecret to your ſelf,
and not to communicate it, except it be
to a ſure friend, who you are confident
will not make it publick: And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
we make upon very good grounds,
knowing that all our writings together,
are nothing to this, by reaſon of the
contradictions, which we have woven
into them, which here is not done in
the leaſt meaſure. I ſhall therefore in this
Epiſtle take up a new Method, and that
different from the former, and ſhall firſt
draw up the ſubſtance of the Philoſophy
couched in this Epiſtle, into ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
and after elucidate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51319:11"/>
The firſt Concluſion is drawn from
the Ninth Stave of this Epiſtle, the
eight firſt Staves being only complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall;
and that is, That as all things are
multiplied in their kind, ſo may be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
which have in themſelves a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of being tranſmuted, the imperfect
into perfect.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Concluſion in the Tenth
Stave is, That the main ground for the
poſſibility of tranſmutation, is the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of reduction of all Metalls, and
ſuch Minerals as are of metallick prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
into their firſt Mercurial matter.</p>
                  <p>The third Concluſion is in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Stave, that among ſo many Metaline
and <hi>Mineral Sulphurs,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies</hi>
there are but two <hi>Sulphurs</hi> that
are related to our work, which <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs</hi>
have their <hi>Mercuries</hi> eſſentially u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Concluſion from the ſame
Stave is, That he who underſtands theſe
two <hi>Sulphurs</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercuries</hi> aright, ſhal find
that the one is the moſt pure red <hi>Sulphur
of Gold,</hi> which is <hi>Sulphur in manifeſto,</hi>
and <hi>Mercurius in occulto,</hi> and that other
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51319:12"/>
is moſt pure white <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
true <hi>Quicksilver in manifeſto,</hi> and
<hi>Sulphur in occulto,</hi> theſe are our two
Principles.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Concluſion from the Twelfth
Stave is, That if a mans Principles be
true, and his Operations regular, his
Event will be certain, which Event is
no other then the true Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Concluſions are but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but of great weight or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Amplification, Illuſtration and
Elucidation therefore of them, will make
a ſon of Art truly glad.</p>

for our purpoſe here to invite any
to the Art, only intending to lead and
guide the ſons of Art; We ſhall not
prove the poſſibility of <hi>Alchymy,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Arguments, having done it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in another Treatiſe. He then that
will be incredulous, let him be incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51319:13"/>
he that will cavil, let him cavil;
But he whoſe mind is perſwaded of the
truth of this Art, and of its Dignity, let
him attend to what is in the Illuſtration
of theſe Five Concluſions diſcovered,
and his heart ſhall certainly rejoyce. We
ſhall therefore briefly Illuſtrate this <hi>1ſt.</hi>
Concluſion, and inſiſt there more largely,
where the ſecrets of the Art are moſt
couched.</p>
                     <p>For this firſt, which concludes in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the truth of the Art, and its validity;
he that would therein be more ſatisfied
in it, let him read the <hi>Testimony of the
Philoſophers:</hi> And he that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Teſtimony of ſo many men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt of them men of renown in their
own times, he will cavil alſo againſt all
other Arguments.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall only hold to <hi>Ripley's</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in this our Key, who in the Fourth
Stave, aſſures the King that at <hi>Lovain</hi> he
firſt ſaw the greateſt and moſt perfect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
namely, the two <hi>Elixirs;</hi> and in his
following Verſes, craved his confident
credit, that he himſelf hath truly found
the way of ſecret <hi>Alchymy,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51319:13"/>
the diſcovery of it to the King, only
upon condition of ſecrecy.</p>
                     <p>And in the Eighth Stave, though he
proteſts never to write it by Pen, yet
proffers the King at his pleaſure, to ſhew
him occularly the Red and White <hi>Elixir,</hi>
and the working of them, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
will be done for eaſie coſts in time
So then, he that will doubt the truth of
this Art, muſt account this Famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
for a moſt ſimple mad Sophiſter, to
write and offer ſuch things to his Prince,
unleſs he were able in effect to do what
he promiſed; from which imputation,
his Writings, and alſo the Hiſtory of him,
of his Fame, Gravity, and Worth, will
ſufficiently clear him.</p>

                     <p>WE come to the ſecond Concluſion;
the ſubſtance of which is, <hi>that all
Metalls, and Bodies of Metalline Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
may be reduced to their firſt Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Matter;</hi> And this is the main and
chief ground for the poſſibility of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation.
On this we muſt inſiſt largly
and fully, for (truſt me) this is the very
hinge on which our ſecrets hang.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51319:14"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then know that all <hi>Metalls,</hi> and
ſeveral <hi>Minerals</hi> have <hi>Mercury</hi> for their
next matter, to which (for the moſt part,
nay indeed always) there adheres, and
is Con-coagulated an external <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
which is not <hi>Metalline,</hi> but diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from the internal Kernel of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Sulphur</hi> is not wanting even in
common <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> by the Mediation
of which, it may be precipitated into
the form of a drie Powder: Yea, and
by a Liquor well known to us, (though
nothing helping the Art of Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
it may be ſo fixed, that it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
all Fires, the Teſt and Coppel, and
this without the addition of any thing
to it, but the Liquor (by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is fixed) coming away intire, both
in its <hi>Pondus</hi> and Virtue. This <hi>Sulphur</hi>
in Gold and Silver is pure, in the other
Metalls leſs pure; Therefore in Gold and
Silver it is fixed, in others it is fugitive;
in all the Metalls it is coagulated, in
<hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> it is coagulable,
in <hi>Gold, Silver</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> this <hi>Sulphur</hi>
is ſo ſtrongly united, that the Antients did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51319:15"/>
ever judge <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> to be all
one; but we by the help of a Liquor, the
Invention of which in theſe parts of the
world we owe to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> (though
among the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> it hath
been, and is (at this day) commonly
known to the acuter ſort of <hi>Chymiſts.)</hi>
By this I ſay, we know that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
which is in <hi>Mercury</hi> coagulable, and
in the <hi>Metals</hi> coagulated, is external to
the Internal nature of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and may
may be ſeparated in the form of a tincted
Metallick Oyl, the remaining <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then void of all <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ſave that
which may be called its Inward or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> and is now incoagulable of it
ſelf, (though by our <hi>Elixir</hi> it is to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated)
but of it ſelf, it can neither
be fixt nor precipitated, nor ſublimed, but
remains un-altered in all corroſive wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and in all digeſtions of heat. One
way then of <hi>Mercury</hi> Azating all <hi>Metals</hi>
and <hi>Minerals,</hi> is by the Liquor <hi>Alchaheſt,</hi>
which out of all ſuch Bodies as have <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
in their Conſtitution, can ſeparate a
running <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> from which <hi>Argent
vive</hi> all its <hi>Sulphur</hi> is then ſeparated, ſave
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51319:15"/>
that only which is Internal and Central
to the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which Internal <hi>Sulphur</hi> of
<hi>Mercury</hi> no corroſive can touch: Next to
this way of univerſal Reduction, there are
alſo ſome other particular ways by which
<hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Antimony,</hi> yea even <hi>Venus</hi>
and <hi>Mars</hi> may be reduced into a running
<hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> by the help of Salts, which
becauſe (being corporeal) they pierce
not ſo radically as the fore-named Liquor
doth; they therefore do not ſpoil the
<hi>Mercury</hi> of its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but that as much
<hi>Sulphur</hi> as there in is Common <hi>Mercury;</hi>
ſo much alſo there in is this <hi>Mercury</hi> of
the Bodies, only this <hi>Mercury</hi> hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificated
qualities according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Metal</hi> or <hi>Mineral,</hi> from which
it was extracted; and for that reaſon,
(as to our work which is to diſſolve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Species of <hi>Metals,)</hi> it hath no more
virtue then common <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> There
is than but one only humidity, which is
applicable unto our Work, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is neither of <hi>Saturn</hi> nor <hi>Venus,</hi> nor
is drawn from any thing, which nature
hath formed, but from a ſubſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Art of the Philoſopher.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51319:16"/>
So then, if a <hi>Mercury</hi> drawn from the
Bodies, have not only the ſame deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of heat and ſuperfluity of <hi>faeces</hi> as
Common <hi>Mercury</hi> hath, but alſo a diſtinct
ſpecificated form, it muſt (by reaſon of
this its form) be ſo much the farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from our <hi>Mercury,</hi> then common
<hi>Argent Vive</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>Our Art therefore is to compound two
Principles, (one in which the <hi>Salt,</hi> and
another in which the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Nature
doth abound,) which are not yet perfect,
nor yet totally imperfect, and (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence)
may therefore (by our Art)
be changed or exalted, which that (which
is totally perfect) cannot be; and then by
Common <hi>Mercury</hi> to extract not the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
but the Coeleſtial virtue out of the
compound; which virtue (being Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal)
begets in the common <hi>Mercury</hi> an Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
more noble then it ſelf, which is our
true <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> which will congeal it
ſelf, and diſſolve the Bodies: Obſerve but
a grain of Corn, in which, ſcarce a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part is Sprout, and this Sprout, if it
were out of the Grain, would die in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the whole grain is ſown, yet the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51319:16"/>
Sprout only produceth the Herb: So is it
in our Body, the Fermental Spirit that is in
it, is ſcarce a third part of the whole, the
reſt is of no value, yet all is joyned, (in
the compoſition,) and the <hi>faeculent corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous</hi>
parts of the Body comes away with
the dregs of the <hi>Mercury.</hi> But beyond the
example or ſimilitude given of a grain of
Corn, it may be obſerved that the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and ſpiritual virtue of this our Body,
doth purge and purifie its Matrix of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in which it is ſown; that is, it makes it
caſt forth a great quantity of filthy earth,
and a great deal of Hydropical Saline
moiſture. For inſtance, make thy waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(for a tryal) with pure and clean
Fountain water; weigh firſt a Pint of the
ſame water, and take the exact weight
of it, then waſh thy compound 8 or 10
Eagles (or times,) ſave all the <hi>faeces,</hi> weigh
thy Body and <hi>Mercury</hi> exactly, weigh
thy <hi>faeces</hi> being very dry, then Diſtil or
Sublime all that will Sublime, a very little
quick <hi>Mercury</hi> will aſcend, then put the
reſidue of the <hi>faeces</hi> in a Crucible, ſet
them on the Coals, and all the faeculency
of the <hi>Mercury</hi> will burn like a Coal, yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51319:17"/>
without fume; when that is all conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
weigh the remaining <hi>faeces,</hi> and
thou ſhalt find them to be two thirds of
thy Body, the other third being in the
<hi>Mercury;</hi> weigh the <hi>Mercury</hi> which thou
Sublimeſt, and the <hi>Mercury</hi> prepared by
it ſelf, and the weight of both will not
recompence thy <hi>Mercuries</hi> weight by far:
So then, boyl up thy water to a skin, in
which thou madeſt thy Lotions, for that
is a thick water; and in a cool place thou
ſhalt have Cryſtals, which is the Salt of
<hi>Mercury</hi> Crude, and no way fit for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
Yet it is a content for the Artiſts
to ſee how the Heterogeneities of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
are diſcovered, which no Art ſave
the Liquor of <hi>Alchaheſt</hi> can do, and that
in a deſtructive, not a generative way as
this is; for this operation of ours is made
between Male and Female, within their
own kind, between which there is a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which effecteth that which no other
thing in the world could do. In all truth
I tell you, that if you ſhould take our
imperfect compound Body, <hi>per ſe,</hi> and
<hi>Mercury per ſe,</hi> and Ferment them alone,
though you might bring out of the one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51319:17"/>
a moſt pure <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and out of the other
<hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the Nut of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> yet with theſe thou couldeſt
effect nothing, for Fermental virtue is the
wonder of the world, and it is by it, that
water becomes Herbs, Trees, and Plants,
Fruits, Fleſh, Blood, Stones, Minerals, and
every thing; ſeek then for it only, and
rejoyce in it, as in a deſervedly invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
treaſure: Now know, that Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
works or ferments not out of kind,
neither do Salts Ferment Metals. Wilt
thou then know whence it is that ſome
fixt Alcalies do extract a <hi>Mercury</hi> out of
<hi>Minerals,</hi> and out of the more imperfect
Metals? Conſider then, that in all theſe
Bodies the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is not ſo radically mixt
and united, as it is in Silver and Gold.
Now <hi>Sulphur</hi> is of kin to divers <hi>Alcalies,</hi>
that are extraordinarily diſſolved or mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it, and by this means the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi>
parts are disjoyned, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
vive</hi> is by fire ſeparated. The <hi>Mercury</hi>
thus ſeparated, is ſpoiled of its <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
when as indeed there needs, or is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
only a depuration of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> by
ſeparating the impure from the pure;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51319:18"/>
but theſe Salts having ſeparated the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
do leave the <hi>Mercury</hi> worſe; that
is, more eſtranged from a Metallick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than it was before; for in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> will not
burn, for though it be Sublimed, Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
made Sugar or Vitrified, yet by
Fire and Fluxes it ſtill returns to the ſame
it was in before; but its <hi>Sulphur</hi> being
(as is aforeſaid,) ſeparated, will take fire
if joyned with Salt-peter, even as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Sulphur</hi> doth, ſo that the Salts act on
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of which they rob the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
but on the <hi>Mercury</hi> they act not for
want of Ferment, which is not to be
found, but only amongſt Homogeneal
things. Therefore the Ferment of Bread
Leavens not a Stone, nor doth the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any Animal or Vegetable, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a Metal or Mineral. So then, though
out of Gold thou mighteſt obtain a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
by the help of the Liquor of the
firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of Salt, yet that <hi>Mercury</hi> would
never accompliſh our work: whereas on
the other ſide <hi>Mercury</hi> made out of Gold
by our <hi>Mercury,</hi> though there be three
parts of our <hi>Mercury</hi> to one of Gold:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51319:18"/>
This <hi>Mercury</hi> I ſay, will (by continual
digeſtion) accompliſh the whole work;
marvel not then, that our <hi>Mercury</hi> is more
powerful, which is prepared by <hi>Mercury:</hi>
For certainly the Ferment, which cometh
between the compound Body and the
water, cauſeth a death and a regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it doth that, which nothing in the
world can do: Beſides it ſevers from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
a terreſtreity which burns like a coal,
and an Hydropical humour melting in
common water, but the reſidue is acua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a Spirit of Life, which is our true
embryonated <hi>Sulphur</hi> of our water, not
viſible, yet working viſibly. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then, that all operations for our
<hi>Mercury,</hi> but by common <hi>Mercury,</hi> and
our Body according to our Art, are erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
and will never produce our Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
although they be otherwiſe, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
never ſo wonderfully made. For as
the Author of the <hi>New light,</hi> ſaith, <hi>No
Water in any Iſland of the Philoſophers was
wholſom, but that which was drawn out of
the reigns of</hi> Sol <hi>and</hi> Luna. Wilt thou
know what that means, <hi>Mercury</hi> in its
<hi>pondus</hi> and incombuſtibility is <hi>Gold fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51319:19"/>
our Body in its purity is called the
<hi>Philoſophers Luna,</hi> being far more pure
than the imperfect Metals, and its <hi>Sulphur</hi>
alſo as pure as the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> not that it
is indeed <hi>Luna,</hi> for it abides not in the fire.
Now in the compoſition of theſe three;
Firſt, our common <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the two
Principles of our compound there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
the Ferment of <hi>Luna,</hi> out of which
though it be a Body, proceeds yet a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>icated
odour: yea, and oft the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
of it is diminiſhed: If the Compound
be much waſht, after it is ſufficiently
clean. So then, the Ferment of <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Luna</hi> intercedes in our compoſition,
which Ferment begets an off-ſpring more
noble then it ſelf a thouſand fold; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſhouldſt thou work on our compound
body by a violent way of Salts, thou
ſhouldſt have the <hi>Mercury,</hi> by far leſs
noble then the Body, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the
Body being ſeparated, and not exalted
by ſuch a progreſs.</p>

                     <p>WE now come to the Third Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is, that among all Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
and Mineral <hi>Sulphurs</hi> there are only
Two that belong to our Work; which
Two have their <hi>Mercuries</hi> eſſentially uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them: This is the truth of our
ſecrets, though we (to ſeduce the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary)
do ſeem to aver the contrary; for
do not think that (becauſe we do inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
two ways, therefore) we really mean
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51319:20"/>
as we ſay, for verily (as witneſſeth <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,)</hi>
There is no true Principle but one,
nor have we but one matter, nor but one
way of working upon that matter, nor
but one regimen of heat, and one linear
way of proceeding.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two <hi>Sulphurs</hi> as they are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our Work, they ought to be
Homogeneal, for it is only Gold Spiritual
that we ſeek; Firſt White, then Red,
which Gold is no other then that which
the vulgar ſee, but they know not the
hidden Spirit that is in it. This Principle
wants nothing but compoſition, and this
compoſition muſt be made with our other
crude white <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is nothing
but <hi>Mercury</hi> vulgar, by frequent cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it upon our Hermaphroditical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſo long till it become a fiery water.</p>
                     <p>Know therefore, that <hi>Mercury</hi> hath
in it ſelf a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which being un-active,
our Art is to multiply in it a living active
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> which comes out of the loins of
our Hermaphroditieal body, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a Metal, and his Mother a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
Take then the moſt beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> whoſe Arms are a <hi>Circle Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51319:20"/>
and on it a <hi>Sable Croſs on a Black
Field,</hi> which is the ſignal note of the
great world, eſpouſe her to the moſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
God, who dwells in the houſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and thou ſhalt find the Salt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with this Salt acuate thy water, as
thou beſt knoweſt, and thou ſhalt have
the Lunary bath in which the Sun will
be amended.</p>
                     <p>And in all truth I aſſure thee, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou hadſt our Body Mercuriali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
(without the addition of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
or of the <hi>Mercury</hi> of any of the Metals)
made <hi>per ſe,</hi> that is, without the addition
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> it would not be in the leaſt
profitable unto thee, for it is our <hi>Mercury</hi>
only, which hath a Celeſtial form and
power, which it receives, not only, nor
ſo much from the Compound Body or
Principles, as from the Fermental virtue
which proceeds from the compoſition of
both the Body and the <hi>Mercury,</hi> by which
is produced a wonderful Creature: So
then let all thy care be to marry <hi>Sulphur</hi>
with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is our <hi>Mercury</hi> which
is impregnated, which <hi>Sulphur</hi> muſt be
eſpouſed with our <hi>Sol,</hi> then haſt thou two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51319:21"/>
                        <hi>Sulphurs</hi> married, and two <hi>Mercuries</hi> of
one off-ſpring, whoſe Father is the Sun,
and Moon the Mother.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Concluſion makes all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
plain which hath been ſaid before;
namely, that theſe two <hi>Sulphurs</hi> are, the
one moſt pure Red <hi>Sulphur of Gold,</hi> and
the other of moſt pure clean White <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are our two <hi>Sulphurs;</hi> the one
appears a coagulated Body, &amp; yet carries
its <hi>Mercury</hi> in its belly: the other is in
all its proportions true <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet very
clean, and carries its <hi>Sulphur</hi> within its
ſelf, though hidden under the form and
fluxibility of <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sophiſters are (here) in a Labyrinth,
for becauſe they are not acquainted with
Metalline love, they work in things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
heterogeneal,; or if they work
upon Metalline Bodies, they yet either
joyn Males with Males, or elſe Females
with Females, or elſe they work on each
alone; or elſe they take Males which are
charged with natural inabilities, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
whoſe Matrix is vitiated. Thus by
their own inconſideration they fruſtrate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51319:21"/>
their own hopes, and then caſt the blame
upon the Art, when as indeed it is only
to be imputed to their own folly, in not
underſtanding the Philoſophers.</p>
                     <p>I know many pitiful Sophiſters do dote
on many Stones, Vegetable, Animal, and
Mineral; and ſome to thoſe add the fiery
Angelical, Paradaical Stone, which they
call a Wonder-working Eſſence; and
becauſe the mark they aim at is ſo great,
the ways alſo by which they would attain
their ſcope, they make alſo agreeable,
that is a double way; One way they call
<hi>Via Humida,</hi> the other they call <hi>Via Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
(to uſe their languages:) The latter
way is the <hi>Labyrinthian path,</hi> which is
fit only for the great ones of the earth to
tread in; the other the <hi>Daedalean Path,</hi>
an eaſie way of ſmall coſt for the poor of
the world to enterprize.</p>
                     <p>But this I know, and can teſtifie, that
there is but one way, and but only one
<hi>Regimen,</hi> no more colours than ours;
and what we ſay or write otherwiſe, is
but to deceive the unwary: For if every
thing in the world ought to have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
cauſes, there cannot be any one end
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51319:22"/>
which is produced from two wayes of
working on diſtinct Principles.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we proteſt, and muſt again
admoniſh the Reader, that (in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
writings) we have concealed much,
by reaſon of the two ways we have inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
which we will briefly touch;
There is one Work of ours, which is the
<hi>Play of Children, and the Work of Women,</hi>
and that is Decoction by the Fire; and
we proteſt that the loweſt degree of this
our work, is, that the matter be ſtirred
up, and may hourly circulate without fear
of breaking of the Veſſel, which for this
reaſon ought to be very ſtrong; but our
lineal Decoction is an Internal Work,
which advances every day &amp; hour, and
is diſtinct from that of outward heat, and
therefore is both inviſible and inſenſible.
In this our work, our <hi>Diana</hi> is our body
when it is mixed with the water, for then
all is called the Moon; for <hi>Laton</hi> is whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
and the Woman bears rule: our
<hi>Diana</hi> hath a wood, for in the firſt days
of the Stone, our Body after it is whiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
grows vegetably. In this wood are
at the laſt found two Doves; for about
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51319:22"/>
the end of three weeks the Soul of the
<hi>Mercury</hi> aſcends with the Soul of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
Gold; theſe are infolded in the
everlaſting Arms of <hi>Venus,</hi> for in this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the confections are all tincted with a
pure green colour; Theſe Doves are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
ſeaven times, for in ſeaven is
perfection, and they are left dead, for
they then riſe and move no more; our
Body is then black like to a Crows Bill,
for in this operation all is turned to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
blacker than the blackeſt. Such
paſſages as theſe we do oftentimes uſe
when we ſpeak of the Preparation of our
<hi>Mercury;</hi> and this we do to deceive the
ſimple, and it is alſo for no other end
that we confound our operations, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of one, when we ought to ſpeak
of another; For if this Art were but
plainly ſet down, our operations would
be contemptible even to the fooliſh.
Therefore believe me in this, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our works are truly natural, we
therefore do take the liberty to confound
the Philoſophers work with that which
is purely Natures work, that ſo we
might keep the ſimple in ignorance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51319:23"/>
our true Vinegre, which being
unknown, their labour is wholly loſt.</p>
                     <p>Let me then (for a cloſe) ſay only thus
much; Take our Body which is Gold,
and our <hi>Mercury</hi> which is ſeven times
acuated by the marriage of it with our
Hermaphroditical body which is a <hi>Chaos,</hi>
and it is the ſplendor of the Soul of the
God <hi>Mars,</hi> in the Earth and water of
<hi>Saturn;</hi> mix theſe two in ſuch a <hi>Pondus</hi>
as Nature doth require: in this mixture
you have our inviſible Fires, for in the
Water, or in the <hi>Mercury</hi> is an active
<hi>Sulphur</hi> or Mineral Fire, and in the Gold
a dead, paſſive, but yet actual <hi>Sulphur;</hi>
Now when that <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Gold is
ſtirred up and quickned, there is made
between the Fire of Nature which is in
the Gold and the Fire againſt Nature,
which is in the <hi>Mercury,</hi> a Fire partly
of the one, and partly of the other, for
it partakes of both; and by theſe two
Fires thus united into one, is cauſed
both Corruption (which is Humiliation)
and Generation, (which is Glorification
and Perfection.) Now know that God
only governs this way of the Internal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51319:23"/>
Fire, Man being ignorant of the progreſs
thereof, only by his Reaſon beholding
its operations, he is able to diſcern that
it is hot; that is, that it doth perform the
actions of heat, which is Decoction. In
this Fire there is no Sublimation, for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation
is an Exaltation; But this Fire
is ſuch an Exaltation, that it is Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf, and that beyond it is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                     <p>All our Work then is only to multiply
this Fire, that is, to circulate the Body,
ſo long until the Virtue of the <hi>Sulphur</hi>
be augmented. Again, this Fire is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Spirit, and therefore not having
Dimenſions as neither above nor below,
but every where in the Sphere of the
activity of our Matter in the Veſſel; So
that though the material viſible ſubſtance
do ſublime and aſcend by the action of
the Elemental heat, yet this Spiritual
Virtue is always as well in that which
ſubſides in the bottom, as in that which
is in the upper part of the Veſſel. For
it is as the Soul in the Body of Man,
which is every where at the ſame time,
and yet bounded or terminated in none.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51319:24"/>
This is the Ground of one Sophiſm of
ours, <hi>(viz.)</hi> when we ſay, that in this
true Philoſophical Fire there is no Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
for the Fire is the Life, and the
Life is a Soul, which is not at all ſubject
to the dimenſions of Bodies: Hence alſo
it is, that the opening of the Glaſs, or
cooling of the ſame during the time of
Working, kills the Life or Fire that is in
this ſecret <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and yet not one Grain
of the matter is loſt. The Elemental Fire
then is that which any Child knows how
to kindle and govern, but it is the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
only that is able to diſcern the
true inward Fire, for it is a wonderful
thing which acts in the Body, yet is no
part of the Body. Therefore the Fire is
a Coeleſtial Virtue, it is uniformed; that
is, it is always the ſame until the period
of its Operation is come; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to perfection, it acts no more,
for every Agent, when the end of its
action is come, then reſts.</p>
                     <p>Remember then, that when we ſpeak
of our Fire which ſublimes not, that thou
do not miſtake, and think that the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Compound which is within
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51319:24"/>
the Glaſs, ought not to Sublime, for that
it muſt do unceſſantly; but the Fire that
ſublimes not is the Metalline love, which
is above, and below, and in all places
alike. Now then for a cloſe to all that
hath been ſaid, learn, and be well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
what matter you take in hand, for
an evil Crow lays an evil Egg, as the
Proverb hath it; Let thy Seed be pure,
and thy Matrix alſo pure, then ſhalt thou
ſee a Noble Off-ſpring: Let the Fire
without be ſuch, as in which our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
may play to and fro unceſſantly,
and this (in a few days) will produce
that which thou moſt longeſt for, the
<hi>Crows Bill.</hi> Continue then thy Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in an hundred and thirty days
thou ſhalt ſee the <hi>White Dove,</hi> and in
ninety days more the <hi>Sparkling Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim.</hi>

We, nor any of the Antients knew any
other way; for it is impoſſible that our
ſecret can be wrought by any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or any other diſpoſition then this.
Our Sophiſm lies only in the two kinds
of Fire in our work: the Internal ſecret
Fire, which is Gods Inſtrument, hath no
qualities perceptible to man, of that Fire
we ſpeak often, and ſeem yet to ſpeak
of the External heat; and hence ariſe
among the unwary many Errours. This
is our Fire which is graduated, for the
External heat, is almoſt linear all the
work, to the white work, it is one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
alteration, ſave that in the ſeaven
firſt days we keep the heat a little ſlack
for certainty and ſecurity ſake, which
an experienced Philoſopher need not do.</p>
                           <p>But the Internal governing heat is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51319:28"/>
graduated hourly, and by how
much that is daily vigorated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Decoction, the Colours are
altered, and the Compound maturated:
I have unfolded a main knot unto you,
take heed of being inſnared here again.</p>

                           <p>Then you muſt provide a Glaſs Tun,
in which you may perfect your work,
without which you could never do any
thing; Let it be either Oval or Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
ſo big in reference to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
that it may hold about twelve

let your Glaſs be thick and ſtrong, clear,
and free of flaws, with a neck about a
Span or Foot long; In this Egg put your
matter, ſealing the neck carefully, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
flaw, or crack, or hole, for the leaſt
vent will let out the ſubtile Spirit, and
deſtroy the work.</p>
                           <p>You may know the exact Sealing of
your Glaſs thus, when it is cold, put the
neck where it is ſealed, into your mouth,

vent, you will draw out the Air, that is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51319:28"/>

when you take the Glaſs from your

                           <p>You muſt then provide your ſelf with
a Furnace, by wiſe men called an <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
in which you may accompliſh your
work; nor will any one ſerve in your
firſt work; But ſuch a one in which you
may give a heat obſcurely red at your
pleaſure, or leſſer, and that in its higheſt
degree of heat, it may endure twelve
hours at the leaſt.</p>
                           <p>This if you would obtain; Obſerve,
Firſt, that your neſt be no bigger then
to contain your diſh with about an Inch
vacancy at the ſide where the Vent-hole
of your <hi>Athanor,</hi> is for the Fire to play.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Let your Diſh be no bigger
then to hold one Glaſs with about an
inch thickneſs of Aſhes between the Glaſs
and ſide, remembring the word of the
Philoſopher, One Glaſs, One Thing, One
Furnace; for ſuch a Diſh ſtanding with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51319:29"/>
the bottom level to the vent-hole, which
in ſuch a Furnace ought to be but one,
about three Inches Diameter, ſloping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
will with the ſtream of Flame,
which is always playing to the top of the
Veſſel, and round about the bottom, be
kept always in a glowing heat.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, If your Diſh be bigger, your
Furnace vent muſt be within a third part,
or a fourth as big as your Platter is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
elſe it cannot be exactly, nor
continually heated.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, If your Tower be above ſix
Inches ſquare at the Fire-place, you are
out of proportion, and can never do
rightly as to the point of heat; For if
you cauſe it (if above that proportion)
to ſtream with flame, the heat will be too
big: And if it ſtream not, it will not
be big enough, or very hardly.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, Let the top of your Furnace
be cloſed to an hole which may but juſt
ſerve for caſting in of Coals about three
Inches Diameter or Square, which will

                           <p>Theſe things thus ordered, ſet in your
Glaſs with your matter, and give Fire as
Nature requires, eaſie, not too violent;
beginning there where Nature left. Now
know, that Nature hath left your Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
in the Mineral Kingdom; therefore
though we take compariſon from Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
and Animals; Yet you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a Parallel in the Kingdom, in which
the Subject you would handle is placed:
As for Inſtance, if I ſhould Analogize,
between the Generation of a Man, and
the Vegetation of a Vegetable, you muſt
not underſtand, as though the heat for
one, were to be meaſured by the other;
for we know, that in the ground Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
will grow, which is not without
heat, which they in the Earth feel, even
in the beginning of the Spring; yet
would not an Egg be hatched in that
heat, nor could a man feel any warmth,
but rather to him a numbing cold.</p>
                           <p>Since then you know that your work
appertains all to the Mineral Kingdom;
you muſt know what heat is fit for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Bodies; and may be called a gentle
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51319:30"/>
heat, and what violent; Firſt, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
where Nature leaves you, not only
in the Mineral Kingdom, but in it to
work on Gold and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are
both incombuſtible: Yet <hi>Mercury</hi> being
tender, will break all Veſſels, if the Fire
be over extreme; Therefore though it
be incombuſtible, and ſo no Fire can hurt
it, yet alſo it muſt be kept with the Male
Sperm in one Glaſs, which if the Fire be
too big, cannot be, and by conſequence
the work cannot be accompliſhed. So
then from the degree of heat that will
keep Lead or Tin conſtantly molten, and
higher, ſo high as the Glaſs will endure
without danger of breaking, is a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heat; and ſo you begin your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of heat according to the Kingdom
in which Nature hath left you.</p>
                           <p>As then the higheſt degree of heat
which the root of a Tree feels in the
bowels of the Earth; is not by far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the loweſt degree of heat an
Animal hath; So the higheſt degree of
heat a Vegetable will endure without
burning, is too low for the firſt degree
of Mineral heat as to our Work.</p>

Our <hi>Stone</hi> is made of one Root, that is,
of two Mercurial Subſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This

for firſt there is the Body, which is <hi>Sol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
and the Water of <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
its Mercuriality, there is a ſpiritual
ſeed of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is the ſecret Fire.
This is the <hi>Trinity,</hi> theſe are called the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51319:62"/>
Body, the Soul, and the Spirit; the Body
is the dead Earth, which increaſeth not
without the celeſtial Vertue; the Spirit is
the Soul of our Air or Chameleon, which
is alſo of a two-fold compoſure, yet
made one inſeparably; the Soul is the
Bond of <hi>Mercury,</hi> without which our
Fire never appears, nor can appear, for
it is naked, it inhabits the <hi>Fiery-Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
and it yields his Soul to the true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnia,</hi>
and is embraced by it, and both
become one together, bearing the ſtamp
of the moſt High, even the Oriental <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi>
the Son of the Morning: This Soul
is <hi>Chalyb's</hi> Magical Volatile, and very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the true Minera of <hi>Sol,</hi> out of which
<hi>Sol</hi> naturally proceeds, which I my ſelf
know to be true, and have ſpoken of it
in my little Latin Treatiſe, called <hi>Introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
apertus ad occluſum Regis palatium:</hi>
This is true <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is imbibed by
the Mercuriality of <hi>Saturnia,</hi> and notes
it with the Regal Signet, and being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and revived into a Mineral Water by
the Mediation of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Doves, it is the
ſharp Spirit which in the Water moves
the Body to putrefie. Thus is the <hi>Trinity</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51319:63"/>
proportionable, to wit, three Natures in
the firſt Mixture, the Work is carried an
end to perfect Complement diſtinctly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Vertue of a Body, Soul, and
Spirit: for the Body would be never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative,
were it not for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor
would the <hi>Spirit</hi> be permanent in its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-perfect
Tincture, were it not for the
Body; nor could theſe two act one upon
another without the Soul, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> is
an inviſible thing, nor doth it ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
without another Garment, which
Garment is the Soul. In this it exerciſeth
its vertue: this <hi>Soul,</hi> as it is drawn from
the <hi>Saturnia,</hi> ſolid and dry, is named our
Air, or rather the Chameleon, which is
an airy Body, changing its hue accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to every Object it beholds, ſo our Air
is of an aſtoniſhing Nature, out of which
I know all Metals may be drawn, yea
even <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> without the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting
<hi>Elixir,</hi> of which in my little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Treatiſe (which was the Congeſt of

                     <p>This Air being diſſolved into Water
Mineral, hath in it two of our <hi>Trinity</hi>
united ſo really that in a ſhort digeſtion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51319:63"/>
the ſpiritual inhabiting inviſible <hi>Sulphur</hi>
will without addition congeal the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>

<hi>Sol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus this <hi>Trinity</hi> is indeed <hi>

being Gold mature, fixt, and digeſted in

to the Artiſt of the truth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
theſe are the Spirit, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

in one; the Water is a Mercurial Bond,
which the Sophiſters can behold ſo far as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51319:73"/>
the outward ſhell reacheth, but the wiſe
man can behold his hidden ſecret Centre:
the Blood is of our <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> which
is indeed the greeneſt or raweſt of the
three: for it hath no manner of Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> no not a grain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is <hi>Totally Volatile,</hi> and it is
more raw than the common Water,
and yet it is called the Blood, for a moſt
ſecret reaſon, becauſe it is the feat of the
Life, which is the Spirit, as Blood in man
is the ſeat of his Life; yea the Spirit by
this Soul of our <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
and is united to it, ſo that though
it be very green or unripe, yet that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
it, which is both pure and ripe, and
can and will digeſt it with the Water, and
make both become life with life: Now
the Spirit is nothing elſe but a Chaos, the
Wonder of the Wonders of God, which
every man almoſt hath, and knows it not,
becauſe as it appears to the World it is
compact in a vile deſpiſed form; yet is it
ſo uſeful, that in humane Affairs none can
want it: to the Philoſopher it appears
united to the Blood, that is, of our <hi>Green

                     <p>We have in our work properly three
<hi>Mercuries,</hi> of which one is to be by the
Philoſopher prepared, of which I have
ſpoken; and this being joynd with the
perfect Body, and ſet to digeſt, the Glaſs
is ſhut, and then in this firſt Compoſition
is the Matter called <hi>Rebis,</hi> that is, (two
things) to wit in Number, for you may
yet ſeparate each from other in its intire
nature.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two being joyned, do operate
ſo within the Veſſel till the Compound
become a black Powder, which is then
called the Aſhes of the Platter.</p>
                     <p>This Powder relenteth into a black
Broth, which is called <hi>Elixir,</hi> or Water
extracted by Elixation, which is reiterate
Liquefaction.</p>

                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51319:75"/>
This Elixir is divided into a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
part, which is called <hi>Azoth,</hi> and the
groſſer part is called <hi>Leton,</hi> which is by
<hi>Azoth</hi> waſhed and whitened.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Rebis</hi> the Matters are confuſed, in

(which though it be a Water, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt palpable part, and viſible,
may be termed the Body of the Water:
the laſt is a Fiery Form, which is the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51319:77"/>
Blood of <hi>Cadmus;</hi> this is a real inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

material, which doth actuate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

is viſible, and may be ſeen, and
is more material and paſſive: Now thoſe

Nature, and all together make but
one univerſal <hi>Mercury,</hi> by intimate union,

of the Stone; for before our <hi>Mercury</hi> (as
it was compounded of three <hi>Mercuries)</hi>
had in it two which were ſuperficial, and
the third eſſential to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> only,

This is called by <hi>Ripley</hi> a moſt perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Humidity: and note by the way,
that the firſt Water is called by Authors
a permanent Water likewiſe; but take
notice that there is a different reaſon for
each denomination; for firſt of all, all
<hi>Mercury</hi> is Water permanent, that is, the
parts have no Heterogeneity, they will
not leave one another in the examen of
the Fire, but either all flyes and is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
or elſe all abides and is conſtant in
the tryal of <hi>Vulcan:</hi> and ſo is our firſt
<hi>Menſtruum.</hi> And in this our <hi>Mercury</hi> and
<hi>Common Mercury</hi> agree, beſides the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter, for it is the form only
that diſtinguiſheth them. But in the next
place, our Water is permanent with the
Body, which <hi>Common Mercury</hi> is not;
that is, it by digeſtion doth unite, not
only adhere to it, ſo that both together
do make one <hi>Individuum,</hi> which is done
by our ſecret Conjunction. But laſtly,
when the Body is thus by our Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
at laſt it comes that the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Putrefaction and Purification, which is

that is pure will aſcend, and all that is
impure deſcend, and will abide in the
bottom of the Veſſel in the form of a

<hi>Sulphur</hi> it will in the end bring forth,

all <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and that all incombuſtible.
This work is called the burning of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>

firſt, into a black unctuous Calx, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable
as Atoms, which are only to be

into a fine white Calx, in which is the
<hi>Moon</hi> in the full: the third, a red Calx,
in which the <hi>Sun</hi> is Orient. Now know
that the firſt Calcination is from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in which the <hi>Sun</hi> ſeeks to

it finds from the water, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded,
and after through the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Earth, totally Eclipſed.</p>
                     <p>This Fire therefore, becauſe of the
mixture of it with the natural Fire of
<hi>Sol,</hi> which is in it diſſolved, is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural;
the firſt Fire of our Water is
called Fire againſt nature, and the Fire
of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the perfect Body is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fire of nature. In this operation,
through the power and will of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
the Body which hath been ſo
long dead, is by this Water quickned,
and actually ſprouts like to a Vegetable;
for when the pores of it are opened by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51319:91"/>
the moiſtning of our Water, it ſtraight
begins to follow the Spirit upon the Fire,
the Spirit then doth mount aloft; which
the Body thus made tender cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but as the Poet ſaith, <hi>non paſſibus
aequis,</hi> as a Son that is little followeth his
Father. It therefore in a token of its
friendſhip with the Water, doth bud
forth like to the tender Froſt upon the
ſurface of the Earth, and retains a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Water with it ſelf, occupying
a middle room between the bottom and
the top; in which reſpects the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have called it their Soul, which to
ſhew its union to the Body, riſeth no

And verily this Soul is the Magnetical

                     <p>This Tree of ours ſome have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to one thing, and ſome to another;
ſome to a Cypreſs or Fir-Tree, which
indeed may ſeem to reſemble it; others
to Haw-Thorn Trees, as <hi>Ripley</hi> in his
<hi>Gate of Cibation;</hi> others to Shrubs and
Buſhes, others to thick Woods, and in
theſe Woods, ſaith <hi>Lambſprint,</hi> there is
a Beaſt all over black. I confeſs there is
a ſimilitude between our Germination,
and all theſe; others, becauſe of the
Humidity of the Compound, which is
ever and anon returning by drops, have
likened it to a mooriſh low Bog, in which
Ruſhes grow, and Toads keep; others
have called it their Coral, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the fitteſt compariſon, for in our
Tree there are Shoots and Sprigs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing that may be properly
likened to Leaves: as then Coral is an
union of a Vegetable and a Stony na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo is it in our Tree, (for Stones
and Minerals are of one Impoſition) our
Tree is Metalline, and yet through the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51319:92"/>
power of God it ſeems to Vegetate.
2ly. Coral grows under the water, where
one would think no Vegetable could
grow; ours alſo grows in a heat in which
no Vegetable but it ſelf can grow.
3ly. Coral hath many Sprigs and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
without Leaves; ſo is our Tree.
4ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coral as it is under water hath a
moſt exquiſite biting taſt, which in the
Air it quickly loſeth; ſo our Stone, or
Tree Metalline, in its place is of a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
fiery nature, but taken out, it in
a ſhort ſpace loſeth the ſame irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
5ly. There are five ſorts of Coral,
the common Gray, the Milk White, the
Green, the Bloud Red, and the Black;
ſo our Tree is at his periods of all theſe
colours, and in this form, which Tree by
the heat of the Fire is dryed to a Calx,
which is called the Aſhes of <hi>Hermes</hi> Tree.
Laſtly, Coral is more heavy then any
other Vegetable; and ſo is our Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

the Cut-throat of Covetouſneſs, Pride,
Ambition, and ſuch like ſordid Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who would not beſtow a little time
in the Inquiry of it? In which let me
aſſure thee in the very words of <hi>Treviſan,</hi>
the Art is ſo plain, that if it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
deſcribed it would be contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And yet in vulgar Mechanicks, how
frequent is it for men to ſerve ſeven,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51319:102"/>
eight, yea ten years Apprentiſhip to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them? And in ſome that are a little
more ingenious, how frequently are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſums of Money beſtowed to
boot? Yet in this noble Art, ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
all Humane Sciences as the Sun
doth a Candle, who will imploy himſelf
with diligence? unleſs it be ſome Money-minded
Sots, who ſeek only for Riches;
and yet how ſoon are even they weary?
So that few or none perſiſt in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
ſave a few Roguiſh Sophiſters
who live by Cozening; by reaſon of ſuch
the Art is ſcandalized, and ill ſpoken of:
Yet truſt me, for I ſpeak knowingly, the
Art is both true and eaſie; yea ſo eaſie,
that if you did ſee the Experiment, you
could not believe it. I made not five
wrong Experiments in it, before I found
the truth, although in ſome particular
turnings of the <hi>Encheireſis,</hi> I erred oft;
yet ſo, as I in my error knew my ſelf a
Maſter, and in leſs then full two years

a true <hi>Adept,</hi> and have the Secret

this is true, there are thoſe alive that can

bear witneſs to this my writing, which
I penn'd for the ſake of the Ingenious,
that they may have <hi>Ariadne</hi>'s thread
ſtretched out to guide them; ſo with the

Experience ſee and know, that I wrote
nothing but what the Light of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                        <p>WE have led thee as it were by
the hand through many a
waſte Field, and many a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart
and Thicket, and now lift up your
eyes and behold where you are, and
now welcom my Friend into the Garden
of the Philoſophers; here you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
(like a Landskip) a very glorious
Caſtle, walled about with a very high
wall, and twelve Gates one following
another hindering your entrance and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51319:109"/>
Poſſeſſion of it at will, one being opened
the reſt open of themſelves, and yield
to thee a far more renowned Conqueſt,
then ever <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> won. The
firſt Gate loe is as it were dug hollow
into the Earth, and little to be ſeen above
the Superficies: view well the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is written over it, which is
the words of that Curſe which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on <hi>Adam,</hi> in the day that he fell,
<hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
Mark the Eſcutcheon that is ſet
forth upon the Gate, this ſignifies unto
thee, that ſome Great Perſon is dead
within, therefore behold the Attendants
all ſtand in Mourning; amongſt whom
one with this verſe of <hi>Solomon, I am
black, but comely, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Lady the Sages have called <hi>Juno,</hi>
or the Metallick Nature, which is indeed
very comely, yet black, for why the Sun
hath ſhined upon her. Another who
ſeems to ſupply the room of the Porter,
ſpeaks unto you in theſe words, <hi>Nothing
entreth hither that defileth, or that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi>
But enough of this, we muſt not
here ſtand gazing, leſt we be taken for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51319:109"/>
Spyes; but we will knock for a Guide,
who may go along with us; for know
that this Caſtle is a Garriſon, and muſt
not be viewed without a Guide, who
may conduct us in and out, and ſhew us
what the places are through which we
paſs. And now he is come, I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you ſomewhat of his conditions,
that you may know how to pleaſe him,
that he may be the more willing to go
along with you in the right way, and
not leave you, as he hath done ſome, nor
miſlead you, as he hath done others, who
when they have attempted this work
with good ſucceſs in the knowledge of
matters requiſite, they notwithſtanding
have fatally erred, not knowing how to
pleaſe their Guide, who hath a humour
of his own not to be equalled in the
World; and if you make him either ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
or cholerick, you had as good give
over the enterpriſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of all then know, that for his
parts he is a very ſtupid Fool, there is
none more ſimple among all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
yet is he moſt faithfull to his
Lord, and doth all things for him moſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51319:110"/>
prudently, ordering all things in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
very diſcreetly; which I may rather
aſcribe to a natural inſtinct, then to any
quickneſs of parts. He is very faithful,
for that cauſe he will never either ask or
anſwer any queſtion, but goes on ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Nor will he ever go before you, but
follow; you muſt be very wary how you
lead him, if he can find an opportunity
he will give you the ſlip, and leave you
to a world of misfortune. By his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
you ſhall know whether he be
pleaſed or diſpleaſed; therefore lay bonds
on him, that is, ſhut him cloſe where he
may not get forth, then go wiſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with heat, and ever obſerve his
countenance as he follows; his anger
you ſhall know, by redneſs in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and his ſullenneſs by his lumpiſh
behaviour; in his good temper he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
active and merry; and ſo you
ſhall paſs on forward, or turn, or go back,
as you ſee his countenance and temper
inclined. In the next place you are to
underſtand, that he was born to be a
drudge, and is the very Servant unto all
his Brethren; and hereupon he doth as it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51319:110"/>
were monopolize the whole toyl and
task of labour to himſelf, and if you go
about to do any thing, he will preſently
take ſnuff, and will leave you all the
work to do, and will not do one ſtroke
more.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he through long cuſtom hath
gotten a habit of perpetual working,
and therefore if you allow him one hours
reſpite, he will never work more; for
in his Fathers houſe he committed the
offence of <hi>Cham,</hi> and is therefore judged
to be a Servant of Servants: his body is
very tender and naked, yet will he have
no Cloaths, nor will he endure any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation
of parts without exception;
for in his youth he offended with <hi>Ruben,</hi>
and went up to his Fathers Couch, and
was for that doomed to a perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,
and is as unſtable as Water.
Theſe in general are the qualifications of
your Guide, and you muſt addreſs your
ſelf to him accordingly, or elſe your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
will be in vain.</p>

black, bluiſh, and yellowiſh, in which
you may ſee a Carcaſs intombed, and
very rotten; a Serpent almoſt dead with
cold, laid to the fire, and a Fountain ſtill
flowing forth to water a Pot which is
nigh to it, in which is planted an Herb
much like to <hi>Ros ſolis,</hi> only it hath the
Root black, the Leaves yellow, with
bluiſh veins and black ſpots in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
ſtanding in a dew, and over it
the Sun as in the Solſtice, ſhining in its
full vigour, and under in a Fire, as it
were of <hi>Aetna</hi> burning continually. The
Fountain ſtill ſends a few ſmall ſtreams of
Pearly water to the Root of this Herb,
which by inſenſible pores aſcend and
ſtand like drops diſcoloured on the
Leaves of the Herb, which ſeems as
though blaſted and withering, and yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51319:111"/>
always full of drops, which dropping
down again, and riſing continually, do
reſolve the Tree into a viſcous Juice,
which is afterwards dried up into a dry
duſt, yet unctuous to ſight, and very
black.</p>

                        <head>After Philoſophy I you behight.</head>
                        <p>THen I lift up mine eyes, and behold
I ſaw<hi> Nature </hi>as a Queen gloriouſly
adorned, ſitting upon her Throne, and in
her hand a fair Book, which was called,<hi>Philoſophy Reſtored to its Primitive Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>whom with low ſubmiſſion I did obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
to, and ſhe graciouſly took notice
of me, and gave me this Book to eat
it up, which I did, and ſtraight-way ſhe
had another of the ſame in her hand:
Then was my Underſtanding ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that I did fully apprehend all things
which I ſaw and heard; and when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
to any Gate or Door, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(as though they were acted by a
ſenſitive Spirit) they opened of their own
accord: And all in the Houſe did fealty to
me, and ſaid that I was to be honoured as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51319:112"/>
Lord of the place:<hi> For, </hi>ſay they,<hi> the
Queen and He are in love united, and ſhe
moreover hath plighted her troth to him.</hi>Then I conſidered with my ſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Book that I had devoured (like
a Charm) had ſo commanded my Spirits,
that I could think of nothing more than
the enjoyment of this rare Beauty which
I had beheld: And while I was full of
theſe thoughts, behold I heard a Voice
behind me, ſaying,<hi> What wouldeſt thou in
this World? </hi>I was a little aſtoniſhed at
the Voice, but yet boldly anſwered,<hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that I might once more ſee that
admirable Perfection which once I beheld in
a Nymph, which not long ſince I ſaw, who
with ſeeming affection did ſalute me, and
gave me a Book to eat; which when I had
eaten, my Intellectuals ſeemed as though the
Candle of the Lord had been kindled in them:
But ſince I could never ſee her whom my
Heart longs for: Oh that I might only be ſo
happy again! </hi>Then ſaid the Voice,<hi> Thou art
happy in that thou haſt ſeen her, more happy
in that ſhe gave thee that Book, which few
in an Age attain to; most happy in that
thou couldeſt and didst eat it, which every
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51319:112"/>
one that hath it cannot do: She therefore
whom thou ſeekeſt for, is gone into her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Solitudes, and as a Legacy hath left
thee two great Treaſures, the Treaſure of
Riches, and the Treaſure of Long Lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>Then ſaid I,<hi> Ah Sir, this you tell me of, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an aggravation of my miſery; for all
the wealth in this world I count but as a ſtraw
in compariſon of the enjoyment of that moſt
admirable Lady's preſence, whoſe Service
I ſhould take for a greater happineſs, than
if I were Maſter of all the World beſides.
If then I may not ſee her again, my Life
will be to me a burden, and to what then
will Long Life avail? </hi>Thus I ſat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
my ſelf, and I heard a ſhrill
Voice as it were cloſe by me, and I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuddenly, and behold an unſpeakable
Light, in compariſon whereof the Sun it
ſelf ſeemed dark; and cloſe by me I ſaw
a moſt ſecret place, and in it a ſecret
Room of Diaphanous matter, and round,
and within it this Lady whom I formerly
had ſeen, upon her Throne; and another
in the perſon of a King, in moſt gay Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if it were a Robe of beaten
Gold, which reached from his ſhoulders
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51319:113"/>
to the ground, and a Crown of pure
Gold on his head; and a third perſon,
who like a Water-bearer had a Pitcher
on his ſhoulder, and in the midſt of it
there burned as it were a Lamp: The
ſight was excellent, yet I could not be
pleaſed, for that I ſaw this Lady ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with this King, ſo in private; and
while I viewed the Room, I found it was
exquiſitely cloſed on every ſide, ſo that
it ſeemed as if it were made of one intire
piece of Cryſtal. I marvelled at what I
ſaw: for the Houſe was but ſmall, the
Chamber leſs, and the Cloſet of Cryſtal
to ſight no bigger than a ſmall Egg; and
the three Parties, with all the Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them, might well have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in a Hazel Nut: Yet was their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineaments
ſo lively, that I might eaſily
diſcern her intire ſhape, whom I could
not but with diſtracted thoughtfulneſs
and a ſad countenance behold; which
ſhe perceiving, ſaid unto me,<hi> Friend, Why
art thou ſad? I am not ſad, </hi>quoth I,<hi> moſt
Noble Lady, but am penſively meditating
on what I behold, which doth not a little
amaze me, the ſight not being to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51319:113"/>
in </hi>John Tradeſcants<hi> Chamber of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which is the Syſtem of the Novel
Rarities of the known World: For whom I
lately beheld glorious upon a Throne in the
Majeſty of a Queen, I now ſee cloistered up
in a ſmall Diaphanous Pix, in a ſtature
ſo ſmall as is ſcarce credible: Moreover,
whom I deemed ſo piouſly virtuous a Lady,
to be ſo retiredly naked with a man, only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a Water-bearer, makes me very
thoughtful what this thing ſhould be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it was my hopes ſo to have ingratiated
my ſelf into your favour, as to have been a
Servant unto you, who I ſee are otherwiſe
provided of a Lover. </hi>Then ſaid ſhe,<hi> My
Friend, what you admire in this ſtrange
Metamorphoſis of me, know that it is by a
Magical Vertue, which is alone given to
me from GOD, my immediate Lord and
Ruler; and for any Diabolical Art, which
your Scruple ſeems to manifeſt your ſuſpition
of, it is becauſe of your unexperience in
theſe things; and this your Ignorance is no
way provoking unto me, for in theſe Affairs
(though a man) yet you are but a Child;
and this liberty I allow all my Sons while
they are Children, ſo to ſpeak, ſo to think,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51319:114"/>
and ſo to act; and I love to hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their childiſh prattle. Know then that
the Devil is but one of my Servants, and
in my Kingdom he doth ſerve GOD, his
and my Lord: And though of all my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
he is the worst, yet he can do nothing
of himſelf, either without me, or againſt
me, or above me: He for the moſt part is a
deceitful Jugler, and doth make things
appear, that are not; but whatever is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
effected by him, is nothing but what is
in my Power: He only applies Agents to
Patients, and adds a little of his own vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
qualities, as a circumſtantial aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the horror of what he thus (by my
virtue) brings to paſs, and then his villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
mind attributes that to himſelf, which
is my Act, that ſo he might arrogate the
honour due to my Lord and his Maſter.
Now I will tell you a ſtrange thing, which
yet is very true: I am obedient to all my
Subjects, which are many, and they obey
me; I rule them, and they do as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
me, for ſo my Lord hath pleaſed to
ordain it: If they call me, I am ſtraight
at hand; yea, in my Body which thou ſeeſt
(which is no Body (but only repreſentative)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51319:114"/>
for I am all Spirit) I feel the Sympathies
and Antipathies, the Actions and Paſſions
of every thing in the World; and I must
be always preſent, for nothing is or can be
well done without I be preſent: I always
work according to the ſubject and its diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which doth alter the effect wonderfully.
In a word, whatever thou ſeeſt that I am, and
more then thou canſt ſee by far, though thou
hadſt the Eyes of </hi>Argus.<hi> My Rule is not
as is the Rule of Princes among Men, but
I am ſerviceable to all, yea to the leaſt
Worm in the World; and becauſe I am ſo
ſerviceable, therefore my Maſter hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
that nothing can or may diſobey me,
or offer violence to me; the Devil here hath
no power, though malice enough: Therefore
my Lord hath given me his own </hi>Diploma<hi>to make me the more Honourable; firſt, An
Omniſciency of all things which are done in
the World, as touching the Being, Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Mutation of them; and next, An
Omnipreſency, by which I am every where
preſent at once, and I am ſeated in the
Will of God, which is my Centre, All my
Subjects are put under Man, therefore he
hath a free power to act any thing within
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51319:115"/>
his reach in the World; and the Soul of
Man is as it were a Magnet unto me, and
all my Subjects, in its Exaltation and
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, by Faith to my Lord and Maſter;
though ſince Man loſt his Dignity, he lost
alſo his Knowledge, and his Will is liable
to the Temptations of the Devil; and ſo as
many as by renouncing their Creator do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
themſelves to Satan, he hath by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
power to exalt their Will, and to
apply their Power to the effecting of things
poſſible in Nature, and impoſſible for the
Devil to perform alone, (whoſe pride would
ſcorn to crave help, if he could) and beyond
the knowledge of the inthralled Caytiff, who
miſtaking the effect, and not ſeeing how it
was done by himſelf and not Satan (though
his power for want of knowledge to employ
it, without his help were made uſe of by him,
and applied according to his own Deviliſh
Deſign) the Wretch is inſnared to bind
over both his Soul and Body to the Devil, as
a requital of this Service, ſo crafty a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
is he. But this being from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſcope, I ſhall forbear to ſpeak further of
it at preſent, lest I ſhould diſtract, not edifie
you. Now as concerning your jealouſie for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51319:115"/>
that you ſee me naked with this King, know
that this place and my Kingdom are in the
State of Innocency, though we are by the
Fall of </hi>Adam<hi> laid ſubject to Vanity; and
till the final Restitution of that Fall, I am
forbidden to work any thing of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
beyond the ſtate of fading corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
though all things have an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit, which when Heaven and Earth
ſhall be renewed, ſhall cauſe an Immutable
Glory in all theſe things. Know then that
this King is my Servant, and he hath many
Brethren who in their paſſage to him are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſoners, and kept in bondage, and
there is no way to Redeem them, unleſs he
give his Fleſh and Blood for their Ranſom,
which cannot be effectual, unleſs he die and
ariſe from the Dead: This I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
alone my ſelf, nor can any help me
herein but Man alone; for God hath here
limited my power, I cannot bring Agents
and Patients together, though he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me power to work on them being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and to effect what may ſerve for the
Ranſom of thoſe poor Captives, and he hath
given man a free power to act in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him in the World, though through
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51319:116"/>
the Fall the Wings of this power are not clipt
at all, but clogged with Ignorance, that it is
very uneffectual in compariſon of its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
If thou couldeſt but underſtand and
believe, thy very Soul would command all
Nature in the whole Fabrick of it: for if
thou didst but know things as they are, thou
wouldest withal clearly ſee the Dignity of
thy Soul, being the Image of God; and this
would command Faith, and kindle Deſire:
Now Faith and a kindled Deſire in the Soul
is that extatical Paſſion which attracts
the whole </hi>Phaenomena<hi> of Nature. This
is the Dignity of a Mental Man. Now
then, my Friend, hearken to me, and what
I adviſe, that do; help me in what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
and I will help thee in what thou canſt
not; ſo ſhalt thou be (to GOD ſubordinate)
Lord both of me and mine; and the Blood
of this King, which redeems his Brethren,
will give thee a Medicine to command all
the Imperfections of thy mortal Body; and
though it be no Antidote against Death,
the irrevocable Decree being past, yet it
triumphs over all the Miſeries of Life, both
of Poverty and Sickneſs, and it poſſeſſeth a
Man of the most incomparable Treaſures of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51319:116"/>
this World. </hi>Then full of Admiration,
with Tears for very Joy trickling down
abundantly, I beſpake her, and ſaid,<hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I thank you for your ſo great favour to
me, as ſo familiarly to diſcourſe with me;
Now then, without any Complement, I am
yours </hi>(ad uſque aras)<hi> and whatever you
pleaſe, that will I do. </hi>Then ſaid ſhe,<hi> 
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Chamber and Cloſet there is a Stove,
put Fire into it, for this King muſt ſweat to
death. Ah ſweet Lady, </hi>ſaid I,<hi> and what
will become of you? Care not you for that,</hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> do you as I bid you: But yet
farther to ſatisfie your curious mind, let me
tell you, That I indure without hurt the moſt
violent Fires which are or can be made, for
I am in them all, and no leſs in the most
frozen places. </hi>Then I conſidered, and
methought my Underſtanding it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
and I perceived the extent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of a ſudden ſhe appeared not
to my ſight; but where ſhe was I ſaw a
moſt exquiſite Light, which took up an
incredible ſmall room, and methoughts
my Head ſeemed as it were diaphanous:
And while I conſidered theſe things, it
came into my mind to wonder what was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51319:117"/>
become of my Guide, for I miſs'd him.
While theſe thoughts perplexed me, an
Anſwer was given, as if from an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Spirit within the Glaſs, ſaying,<hi> Let
not thoughts fill your mind, he whom you
ſeek is with us, for ſo it muſt be, this King
is his Lord. </hi>This ſtraight made me view
the complexion of the Water-bearer, and
his countenance told me that he was my
very Guide: Then I viewed his Pitcher
well, and I found that his Pitcher was
clear as pure Silver; and what was
ſtrange, the Bearer, and the Pitcher, and
the Water in it were one; and in the
midſt of the Water, as it were in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
centre, there was a moſt radiant
twinkling Spark, which ſent forth its
Beams even to the very ſurface of the
Water, and appeared as it were a Lamp
burning, and yet no way diſtinguiſhable
from the Water. The Voice then ſpake
to me a ſecond time,<hi> Delay not to put Fire
under us, and govern it as you ſhall hear the
Voice direct you. </hi>Then I put Fire in at
the open door at the top of the high Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
and Coals upon it, and cauſed my
doors to be ſtopt both above and below,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51319:117"/>
and on every ſide; only by a ſecret paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
I conveyed my Immortal Fire under
the Chamber in which was the Cloſet,
and forthwith when all things were heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Water-bearer took his Pitcher,
and through a ſmall Pipe he poured out
his Water, and the Fire came out with
the Water, without any particular ſhape,
only it added a luſtre thereto; and no
ſooner was the Water poured forth, but
the Water-bearer with his Pitcher popt
as it were under the ſtreams, and I ſaw
them no more: And though the clearneſs
of the Water did make it to appear as it
were Diaphanous, yet I found by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
view that it was not ſo really, but
only as to apparency, and that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very compact: And as I wiſtfully
beheld it, I ſaw as it were a goodly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the midſt of it, which was no way
reſembling the former Beauty which I
had diſcourſed withal, whoſe Name was<hi>Nature; </hi>yet indeed very bcautiful, even
to the parallel of<hi> Helena. </hi>This Lady was
naked, and of an admirable fair comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xioned
Skin, as bright as the fineſt Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
at firſt ſhe appeared very ſmall, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51319:118"/>
waxed bigger and bigger, until the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appeared no more, but ſhe her ſelf
had tranſmuted its whole ſubſtance into
her ſhape. This ſight I beheld with pity,
for ſhe (far unlike unto the firſt Lady)
was wholly impatient of the heat which I
had made, and yet was ſo incloſed in the
Cloſet that ſhe could not get out; ſhe
ſweat therefore even as though ſhe
would melt, and ſeemed as though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
fainting: Then the King (who
ſeemed as it were glad of the heat) ſeeing
her knew her to be his Siſter, his Mother,
and his Wife, and compaſſionating her
eſtate, ran unto her and took her in his
Arms, and ſhe feeling him, did ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embrace him, that he could not ſhake
her off, and with her ſweat partly, and
partly with her tears, ſhe did ſo beſtream
his Kingly Robes, which ſhone like unto<hi>Tagus </hi>or<hi> Pactolus, </hi>that they were all ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
changed into a colour Argent: the
King loving her exceedingly, asked her
what ſhe deſired? She anſwered,<hi> That
her deſire was to have of him Conjugal Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for, </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> I cannot endure this heat,
but I muſt die in it, and without me your
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51319:118"/>
Highneſs can have no Off-ſpring: </hi>The
King condeſcended, and granted her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and ſo ſoon as ſhe conceived the
Kings Seed, ſhe ſaid that ſhe was better
able to endure the Fire which did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon her.</p>
                        <p>Therefore not contented, ſhe had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
a third and fourth Benevolence,
even to the eleventh time: Then ſaid
the King, <hi>I am very faint and weak:</hi> and
trying to go, as formerly, his Legs and
Feet failed him, his Fleſh and Body wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
as it were to nothing, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
worſe and worſe, until at length his
Body being thus waſted by Venery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſweat exceedingly, ſo long he
ſweated, till he was as it were wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed;
and his Wife ſeeing what fell out,
wept bitterly, and her tears mingling
with her Husbands ſweat, grew into a
large ſtream, in which both ſhe and the
King were drowned; ſo far I beheld: And
then when they were both wholly out of
ſight, I muſed at the ſtrangeneſs of the
object, and while I wondered, methought
I ſaw them aſcend again; but conſidering
it well, I found that there ſwam upon
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51319:119"/>
the Water a Carcaſs, which being wholly
void of Life, did with the heat of the
place draw to putrefaction more and
more, ſo that it grew livid, black, blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
and yellowiſh, and ſent up moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
Exhalations, and with its odour
did ſo infect the Waters, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of an Argent Clearneſs, that they
did grow very thick and dark, and at laſt
black, reſembling the form of muddy
ſlime which is found in Boggs; and at
length with the heat of the Sun the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
was wholly dried up (as Mooriſh
low Grounds in the ſummer time uſe to
be) and I ſought what was become of my
Bodies, and I found a horrible venemous
tumefied Toad, which ſeemed as it were
dying; and a Raven almoſt famiſhed
walking there for to look for meat, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Toad, and preyed upon him,
and with its poiſon died, and made a
moſt filthy ſquallid Liquor blacker than
Ink, and thick like to Pitch melted, which
made me to wonder at the ſight: And
going to depart, I heard a Voice which
ſaid to me, <hi>You muſt not leave us; if you
do, our Perſons and Kingdom is loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51319:119"/>
recovery.</hi> Then my Eyes were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I ſaw <hi>Nature</hi> walking up and
down among the Carcaſes, and in her
hand her unparallell'd Lamp; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a more ſerious view, I ſaw in thoſe
rotten Atoms the Idea's of all things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and ſupernatural; and I found the
dead King with his Wife were intombed
in a Field Sable, and the Tomb as it were
of poliſhed Jet or Ebony; and as in that
place all things were ſtrange, ſo moſt
ſtrange was it that the Tomb and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed
Carcaſs were one, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably.
Alſo upon the Tomb I found
written a Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> That they (if
the Fire were kept equal and continual)
ſhould riſe again, and be more glorious
and powerful than ever they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Then ſaid I to the voice which is
in the Glaſs, I muſt be directed both
what, and how, and when to do. The
voice anſwered me, Take no care, only do
as I ſhall direct, and all ſhall be well; in the
mean time you may view the places that
are about, only be ſure that you neglect
not your time of attending here: And
for to take away the tediouſneſs which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51319:120"/>
the length of time would otherwiſe
work, ask of me, and I ſhall inform you
in whatever you deſire, nor ſhall I think
my diſcourſe to me a burden, ſo you will
not think your labour a trouble. Then
ſaid I, Not ſo; though I ſhould be bound
to ſerve you during my whole Life, yet
ſhould I count it a priviledge, not a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Then ſhe gave unto me as it were
a Ball of fine Silk, wound up as on a
bottom, and ſaid, Make this faſt to a
Pin of this Tower, and then go round
and behold the place, it may ſhorten the
time to you: Carry this bottom with
you, and unwind it as you go, and by
it you may return till you know the
place.</p>

                        <p>THen I paſſed along, and was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
out of that place, but a very
thick miſty darkneſs apprehended me,
ſo thick that I might fell it; and though
my head were as it were tranſparent and
very light, and I took alſo a Candle with
me, which was burning there continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51319:120"/>
at the entrance of the Tower, yet the
darkneſs was ſuch, that it would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the light, for they were not homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial,
but were a little diſ-joyned by
the Rays of the Light, and as it were
here and there condenſed into ſtrange fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
as of Birds, Beaſts, and creeping
things of monſtrous ſhapes: And by
reaſon of this oppoſition the Rays of the
Light extended but a little way, and the
Light moſt clear did ſhoot as it were in
Beams, and the darkneſs ſtood as it were
in cluſters by it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>There were as it were a multitude of
men, who ſeeing my Light in my hand,
which they could not diſcern well, they
being in that dark which would not be
inlightned, but as through a thick cloud
they beheld my Candle, and judged
it ominous, and left their ſtations: for
their eyes with dark and ſmoak were ſo
tender, that my Candle over-poured
them, and they could not bear its luſtre;
therefore they crying out, ran away. I
muſed much at this, how they could be
in ſuch Cimmerian Darkneſs; and as I
wondered, I eſpied that they had with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51319:121"/>
them Light as it were of Fox-fire, or
rotten Wood, and Glow-worms Tails,
and with this they ſat in conſultation,
reading <hi>Geber, Rhaſis,</hi> and ſuch whom I
heard them name, and commenting on
them, not without much pleaſantneſs:
Then I conſidered that the Light which
I had brought with me, did not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the place, but ſtood ſeparated as it
were from the darkneſs; and withal I
remembred that once there was Light in
the World, and the darkneſs comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it not, and that darkneſs had a
falſe fire Light of its own, with which it
ſeemed to its inhabitants wonderous well
inlightned: I ſet down my Candle, and
went with my Thread in my hand, by
which I intended to return. When I was
gone out of ſight of my Candle, my
head began to ſeem as it were opacous,
and a wind had almoſt blown me down:
Then I took my bottom of Thread, and
made it faſt to my Girdle, leſt it might
drop out of my hand; and well it was
that I did ſo, for ſoon a Vertigo came upon
me, and I fell and ſlumbered; and when
I awaked, methoughts it was no more
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51319:121"/>
darkneſs, but day-light about me: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at the very ſtrange change, and
ſtill felt for my Thread, which by that
Light I could not ſee, but only feel it. I
began to look about me, to ſee where I
was, and behold I was in a ruinous place
of many millions of turnings, each lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral ways; and every room was
ſo inlightned with Fox-fire and Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm-Tails,
that for want of a better
Light it ſeemed as if it were day: I took
out of my Pocket a ſmall Book to ſee if
I could read in it, it was called <hi>Enchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion
Phyſicae Reſtitutae,</hi> with an <hi>Arcanum</hi>
at the end of it, and I could not read one
word in it. There met me a man aged
and decrepit, his Face rugged, his Eyes
bleared, his Hands and Fingers corraded,
and ſaluted me, and ſaid merrily, What
Book have you there? It is, ſaid I, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum
Hermeticum.</hi> It is a good Book,
ſaith he. He and <hi>Sendivow</hi> are the two
beſt that ever wrote. I but, ſaid I, I went
to peruſe my Book, and I can read not
one word in it. That's ſtrange, quoth
he; let me ſee it: Then I ſhewed it him,
and he read out of it ſuch ſtrange things
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51319:122"/>
that I never had heard of before; and
<hi>Sandivogius,</hi> ſaith he, is of the ſame mind.
Then he begun to read in him, and read
ſuch Proceſſes that I had never heard of.
I do remember well the Authors, and
what they wrote, but never to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
did I find what you read in
them, ſaid I. Look on them your ſelf,
ſaid he, and you ſhall find it plain: I went
to look on the Book, but could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
any word in it; which made
me wonder. Then I thought with my
ſelf, that as that Light had a peculiar dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from that Light which I ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Tower where I was before, ſo
it might have its peculiar Objects: This
Opinion I had confirmed by this, for that
having <hi>Geber</hi> and <hi>Rhaſis</hi> with me, I tried
how I could read there, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
I could read very well, only ſome
places ſeemed as it were left out, and a
diſtance of white left: I knew that my
Books were perfect, and ſome of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(which were (as they ſeemed to me)
left out) I remembred very well to be
thoſe places in which the Truth was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in few words: Then I returned by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51319:122"/>
my Thread to my Candle, and ſtraight
my head returned to its former diaphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
I took my Candle in my way, and of
a ſudden all my places that ſeemed light
before, returned to be Cimmerian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
only with the time that I had been
there, I found my Eyes were beginning
to grow tender, and ſmarted and itched
at the firſt glimpſe of this true Light,
which then in compariſon of the Light
I had before ſeen, did not ſeem barely
Light, but the Super-Coeleſtial Light of
Paradiſe. Then I demanded of her with
whom in the Glaſs I had former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
concerning what I had ſeen. She
told me, That they were ſuch who wrot
in <hi>Alchymy</hi> according to the Light of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and not of Nature; though to them
their Light ſeem clear enough, yet can
they ſee nothing by it but what is phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical,
and myſtically or ſophiſtically
written by the Envious, for the ſeducing
of ſuch fanciful Doters: therefore when
once the Light of Nature is brought to
their ſtation, it diſcovers Cimmerian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
there, where their imaginary Light
only ſhines, ſuch as is Fox-fire and Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51319:123"/>
Tails, that ſhine only in the dark;
This Light makes their Eyes ſo tender,
that the Lamp of Nature makes them fly.
Moreover, whatever is written accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Light, they cannot ſee, nay
they cannot endure the Light of the true
<hi>Luna</hi> of the wiſe men: for any true
Light diſcovers their Darkneſs, and yet
their Darkneſs is uncapable of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Light. Now in that you went
in among them without your Candle, it
was a bold adventure, for had you loſt
your Thread, you could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
Then I looked into my Tower,
and did as I was directed; and again I
went to view thoſe parts of Cimmerian
Darkneſs once more, yet with my Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in mine hand, and my Thread at my
Girdle; when I came the ſecond time, at
the ſight of this Light all fled, ſo that I
could not meet with any, but I entered
into ſeveral turnings which I ſaw, and
found in them ſeveral works curiouſly
erected, in which I might gueſs they
aimed at nothing leſs than the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Stone.</p>

                        <p>I Found one Furnace moſt curiouſly

were ſeveral Matters, ſome digeſting,
others ſubliming, others diſtilling, others
calcining, and about the Glaſſes and the
Furnace was written this of <hi>Geber, Per
Deum Sulphur eſt omne illud illuminans
quod eſt ſupra terram.</hi> By this I knew,
that <hi>Sulphur</hi> was the ſubject on which
was wrought; and indeed with ſo great
cunning, that I could not but admire the
ingenuity of the men: and knowing
that what a man prizeth, (though it be
a trifle) yet to ſpoil or deſtroy that
would be an injury, I meddled not with
any Glaſs, (for indeed there were La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
that fled not, becauſe they knew
nothing, but only wrought as they were
directed:) and when I came, they could
not perceive that I had any Candle in
my hand, and wondred their Maſters
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51319:124"/>
ſhould fly ſo from a phanſie. Moreover
I found that they could not ſee any light
from the Fox-fire and Glow-worms tails,
which were there; but the place being
dark, as being under ground, they
wrought by Candles and Lamps, which
yet could give their Maſters no light,
but they ſought all the world over for
thoſe ſhining ſubjects: Yet I could not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
both diſcern utter darkneſs,
which the Rays of my Candle would not
enlighten. Then ſaid I to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
What is this that is brought in here?
Oh, ſaid they, they are <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi>
terreſtrial, whereby our Maſters can ſee
clearly the Natures of all things in the
world, and to make by their light the
great <hi>Elixir;</hi> and though we can ſee no
light in them, or very little, it is becauſe
of our Ignorance in theſe things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we uſe our Lamps to work by.
Where are your Maſters? ſaid I. They
ran away, ſaid they, becauſe when you
came they ſaid you were a Devil, and
brought an ominous light with you, and
if they did but once ſee that with a full
view, their Works would all vaniſh;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51319:124"/>
they did therefore lay a few Charms, and
ran away. Then I looked, and the

and Minerals; others were drawing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vinegar with a great care, till it
became exquiſitely ſharp, and in this
they laboured to calcine ſeveral Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
bodies; others were rectifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine, ſo long till no Body almoſt

and this they ſaid was the true
Water of Life that muſt do the work;
others were ſubliming of Lead, hoping
after it was exquiſitely ſublimed, to have
out of it that <hi>Menſtruum</hi> which ſhould
effect the Stone, without any further lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands. This when I had ſeen,
I returned to my Furnace, and recruited
my Fire as I was directed, and made a
particular relation of what I had ſeen,
and deſired the verdict of Nature upon
them all. She told me, That they could
never by this way expect any thing but
loſs. I asked her if they might not with
trying many things, at length hit the
right. She told me, No, they had not
any ground of truth, nor could they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
either the great ſecret, or any other
particular profitable truth, in that way.
Then ſaid I, Noble Lady, pray let me
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51319:125"/>
know the reaſon of their error, that I
may know how to avoid the like.</p>

                        <p>ANd thus thy Work is brought to the
true Touch-ſtone, and that is Trinity
in Unity; for in this <hi>pondus</hi> of your <hi>Mercury</hi>
you have a potential Body, which is one
part of three of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which may
by Art be made appear. This potential
Body is to be reckoned to your actual
Body, and that makes with it two, and
ſo <hi>in potentia</hi> you have two of the Body
to one of the Spirit, which is three to
three, and one to one. And this poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Body is at firſt ſpiritual and volatile,
<hi>(in manifesto)</hi> for unity ſake, without
which could be no unity. Thus then a
potential Body, but an actual Spirit, is
joyned with an actual Body, by which
means the actual Body, when it is actually
diſſolved and made no Body, but a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or Spiritual Body, then this potential
Spiritual Body (which was in the Water
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51319:132"/>
before) receives this potentialized Body,
and both unite and congeal together,
and is endowed with a double nature
and virtue, that is, Spiritual and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Heavenly and Earthly. And thus is
made an union, of which the proportion
of the Water in its firſt preparation, and
its due mixing with its Body, was the
moving cauſe, really though hiddenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
the Compound by the neceſſity
of its end, which it could not have done
had it not been ſo proportioned.</p>

                        <p>ALſo if your Water have its proportion
qualified accordingly, you may tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it with your Earth almoſt in an equal
quality, that is, two to three, or three to
four; but be ſure then of your due go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of external Fire, and a juſt ſize
of your Veſſel, and ſo you may expect
from this mixture Conception and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
for in this <hi>pondus</hi> you ſhall find
the death of the Spirit, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Body, and the exalting of
your Tincture firſt into white, and after
that into red, which will have ingreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bodies, and tyne them permanently
and radically. Though the Tincture is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51319:134"/>
largeſt where the Water is moſt, but the
work is ſpeedieſt where the Water is
leaſt, the Fire is alſo leſs hazardable;
but your true proportion of your <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
for ſuch a <hi>pondus</hi> is hard to be found,
and thou wilt not eaſily find it unleſs
thou be very skilful; the middle propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is leſs difficult, that of three to one is
worſe, for a <hi>Tyro,</hi> becauſe he may very
eaſily have his time made tedious by it.
The laſt would be better for ſuch a one, if
it were not ſo hard to apprehend, for the
Body would ſoon be made no Body, and
the Spirit mortified, and ſo Union would
follow in a ſhort time, in compariſon
to other proportions. So then if thou
knoweſt how to prepare thy <hi>Mercury</hi>
aright for its Internal proportion, the
leſſer thou putteſt of the Spirit, the better
and quicker ſhall be thy Calcination and
Diſſolution; and the more thou giveſt of
the Water, the longer thou ſhalt be in
attaining the maſtery: but if thou glut
thy Earth with Water, thou wilt ſo ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the active virtue, that thy moiſture
will not be dried up; at leaſt it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſo tedious a decoction, that thou
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51319:135"/>
wouldeſt never ſee the effect. But the
mediocrity is for thee the beſt, at leaſt at
firſt; be not too covetous, nor too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,
for over-drineſs and over-moiſture
are both enemies to Generation, and
make a barren Womb. If thou be'ſt witty
to apprehend therefore, I ſhall ſhew you
the certain way of External proportion;
for know, that as the Water is qualified
internally, ſo doth it act externally, and
if thou canſt apprehend the ſympathy
that is between the inward quality, and
the outward effect, thou mayſt eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
by what is apparent to ſight, that
which is hiddenly contained. Then for
your true information take this rule:
Let your Body be very well ſubtilized,
and very pure, (which is a great matter,
at the leaſt 24 Carrats) mix this at firſt
with twice as much of its Water, and
grind it either on a clean Glaſs, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mortar; grind it thorowly, as Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
uſe to grind their Colours, and
make not a light matter of this, for lack
of one half hour or hours pains in thy
Amalgamation, thou mayſt ſet thy work
backward 20 or 30 days; for the more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51319:135"/>
ſubtlely the <hi>Amalgama</hi> is mixed, the more
eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſpeedily it reſolves into <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and is wrought upon, and the ſigns
appear. When thou haſt ſoundly and
well ground it, and waſhed it very clean,
and dried it very thorowly, ſo that there
be not the leaſt moiſture in it, obſerve
the temper; if it be plyable like to Paſte,
yet ſo as when you incline it this way or
that, you ſee no Water run to the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſide, which you may eaſily diſcern,
it is a good &amp; ſure temper; but if it be ſo
hard and dry, that it will not ſpread eaſily,
it lacks moiſture; or if that Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
water run as it were within a skin, to
the declining ſide of your <hi>Amalgama,</hi>
add more of your Body to it, till you ſee
that ſign no more; and grind it thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as is ſaid, and rather chuſe to lean to
the other hand, then to this, for there is
nothing more irkſome to an Artiſt in his
Scholarſhip, then to wait for his ſigns
beyond the time.</p>

to decoct it in a very gentle Fire till
it be dry, not by exhaling the Water,
but by coagulating it with the Body, in
which thy main care muſt be, that thy
Veſſel be cloſe, and thy Fire gentle:
Now the way to diſtinguiſh a gentle
from a violent Fire, is a thing deeply
concealed by the envious, I ſhall preſcribe
ſome few rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Know that it is the internal Fire of
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of thy Water, which doth
perform the whole work.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the external Fire is but an
outward circumſtance, which yet is ſo
abſolutely neceſſary, that nothing can be
effected without it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Regimen of the Fire is one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near
decoction, from the beginning to the
end of the Work, boiling the thick, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51319:136"/>
ſubliming the thin, and ſo diſſevering
both <hi>(ſuaviter &amp; cum ingenio)</hi> according
to old <hi>Hermes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. All our Maſtery conſiſts in Vapour,
which cannot be done without Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Diſtillation; for if our Spirit
aſcended not in a living form, it would
all aſcend and hang; but aſcending
quick, it returns again and moiſtens the
Body.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Our Diſtillation or Circulation, is
not without a conſtant motion of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for as the ſubtle is ſeparated from
the groſs by Sublimation, ſo the thick of
that which is below is ſevered from the
thin, which is by continual boiling and
decocting, without a moments intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Therefore, ſaith <hi>Hermes,</hi> thou ſhalt
ſever the ſubtle from the groſs, and the
thick from the thin.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Our tender Spirit learns every day
more and more to ſuffer Fire; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſaith <hi>Arnold,</hi> boil it with a Fire
daily increaſing: yet is it but one degree
of Fire, and that is boiling, till the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Empire is vanquiſhed; and then
there is another degree, and that is roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51319:137"/>
which hath two periods, Fixation
and Calcination: therefore ſay Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
in the beginning, <hi>Coque,</hi> that is,
Boil, for as much as the Stone is moiſt;
and at the end they ſay, <hi>Aſſa,</hi> that is,
Roaſt, for then the Stone is dry.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The periods of the ſtrength of the
Fire are in this time many: every day if
thou canſt, augment a little, that it may
increaſe inſenſibly, and you will find the
effect the more ſweetly and ſpeedily.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The Philoſophers in their deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Fire, and its degrees, did more
obſerve their matter and its capacity, then
the Fire it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. They chiefly liken their Work to
Man's Generation, and ſo they call their
Compound, Man: therefore ſaith <hi>Ripley,</hi>
remember Man is the moſt Noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. This is the true meaning of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>'s
four degrees of Fire, <hi>Primus forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ut ſenſus ei dominetur;</hi> that is, the
Stone being compared to Man, and its
firſt moiſt Regimen to a Bath; the firſt
degree makes it ſweat gently, as a Bath
to a Man, which is leſs hot then he can
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51319:137"/>
ſuffer, doth cauſe a gentle ſweat. <hi>Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
aequato gaudet natura ſecundo,</hi> is the
ſecond degree, in which ſweat is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
cauſed, as a Bath which is as hot as
a man can poſſibly ſuffer, cauſes a moſt
violent ſweat. <hi>Tertius excedit &amp; cum
tolerantia laedit,</hi> is the third degree, which
cauſeth bubbling and ſwelling, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to that heat which will bliſter a
mans hand; for our Compound in this
heat riſeth in bliſters, which fall and riſe
continually. <hi>Deſtructor ſenſus gaudet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere
quartus,</hi> is the fourth heat of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation,
which takes away ſenſe, that is,
quickneſs, and brings in ſiccity, juſt as
the cauterizing heat ſears the fleſh, and
drys the moiſture. Thus hiddenly did that
ſubtle Sophiſter veil his Fires.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Know that after 40 or 46 days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
boiling, the moiſture will begin
to waſte, and the Compound will begin
to dry; which thou ſhalt know, in that
the boiling will begin to turn to a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
like to Puff-paſte or Leavened<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dough.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Know that in 36 days thou mayſt
have thy moiſture begin to congeal, if
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51319:138"/>
thou be exact in thy Fire, and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both inward and outward.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Know that thy Glaſs muſt be thick,
and very ſtrong, and no leſs ſtrongly
cloſed, leſt it break with thoſe winds
which the firſt decoction will raiſe in thy
Veſſel.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Let its neck be ſomewhat long,
and faſtned, that the motion which is in
the Glaſs may not cauſe it (by reaſon of
the length and thickneſs of the neck, and
the Sublimation that is ſtill in it, in drops
which make it heavy) to ſway the
little Body one way or other; for if it
incline, the Matter will be apt to grow
to the inclining ſide, which ſhould be
avoided.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Let the neck be conſiderably
cooler then the other part, that thy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
may condenſe in it, which elſe will
burſt the Glaſs violently; ſo mayſt thou
give thy Fire more ſtrong then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and let thy neſt be guarded from
unneceſſary heats and colds, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would have holes at the top of the
Cover, which may ſhut over every Glaſs,
and let out a part of the neck, which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51319:138"/>
would be very advantageous both for
the faſtning of the Glaſs, and condenſing
of Vapours.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. This boiling will begin in the firſt
three days, and if you be a good
Work-man, in the firſt 24 hours; and
from its firſt ebullition your time is to be
reckoned.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. When you ſee the Water thicken
in its boiling, there is leſs danger of
the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. If your Fire go out, your Stone
dies.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Every intermiſſion of your Fire, is
a waſting both of its ſtrength and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and beſides the moſt tedious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of time, it makes the Stone ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many Sickneſſes, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a moſt ſubtle Philoſopher to amend,
and it lays your Stone in danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a return of the Crows Pullets to
their neſt, after they are fled, which is an
ominous ſign.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Your Gold is not totally loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

true, for matter of Operation he wrought
well, but withall very enviouſly and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſly:
he calls the matter <hi>Gold,</hi> and
<hi>Mercury,</hi> but that is but alluſively; but
he meant Egg-ſhels calcined, or Vitriol,
or Mans Blood, or Dew, or Rain-water,
or Salt-peter, or Nitre, or Tartar, or this
or that thing, according to their ſordid
fancy, and ſo they will proceed, nothing
unſettled in their fancies by what I have
candidly written. Groſs Sots, thus to
think that I in what I without any equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
call <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> they
ſhould make to allude to ſuch trifles:
it is the ſign of an Owl to be blinder, by
how much the Sun ſhines clearer; let me
therefore to ſatisfie the Ingenious, profeſs
and proteſt, that without any Alluſion or
Figure in ſpeaking, our Matter is <hi>Gold,</hi>
even the pureſt that is ſold, or can be
bought; this is our Maſculine Sperm.
And our other principle is <hi>Mercury,</hi> like
to that which is commonly ſold, in form,
in flux and colour, only it is brighter, and
ſome what more ponderous; and without
any Metaphor we call it <hi>Argent vive.</hi>
In the making of this <hi>Mercury</hi> is all our
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51319:142"/>
ſecret, and in the Regimen of the Fire
according to its capacity, conſiſts the
whole Maſtery. O fools and blind! think
you to gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs
of Thiſtles? wherefore do you thus waſte
your Goods, proceeding in your Work,
as an Aſs to his Crib, never conſidering
the nature of the thing you go about?
If Gold and Silver be your intention to
produce, in what would you find them?
in Eggs, or Blood, in Salts, or ſuch things?
what a madneſs is this? to what end think
you theſe operations will tend? what
conformity is there between what you
ſeek, and that which you take in hand?
do you not conſider the difference of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
between thoſe Subjects, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals?
how do you think that they ſhould
give weight to imperfect Bodies, when as
they themſelves are far more light them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
how can you expect from them
a ſpecifick perfect Metalline Tincture,
which have not any thing Metalline in
them? You ſee not your own madneſs.
It is no light matter to cauſe a Body,
which perhaps is 10 or 12 parts at the
leaſt in 16 defective of the dimenſions of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51319:142"/>
Gold, to penetrate its own dimenſions ſo
many times, to anſwer your fond deſires.
This which you attempt is to force Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to create Sperms, both which
are vain to undertake, and truly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Leave then this Sophiſtry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
true Light. To create Sperms is
Gods alone property, and every thing
hath its own Sperm, as it hath its own
Form: there is nothing that hath a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
virtue applicable to two things, every
thing hath its own Seed, and according
to its own Form. Gold therefore and
Silver being thine intention, let the ſame
be thy ſubject to work upon; Gold is
thy firſt Baſis, for thy white muſt firſt
come out of thy red, and when thy white
Stone is perfect, then mayſt thou uſe
<hi>Luna</hi> vulgar. Now Gold muſt have its
hidden Seed extracted, and that is done
by <hi>Mercury</hi> in Calcination, for that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is the Mineral Copulation, in
which the Seeds are ſent forth and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
together, then ſhall the old Body
die, and a new Body ſhall riſe again, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a multiplicative virtue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of all things; for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51319:143"/>
it ſavours rankly of abſurdity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to allow all things almoſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative
power, and to deny it to Gold,
the moſt perfect of all ſublunary things.</p>

the Philoſophers, who affirm that
their Stone is in all things, though in ſome
things nearer, and in ſome things at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſtance, yet in all things according
to the rule of <hi>(propinquius &amp; remotius?)</hi>
To ſuch I anſwer, I grant and know that
all things originally owe all their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
material unto Water, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
unto Light; and according to the
congreſs of theſe two principles, through
the command of the Architect, this Light
doth illuminate the material Water in a
ſingular way, according to the Ideal ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which were before in the Archetype:
So then the Matter reſides in Water, the
Informing in Light, and the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Form, which is as I may ſay
the Form's formality, is in the will of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51319:143"/>
Creator, firſt impreſſed or ſealed in the
word <hi>(fiat,)</hi> and ratified in his command
<hi>(producat unumquodque juxta ſpeciem
ſuam.)</hi> Now to apply this to our preſent
purpoſe, in Water and Light all things
agree, in the determination of Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they differ. This determinative ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Almighty, ſealed a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in the products of the Matter and
Form, which are in themſelves general,
and being thus ſealed, not any thing can
paſs from its kind to mix with another
kind, but it will cauſe a product parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of either Parent, nor can mixture
be made but in the ſame <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>ſpecies;</hi>
as an Apple may be graffed on a Crab-tree,
a Man may (though abominably)
mix with a Beaſt, <hi>(licentia naturali)</hi> but
out of <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>ſpecies</hi> nothing can mix.
There are alſo many particular exceptions
of things in one <hi>genus,</hi> for many Trees
I know which the Art of man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff
one in another, ſo as to grow, will
yet grow well ingraffed elſewhere; ſo
a Dog and a Mouſe cannot mix, being
one ſo diſproportionable to another.
But this by the by.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:51319:144"/>
To return to our intention, we ſay,
that as all things are by the will and
power of God ſpecificated, ſo with the
deſtruction of that <hi>ſpecies,</hi> the Form (as
to that individual) periſhing, (for no
intire <hi>ſpecies</hi> can periſh) things may both
by Nature and Art return to their firſt
ſtable principle material, which is Water,
of which Nature, if it found it in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place, might (impregnating it
with a Metalline Seed) produce a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
Sperm, or viſcoſity, which then
might be a Metal by decoction, and yield
unto our work a profitable ſubject.</p>

thee a Maſter, after which thou canſt not

                        <p>Others call it a Spirit killed with its

Gold, in which diſſolved Body
(which then ſeems a Spirit) there is a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ferment, which may recongeal the
ſame: this fermental virtue it is that doth
coagulate or thicken the Water, that to
the wonder of the Beholders what before
was thinner and thinner, doth after 40
days thicken, till it come to a duſt or
powder like to impalpable Atoms.</p>
                        <p>But I ſhall not inſiſt upon theſe deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
there being ſo many given to
it by the Envious, that there is nothing
almoſt in the World that is black, or may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51319:150"/>
be made black by the Fire, but they have
named it by it. Alſo whatever is filthy
or faeculent, or unſavoury either to taſte
or ſmell, they have Alluſively called their
Stone by, in reference to its firſt putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or corruption. So likewiſe when
by continuance of decoction the colour
changeth to white, they then call it their
Swan, their Dove, their white Stone of
Paradiſe, their white Gold, their Alabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
their white Smoak, and in a word
whatever is white they do call it by. And
ſo the Red they name their Vermilion,
their red Lead, their Poppy of the Rock,
their Tyre, their Baſilisk, their red Lion,
and in ſum it borrows the names of all
red things.</p>
                        <p>Now thou art entred the firſt five
Gates of the Philoſophers Caſtle; for do
not believe but that Calcination is verily
Putrefaction, and is done by Diſſolution,
Separation and Conjunction, as if thou
haſt attended this diſcourſe thou mayſt
eaſily conceive: only here is the Sophiſm,
after this total Calcination, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
again; for as I ſaid before, our
Operation is but turning as it were of a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51319:150"/>
Wheel, which runs one half of its circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
directly backwards to its firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.
Thou ſublimeſt ſo long, till the
Body is made as volatile as it may be, this
is the activity of the Spirit; then thou
congealeſt ſo long, till all appear like
Atoms, and then is thy bodily virtue
active, and thy Spirit paſſive; then thy
Spirit begins to be active again, and thy
Compound which was apparently fixed,
relents again and diſtils as before, till it
come to its height again of volatility,
which is again a Separation; then is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
again a Conjunction Tetraptive,
and from that time all aſcends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
together, and there is ſuch an
union, that there doth not then (as at
firſt) exhale a quick Fume, and deſcend
upon the bodily Moles, but all aſcends
like to a glorious Tree with branches,
and is not ſublimed to the top, but ſprouts
up like the tender Forſt in a fair morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which falls and riſes till all become a
Powder impalpable. So then after Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is again a Solution, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
between <hi>Azoth</hi> and <hi>Laton,</hi> and a
diſtilling Separation in which <hi>Azoth</hi> waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51319:151"/>
                           <hi>Laton;</hi> and after that a Conjunction,
not of the four Elemental qualities only,
which was in the firſt Conjunction, but of
the Elements themſelves, the Body, Soul
and Spirit; and then is made another
Calcination into a white Calx, which by
continual decoction relents again, and is
made volatile again: for our Wheel goes
round, and when it is come thither
whence it ſet forth, it begins again.
Thus is made a third Solution, Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Calcination into a red <hi>Elixir,</hi>
which is the Sabboth of Nature and Art;
at which being arrived, there is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
progreſs without a new Marriage,
either by Ferment or otherwiſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of Nature and Art: ſo
that indeed all our work is three Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and every Rotation hath three
Members, Solution, Sublimation, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.
The firſt Solution, is called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration,
and Reduction or Liquefaction,
the ſecond properly Solution, the third
Inceration. The firſt Sublimation is called
Diſtillation, Aſcenſion and Deſcenſion,
the ſecond Separation and Ablution, the
third Exaltation and Sublimation. The
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51319:151"/>
Firſt Calcination is called Calcination and
Conjunction Triptative, Putrefaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The ſecond Congelation, Albification and
Fixation, the Third Illumination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
only remember, thou in thy firſt Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
attaineſt compleat Putrefaction, in
the ſecond the compleat white <hi>Elixir,</hi>
and in the third the compleat Red. This
I premiſe to undeceive thee, that thou
mayſt not think to have a Calcination
firſt, a Diſſolution next, a Separation
thirdly, a Conjunction fourthly, a Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
fifthly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No verily, when
thou firſt putteſt thy Matters into the
Veſſel, in the firſt day of thy Operation,
thou giveſt a Fire in which thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
boileth, ſwelleth, and puffeth viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and drops run down in veins off
from the Convex of thy Glaſs; for in
this <hi>Mercury</hi> thy Gold will, beyond the
nature of any other <hi>Mercury,</hi> flow in the
Fire as if the whole was <hi>Mercury,</hi> and
boyl viſibly, which muſt never ceaſe, not
a moment, for it brings imminent damage.
In the firſt days of your boyling, which
is accompanied with a conſtant aſcending
and return of Fumes, your Compound
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51319:152"/>
grows more and more liquid, now and
then a skin appearing in the form of a
diſtinguiſhable, though not very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
whiteneſs. At length a yellowiſh
colour will appear, leſs at firſt, and more
afterwards diſtinguiſhable, both in the
boyling Compound below, and in the
Fumes above; and when thou ſeeſt thy
Glaſs as if it were all over gilded, where
the Fumes aſcend with a blewneſs, then
know that thy Man and Wife do mix
their Seeds, then ſhall an obſcure green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
paſs and continue a ſeaſon, then ſhall
thy Fumes diminiſh, and at length be
none at all, and the Compound ſhall
boyl and ſwell in the bottom of the
Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>After that, the more you boyl, your
Compound will be the more black, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at laſt to the temper of melted Pitch
for colour and bubbling, which ſhall rot
with obſcure colours untill it come to
the period of Putrefaction, which is a
moſt exquiſitely ſubtle, black, unctuous
Powder, which about the 84<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or
90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day in a good decoction will be
compleat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:51319:152"/>
Take heed now, for I ſhall not make
ſuch another particular Syſteme of the
Work in all my Writings. When the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of compleat Calcination is perfect,
then will the parts begin to liquefie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again, and you then ſhall ſee Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
begin to ariſe again, firſt like to
a Smoak, which will after return in drops
condenſing on the Veſſel ſides, which
believe me is a gallant ſight; for in this
Operation as blackneſs by little wears
away, ſuch colours will appear which
thou canſt not imagine, that thou wilt
ſteal from Natures due to ſatisfie thine
eyes in the beholding of it, when thou
ſhouldeſt ſleep.</p>
                        <p>This Circulation with infinite variety
of colours will laſt between 20 and 30
days, and then thou ſhalt ſee thy Matter
appear pretty white, which then will
grow whiter and whiter, till it become
like a glittering Sword in the Sun-beams:
truſt me, for I have ſeen this ſhining
ſparkling white, which yet will be quick
like a moſt glorious Heaven-born <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
the ſubject of wonders.</p>
                        <p>Then ſhall theſe Fumes begin to ceaſe,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51319:153"/>
and thou ſhalt ſee a Congelation, like to
the ſparkling twinkling eyes of Fiſhes,
which moving unceſſantly on the Fire,
will glitter incomparably and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and thickning more and more, it
will ſprout like the tender Froſt in a moſt
amiable luſtre, and in 25 days ſhalt thou
have it a moſt impalpable undiſcernable
Powder. Now thou needeſt no farther
inſtruction, only this let me tell you, that
the continuing your Glaſs in the Fire,
and increaſing it diſcreetly, this white
will relent again, and change into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
green, and will again circulate and
become perfect Azure, and at the length
thicken, and in the end become (after a
long Citrinity) in a moment a ſparkling
red pure impalpable Powder. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this well, and you will not be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
any longer with the diſtinction of
our Operations, which is but Solution
(which contains Separation or Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Volatization) and Coagulation,
which contains Conjunction, Calcination
and Fixation; and all is but a ſucceſſive
action and paſſion of Gold the Body
and his qualities, and <hi>Mercury</hi> the Soul
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51319:153"/>
and its qualities, between which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
a Spirit of Life, which carries them
up and down like a Wheel, which turns
till it returns thither whence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and then begins again and turns ſo
long till it finds its reſt, which is in the
Fiery <hi>Cathedra,</hi> the red of the reddeſt,
the great <hi>Elixir</hi> commanding all Metals,
and reducing them to the higheſt period
of Nature, which is Gold it ſelf, having
attained a <hi>pluſquam</hi> perfection, through
the marvellous co-operation of Art and
Nature.</p>
                        <p>Thus Gold is thy Baſe or Foundation,
the Centre to which all thy Operations
return, and in which they reſt; for they
are but Circulations in their own kind,
and theſe Circulations are unceſſantly
carried along through the never-ceaſing
action of the Fire, which a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion
would retard notably, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of the heat would extinguiſh ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably.
If any then ſhould ask us,
what our natural Operation of the Stone
is; we would anſwer, a making of active
Natures paſſive, and paſſive active, by
continual decoction. We boyl continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51319:154"/>
and when the Spirit is active there
is a conſtant aſcenſion and deſcenſion,
and the Body is diſſolved and made to
fly like a Spirit; and when the Body is
active, the Fumes by little and little ceaſe,
and the Compound remains below, boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without fuming, thickning and then
at length calcining: and this is without
hands repeated three times, the Fire only
being kept continually, and then a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
of reſt and perfection is attained:
in the mean time divers colours come and
go, which the dying Body and vegetative
Soul do work and cauſe. Truſt me, Friend
and Brother, thou never hadſt ſuch a
manuduct as this in thy life, the Reaſons
of my plainneſs my little Latine Treatiſe
doth clearly ſhew.</p>

the Wheel which turns up the Spirit, and
down the Body; the ſecond hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

active, and Spirit paſſive: ſo then Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
hides the profundity of the Body,
which Solution diſcovereth. It is then
nothing elſe but a boiling of hard and
dry Bodies in our <hi>Mercury,</hi> in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Fire, ſo long till they be diſſolved
and made thin; then the ſame Fire makes
them fly, and flying they condenſe and
return in drops on the Body, and moiſten
it: This is Solution and Sublimation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for the Water circulating upon
the Body, doth ſoften it, and by often
returning doth at length bring it to its
own nature of moiſture. In this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to <hi>Artephius,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi>
loſeth its colour and is darkned, and the

it lives: it behoveth thee then to put in

Putrefaction, Separation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
Death and Purification, ſhould
be performed in one Veſſel, and one

the other is congealed: this proves
the naturality of our Work, for as a grain

Water, not diaphanous, ſuch as is the
Waters of the Clouds, or of Fountains,

                        <p>ANd here take notice by the way, that
that is no total Diſſolution which is
before Calcination, but only partial, the
Water reſolves as much as it can of the
Body, ſo much that it doth ſever between
its Spirit and Body; but by reaſon of its
perfection and ſtrong compaction, it finds
a great deal of difficulty before a total
Reſolution, and therefore it putrefies
what is moſt groſs, and thus brings it to
Atoms, which when it is once ſubtilized
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51319:162"/>
beyond the exigency of its own nature,
it then is diſſolved, and relents, and then
Diſſolution is made totally, <hi>viz.</hi> after
Putrefaction. Then at length it becomes
all like a glorious <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and this
immediately before the Lunary Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Know then that our firſt looſing is
into a viſcous Powder, which is brought
on by Incrudation, or rather Liquefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for know that till after Putrefaction,
our Stone and Compound is moiſt in the
Fire, but hardens more and more by how
much the colder it is, and ſoftens more
and more by how much hotter it is, and
the heat ſlacking, the boiling will change
into a ſeeming Vegetation, and the Fire
going out, it is hard rather than ſoft, yet
the mingling of the Natures is known by
the colours, and drawing to Calcination.
Therefore thy firſt Operation is to dry
up thy ſuperfluous watriſh moiſture, not
evaporating it, but congealing it on the
Body. Think not then, as ſome of the
envious Sophiſtically write, that the more
you put of your Water, the ſooner you
diſſolve, and congeal the ſlower: No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
your Calcination is but the <hi>medium</hi>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:51319:163"/>
of true Solution, which is (truſt me) not
total nor proper till after Putrefaction.
I ſhould never have told thee this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had not the love of my Neighbour
compelled me. That opening of the Body
which is before, is but an opening of its
pores, which lets our Water in, and then
after death and reſurrection the <hi>Mercury</hi>
of <hi>Sol</hi> is viſible to the eye, which before
was but diſtinguiſhable by its effect.</p>

                           <l>And ſo it must, for Water it was before;</l>
                           <l>Right ſo again our Water to Earth is went,</l>
                           <l>And Water thereby congeal'd for evermore:</l>
                           <l>For after all Philoſophers that ere were bore,</l>
                           <l>Each Metal once was Water Mineral,</l>
                           <l>Therefore with Water they turn to Water all.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>SO then our Body hath moiſture in it
ſelf, but this moiſture is ſealed, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when frozen by the Cold. But when
the pores of the Body are by our Water
opened, and its central Fire ſet at liberty,
this internal Fire of Nature makes the
Body to become no Body, but a very
Spirit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51319:163"/>
In this ſame Operation the Spirit is
congealed, for the Body hath in it more
virtue then its two Sociats, that is, than
the Soul and Spirit. This is the action and
re-action of our Body and its Water, for
our Body is in its <hi>occulto Mercury,</hi> and
our <hi>Mercury</hi> is in its <hi>occulto Sol;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they embrace each other, becauſe of
the nearneſs of their Natures, and ſo the
Body hath its profundity diſcovered, and
the Water its altitude, and both together
are glorified in one Spiritual Body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to Noble <hi>Hermes, Vis ejus

by conſequence the more fit for Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
in which groſs Humidity all the

they have called their Metals <hi>Sol</hi> and

Mountains are higheſt above ground, ſo
they lye deepeſt under ground; or for

                        <p>But it makes not ſo much for the name,
the thing is, take the Body which is

is the Water below, the Altitude is
Vapour or Waters above, and the union

work, the whole Maſtery is to govern the
external Fire, which as the Philoſopher
doth either perfect or deſtroy all: if thy
Fire be too ſlow for want of motion, thou
wilt hardly ever ſee an end; and if too
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51319:169"/>
big, thou mayſt happen to ſeek thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the Aſhes.</p>
                        <p>Be not therefore immoderate in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning;
and for better ſecurity, let not
your Glaſs neck be under a ſpan in
length, but as much longer as you ſhall
ſee good; the longer for a <hi>Tyro,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſhall work, and with the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
But the uſual length which we
uſe, is about 12 or 14 inches high; this
height being ſo allowed, order ſo your
Furnace as to let out about 3 or 4 inches
of the top of your Glaſs, which may
come forth through the cover of your
<hi>Athanor,</hi> and if you can without hurt
feel or ſuffer any part of that neck, fear
not your Fire, but ſtew him without fear,
your Glaſs being ſtrong, and the quicker
Fire the better.</p>
                        <p>Yet know, that your Furnace muſt be
anſwerable, for do not believe that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
did formerly uſe our Art of
Furnaces, but made them of Brick, or
Earth, with Earthen Covers, which had
holes for letting out part of the necks of
their Glaſſes, over which if they put a
Cover, which they could remove and ſet
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51319:170"/>
on again at their pleaſure; this Earthen
Cover was not ſo reflective of heat, as
our Iron Covers are, but that end of the
Glaſs which came out at the hole of the
Cover, they could feel without any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and by their being able to ſuffer
that in their hand, they judged the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of their heat. Therefore in thy
Furnace let thy Cover or Top be luted
with good Loam every-where, at the
leaſt half an inch thick, ſo ſhalt thou be
ſure not to have too ſcalding a heat in
the concavity of thy Neſt, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
thou wouldſt have, ſo mayſt thou
govern thy Fire at thy pleaſure; the
necks of thy Glaſſes which come forth,
thou needeſt not cover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhalt thou ſee
this of <hi>Ripley</hi> verified, thy Work will go
on very ſucceſsfully, and thou wilt ever
be able to endure thy Glaſs in thy hand;
and this is the true meaning of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
to give a certain rule by which
thou ſhalt never exceed, and that is ſo
long as you can endure to feel any part
of thy Glaſs, provided thy Neſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and the ends of thy Glaſs necks
come forth.</p>

this feeling of the Glaſs, it muſt be ſuch
as may be without opening or moving
of the ſame; for if the Seed be diſturb'd
in its beginning to vegetate, the Work is
undoubtedly ſpoiled, or at leaſt it will
be ſo notably weakned, that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>Therefore when thou ſetteſt in thy

                        <p>HAving now run through two of the
twelve Gates, I am come to the
third, which is Separation, which begins
ſo ſoon as the Matters have been ſo long
circulated, as to begin to hold one of
another. This Operation the Ancient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
have denominated Diviſion of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which afterwards they ſay muſt
be joyned with a perpetual union. This
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51319:174"/>
Separation is by others called Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Natures, and the parts ſeparated
are compared to two Dragons, the
one winged, and the other without
wings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Artephius,</hi> who for Age and Candor
was next to <hi>Hermes</hi> the moſt eminent,
calls this Separation the Key of the
Work, which according to him is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation
in a continual Vapour, that
what is Heavenly and ſubtile, may aſcend
aloft, that is, to the upper part of the
Veſſel, and there take the nature of a
Body Heavenly, or Spirit; and what is
groſs may remain below, in the nature
of a Body Earthly, which is the end of
our Maſtery, to bring the Bodies which
are compact and dry, to become a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
fume, which is only to be done
by Sublimation, and Diviſion or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>So then our Separation is not to be
underſtood, as many fooliſh Alchymiſts
do interpret it, who have their Elements
of which they boaſt much, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
manual, done by handy-work, the
Glaſs being removed, altered or renewed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51319:174"/>
every time. Nor are our Separations
made by filter, or <hi>per tritorium,</hi> as many
imagine, who know not the nature of
our Work, and therefore run into ſuch
fooliſh fancies.</p>
                        <p>Nature then in our Work doth all in
all, who as a curious Artificer maketh no
confuſed mixtures, but firſt of all cauſeth
the moiſture to aſcend, which becauſe it
cannot get out, it doth therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe
in drops, and deſcends ſo long till
at length it begin to be acuated from
the Body, which is below; for naturally
all homogeneal moiſture, cohobated on
a bodily ſubſtance, with which it hath
affinity, is acuated by it. Gold then is a
Body in which the active qualities of
heat and drineſs, are more than in the
<hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Mercury</hi> being cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on it, begins to be a little more Fiery
or hot, and then the Exhalations are
more Aërial, which before were more
Watry, and by continued Cohobation
the Water partakes yet more and more
of the <hi>Solary</hi> nature, until at length this
heat or <hi>Sulphur</hi> impregnating the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
cauſe it to congeal into a new Body
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51319:175"/>
or quinteſſence, which is after the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the old Body, which is called
the Earth, or Aſhes of <hi>Hermes</hi>'s Tree.</p>

                           <l>And Separation is called by Philoſophers
definition,</l>
                           <l>Of ſeveral qualities a Tetraptive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>SO then this is the method of our Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Earth, that is <hi>Sol,</hi> is boiled in
our <hi>Mercury,</hi> in ſuch a heat in which
the <hi>Mercury</hi> may aſcend conſtantly in a
ſmoak, and deſcend in drops, and the
Body below ſtand liquid and boil: then
ſhall the Water dry up, under which is
blackneſs hidden, which when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is dryed up ſhall appear like the
Crows Bill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:51319:175"/>
Then ſhall this Powder again relent,
and after 40 days rotting without fumes,
ſhall ſend up a ſmoak again, which ſhall
aſcend and deſcend ſo long, till the
whole be made volatile and Aërial; then
ſhall the black colour vaniſh, and the
white appear.</p>
                        <p>This white <hi>Argent vive,</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi>
animated, which appears after blackneſs,
ſhall then totally congeal, and ſhall be
then Fire, whoſe Nurſe is the Earth;
then haſt thou the four Elements, that is,
cohobated thy Natures to the higheſt
degree of perfection of the white Stone,
then canſt thou go no further, but go
back and turn the ſame Wheel till thou
haſt attained the red Stone. Thus haſt
thou the true Principles and Operation
of our great <hi>Elixirs</hi> both red and
white, which if thou once haſt, thou haſt
Riches enough, and needeſt no more in
this life.</p>
                        <p>This, if no more were ſaid of this
point, might be enough to ſhew thee the
truth of our true Separation: yet becauſe
Philoſophers have ſpoken much of it, and
indeed it is all the work to cauſe aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

and deſcenſion of our true Water on
our true Body, ſo long till by the Water
the Body be volatized, and after that by
the Body the Water fixed; and till that
be brought to paſs, there will come and
go the four Qualities in their ſeaſon, and
will cauſe change of colours ſuitable to
their ſtation, pleaſant to the Philoſopher

Water or Phlegm, and after it the Water
will be coloured, and aſcend ſo on the

and then the boiling will turn
to a Pitchy ſwelling, and puffing up like

Leavened Dough; and from that time
the Compound ſhall grow dryer and
dryer, coming at length to Pitch-black

                        <p>Be patient therefore in decoction, and
wait with a great deal of confidence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
thou ſeeſt thy Water, which at firſt

to change colour, and the Exhalations to
ariſe diſcoloured within the Glaſs. Then
continue your decoction till the Cloud

in this Operation be ſure that the Seeds
begin to mingle, and will give you a

which is as was touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Key of the whole Work, by
which Separation is made unceſſantly
each day and hour.</p>
                        <p>Thus are the Waters divided from the
Waters, that is, the Waters above from
them which are below; for part of the
Water aſcends up like a fume, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals

whatever is Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both in the Water and in the Body
lightly aſcending, and in the upper part
of the Glaſs taking the nature of a Spirit,

                        <p>But as for the Spirit, that is a tender
thing, nor is it able to endure the Fire,
but flys from it, and abides in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
part of the Glaſs; only ſo long as
the fumes ariſe, the aſcending do ſtill
meet with them which are above, till at
laſt making over great drops, they fall
down; and when the fumes ceaſe, as
much of the Spirit as the Concave of the
Glaſs will hold without running down,
ſtays above until intire Calcination be
perfected, and then they are drawn down
by a Magnetical virtue: So that here is
all the myſtery of the proportion of the

this true Separation is the cauſe, and

the Spirit on the Fire wherever it flys.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51319:180"/>
The occaſional cauſe of all this, is our
firſt Water, which though vile, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be much valued, for it is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
through the virtue of which it
comes to paſs, that our Earth yields a

which at length doth allure the ſaid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

never be: and then the Body beyond
its own nature is lifted up, moving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
with the Spirit and Soul upon
the Fire, for all now are made one inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably;
and this is called the <hi>ſealing
the Mother in the belly of the Infant which

united to the Water that aroſe from it,
that in this Operation after this true

but are together ſublimed, and
deſcend continually, moving and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually until perfect Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Now for as much as all the Maſtery
conſiſts in Vapour, which are called the
great Winds, which are in the Veſſel at
the forming of this our <hi>Embrio,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51319:180"/>
great care muſt be had leſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

of our Fire, which muſt cauſe the <hi>inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra

thirdly, in Putrefaction the Body and

alſo muſt be retained.</p>
                        <p>For preventing of all, thou ſhalt have
thy Stopple as firm as any part of thy
Glaſs, which let it be ſtrong, as is ſaid,
and the neck long and ſtrong, and let
the neck be melted up with a Lamp, or

                        <p>This I ſay, that it muſt firſt be coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated

                        <p>When it aſcends like to the Pearled

ſufficiently pure, which is not till all the

that it will diſſolve <hi>Jupiter, Saturn,</hi> or

commands Metals as their true Water

known to the <hi>Adepti,</hi> which if I

                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:51319:182"/>
that it is the Mother of Metals, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>Hereupon in reſpect of its wonderful

Philoſophers have by Analogy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that it was before the greateſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for they have a Maxim <hi>(ex ſummo

diſpute. But he who thinks, becauſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
ſay it is ſuch a deadly poiſon,
that it is to be bought at the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or Druggiſts, he is miſtaken; for as
it is firſt bought, I confeſs it is very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous,

                        </p>
                        <p>But whatever it be in its Crudity, I am
ſure it is not ſo in its Perfection, for he
who ſhall take of it then, ſhall be ſo far
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51319:184"/>
from receiving any damage by it, that
he ſhall find it to be a ſoveraign Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,

                        <p>A noble Philoſopher (though I ſcarce
believe him to be an <hi>Adeptus</hi> of the
Stone) hath wrote of late a ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Fevers,</hi> the <hi>Lithiaſis,</hi> and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence,</hi>
and there he ſaith in one of his
Tractates, That the loſs of ſtrength which
is made by Venery and Bloud-letting, is
wholly irrecoverable. It is true, and I
verily believe that he had Medicines very
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51319:185"/>
noble, and it is pity but he had this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to preſerve his old age, for I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
profeſs, that of all the Tractates
that ever I read, they are the moſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical;
but by this expreſſion it is
evident, that he was ignorant of this
ſecret.</p>
                        <p>For although by Venery, or a <hi>Tabes,</hi>
or Bleeding, or by any other way a man
be debilitated, he may be reſtored by this
<hi>Elixir,</hi> not only to perfect health, but
alſo to ſuch a meaſure of ſtrength which
he never had before. Yea and a man or
woman who is born to hereditary weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
may be changed into a more then
ordinary ſtrength by the uſe of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine:
or a man who by labour, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and years, is come to the Graves
mouth, even to drop in it, may by uſe
hereof be reſtored his hair, his teeth, and
his ſtrength, ſo that he ſhall be of greater

ſtrength, and may live many years, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

                        <p>For Minerals are of all Sublunary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
the moſt perfect, and the beſt part of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51319:186"/>
them are Metals, which when they are
perfect, defend themſelves from all fear
of corruption perpetually. Now the
Spirit of the Metal when it is exalted
to a millenary perfection, it tingeth all
Metals imperfect to an incorruptible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
but then this Spirit muſt be made
a Body, according to the ſaying of
<hi>Hermes, Vis ejus eſt integra ſi verſa fuerit
in terram.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this tranſcendent Tincture may be
diſſolved into an Oyl, or rather a pure
Liquor, which then is not proper for
Metals, but is only Medicinal; for it is
of the nature of Light, and therefore it
doth as readily concur with our formal
vital principle, as one flame will enter
another.</p>
                        <p>Yea and beyond this, it may be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond the nature of man, yea and
of any tangible Body, to become a moſt
radiant perpetual Light, which I have
ſeen, though not my ſelf actually made.
All this is done by the Divine virtue of
our Water, which is to be prepared, as
is ſaid, by Cohobation and Diſtillation,
for our Water is a living Water, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51319:186"/>
not corroſive, as many do miſ-interpret
our Books.</p>
                        <p>Theſe then are the circumſtantial qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of our Water, it is pure, clean, and
very bright, it is quick, and very fluent,
without Humectation; it is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
ſubject that we can chooſe for
this Art, and whatever can be taken in

ſo wonderful that if thou ſhouldſt

not believe it. Study therefore only to

turns all perfection, it is that which the
Wiſe men never revealed but only in
Figures and Metaphors.</p>

                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:51319:187"/>
Some have called it their ſharp Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
becauſe of its diſſolvent quality;
others have called it a Bird, a Gooſe, a
Pheſant, and many ſuch names they have
given it.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe it ariſeth in the form of a
Wind or Vapour, the Philoſophers have
called it their Vapour, their Smoak, and
their Wind; and for this cauſe command,
that the Porter keep diligent watch, that
it fly not away or exhale, for it would
ſpoil the Work.</p>
                        <p>This Water then flyeth the more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
part of it, and the Corporal part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth

which doth bubble and boil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,

<hi>Sol,</hi> which is moſt fixed, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Nature is made volatile, and
ſends out in the Exhalation of the Water
its ſubtle fiery Soul.</p>
                        <p>Thus the dead Body hath infuſed into
it a Spirit of life, and begins to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a living Soul, which moves
aloft with the Spirit, and returns with

the ſame, till the Body be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                        <p>And by this means the Body of the <hi>Sun</hi>
retaining the more Corporeal part of the

and enter one another, and ſo both by

and make together one Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditical
Body, of which the more

the more Corporal parts below, and the

                        <p>THeſe Bodies do ſend forth a thin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fume, which may be compared
to their breath; and the returning of it,
and fuming continually, may be likened
to the breathing in and out of Air, for
ſaith <hi>Artephius,</hi> all things live by Air:
and ſo our Stone it is inſpired by the Air,
which Air is the fume which aſcends
continually, which partakes of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as well as the Body below doth.
Alſo this makes that below to boil and
ſwell continually, which it would not
do, did not the Earth retain the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and the Sublimation carries with
it the ſubtileſt part, or Soul of the Body,
which eaſily appears by its changing of
colours, for whatever coloureth is of
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is unctuous, and therefore
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51319:188"/>
the Sublimation appears pinguous: the
<hi>medium</hi> of this Extraction is Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Water and the <hi>Sulphur</hi> are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in this Circulation there
are two things to be conſidered, the
bottom, and the top; the bottom is not
only the Body of <hi>Sol,</hi> for ſo it would not
ſtand liquid, and flow, and boil, and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as it doth: therefore it is certain,
that the Body retains part of the Water,
which is more thick, which thickneſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
and mixture hath cauſed; which
groſſer part of the Water is joyned with
the Body, but not perfectly united. The
uppermoſt part is not only from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor yet the moſt whole of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but a certain ſubtle portion of your
firſt Vinegar, which hath in it the moſt
pure part of your Gold, which is ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with it, which both together make
a <hi>medium</hi> of much Firineſs: So then by
reaſon of the mixture both the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
and the ſubſident part are reduced
to a mean, which hold one of another;
therefore our Body at this time, and in
this Operation, is called the Body both
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51319:189"/>
of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Vapour
contains both the Soul of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
the Spirit of the <hi>Mercury.</hi> Take this for
your prey, for I have reveal'd what Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
upon penalty of an <hi>Anathema</hi>
would never diſcloſe.</p>
                        <p>If you have well attended to what I
have ſaid, I have ſaid enough, and if this
do not ſuffice you, I know not what will.
Remember well what I have ſaid, if you
ever expect ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>To ſum up all therefore in one word,
for I have been ſo long that I fear I have
been too prolix: Remember what you
go about, and what you work on. You
take in hand an Earthly Body, which
you would bring to a Heavenly Tincture.
This you would effect by <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
is the only way or <hi>medium</hi> in the World.

be <hi>Sulphur</hi> congealed, and dry, yet in
its <hi>occulto</hi> it is <hi>Mercury</hi> liquid, and moiſt:
Now the Water which thou mixeſt with

then the Water of the Body will as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
agree and aſcend with thy Water

                        <p>Now as <hi>Sol</hi> hath a hidden Spirit, ſo
hath our <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is in it inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for to ſight it appears as other <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
only a little brighter, but in effect
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51319:190"/>
they differ wonderfully: which Spirit
will as naturally unite with the Soul, or
Fiery part of the Body, as Light will mix
with Light, and then the groſs part of
the Body, and of the Water, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Veſſel, will be brought in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Soul and Spirit to putrefie.
So then theſe two Fiery Natures being
Homogeneous, will readily mix, and will

and there condenſing in the top of

                           <l>Theſe four Fires uſe we and no moe,</l>
                           <l>Fire againſt Nature muſt do thy Body woe.</l>
                           <l>This is our Dragon as I thee tell,</l>
                           <l>Fiercely burning as the Fire in Hell.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>NOw to give thee a touch concerning
our Fire, which he that knows may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51319:192"/>
well be accounted a Maſter of our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets:
We have indeed four Fires, which
is one more than <hi>Artephius</hi> numbred,
which yet he intended to include. The
moſt noble Fire is Natural, which is that
which we ſeek to have multiplied, and
that is the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Gold, or rather its
Fiery Tincture; it is that which we
ſeek for, and we uſe <hi>Mercury</hi> for <hi>Sol</hi>
his ſake.</p>
                        <p>Our next Fire is our Fire againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that is the Fire of our Water
which is to be corrupted, and by this
corruption Multiplication is made.</p>
                        <p>The third Fire is Unnatural, which is
the mixture of theſe two Fires, while they
are in their action and paſſion, and neither
doth actually predominate.</p>
                        <p>Now for to give you a reaſon of theſe
Fires denomination, know that Mineral
Fire is <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is hot and dry,
and it is the death of the Mineral Tree,
that is, it is the cauſe of coagulating, that
is, taking away the flux of the <hi>Mercury</hi>
which is cold and moiſt; this in Gold is
apparent, for it is a coagulated perfect
Body, fixed and permanent in all tryals:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51319:192"/>
this it hath from, its Fire or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
this is Natural.</p>
                        <p>But now our Water hath an actual and
active <hi>Sulphur</hi> in it, and yet quick and
fluid, a Fire in Water which yet is not
burned; this <hi>Sulphur</hi> is true Gold, and
yet it is volatile; this is a Riddle, the
Philoſophers Myſtery, and yet true; this
is contrary to Natures ordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Mineral Bodies.</p>
                        <p>Now Nature will always care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for her own Child, before a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
Gold is her own Son, and is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her own Rules: but this <hi>Mercury</hi>
is the Son of the Philoſopher, to whoſe
nativity though Nature contribute her
help, yet he is out of her ordinary road,
and through the co-operation of Art and
Nature, he is for his qualifications an
aſtoniſhment to Nature, hot and dry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
and that actually; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with real <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and yet not
coagulated, but in one word <hi>Ignis aqua,</hi>
Gold truly ſo called, and that moſt pure,
yet volatile and crude, and no abortive;
not perfect, yet left in the way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and yet its virtue active, not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51319:193"/>
extinguiſhed. This ſubject Nature find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mixed with her Son, the King, even
Gold, by it ſhe endeavours to mend his
Conſtitution, and to multiply his virtue;
for though living Gold be a thing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
force, yet being out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
channel of Natures operations, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not mind its preſervation, much
leſs its propagation.</p>
                        <p>Theſe three forenamed Fires are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
ſecret and inviſible, but there is one
more which we uſe, which is not ours
properly; for every Sophiſter hath it and
uſeth it as well as we, and that is Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Fire, which yet is ſo neceſſary that
without it we can do nothing, nor yet
without the true knowledge of its due
proportion. So then we uſe no Fires of
Dung, nor of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or of Baths, at
ſome Sophiſters perſwade themſelves and
others, for theſe are all the Fires which
we uſe.</p>
                        <p>With the ſecret <hi>Sulphur</hi> that is in our
Water, which we proportion exactly in
the beginning, we open our Body, for
this Fire can do and doth that which no
other Fire can do, for it deſtroys and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51319:193"/>
conquers the Body, and makes it no Body
but a Spirit.</p>
                        <p>So that whatever any Sophiſters may
ſuggeſt, our Fire is Mineral, it is <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and that pure; it is united to the Water
in one form, and yet hinders not its flux,
nor corrupts its form.</p>
                        <p>This is the true <hi>Ignis Gehennae,</hi> for it
Eclipſeth the light of the Bodies, and
makes them become black as Pitch;
which is a ſymbol of Hell, and for its
<hi>Cimmerian</hi> darkneſs is by many of the
Wiſe men called Hell.</p>

                           <l>Fire of Nature is the third Menstrual,</l>
                           <l>That Fire is natural in each thing,</l>
                           <l>But Fire occaſionate we call unnatural,</l>
                           <l>As heat of Aſhes and Balnes for putrefying.</l>

                        </head>
                        <p>OUr natural Fire is, as I ſaid, the true
<hi>Sulphur</hi> of Gold, which in the hard
and dry Body is impriſoned, but by the
mediation of our Water it is let looſe, by
rotting the moles of the Body under
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51319:194"/>
which it was detained, and after ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Elements, it appears viſibly in our
third Menſtrual.</p>
                        <p>For though Gold be a compact and
dry Earthy Body, none may think that it
became what it is without the virtue of a
Seed, which by perfection is not extinct,
but ſealed up only; which Seed is a
Fiery form of Light, which nothing in
the World wanteth, and therefore it
would be a great <hi>Anomalum</hi> if it ſhould
be only defective in Metals, the choice of
all ſublunary Bodies.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt theſe two Fires, in the time
of their action and paſſion one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from another, there is made a
<hi>medium</hi> which is part of both, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not altogether natural, nor
wholly againſt nature, is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</p>
                        <p>The duration of this unnatural Fire is
from the time that the Body begins to
open, and colours to change, that is in a
word, all the time of the rule of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
and part of the rule of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the whole
Regimen of Putrefaction, and ſo much of
Ablution until the Dove begin to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51319:194"/>
over the Crow; which Putrefaction
as it is the turning of an intire Wheel, ſo
part of it is done <hi>in ſicco,</hi> when the Body
is all a diſcontinuous Calx or Aſhes, and
part <hi>in humido,</hi> which is called a Bath,
when the ſubſident part is liquid and
boils, and the ſuperiour part vapours aloft
and deſcends.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee how many Fires we
have, and how they are diſtinguiſhed:
wherein I have written what I know,
and as many as underſtand me will eſteem
my Writings highly; for without boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
let me aſſure thee, thou haſt not ſuch
another Directory in the whole World:
I may ſpeak it without offence, being
unknown to thee, and thou to me. This
I ſay not to detract from any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
for many were deeply ſeen in this
Maſtery, but almoſt all were envious,
and the moſt candid would have judged
my plainneſs deſerving an <hi>Anathema ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha.</hi>
I have here laid you ſo plain
demonſtrations as I go, that you cannot
miſs, if God direct you; and without
the knowledge of the Fires you are far
wide, whatever whimſies you have in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51319:195"/>
your head; for you ſhall never ſee the
diſſolution of the Body, nor ſhall you
ever make black, and by conſequence
you cannot divide Elements as you
ought to do, becauſe you proportioned
not your Matters wiſely in the beginning
of the Work; for, <hi>Dimidium facti qui
bene cepit, habet,</hi> he who makes a good
beginning, hath as good as half done.</p>

                        <p>HAving run through the Chapter
of Separation with a plain ſtile,
we ſhall now come to the life of
all, which is Conjunction; for we ſeek
not a thing which may be capable of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but which may abide in all
tryals, the parts being impoſſible to be
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51319:201"/>
ſeparated one from another, for ſo our
Tincture ought to be, or elſe it will
be wholly unprofitable for our purpoſe.
For Separation is but the middle motion,
by which we paſs from the unary ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Gold, to the millenary <hi>pluſquam</hi>
perfection of our Stone; before which
can be attained, there muſt be a looſing
of the Compages of the Body, that ſo the
Spiritual Fire, or Tincture may be ſet
looſe; which being looſed, will certainly
multiply it ſelf with that by which it was
diſſolved, with which it is neceſſary that
it ſhould Radically be mixed and united,
ſo as that both the diſſolvent and the
diſſolved may make one together.</p>
                        <p>This then is the benefit of our Water,
that it doth not only reduce, open and
mollifie our Body, and cauſe it to ſend
out its Seed, but it is actually recongea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the fermental virtue of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
influence of Gold, that it becomes
together with the Body, one new Body
perpetually united.</p>
                        <p>So that although our Water be vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
when it is firſt taken, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
after it hath firſt made the Body
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51319:201"/>
no Body, but a Spirit, in which ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
the Virtue or Tincture is augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
after that the Body by Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
makes this no Spirit but a Body, by
which the fixity is advanced mightily, ſo
that both will endure all Fire.</p>
                        <p>For it is not only an apparent union
that is made, but real, ſo real that the
Spirit and the Body paſs one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
penetrating each others dimenſions,
the Spirit being one with the Body, and
the Body being the Spirit, the Form
ſwallowing up the Matter in unity, ſo that
all becomes really Tincture.</p>

                        <p>OF this Operation Philoſophers make
a great Myſtery, and ſpeak of it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51319:202"/>
very hiddenly, in reſpect to the <hi>terminus</hi>
of it, which they call <hi>the hour of the Stones
Nativity,</hi> in which they ſay many mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
will appear, for all the colours that
can be invented in the World will be
then apparent.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay their Conjunction is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of Contraries, a making
friendſhip between Enemies, becauſe in
that time the volatile is ſtill aſcending and
deſcending upon the fixt: this is by them
aſcribed to Contrariety.</p>
                        <p>Others meaſuring all ſublunary things
by the rules of Symmetry and Ametry,
do aſcribe this Operation (which they
for ſimilitude ſake compare to a Duel)
to the over-prevailing of one principles
qualities above the qualities of the other,
and therefore they define Auriety to be
the Anaticalneſs of the four Elements in
mixture, each in his quality acting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the reſiſtance of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>&amp; vice verſa.</hi> But this is but an
Entanglement, in which the Chymiſts
ſtumble upon School Academical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
I had rather embrace their Secret,
as for Operation; but for Philoſophy,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51319:202"/>
jump with that noble <hi>Bruxellian,</hi> whoſe
promiſed Treatiſes when the World ſhall
enjoy, I ſuppoſe they will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt
piece of Philoſophy that ever
was revealed to the World: which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
not ſo much for his Experiments, of
none of which I am ignorant, nor <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>
to boot, many, yea moſt of which are
far harder (though ſooner wrought) than
the <hi>Elixir,</hi> and the <hi>Alchaheſt</hi> is a hundred
times more difficult; but what I moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in that noble Naturaliſt is, that he
did ſearch out the <hi>Occulta Naturae,</hi> more
accurately then ever any did in the
World. So that (ſetting aſide the skill
of this Maſtery, of which I cannot find
any footſteps in what of his is extant)
I am confident he was without flattery
Natures Privy-Counſellor, and for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
verity might have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this Secret; but God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
all to all men, yet who knows
what he may live to be Maſter of in this
point too.</p>
                        <p>This I ſpeak not to flatter him, who
(beſides what is evident to the whole
World in his Writings) have no other
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51319:203"/>
character of him, and to him I am like to
remain a perpetual Stranger; yet could
as heartily deſire his acquaintance, as
any mans I know in the World, and if
the Fates prevent not mine intentions,
by mine or his death, I ſhall endeavour
familiarity with him. But this by the
way.</p>
                        <p>To return whence I digreſſed; our
final ſecret is firſt to unite the Spirit and
Soul of our diſſolving Water, that by the
mediation of the Soul, the Spirit and
Body may be conjoyned, and then after
ſeveral Sublimations and Precipitations
made for that end, that the Body may be
ſpiritualized, and the Spirit corporalized,
ſo fix together the Soul, Body and Spirit,
the flying and the fixt, that all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(to uſe Philoſophers terms) may
acquieſce and reſt in this Neſt of Earth,
in which all the virtue of the ſuperiours
and inferiours is contained, both in power
and act.</p>
                        <p>From what hath been ſaid may appear,
the ſtrong paſſive deluſion that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
many men of our Age, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who with the Chymiſt in <hi>Sendivogius,</hi>
                           <pb n="281" facs="tcp:51319:203"/>
cannot dream of any other <hi>Mercury,</hi> then
that <hi>Mercury</hi> which is to be bought at
Druggiſts, which they take and ſublime
variouſly to make it clean, and then with
<hi>Hogheland</hi> mix it with Gold, applying
all the words and ſayings of Philoſophers
to this their mixture: But when the time
comes that they ſhould ſee the ſigns ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
of the Philoſophers, there they fail,
it may be by reaſon of ſomething exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to the Gold, (which it gets in folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which it gets in
waſhing and purging, which though it
be but little, yet it is enough in heat to
give a light Tincture to the Superficies)
they may with <hi>Hogheland,</hi> ſee a diſcolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
outſide, which is nothing; for our
Operation is not ſo trivial, that a man
had need of Spectacles, and a moſt clear
light to diſcern it: but it is ſo apparent,
that a half blind man would be amazed
at it, for our Body, even the perfect Body
is divided, which common <hi>Mercury</hi> can
never do, though a man bleſs himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much in his mock-purgations.</p>
                        <p>But when as ſuch Work-men have
waited their time out, and it may be out
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:51319:204"/>
again, and ſee not blackneſs, then they
run into another extreme, and ſhare the
fault of their errour (which was only in
their <hi>Mercury,</hi> or withall in their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for <hi>pondus</hi> and heat of external Fire)
between both principles, and then ſay
with <hi>Hogheland,</hi> our <hi>Mercury</hi> and our
Gold are not vulgar, but they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(no man knows what) which the
Philoſophers have called Gold and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
which yet are ſome ſtrange thing
which man never heard of, or ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing, or ſome vile thing. Thus they
vaniſh into ſmoak, and all for want of
knowledge of our true <hi>Mercury.</hi>

thy Body; mollifie it, ſoften it, and

uniting with Spirits, as one flame will mix

                        <p>The Soul being thus ſevered from the

ſeparated. And as by the Water (which
extracts the Soul) it dies and grows pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid

is waſhed from its filthy blackneſs; then
the clean Soul having cleanſed the Body,
is united to it, that from that time the
Body follows the Soul, and is moved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with it upon the Fire, flying and
deſcending in the form of a Spirit, which
is a wonder to behold.</p>
                        <p>This is our Secret ſo much eſteemed,
<hi>Conjunction,</hi> which is celebrated after
the looſing, putrefying and purifying of
our Body. This is the true proceſs of our
Work, according to the true exigency
of Nature; firſt the Soul is to be divided
from the Body, that is, groſneſs may be
purged by corruption and rotting, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51319:205"/>
the Spirit which is a form of light, and
ſeminal, may, being let looſe, multiply it
ſelf by the Spirit of the Water, and ſo
being allied to the Body from whence it
was drawn, and to the Water from whoſe
Spirit it receives an increaſe in virtue
and Tincture, it may unite both the Spirit
and the Body with a perpetual bond.
He who works thus, ſhall undoubtedly
attain unto perfection.</p>

                        <p>BUt when as the Philoſophers ſpeak of
Conjunction, it is warily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of what Conjunction they do
mean, for as it is a term very often uſed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51319:205"/>
ſo is it very doubtfully to be taken. One
Conjunction which they ſpeak of is groſs,
which is properly <hi>Amalgamation,</hi> it is
the firſt Operation after the preparation
of the <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this is not the Conjunction here
to be underſtood, but a more ſecret by
far, in which man worketh nothing at
all, but ſtands by only and beholds Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Operation. And this work is done
without any laying on of hands, and very
quickly, when the Matters are prepared
and made fit. This work is therefore
called a Divine Work.</p>
                        <p>This Conjunction is far more intimate
than the groſs, for this is an union <hi>per
minima,</hi> or <hi>intima,</hi> ſo that the eſſence of
the one, enters the eſſence of the other,
ſo as to make it but one ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>This maketh a temper which man by
no Art could make, for even as Water
mixed with Water is inſeparable, ſo is it
now with theſe principles. Now is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,

Love brought them together, Love par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them with a ſeeming diſcontent, and

                        <p>Now the ſame thing is both moiſt and
dry, hot and cold, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

according to the uſual voice of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)
for now is of two made three,
and of three made four, and of four one;

the Quadrangle is turned into a Circle,

                        <p>For the eſſence of one Element now
penetrateth the eſſence of another, that

mixed, that all four now make but one
partaking of all.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are thoſe principles which God
now hath conjoyned, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Garland.</p>

eaſily and ſpeedily attain to this, and
that thy ſigns may the better and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

                        <p>Be ſure you do not over-glut your
Earth with Water, nor cloy your Water
with Earth, but impaſt them, and then
grind them together as diligently as a
Painter would grind his Colours; for
the more exactly thou mixeſt them, the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:51319:207"/>
better and ſooner will they work one
upon another in heat.</p>
                        <p>Then ſet thy Glaſs in a Furnace made
for thy Work, and give a convenient
Fire, in which it may boyl night and day
perpetually, without a minutes ceaſing;
order the Fire ſo that it may in 12 or
24 hours begin to boyl, and from that
hour not to ceaſe boyling, ſubliming,
aſcending and deſcending, until ſuch time
as the moiſture be dried up, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

three,</l>

                           <l>And our Conjunction truly bring about.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>NOw to help thee throughly in this
myſtery of Philoſophical Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51319:207"/>
I ſhall particularize all our Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
We have particularly three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
all which muſt be known
by him who intends to compleat this
Maſtery.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is groſs, which I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
it is the <hi>Amalgamation</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> with
our <hi>Mercury,</hi> which becauſe the mixture
is made of two things, it is called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
diptative; and the Compound
is now called <hi>Rebis,</hi> that is, two things,
according to the verſe, <hi>Res Rebis eſt
Vina confecta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this mixture there are two Natures,
the one more active, which is the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
the other more paſſive, which is
Gold: where note, that the activity of
the <hi>Mercury</hi> above the Gold, is becauſe
the moving virtue of <hi>Sol</hi> is ſealed, that
is, his <hi>Sulphur</hi> is impriſoned. Otherwiſe
when Diſſolution is made, <hi>Sol</hi> then is
moſt active, and <hi>Mercury</hi> more paſſive;
<hi>Mercury</hi> then is as it were the Feminine
Sperm, which being more crude and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it is ſooner wrought upon by the
Fire, which <hi>Sol</hi> the Maſculine Sperm feels
not till it be penetrated by the <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                           <pb n="290" facs="tcp:51319:208"/>
and then it is forced to ſend forth its
Seed; for the formal principle reſides
moſtly in the Gold, and the material
chiefly in the Water; in the one, being
thick of conſtitution, the formal part is
ſealed; in the other, that little which is,
(in reſpect of the Body) is more at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and ſo by conſequence ſooner
active. Theſe two then muſt be mixed
<hi>(ad justam exigentiam naturae)</hi> as is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
hinted and proſecuted largely. To
this if thou haſt attended, thou ſhalt
know the extent and full Latitude of this
Conjunction; this is a manual work, and
the laſt manual work, next to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and ſealing of it in the Egg, that
thou haſt, before thou haſt attained the
firſt degree of the Maſtery.</p>

                        <head>
                           <l>The ſecond manner is called Triptative,</l>
                           <l>Which is a Conjunction of things three,</l>
                           <l>Of Body, Soul and Spirit, that they not
ſtrive,</l>
                           <l>Which Trinity thou muſt bring to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe next Conjunction that follows this
in order, is when thou haſt ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51319:208"/>
and regulated thy Fire, that thy
Spirits ſhall ſo aſcend and circulate, until
they have extracted out of the fixed
Body its moſt digeſted virtue, or ſubtle
Soul, which is Sulphureous, or of great
Firineſs. Then ſhall the Spirit and Soul
deſcend, and ſhall unite it ſelf with the
Body; then ſhall the Air be converted
into Duſt, according to the proceſs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Sandivogius,</hi> where they ſhall lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumulate
for ſix weeks without breath;
and after when the Spirit of life ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into them, the Spirit and Soul ſhall by
their mighty force carry aloft the Body
with them, ſo that it ſhall go out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
with them, for now theſe three are
made one.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>
                           <l>For as the Soul to the Spirit the bond
muſt be,</l>
                           <l>Right ſo the Body the Soul to him muſt knit.</l>
                           <l>Out of thy mind let not this Leſſon flit.</l>
                        </head>
                        <p>SO then by the mediation of the Soul,
the Spirit is made one, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the Body; for the Soul being
by the Spirit drawn from the Body, doth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51319:209"/>
naturally deſire to be united with it
again, and ſo long as it is from it, is from
home as it were in a Pilgrimage. The
Body alſo naturally doth deſire its Soul,
and will as forcibly attract it as a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
doth attract Iron: for know, that
the Soul doth not aſcend, but it carries
with it a fermental Odour of the Body,
by which it doth ſo effectually affect the
Spirit, that it begins to think of taking a
new impreſſion, and becomes daily by
little and little more and more able to
ſuffer Fire, and by conſequence draws
to the nature of a Body: obſerve this.</p>

                        <p>BUt yet this Conjunction doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the volatility of the Compound,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51319:209"/>
though it is ſo united that the parts aſcend
and deſcend together; the reaſon is, that
though by the Soul the Spirit and Body
be united, yet the Spirit ſometimes doth
carry the Body with it aloft, and the
Body at times precipitates the Spirit, the
Soul holding faſt together, till at length
not only theſe parts, but the Elemental
qualities of them, are ſo ſtrongly permixt,
that the one doth not more in acting,
then the other doth in reſiſting, by which
means they are not only united to follow
one another, but fixt to abide Fire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p>This is the laſt and nobleſt Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which all the myſteries of this
Microcoſm have their Conſummation.
This is by the Wiſe called their Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive

Elements Anatically mixed and united,

which name unleſs to our Stone,

ſo is there in the Generation of our
Stone, much that may anſwer to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Man: for as Anatomiſts do
allow the Woman fifteen veins conducing
to the act of Venery and Procreation,
and the Man from whom comes the Male
Sperm but five; ſo our Stone in his firſt
Compoſition requires three parts of the
Water or Feminine Sperm, to one of
<hi>Sulphur</hi> or the Male: ſo the Artiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting,

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51319:211"/>
will be accompliſhed with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

                        <p>Remember now that the more thy
Water is, the more ought to be thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Fire to dry it up; ſo then when
thou ſhalt make the proportion of Water
to the <hi>Sun</hi> three to one, remember that
thy number of Eagles, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of thy <hi>Mercury,</hi> ought to be nine,
or at moſt ten.</p>
                        <p>This is the higheſt Acuation of the
Water, which is beſt for ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as for ſeven Eagles, two to one is
a very good proportion, ſo haſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
three Eagles to every one of
the Water which is added to the Body.
Some are ſo acute as to ſay, that with
four Eagles well cleanſed, the Work may
be performed, and then the proportion
muſt be as three of the Water to two of
the Body, but the decoction muſt needs
be longer. I never yet tryed it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the forenamed proportions will do
far better, and nine months time is a

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51319:211"/>
ſince they ſhew nothing more than
quicker ways, but protract the time of
Putrefaction; for from that time the Fire
of Nature is at work, and then every

the Fire be accordingly, and the Matter

one ounce or two will be far ſooner

it fully; take heed then to my
Doctrine, mix thy Water with thy Body
in a due quantity, and grind them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

mixed them, ſhut them up in thy Glaſs
carefully, and there let them ſtand till
compleat perfection.</p>
                        <p>And after thou haſt mixed them, and
ſet them to heat, be ſure thou ſtir them
not, much leſs open them, or add any
thing to them, or take ought from them,
whatever any Author do ſeem to adviſe:
For if thou do contrary to this my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
thou doſt run an extreme hazard
of loſing all; for as it is with Harlots,
who lying with many men, conceive
rarely of any: ſo if thou joyn crude <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
after thy firſt Conjunction, I will not
ſay that it is impoſſible, but very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ever thou ſhalt attain our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:
And what I ſay of putting in freſh
<hi>Mercury,</hi> is to be underſtood of the Body
alſo, for if thou ſhalt add freſh of that,
thou wilt deſtroy all; for after thou ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
them to the Fire, thou muſt expect
Conception, that is, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> by
aſcending and deſcending will extract
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:51319:212"/>
part of the ſeminal virtue out of the

done, there then ſtands a relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

Husband and Wife. Now other
<hi>Mercury,</hi> or other <hi>Sol</hi> are not as yet ſo
related, and therefore they are as a third
perſon, which Love abhors. Therefore
mix thy Matters ſo judiciouſly at firſt,
that thou need not afterwards to wiſh for
any new addition, and cloſe your Veſſel
well, and decoct it carefully.</p>

there is a third made, which is a Neuter
from both, and yet partakes of both;
and theſe two Natures that did ſeem ſo
oppoſite, are now conſpired together to
make one ſubſtance incorruptible.</p>
                        <p>For the Water which is a Spirit, hath
given ſuch an impreſſion to the Earth,
that it which was corporal and dry, and
uncapable of communicating Tincture,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51319:215"/>
is by it become penetrative, ſo that it
can in the very twinkling of an eye paſs
to the very Centre, upon an imperfect

                        <p>For it is not in our union of this <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>

of Water to Earth, though we make ſuch

our <hi>Mercury</hi> will not in the Examen of
the Fire flow away as Water will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale
from Loam, how exquiſitely ſoever
it be contempered with it.</p>
                        <p>So then our Body which by our Art is
renewed, is advanced into the order of
Spirits, or Bodies glorified, which though
they have Bodies, yet they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to thoſe Laws of groſs corporeity,
which is in Bodies not regenerate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Stone is a Syſtem of Wonders,
ponderous, fixt, and exquiſitely compact,
and yet as penetrative as hot Oyl is into
ſoaking Paper.</p>
                        <p>So that it is not now as it was at firſt
beginning of Operation, when the one
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:51319:216"/>
was above, the other below, compared
to two Dragons or Birds, the one winged,
the other without wings; but now both
are capable to reſiſt the Fire in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
fury.</p>
                        <p>Now hath the Water received a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

                        <p>Our firſt Secret is to know, our true

the abſurdities in the World: This is
Gold, which is to be bought pure almoſt
in any place.</p>
                        <p>The next is to know our <hi>Mercury,</hi>
which is not common, but artificial,
drawn from three heads by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one thing, which makes the two
which are dry and Sulphurous, to unite
with one which is moiſt and Mercurial.
Theſe are different in their qualities,
which difference our decoction ſo recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles,
as to make of them ſweet Harmony.
For the <hi>Sulphur</hi> in whoſe increaſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
conſiſts our final intent, it doth give
conſiſtence to the Water, yet ſo as that
it doth not part with it from it ſelf, but
with its Fermentative virtue it doth ſo
infuſe it, that of a moiſt Spirit tender and
volatile, it becomes a fixt dry Fire-abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>But firſt of all the Water doth mollifie
the Body, and ſoak into it, and ſearch

out its profundity; for the <hi>Sun</hi> teyneth

                        <p>BEtween the dry Body and the fluid

which is called Impaſtation, for it is made
like unto Paſte; and Inceration, for it

the notion of an <hi>Amalgama,</hi> and knows
what temper that is, when it will ſpread

now doth lead us to the Gate of
Putrefaction, a horrible Gate, whoſe

dreadful with many windings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                        <p>And yet it is a Gate ſo neceſſary, that

                        <p>The cauſe of this death, or corruption
or rottenneſs, proceeds from the action
of continual heat, not ſo much of the
external Fire of the <hi>Athanor,</hi> as of the
Compound within it ſelf; in which the
Fire of the Water which is againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
doth open the perfect Body by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
contrition and decoction, and ſo
lets looſe its <hi>Sulphur</hi> that was incarcerate,
which is Fire of Nature, that ſo between
theſe two in continual action and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
together with the external heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
acting, the whole Compound is
brought to corruption, being ſometimes
roaſted with external heat, which doth
ſublime the moiſture, which again of its
own accord returns continually, and
doth moiſten the Earth ſo long, until by
reaſon of the heat it have drunk up the
moiſture wholly, and then it dyes.</p>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51319:225"/>
that ſo a new Life may ſpring
from the old dead Body; nor doth he
ever expect increaſe, ſo long as it remains
in his Garner.</p>
                        <p>Right ſo we, ſo long as our Material
principles continue in their own nature
and form, they are but of a ſingle value,
for Gold and <hi>Mercury</hi> are two ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that they will for ever delude as
many as proceed to work on them in a
Sophiſtical way; for whatever the Artiſt
may think, they will remain the ſame
unto the end of the World, unleſs pure
<hi>Sol</hi> being mixed with its own pure and
appropriated <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſet in a due
heat of digeſtion, there ariſe a mutual
action and paſſion between them, which
without the laying on of the Artiſts
hands, will tend to a new Generation.
For in a convenient Fire, in which the
Compound may perpetually and unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
boyl, and the ſubtle parts may
aſcend and circulate upon the groſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermiſſion, the moſt digeſted Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or Soul of the fixed Body, (which is
his <hi>baſis</hi> of Tincture) will be extracted
by the Water, and this will mix it ſelf
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:51319:225"/>
with the pure Spirit of the Water, and
with this it will aſcend and return, until
a total ſeparation be made of the pure
from the impure, and the ſubtle from
the groſs.</p>
                        <p>Then ſhall the Body draw down its
Soul again, and by the power of the moſt
High it ſhall be united, and with it the
Spirit of life ſhall be joyned alſo, ſo that
all three ſhall become one with an union
indiſſolvable; but all this pre-ſuppoſeth
a Putrefaction, or Corruption of one
form, elſe cannot there be an Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <p>Therefore ſince this myſtery of Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

ſo neceſſary that without it there is
nothing can be done to purpoſe, that is
to ſay, with profit; I ſhall be a little
plain and full in the proſecution of this
myſtery: For in the knowledge of this
conſiſts all that is required to make a
Philoſopher. All the intentions of the

order things, that he may be ſure of this
<hi>terminus;</hi> and when he is there come, he
is as ſure a Maſter as if he had the Stone

the Operator is always to turn either
backward to ſeek out ſome other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or forward, or to the right hand,
or to the left; but when he is Maſter of
this, he then can fail in nothing but in the
Regimen of the outward heat.</p>

                        <p>THe definition that the Philoſophers
give of this Operation, is perpetually
Allegorical, for this Gate they have
named by all Metaphors almoſt in the
World, eſpecially from death, and dead
men: therefore they allegorize the Veſſel
in this ſtation, to Grave, or Tomb, and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51319:226"/>
emblematically diſcover this Operation
by the types of Skuls, dead Bones, and
rotten Carcaſſes; according to which
Metaphors they call Putrefaction, the
death of the Compound.</p>
                        <p>For when they ſaw the Body with the
Water to melt in the Fire, to flow and
to boyl, they called this <hi>Magneſia;</hi> when
they ſaw the Water partly to aſcend, and
partly to deſcend, and partly to remain
below, ſo that at once there was both a
Sublimation in vapour, and a Motion of
what was below, they ſaid that it was
the Spirit of the Water that aſcended,
or more Airy part; and the more Fiery
part, which rejoyceth moſt to be united
to, and hidden in Earth, remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
for that was more capable of the
Fire, and did better agree with it, as with
its like: which becauſe it did ſo unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
ſwell and boyl, and rage at the
bottom, and make the Body begin to
change its colour, they ſaid it was Fire
againſt Nature. Again, when they ſaw
the aſcending Vapour to change colour,
they ſaid it was the Soul of the Bodies
was mixed with the Spirit, which becauſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51319:227"/>
it was green, they ſaid it was a vegetative
Soul, and Fire of Nature.</p>
                        <p>Now when the Body below began to
thicken, they ſaid this was an Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditical
Body, becauſe part of the
Water always remained below, and made
the Body to boyl, and bubble, and flow;
and therefore this they called a new
Body compounded of two Bodies, the
<hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> the Man and the
Wife, which becauſe it grew to a ſlimy
conſiſtence, they named it <hi>Limus,</hi> or
<hi>Limbus, Hyle,</hi> and a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <hi>Terra
Adamica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When this Body began to grow very
black, and to ſend up foul Exhalations,
yellowiſh, blewiſh, and black, they ſaid
this was Death and Corruption, which
followed the ſeparation of the Soul from
the Body.</p>
                        <p>Now when they ſee the Souls to be
again united, and to remain below toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they knew that the Soul and Spirit
were Immortal, that is, the Tincture or
Vital Balſam was Incorruptible; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſee them again unite, they
knew the Soul and Spirit would renew
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51319:227"/>
the Bodies, and this ſeeming Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was but the natural ſtep to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Regeneration; for if the Souls be
again united to the Bodies, they will
ſurely regenerate them, and renew them,
and make them incorruptible; for if the
Spirits had not returned to this union,
they might only have expected the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation
of them: for Spiritual Tinctures
or Eſſences, cannot be deſtroyed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in many Vegetals, much leſs in
the moſt perfect of Minerals and Metals.
The union then of the Souls with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
argues evidently a hidden purity,
under the apparent rottenneſs, which will
after Purification be exalted to tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Glory.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon they ſaid, that the Spirit
and Soul which were above, were the
Heavenly Quinteſſence, and the Body
below was the Earth; and this Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirits, were but as the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Heavens round about the
Earth; and the falling drops, were but as
the influential dew, which did cauſe the
Earth to fructifie; and the blackneſs and
darkneſs, were but the Winter Latitude,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51319:228"/>

Therefore what by long Experience,
and profound Meditation, Philoſophers
have found out and ſeen, that alſo they
committed and communicated unto us;
ſo that we alſo are made fellow Heirs of
this great Treaſure, and we ſhall as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
communicate our knowledge for
thy Inſtruction. Firſt then, take thy Body
which is <hi>Gold,</hi> and thy Water which is
<hi>Mercury,</hi> the one ready made by Nature
to thy hand, the other thou muſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
for it is not to be found in the
Land of the Living, but muſt be made;
Nature here is at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and ſo is
Art, taken aſunder, but both together
effect it.</p>
                        <p>Mix theſe together in due proportion,
ſo as I have often told thee; then ſet
them to the Fire to decoct, and give
them a convenient heat, in which they
may boyl, aſcend and deſcend perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
without any intermiſſion night
or day.</p>
                        <p>But eſpecially and before all things be
careful in your Internal heat, to wit, the
proportion of your Water for your <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;</hi>
that you muſt add and ſupply to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51319:229"/>
it in the beginning of your Work, in its
Preparation, is that which doth perform
all the work within, without which your
External heat is of no value, for it is of it
ſelf uneffectual.</p>
                        <p>If then thou accend this heat ſo much
as that it predominate, it will not then
diſſolve the Bodies, as thou expecteſt,
but contrarywiſe burn the Flowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are extracted from the depth
of their Marrow: this thou mayſt eaſily
do, either if thy <hi>Arſnick</hi> be not made as
it ought, or elſe the number of Eagles
exceeded, or the proportion of thy
Water to thy Body not agreeing to the
number of Eagles, or thy Glaſs not well
proportioned to thy Matter; it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
burn, if thy Glaſs be too big, for ſo
the moiſture will ſo much be diſperſed
about the Concave, that it will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
before the Earth below be left too
dry. I have given Rules eaſily to avoid
all theſe inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>And on the other hand, be ſure that
thou do not erre in too little heat; let
thy Water have Fire enough within it,
to make a true diviſion and corruption,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51319:229"/>
which if either thy <hi>Arſnick</hi> have not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Fiery virtue, or if the union of
this and thy Water be not well attended,
but ſlightly performed, or the Purgation
of thy Water be not throughly made
each Eagle, for ſo two or three Eagles
may not add the virtue of one, or if thy
number of Eagles be not juſt, or thy
proportion of quantity be not duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                        <p>Therefore follow my advice, and be
careful in both theſe particulars, and

                           <l>And thus by the Gate of blackneſs thou muſt

wilt win.</l>

                        <p>IN the beginning therefore of our
Work, through the Co-operation of
heat both internal and external, and the
moiſture of the Matter concurring, our
Body gives a blackneſs like unto Pitch,
which for the moſt part happens in 40,
or at the moſt in 50 days.</p>
                        <p>This colour diſcovers plainly that the
two Natures are united, and if they are
united, they will certainly operate one
upon another, and alter and change each
other from thing to thing, and from ſtate
to ſtate, until all come to one Nature and
ſubſtance Regenerate, which is a new
Heavenly Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="348" facs="tcp:51319:237"/>
But before there can be this Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Old man neceſſarily muſt be
deſtroyed, that is, thy firſt Body muſt
rot and be corrupted, and loſe its form,
that it may have it repaid with a new
form, which is a thouſand times more
noble. So then our Work is not a forced
and apparent, but a natural and radical
Operation, in which our Natures are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
perfectly, in ſo much that the one
and the other having fully loſt what they
were before, yet without change of kind,
they become a third thing, Homogeneal
to both the former.</p>
                        <p>Thus they who ſow in tears, ſhall reap
in joy; and he who goeth forth mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and carrying precious Seed, ſhall
return with an abundance of increaſe,
with their hands filled with ſheaves, and
their mouths with the praiſes of the Lord:
thus the choſen or redeemed of the Lord
ſhall return with Songs, and everlaſting
Joy ſhall be upon their heads, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſorrows ſhall fly away.</p>

and the Air cold with Northerly winds,
and much Rain falls, which endures for
its ſeaſon; but after that, the Sun breaks
out, and ſhines hotter and hotter, till all
become dry, and then at Noon-day not a
Cloud appearing, but all clear from one
end of the Heaven to the other.</p>

nothing elſe but extracting Water
from the Earth, and returning it again
upon the Earth, ſo long and ſo often till
the Earth putrefie; for by elevation of
the moiſture the Body is heated and
dried, and by returning it again it is
cooled and moiſtned, by the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which ſucceſſive Operations, it
is brought to corrupt and rot, to loſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:51319:243"/>
its form, and for a ſeaſon to remain
as dead.</p>
                        <p>This is the true intention and manner
of our working, and there is no other
manner of working that can be invented,
that can give thee the effect of this our
Operation; for this is the true way and
means by which thy Body of Gold will
be deſtroyed, and no other way profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for our Art: Proceed therefore as
I have directed thee, and ſwerve not
either to the right hand or to the left.
Take this Body which I have ſhewed
thee, and joyn it with the Spirit which is
proper to it, which the Wiſe men have
called their <hi>Venus,</hi> or Goddeſs of Love,
and circulate theſe two Natures one upon
the other, until the one have conceived
by the other.</p>
                        <p>But beware you urge not the Spirit
too much, but remember that he is a
volatile ſubſtance, and if he be over-provoked,
he will certainly break the
Veſſel, and fly, and leave thee the ruines
of thy Glaſs for a recompence of thy
over-ſpeedy raſhneſs; which truſt me
will make thee fetch a deep Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

which thy Spirit may be ſo ſtirred up, as
to return to its Body in the Glaſs, and
not ſo irritated as to break the Veſſel, and
return to the Aſhes or Sand of the Neſt,
or ſtick about the ſides of the Cover of
your Neſt, or elſe fly about in the Room
wherein the Artiſt is, and lodge in his

then it was before, by adding to his

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51319:244"/>
the Spirit and Body are enforced to
change their colour and complexion: for
it is this Soul of the diſſolved Bodies,
which is the ſubject of Wonders; it is
the life, and therefore quickens the dead;
it is the Vegetative Soul, and therefore
it makes the dead and ſealed Bodies,

                        <p>FOr as in our Solution we do not make
our Gold volatile as to ſhew, as Fools

ſo as that by no Art of man it can ever

which made it volatile; ſo alſo our Fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth make our flying Spirits ſo Fire-abiding,
that they by no Art of man

like Wax.</p>
                        <p>Nor is it fixed in manner of flying

relent neither in the Air nor Water, like
to a congealed Salt.</p>
                        <p>Nor yet is our Congelation a formal
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:51319:255"/>
Tranſmutation of a thing by another ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
virtue, for then it would become
of a Stony, Flinty, or Adamantine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but by its own internal virtue, the
<hi>Mercury</hi> is changed into <hi>Sulphur</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible,
yet ſo as that the <hi>Mercuriality</hi>
retains ſome of its qualities in a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        <p>So then take this for the Touch-ſtone
of all thy Alchymical endeavours, if ever
thou intend any thing commendable in
our Art; ſee that thy Medicine be of an

and flow on it like Wax or melted Pitch;
yea let the flux be ſo eaſie, that it may
flow upon <hi>Mercury,</hi> and enter it before

Such are they who mix <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> both

and long Decoction brought to this

reckons without his Hoſt, and muſt reckon
again: It is Medicine of the firſt Order,
and muſt be brought to the third Order
by Imbibitions and Cibation, which is a
ſecond turning round the Wheel; and by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51319:277"/>
Fermentation, which is a third turning
round the Wheel, and brings the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
to the third Order, and makes it then
fit for Projection, which at firſt it is not;
For till the Medicine will flow like Wax,
it cannot enter <hi>Mercury</hi> before its flight;
but the Powder as it is made at firſt, is like
Grains or Atoms, and is congealed in a
far greater heat, then will make ☿ to fume,
yet it abides in its from of Duſt or Powder,
which muſt be otherwiſe before it be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Projection; therefore the Stone
tingeth <hi>Mercury</hi> into a Metalline Maſs in
the twinkling of an eye, as our Author
ſaith in his Preface, even as the <hi>Baſilisk</hi>
kills by ſight: But the Red <hi>Sulphur</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
<hi>Mercury</hi> by a digeſtion of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its own Nature, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Powder, if it
be joyn'd in a due proportion, and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a due heat: Therefore ſaith our
Author, if you give it too much, it muſt
have a Vomit, or it will be ſick too long,
but the Stone will never part with any
<hi>Mercury</hi> that is joyned to it in heat; our
<hi>Sulphur</hi> then is a Royal Infant, which doth
both hunger and thirſt; and if you can
but be a Nurſe to it as you ought, it will
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51319:278"/>
repay both your Pains and coſt: Leave
not then where you ſhould begin; but
go on till you bring it to the third Order,
which <hi>Reymond</hi> calls his Oyls and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents;
and ſo our Author likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>Three Properties there are in which
the White and Red <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of the firſt
Order, differ from thoſe of the third Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>One flows as eaſily as any Wax in heat,
or on a hot Metal: the other in a ſtrong
heat abides a Powder.</p>
                     <p>The one is like to Glaſs, brittle, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
and ſhining; the other a powder
like to Atoms.</p>
                     <p>The one enters <hi>Mercury</hi> like an Oyl,
and Coagulates it in an inſtant: the other
drinks up <hi>Mercury</hi> only, as the Calx of a
Metal would do, but will not retain it, if
the Fire be increaſed ſtrong, nor turn it
into Metal; but if the heat and proportion
be both as they ought, by a digeſtion of
Time, it turns it into its own Nature:
And ſo, (as <hi>Ripley</hi> ſaith truly,) you may
Multiply both White and Red with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
That if at firſt you had not enough
to fill a ſpoon, yet in ſhort time you may

becauſe we ſeek the Nobleſt of Creatures

when they ſay our ſtone is nothing
elſe but Gold digeſted unto the higheſt
degree, to which Nature and Art, can
bring it; and again the firſt work, ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Philoſopher, is to ſublime <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and then into clean <hi>Mercury</hi> to put clean
bodies: many witneſſes I could bring, yea
the whole current of writers run this way:
And what if ſome ſubtle <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſeem
to deny this, on purpoſe to deceive the
unwary? We ſhall not make it our work
to reconcile them; (though we might)
for many of them wrote very enviouſly,
on purpoſe to enſnare; all of them wrote
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51319:284"/>
myſteriouſly, as much as they could to
darken the truth: and at the beſt none of
them were but men, and deſcribed things
according to their apprehenſions in
Philoſophy, none of them wrote in every
thing the naked truth; for then the Art
would become ſo eaſie, that it would be
contemned. But what needs words? we
know the Truth, and we know by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Character, true Writers from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters;
and we need no Arguments
being eye-witneſſes our ſelves, and know
that there is but one truth; nor but
one path, even the beaten path in which
all who ever have attained this Art
have troden, nor can we be deceived
our ſelves; nor would we deceive others.</p>

                     <p>THis Toad is ſaid to drink the juice of
Grapes according to the Philoſopher,
the body, ſaith he, is not nobler than Gold,
nor yet the water more pretious than

diſcovered the whole Truth fully and
nakedly, and if not too plainly, I am
ſure plain enough. I ſhall not here repeat;
to that I remit the Reader.</p>
                     <p>This juice of Grapes this Toad is ſaid
to drink; that is not only in the groſs
Conjunction, which is an Impaſtation of
the body, with the Water to the temper
of <hi>Dough</hi> or <hi>Leaven,</hi> which the Water
readily doth: ſuch affinity there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Water and the Body; as the
Philoſopher ſaith, this Water is friendly
and pleaſant to the metals. But over, and
beſides the Water ſoaks Radically into
our Body; being circulated upon it,
according as the Philoſopher ſaith, When
its own ſweat is returned to the Body, it
perforates it marvellouſly. Thus the Body
drinks in the Water, or Juice of Grapes,
not ſo much then when they are firſt
mingled: but moſt eſpecially, when by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51319:285"/>
decoction it pierceth radically to the
very profundity of it; and makes it to
alter its Form; This is the Water which
teareth the Bodies, and makes them no
Bodies, but flying Spirits like a Smoak,
Wind or Fume, as <hi>Artephius</hi> ſpeaketh
plentifully.</p>
                     <p>This operation is performed in a ſhort
while, in compariſon of Subterraneal
operations of Nature, which are done
in a very long time; therefore it is that
ſo many Philoſophers ſay, that it is done
in a very ſhort time, and yet it is not
without cauſe, that ſo many of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
have complained of the length
of this decoction.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the ſame <hi>Artephius</hi> who had
ſaid, that this fire of the Water of our
<hi>Mercury,</hi> doth that in a ſhort time above
ground, that Nature was in performing a
1000 years, doth in another place ſay, that
the tincture doth not come out at once,
but by little and little each day, and hour,
till after along time the decoction be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
according to the ſaying of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher:
Boyl, boyl, and again boyl, and

White, and afterwards become Yellowiſh,
Blewiſh, and Blackiſh, (from the virulency
