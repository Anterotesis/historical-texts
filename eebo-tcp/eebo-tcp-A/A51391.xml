            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath lately printed a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led [The Mischiefs of Self-Ignorance, and <hi>the Benefits of Self-Acquaintance</hi>] in the Address of which Book to his dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved the Inhabitants of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> he hath this ensuing passage relating to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a disputation by writing, those of the other part formed an Argument, whose Major Proposition was to this sense (for I have no Copy) <hi>[What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Book enjoyneth nothing but what is of it self lawful, and by lawful authority, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth nothing that is sinful,]</hi> We denied this Proposition, and at last gave divers Reasons of our denial; amongst which one was, that <hi>[It may be unlawful by Accident, and therefore sinful]</hi> You now know my Crime; it is my concurring with Learned Reverend <hi>Brethren,</hi> to give this reason of our denial of a Proposition: yet they are not forbidden to Preach for it, (and I hope shall not be) but only I. You have publickly heard from a mouth that should speak nothing but the words of Charity, Truth and Soberness, (especially there) that this was <hi>[a desperate shift that men at the last are forced to]</hi> and inferring <hi>[that then neither God nor man can enjoyn without sin]</hi> In City and
<pb facs="tcp:61479:3"/>
Countrey this soundeth forth to my reproach; I should take it for an Act of Clemency to have been smitten professedly for nothing, and that it might not have been thought necessary to afflict me by a defamation, that so I might seem justly afflicted by a prohibition to Preach the Gospel. But indeed is there in these words of ours so great a Crime? though we doubted not but they knew that our Assertion made not Every Evil <hi>Accident</hi> to be such as made an Imposition unlawful, yet we expressed this by word to them at that time, for fear of being misreported: and I told it to the <hi>Right Reverend Bishop</hi> when he forbad me to Preach, and gave this as a reason: And I must confess I am still guilty of so much weakness, as to be confident that <hi>Some things, not Evil of themselves, may have Accidents so Evil, as may make it a sin to him that shall Command them.</hi> Is this opinion inconsistent with all Government? yea I must confess my self guilty of so much greater weakness, as that I thought I should never have found a man on Earth, that had the ordinary reason of a Man, that had made question of it; yea I shall say more then that which hath offended (viz.) <hi>That whensoever the commanding or forbidding of a thing indifferent is like to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion more hurt than good, and this may be foreseen, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding or forbidding it is a sin.</hi> But yet this is not the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I am chargeable with, but that <hi>[Some Accidents there may be that may make the Imposition sinful]</hi> If I may ask it without accusing of others, how would my Crime have been deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated if I had said the contrary? should I not have been judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to live in any governed Society? It is not unlawful of it self to Command out a Navy to Sea: but if it were foreseen that they would fall into the Enemies hands, or were like to perish by any <hi>Accident,</hi> and the necessity of sending them were small, or none, it were a sin to send them. It is not unlawful of it self to sell poyson, or give a knife to another, or to bid another to do it; but if it were foreseen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they will be used to poyson or kill the buyer, it is unlawful; and I think the Law would make him believe it that were guilty. It is not of it self unlawful to light a candle, or set fire on a straw; but if it may be foreknown, that by anothers negligence or wilfulness it is like to set
<pb facs="tcp:61479:3"/>
fire on the City, or give fire to a train or store of Gun-powder that is under the Parliament House, when the King and Parliament are there, I crave the <hi>Bishops</hi> pardon, for believing that it were sinful to do it, or command it; yea or not to hinder it (in any such case) when <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> jubet,</hi> yea though going to Gods publick worship be of it self so far from being a sin, that it is a Duty, yet I think it is a sin to command it to all in time of a raging Pestilence, or when they should be defending the City against the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of an Enemy, it may rather then be a duty to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibit it. I think <hi>Paul</hi> spake not any thing inconsistent with the Government of God or Man, when he bid both the Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and the People of the Church, <hi>not to destroy him with their mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for whom Christ dyed:</hi> and when he saith, <hi>he hath not his power to destruction, but to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> yea there are evil <hi>Accidents</hi> of a thing, not evil of it self, that are caused by the Commander: and it is my opinion that they may prove his command unlawful.</p>
            <p>But what need I use any other Instances then that which was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our dispute? Suppose it never so lawful of it self to kneel in the Reception of the Sacrament, if it be imposed by a penalty that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident</hi> of the Command, and maketh it by <hi>Accident</hi> sinful in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. If a Prince should have Subjects so weak as that all of them thought it a sin against the example of Christ and the Canons of the General Councels, and many hundred years practice of the Church, to kneel in the Act of Receiving on the Lords Day, if he should make a Law that all should be put to death that would not kneel, when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew that their Consciences would command them all, or most of them to dye rather then obey, would any man deny his command to be unlawful by this <hi>Accident?</hi> Whether the penalty of ejecting Ministers that dare not put away all that do not kneel, and of casting out all the people that scruple it, from the Church, be too great for such a circumstance (and so in the rest) and whether this, with the lamentable estate of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and the divisions that will follow, being all foreseen, do prove the impositions unlawful which were then in Question, is a Case that I had then a clearer call to speak to, then I have now; only I may say
<pb facs="tcp:61479:4"/>
               <hi>That the Ejecting of the Servants of Christ from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Church, and of his faithful Ministers from their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Work, when too many Congregations have none but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, or scandalous Teachers, or no Preaching Ministers at all, will appear a matter of very great moment in the day of our accounts, and such as should not be done upon any but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary cause, where the benefit is greater then this hurt (and all the rest) amounts to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having given you (to whom I owe it) this account of the cause for which I am forbidden the exercise of my Ministry in that Countrey, I now direct these Sermons to your hands, that seeing I cannot teach you as I would, I may teach you as I can: And if I much longer enjoy such Liberty as this, it will be much above my expectation.</p>

            <head>The Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s Letter to a Friend for Vindication of himself from Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Calumny.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received that Letter of yours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you inform me that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written and printed something with such a reflection upon me, that I am obliged to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>I thank you for your care of my Reputation, which next to Conscience ought to be the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all things to all men, especially to men of my Profession and Order, who the more they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified (whether justly or unjustly) the less good they will be able to do, especially amongst those that have industriously been prepossessed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice either against their Persons or their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions This was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Case, when there were some that did what they could to make the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to undervalue his person, that thereby they might discredit his Doctrine, and weaken his Authority, whom therefore he thinks he may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61479:5"/>
without breach of Charity call <hi>False Apostles and Deceitful Workers.</hi> Nay this was our Saviours own Case, who, whilest he lived here upon the Earth, was ever and anon traduced and slandred by the Scribes and Pharisees, those proud Hypocrites, who were the greatest pretenders to holiness, and yet the greatest seducers of the people, and the grossest falsifyers of Gods Word, that ever were in the world, until these our times, which have brought forth a generation of men (St. <hi>Johnaptist</hi> would have called them a <hi>Generation of Vipers</hi>) who in the Art of holy jugling and malicious slandring have out-done the Pharisees themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all that went before them; witness their so often wresting and perverting the Scripture in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to stir up the people to Sedition, and their as often Libelling the King in their Prayers, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the making of his Subjects first to hate him, then to fight against him, and at last to take away his Crown, and his Life from him. And is it any wonder that those that are such Enemies to Kings, should not be friends to Bishops? or that one (who hath done what he could to make the late King odious unto his People) should do what he can likewise to make the Pastor odious unto his Flock? to his Flock I say; For it is the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> as well as of all other Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches in that Diocess; neither did I or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61479:5"/>
any other <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> ever commit the Care of Souls in that, or any other Parish of that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> though by that Preface of his to those of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> he would make the world believe, that they were <hi>his</hi> Flock, and not <hi>mine,</hi> and that therefore he hath the more reason to complain of my defamation of him (as he calls it) in that place and before that people: whereas the truth is that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was never either <hi>Parson, Vicar,</hi> or <hi>Curate</hi> there or any where else in my Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; for he never came in by the <hi>Door,</hi> that is, by any legal right or lawful admission into that Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, but climbed up some other way, namely, by violence and intrusion, and therefore by Christs own inference he was a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber</hi>; and indeed he did <hi>Rob</hi> him that was then, and is now again the lawful <hi>Vicar</hi> of that Church; he <hi>Robbed</hi> him I say, first of his <hi>Reputation</hi> amongst his Flock, and then of his <hi>means</hi> and <hi>maintenance,</hi> by taking away the <hi>Fleece</hi> as well as the <hi>Flock</hi> from him; though (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath confessed to me) <hi>He be a man of an unblamable life and conversation, though not of such parts</hi> (said Mr. <hi>Baxter) as are fit to qualifie him for the Cure of so great a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>; which whether it were so or no, I am sure Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not to be the Judge; but in that Case the Bishop that was then living should and would have provided him a Coadjutor, as I have done since, and such an one, as I hope will feed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61479:6"/>
that flock with much more wholsome Doctrine then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, when he sowed the seed of Schism and Sedition, and blew the Trumpet of Rebellion amongst them. For which cause I thought it my Duty (as being their Pastor in Chief) not onely to forbid Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to Preach there any more, which, by the way, he had done without my License; but likewise to Preach there my self, and to do what I could to undeceive that poor seduced and miserably deluded people; which was not to be done, as long as they had the person of their <hi>Seducer</hi> in so great admiration; and therefore by the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in order to the same end did take the same course with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith, with <hi>Demas, Philetus,</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus</hi>; as likewise by the example of Christ himself, who in order to the same end, did take the same course with the Scribes and Pharisees, I thought it necessary to let them know <hi>that one that was of great authority amongst them</hi> (meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though not naming Mr. <hi>Baxter) was not the man they took him for; that he had not dealt faithfully with them, nor preached the word of God sincerely to them, when he made them believe it was lawful for them to take up Arms against the King, nor in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if not making) them to scruple at these things as unlawful, which he himself confesses to be lawfull</hi>; and afterwards making use of those scruples of theirs (which he himself had infused into them, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61479:6"/>
not endeavoured to take from them) as the only argument why those things they did so scruple at should not be enjoyn'd by lawful Authority, though lawful in themselves, <hi>because,</hi> forsooth, <hi>the enjoyning of things lawful by lawful Authority, if they may by Accident be the occasion of sin, is sinful</hi>; which assertion of his (as I then said, and must still maintain) is destructive of humane society in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Authority of Commanding and the obligation of obeying, together with the whole Legislative power, Civil as well as Ecclesiastical, and Divine as well as Humane. And thus much (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself saith) I told him before in mine own house, neither did he then deny the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, or endeavour to disprove what I inferr'd from it, by any of those distinctions or instances he now useth. And that this is true the <hi>Reverend Dr. VVarmstry</hi> now <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> will witness for me, whom I desired to be by whilest I conferr'd with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> foreseeing what misreport a man of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> principles and temper was like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make of what should pass betwixt us. And it was very well I did so; for I find that the <hi>Presbyter</hi> aswell as the <hi>Papist</hi> will serve themselves, as often as they are put to it, of their <hi>piae frandes,</hi> or holy artifices, of speaking more or less then the truth, as it makes more or less for their purpose or advantage; as likewise of putting <hi>non causam pro causa,</hi> or a part and a less principal part of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61479:7"/>
cause for the whole cause. For who would not think that knows not Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that when he tels his Disciples of <hi>Kidderminster, You now know my Crime,</hi> with reference to the aforesaid assertion, and to that only, who would not think, I say, that either there was nothing else objected against him, or at least nothing of moment, or that could be any just and reasonable cause of my forbidding him to Preach in my Diocess? especially when he adds that the <hi>Right Reverend Bishop gave him this as a reason for his forbidding him to Preach</hi>; where if he means that the <hi>Bishop</hi> gave him this as the only, or the principal reason, he speaks without truth, and against his Conscience; for the first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reason the <hi>Bishop</hi> gave him for his forbidding him to preach, was (as he well knows, and as the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> will witness against him) <hi>His Preaching before without License, having no Cure of his own to Preach to</hi>; whereunto when he replyed, <hi>I had promised to give him such a License as the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>had given him, viz.</hi> Quàm diu se bene gereret, &amp; durante beneplacito, I rejoyn'd, <hi>That it was true indeed, I had once promised to give him such a License, but withal, that it was as true, that first I had never promised to give him a License, if he took it before I gave it him; and that for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of his, I had now forbidden him to Preach any more.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That I knew more of him since then I did at that time; for,</hi> first, <hi>I had been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61479:7"/>
informed, that he had abused the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<hi>'s favour by preaching factiously, though not in the City, yet in the Diocess of</hi> London, <hi>and I named the place to him</hi>: Secondly, <hi>that since that promise of mine (which cannot be supposed to be other then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional) I my self had heard him at a Conference in the</hi> Savoy, <hi>maintaining such a Position as was destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Legislative Power both in God and Man</hi> (meaning the Assertion before spoken of, <hi>viz. That the enjoyning of things lawful by lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if they might by Accident be the cause of sin, was sinful) which Assertion of his with the horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it I told him then at</hi> Worcester, <hi>I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told him of at the</hi> Savoy <hi>openly, and before all the company that was at the Conference</hi>; whereunto all that he replyed at my second telling him at <hi>Worcester,</hi> was, <hi>that he had used some distinctions to salve that Assertion from those consequences</hi>; but what those distinctions were he did not then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as Dr. <hi>Warmstry</hi> can witness) though in this printed address of his to his friends of <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> he saith, <hi>he did tell the</hi> Bishop <hi>in what a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and restrained sense he and his brethren under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that Assertion</hi>; which whether they did or no, will appear by and by, when we shall more nearly examine his printed Narrative as to that particular. In the mean time, though I said indeed that one that held and was likely to teach such Doctrines, was not to be suffered to Preach unto the People,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61479:8"/>
yet this was not then alledged by me as the cause or crime for which I had forbidden him to Preach, (for that, as I said before, was <hi>His presuming to Preach without a License</hi>) but only as a reason why I should have thought my self not obliged by the promise I had formerly made him, to give him a License, though he had not otherwise forfeited his Claim to that promise by Preaching without, or before he had it. Lastly, He might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred another reason I gave him why I could not have made good that promise, namely, <hi>those principles of Treason and Rebellion publickly extant in his Books, which I had not taken notice of till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the making of that promise, and which till he should recant in as publick a manner, I thought my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Conscience not to suffer him to Preach in my Diocess</hi>; whereunto his Answer was, <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he had said or done in that kind, was pardoned by the Act of Indempnity: True,</hi> said I, <hi>so far as the King can pardon it, that is, in regard of its corporal punishment here in this world, but it is God that must pardon the guilt or obligation to punishment in the world to come, which he will not without Repentance, and it is the Church that must pardon the scandal, which she cannot do neither without an honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends made her by publick Confession and Recantation.</hi> I could tell Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his ear likewise, that in excuse of his Rebellious Principles formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, he said, <hi>That now the Parliament had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61479:8"/>
where the Soveraign Power was, he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it and submit to it,</hi> as if the King owed his Soveraignty to the declaration of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is as false as Rebellious, and as dangerous a principle as any of his former, however by what hath been said, it appears that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meant to impose upon his credulous friends at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> and upon his unwary Readers, by making them believe that was the only cause for which the <hi>Bishop</hi> forbad him to Preach, which was neither the only, nor the principal cause, why the <hi>Bishop</hi> did so, nor indeed, to speak properly, any cause of it at all; for the only proper cause for which the <hi>Bishop</hi> forbad him to Preach, was <hi>His Preaching before without the</hi> Bishops <hi>License</hi>; the other which he pretends, together with the third which he conceals, were properly and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly the Causes why the <hi>Bishop</hi> would not take off that prohibition, or why he would not give him a License to Preach for the future, either at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> or in any other place of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, until he should publickly retract that Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had openly asserted at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and should publickly renounce likewise those seditious and rebellious principles which are published in his Books. And this is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth of what passed betwixt me and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at <hi>Worcester,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preached at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> where whether I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61479:9"/>
defamed him, or he, by saying so, hath not grosly defamed me, will appear by that which follows; wherein that I might neither be deceived my self, nor deceive others, I have not trusted to my own memory only, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he doth to his, but I have consulted with Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> two of the three that managed that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his <hi>Assistants,</hi> and have seen that Assertion in the same sense that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> disclaimes it, affirmed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself under his own hand.</p>
            <p>I found Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> engaged in a Dispute, and I perceived that to keep himself off from that part of the argument which would press near to the merits of the Cause, he had often affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his <hi>Answers, That the Command of a most lawful Act was sinful; if that Act commanded might prove to any one a sin</hi> per accidens. This Assertion I did then and there presently and openly lay to his charge; and when he denied it (as it was most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with him immediately to deny what he had before affirmed) the answers which he had delivered written with his own hand were produced, and upon the reading of them, the Justice of my charge was most apparent; whereupon I urged him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this Assertion of his was not only false, but destructive of all Authority Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as not only denying all power to the Church of making Canons Ecclesiastical for the better
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61479:9"/>
ordering and governing of the Church, but also taking away all Legislative Power from the King and Parliament, and even from God himself: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at the same time my reason for what I said, which was briefly this, because there can be no Act so good of it self, but may prove <hi>per Accidens,</hi> or by Accident, a sin; And therefore, if to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an Act which may prove <hi>per accidens</hi> a sin, be a sin, then every Command must be a sin. And if to command be a sin, then certainly God can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nothing, because God cannot sin; and by the same reason, Kings, Parliaments and Churches ought not to command any thing, because they ought not to sin.</p>
            <p>Thus far I then charged Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and to this Charge he gave then no satisfaction. Neither can I yet conceive it possible to give any satisfaction, but by one of these two wayes, either by proving that the Assertion, with which I charged him, was never his, or by shewing that the consequence I urged, is not good; neither of which was he then able to do: and by what he hath now been pleased to publish, it is more then probable that he can never perform either of them.</p>
            <p>For in his bold, but weak Apology, he doth not so much as pretend to shew any Invalidity in my Inference, and for the Assertion with which I charged him, he denies it so poorly, and goes about to prove another instead of it so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61479:10"/>
that he may without any injury be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to yield it. He saith indeed now, <hi>That he told us that his Assertion made not every Evil Accident to be such as made an Imposition unlawfull.</hi> But whether he ever said so before this time or no, it was then clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved that he did assert, <hi>That an Act for nothing else, but because it might be</hi> per accidens <hi>a sin, could not be commanded without sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now in his publick appeal, he hath taken a strange way to wipe off all this, for he makes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brief Narration, and most notoriously imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and then sayes, <hi>You know my Crime,</hi> as if that were all that had been, or could be objected against him. Besides, in the relating of this short Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he relies wholly upon his own memory; not so much as endeavouring to satisfie himself, before he presumed to satisfie others. How his memory may be in other things I know not, in this if it hath been faithfull to him, he hath been very unfaithful to others. He relates an Answer in what terms he pleaseth, and brings one Proposition, as made by his Opponents in what terms he thinks fit, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this answer to that Proposition he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth as all his Crime; whereas his answer was far more largely given, and that to several Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in several Syllogisms, of which the Proposition which he relateth was but one, or rather none; so that he hath most shamefully abused his Disciples at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> with a short and partial Narrative of his fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61479:10"/>As for his <hi>Concurring with Learned Reverend Brethren,</hi> (which he would pretend to be part of his Crime) and his invidious insinuation, <hi>That they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to Preach for it, though he be,</hi> the reason is clear. He had often delivered this Assertion before the company, his Brethren had not; the words of the Answer were written with his hand, not with his Brethrens. His Brethren had several times decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves not to be of his Opinion (as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when he affirmed (<hi>That a man might live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any actual sin</hi>) And therefore we were so just as not to charge them with this Assertion; especially considering they did shew themselves unwilling to enter upon this dispute, and seemed to like much better another way tending to an amicable and fair compliance, which was wholly frustrated by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> furious eagerness to engage in a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>All his discourse which followeth (after his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Narrative) in justification of himself, is grounded first upon a misreporting of his own Assertion; Secondly, upon the dissembling of the several Propositions, to which his answer was so often applied; Thirdly, upon his pretending <hi>That he sayes more now, than that which had offended formerly</hi>; which is most palpably false, and in all probability (if he have any memory) against his own Conscience. And this will presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the vanity and impertinency of all those
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61479:11"/>
specious instances which he brings to mollifie his Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Command a Navy to Sea</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is lawfull but if it were foreseen that they would fall into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hand, or were like to perish by any accident, it were a sin to send them.</hi> Is this more then he said before, or is it any defence of his Assertion at all? It is not certainly, because the Opponents had put it expresly in the Proposition; <hi>That the Act in it self lawful, was to be supposed to have nothing consequent, which the Commander of it ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against</hi>; and yet being so stated, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmed, <hi>That if the Act might be</hi> per accidens <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Commanding of it was sin.</hi> Now certainly the falling of a Navy into the Enemies hand, or the perishing of it any other way, <hi>if foreseen,</hi> ought to be provided against by the Commander; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> answer did import, That if any Prince did Command a Fleet to Sea, though he did not foresee the Fleet would fall into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand, or perish any other way, yet if by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it miscarried that or any other way, which he could not foresee, or were not bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against, the very Command at first was sin.</p>
            <p>The same reason nullifies his instances of the <hi>poyson,</hi> and the <hi>knife,</hi> because the sin in selling them supposeth the murder of the buyer to be foreseen, and consequently that the seller ought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61479:11"/>
to prevent it; but if he will speak in correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to his former Answer, he must shew, that though the seller do not foresee that the buyer will use the poyson or the knife, to his own, or any other mans destruction, yet if by any Accident or mistake, either the buyer, or any other perish by the poyson or the knife, the Seller is guilty of his death.</p>
            <p>His instance of <hi>setting a City on fire, or putting Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder under the Parliament House when the King and Parliament are there,</hi> is of the same nature, and needs no addition of answer but onely this, that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in a sense too true, hath been very instrumental in setting the City on fire, and in adding powder to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The rest which follows betrayes the same weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because the inconveniences are urged <hi>upon a Duty to prohibit them,</hi> and his answer did charge the Command with sin in respect of such Accidents, as it was no part of the Commanders Duty to provide against. It is therefore most certain, that no one of those instances singly, nor all of them joyntly have any force in any measure to justifie that Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did maintain, and whereof he is accused.</p>
            <p>As for that last instance, <hi>which was</hi> (saith he) <hi>the matter of the Dispute,</hi> and which he urgeth in this manner, (<hi>Suppose it never so lawful of it self to Kneel in the reception of the Sacrament, if it be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61479:12"/>
imposed by a penalty, that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an Accident of the Command, and maketh it by Accident sinfull to the Commander</hi>) he is manifestly guilty of a double falsification: First, in pretending the matter in dispute, <hi>was the imposition of kneeling at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>; when this very matter was expresly rejected in the very beginning of the dispute, as belonging to the <hi>Canons,</hi> not the Common-Prayer-Book, the lawfulness of which <hi>Canons</hi> the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had no authority to debate, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows, that his Argument was denied upon that ground. The second falsification is yet greater, in urging the penalty to make the Command sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when his Answer did charge the Command with sin, without any relation to the punishment; and when the Proposition he replied to was so framed, that all unjust penalties were <hi>in terminis</hi> expresly excluded, even then I say he charged the Command of a lawful Act with sin, if it were otherwise by Accident sinful; though by the way I must not grant that the penalty imposed by the Law for not kneeling at the Receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (namely the not admitting of such as will not kneel, at the receiving of it) <hi>is incomparably greater then the offence</hi>; for the greatness of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in such cases, and as it stands in relation to such or such a penalty appointed for it, is not to be measured by the Quality of the Act considered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61479:12"/>
in it self, but by the more or less mischievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences it is likely to produce, if men be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd from such an Act by such a penalty; for example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a Souldier is hang'd for stealing of a Hen, or for taking away any thing of never so little a value, without paying for it, no wise man will blame the <hi>General</hi> for such a severity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if he did not do so, every one would take what he pleased, which would discourage the Countrey from bringing in provisions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the whole army would be ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. And as the Martial, so the Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws likewise in commanding or forbidding any thing under such or such a penalty, have an eye not so much to the merit of the Action it self, as to the more or less danger of the Publick in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; whence it comes to pass, that a less evil may sometimes most justly be forbidden under a more severe penalty then a greater, because the former may be of much more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence then the latter; so that he that will judge rightly, and impartially of the equity or iniquity of appointing or inflicting such or such a penalty, he must not so much consider the quality of the Transgression singly in it self, nor whether it be from weakness, or wilfulness in the party transgressing (as he is this or that individual person) but rather he must consider what the <hi>Consequence</hi> would be of the breach of such a command if it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61479:13"/>
were not prevented by such a penalty, alwayes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Command it self to be lawful, and that the transgressor of it is to be considered as he stands in relation to that whole Body, whether Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or Ecclesiastical, whereof he is a part; and that the whole is not to be endangered out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and indulgence to some particulars, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently it would be, if every man were left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do what seem'd best in his own eyes, even in the Ceremonials and Circumstantials of Gods Worship; for considering the pride and self-love that is in humane nature, which makes men so overvalue their own practises and their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that they are alwayes apt to undervalue those that will not conform to them, as it alwayes hath been, so it alwayes will be; he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippeth God one way, will either judge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him that worshippeth God another way; he that <hi>Kneeleth</hi> at the Sacrament, will be thought to be Idolatrous or Superstitious by him that <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> and him that kneeleth not will be thought wilful, or weak, by him that kneeleth. And thus from diversity grows dislike, from dislike enmity, from enmity opposition, and from opposition, first Separation and Schism in the <hi>Church,</hi> and then Faction, Sedition and Rebellion in the State; which is a progress very natural, and I would we had not found it to be so by our own experience; for as the safety of a State depends upon the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61479:13"/>
safety of the Church, so the safety of the Church depends upon Unity, and Unity it self depends upon Uniformity, and Uniformity there cannot be, as long as there is diversity or divers waies of worship in the same Church, which will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, unless it be lawful for publick Authority to oblige all particulars to one way of publick worship, and that under such penalties, as the Law-givers shall think necessary to prevent the disturbing of the publick Peace and safety; the preservation whereof being the main end of all Laws, and of all penalties appointed by Law, those practises that are either intentionally or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially destructive to this End, may be, and no doubt ought to be restrain'd by severe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is not therefore the <hi>not kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament, but the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church, and the endangering of the Peace and Safety of the whole, which our Laws punish by not admitting such unto the Sacrament, as will not, or perhaps dare not kneel at it; for as they will not endanger the Peace of their Consciences for the Churches sake; so it becomes the Law-givers not to endanger the Churches and the States Peace for their sakes: And surely when there is a necessity of the yielding of the one or of the other, it is much more reasonable that a part should yield unto the whole, then the whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a part, especially when the whole cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61479:14"/>
yield without endangering it self, and with it self even those themselves also, that, will they nill they, must be involved in the ruine of it; as the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have found by their own experience also, who by their groundless and needless sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from us, have given example and ground enough for others to separate from them, till by dividing and subdividing from one another, there was nothing of Uniformity, or unity, or order, or decency left in that <hi>Church,</hi> which was formerly (and I hope by the Prudence and Piety of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority will be now again) the Glory and Pattern of all other Protestant and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in the world; of which, by the way, there is not one which doth not use as great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity for the preserving of Unity by Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as we do, even in this particular; for do not the Protestant Churches in <hi>France</hi> enjoyn <hi>Standing,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Holland, Scotland,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> that follow <hi>Calvin</hi> enjoyn <hi>Sitting,</hi> and the Churches that follow <hi>Luther</hi> there and elswhere enjoyn <hi>Kneeling</hi> as we do, and all of them upon the same penalty of not receiving it otherwise? And is it not as lawful for our Church, as for all other Protestant, and all other Christian Churches, to require of her Children the like conformity to her Laws under the like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty for the same end, and to prevent the same danger? <hi>Yes</hi> (replyed Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> when this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61479:14"/>
was asked him) <hi>just as lawful,</hi> that is, <hi>not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at all, such an injunction upon such a penalty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinful, wheresoever and by whomsoever it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</hi> O happy <hi>England,</hi> that hath such an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus</hi> as is worthy to censure all the Churches of the world, whose Catholick practise (if it cross Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> opinion) must presently without more adoe be Condemn'd as sinful, and all the world must be Lyars rather then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must not be justified in his sayings. You have before seen the ingenuity and veracity, you now see the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and the modesty of the Man; and indeed in proportion, of the whole party, for <hi>crimine ab uno,—Disce omnes.</hi> But doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the rest of his perswasion think indeed, that it is so great and grievous a punishment to be kept from the Sacrament when men will not receive it in that way and upon those terms that the Church offers? if they do, why then do they deny it to so many that hunger and thirst after it, whensoever either by reason of Age, or Lameness, or sickness, or some other bodily infirmity they cannot come to Church for it? especially when the Catholick Church in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of the first General Councel commands it be given even to those that are Excommunicate, if they desire it when they are in <hi>Extremis,</hi> or going out of the world. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why have they suffered so many whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in <hi>England</hi> under their charge to have been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61479:15"/>
without a Communion so many years together, as I am credibly informed they have? Thirdly, why do they reject those from the Sacrament, that will not come before hand to them to be examined by them, there being neither precept nor practise in the Gospel, nor Canon in the Church, either to warrant them to require it, or to oblige the People to submit to it upon any such penalty? I am sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he chides those of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for coming ignorantly to the Sacrament, and for behaving themselves profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Sacrament, that which he prescribes for avoiding the same or the like faults for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not that every man should come, and be examined by the Minister, but that <hi>every man should examine himself before he eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup</hi>; And yet I will not deny but that every man before he Communicates ought to be well Catechis'd and instructed by the Minister, and thereby enabled to examine himself the better; nor will I deny neither but that every man may and ought in Case of scruple of mind or trouble of conscience to advise with, and to be advised by him that hath the cure of his Soul; but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man as often as he intends to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament should be obliged under the penalty of being rejected from it, to come and to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Minister, this is that which I utterly deny, and which I take to be the same thing in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61479:15"/>
other words with that of <hi>Auricular Confession</hi>; so that they who exact the one, have no reason to condemn the other, unless it be because they would ingross it wholly unto themselves: Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if refusing the Sacrament to those that will not kneel, when the Church enjoyns it, be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty so far transcending the offence, how much more must the same penalty transcend the offence, when there is indeed no offence at all? for where there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there can be no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where there is no Law there can be no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and consequently there being no Law of God nor Man that requires all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants to be pre-examined by the Minister, those that are refused the Sacrament because they will not be pre-examined, are punished with the same punishment which they complain of, for no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at all. And therefore <hi>si maximè digna es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem</hi> (may our Church say) <hi>ista contumelia, indigni vos, qui faceretis tamen</hi>; for, <hi>Who art thou O Man that judgest another?</hi> nay, that judgest thy Mother, <hi>when thou doest the same,</hi> or worse, <hi>thing,</hi> then those are for which thou condemnest her? And how can any man of reason be so scrupulous, as to quit his Calling, rather then deny the Sacrament to those that will not receive it kneeling, when the Church commands it should neither be taken nor given otherwise, and yet make no scruple at all of denying it to whole Parishes? of denying it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61479:16"/>
to those that cannot come to Church for it, though desirous of it, and qualified for it, and such as have most need of it to strengthen their faith in their last Agony? and lastly, of denying it to such as refuse to be pre-examined by them, and all this without any command or warrant from Gods Word, and contrary to the Command and Custome of Gods Church? whereby it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that either they do not think the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament of so great importance, as indeed it is, nor the denying of it so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or punishment as they pretend it to be; or else that they would have every Minister to be a Monarch or Soveraign Law-giver in his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and this indeed is that they would fain be at, now they have lost their hopes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Kingdome; for you see by what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adds, that if they may not be suffered to give or deny the Sacrament to whom they please, and in effect to do what they list in their own Parishes, they threaten to quit their Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he calls <hi>being Ejected because they dare not put away all that will not kneel at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: And this menace they often repeat upon all occasions, as if they were the only men that could carry on the work of the Lord; or as if the Church must needs sink and perish, if it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such Pillars as they are to uphold it. But (thanks be to God for it) the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61479:16"/>
is not yet (notwithstanding all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to that purpose) reduced to so very ill a condition, that she cannot subsist without them; whereas the truth is, she cannot subsist with them, as long as they continue to be what they have been, the sowers and fomenters of Schism in the Church, and sedition in the State; and as long as they continue to do as they have done in humouring, and hardning, and confirming the people in their obstinate standing out against the lawful commands of their Superiours; which they would never have done at all, if these men had not at first infused into them these scruples. And therefore as God asked <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, How came you to know that you are naked?</hi> so if I should ask those poor souls whom those sly and subtle Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents have beguiled and seduced, How came you to know that you shall sin against God if you obey the Orders of the Church in general? or particularly how came you to know, <hi>That it is against the Canons of the General Councels, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years practise of the Church to Kneel in the Act of receiving</hi>? Did you or can you your selves read those General Councels? Did you or can you examine so many hundred years practise of the Church as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks of? What an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer can they make to these demands, but that which <hi>Eve</hi> made unto God? <hi>The Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled me, and I did eat</hi>; Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or some
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61479:17"/>
such Godly and Learned men as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, did tell us so, and we believed them: But what if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieve that himself which he would have you believe? For first he would have you believe that there is great reverence and respect to be given (as indeed there is) to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>General Councels,</hi> and to the <hi>Catholick practise</hi> of the Primitive Church; but doth he himself believe this? if he do, why did he so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously oppose that which all General Councels approve of and confirm? I mean the Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops</hi> in the sense wherein it is asserted and practised in our Church? Or why did he perswade Subjects to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>Soveraign</hi>? which he knows to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine and practise of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians for many hundred years more then he speaks of. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have you believe, that Kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament is forbidden by <hi>General Councels,</hi> and contrary to the custome and <hi>practise</hi> of the Ancient Church, which I am affraid he doth not believe himself; I am sure there is no convincing reason to make him believe it; for it is not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches injunction to stand when they prayed betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> that will prove they were forbidden to Kneel when they received; especially if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> opinion be true, <hi>that we are not to be in the Act of Praying,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61479:17"/>
when we are in the Act of receiving</hi>; But if we may pray (as no doubt we may and ought to pray) in the Act of Receiving, then suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ancient Injunction of the Chuch to stand at Prayer upon Sundaies betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide</hi> to be still in force, yet all the rest of the year we are to kneel when we Pray, and consequently when we Receive, though there were no particular command of our own Church for it. Besides Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Injunction of the Church was but Temporary, till the people were sufficiently confirmed in the Doctrine and Belief of the Resurrection; for if it had been of perpetual obligation, and were still in force, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must needs condemn the whole present Church of God for kneeling when they pray betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whisontide,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he must most of all condemn himself and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for not standing when they receive, if at least that Injunction be to be understood of Receiving, as well as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which if it be not, then is it urged by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against us to no purpose, as indeed it is; And therefore no doubt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not believe himself what he would have others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, when he presseth that occasional tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary injunction of the Church for <hi>standing</hi> against <hi>kneeling</hi>; which if it be of force, must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his own practise of <hi>sitting,</hi> as well as ours of <hi>kneeling.</hi> The like may be said of Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61479:18"/>
alleadged by him also; for would he, or would he not have his Disciples believe that they are obliged to do as Christ did? if he would not have them believe so, why doth he press them with Christ example? if he would have them believe so, I demand again whether he doth believe it himself or no? if he do not, it is plain he is a seducer of the <hi>People</hi>; but if he do believe it, he must needs condemn the <hi>French Presbyterians</hi> for <hi>standing,</hi> as well as the <hi>English Protestants</hi> for <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; nay he must needs condemn himself and all other Christians in the world for not doing as Christ did in point of time, I mean, for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and receiving the Sacrament in the Evening as Christ did, as well as he condemns us for not doing as Christ did in point of gesture; unless he can prove (which I think he cannot) that we are of necessity to follow Christs example in one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the same action, and not in another, and in that circumstance which is lesse, but not in that which is more material; for certainly that circumstance which denominates the action (as the circumstance of time doth the Lords Supper) is most material; and yet that circumstance by the consent of all Christendome is altered from the Evening to the Morning, and so was the gesture or posture of receiving also, and that upon most just and weighty reasons, till those that delight in change would needs have it otherwise, and that perhaps for no other reason but because they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61479:18"/>
found it setled in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christs example, who in things indifferent in their own nature conformed his practise to that of the Church in which he lived, though varying in some circumstances from the primitive Institution; and particularly in this very action, from which they press us with Christs example. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Christ and his Disciples sate at the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, (though it be uncertain whether he or they sate at the giving and receiving the Sacrament o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no, for it was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>after he had supped,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Luk</hi> 22.20.) Howsoever it is certain, I say, that Christ and his Disciples sat when they eat the Passover, and this no doubt was according to the custome of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church at that time; but it is as certain that this was not the manner according to the first institution of it, which was to eat it <hi>standing,</hi> as you may read <hi>Exod</hi> 12.11. So that to urge Christs example against us, is to urge Christs example against himself; for as we conform our selves to the Churches order and custome of our times in receiving the Communion otherwise in point of gesture, then perhaps it was received at the first institution; so Christ and his Apostles conforming themselves to the order and practise of the Church of their times, did celebrate the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over otherwise then according to the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was to be celebrated in point of gesture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; thereby perhaps intending to teach us, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61479:19"/>
as long as the Essentials of Doctrine and worship (which are unalterable) are preserved, we are not to separate from the Church, or quarrel with our Superiours, if those things that are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alterable, be not alwayes and in all places just the same that they were at first, because there may be very just cause for the alteration of them; and whether there be such a cause or no in this and the like particulars, it is the Church that is to be the Judge. So that there is nothing that can be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted either from the Canons of the Councels, or from the practise of the Primitive Church, no nor from Christs own example, that can prove kneeling at the Sacrament to be a sin; neither doth Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself believe it to be sinful, for if he did, he would not say (as he does. Pag. 411. of his five Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations) <hi>that he himself would kneel rather then disturb the peace of the Church, or be deprived of its Communion.</hi> In which words he confesseth, First, that Kneeling at the Sacrament is not sinful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, Secondly, that not to Kneel when it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is to disturb the Peace of the Church, and Thirdly, that the imposing of it upon penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of the Communin, is an effectual means to make those that otherwise would not kneel, to conform to it; and consequently, that the imposing of it upon such a penalty is prudent and rational, and whatsoever is prudent and rational cannot be unlawful; so that not onely the Act of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61479:19"/>
Kneeling it self, but the imposition of it by lawful Authority must needs be lawful. Neither indeed would the People scruple at the imposition, if they had not been taught that the thing it self were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, or if Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> would yet teach them to believe what he himself believes, namely, that it is lawful; which with what conscience he can refuse to do I know not; for sure he is obliged to teach them obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e not to Divine Authority only, but to humane authority also in all lawful things; and not to let them go on in such an erroneous opinion, <hi>as will disturb the Peace, and deprive them of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church,</hi> and consequently make them sin against God and man and their own Souls. Of which sin of theirs he must needs be a partaker in a great measure, if he do not perswade them from it; seeing (as he himself saith) <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet.</hi> And what <hi>Power</hi> he hath to lead or mislead those kind of men, <hi>their</hi> venturing to kill and be killed in a most unrighteous quarrel (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perswasion) hath more then enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated during the time of the late troubles; unlesse he will say that he hath conjured up a Spirit that he cannot lay. Howsoever by how much the more fault he hath been in misleading them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, by so much the more zealous he should be to reduce them into the right way hereafter; which if he and the rest of his Brethren can do (as I am confident they can if they will) they will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61479:20"/>
make some amends for the mischief they have done and then there will be no fear or danger of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters being Ejected for their tenderness towards the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor of the Ejecting of any of the People from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio of the Church for not conforming themselves to the Orders and Commands of it,</hi> and consequently, there will be no Schisms or Divisions amongst us, when we shall all worship the same God the same way. But if they will not do this (which by all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations humane and Divine they are bound to do) for my part I know no better way for undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and reducing of the People, then by removing such Ministers, and then we shall see when the blowing of those boisterous winds ceaseth, whether the waves will not be still or no: In the mean time, I hope the removing of <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>seditious,</hi> will not necessitate the introducing of <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now (to use Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words) I think there is <hi>no man to be found on earth, that hath the ordinary reason of a Man, but will confess, That it is indeed destructive of all Government and Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, to Assert</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did Assert) <hi>the command of a thing in it self lawful by lawful Authority, under no unjust punishment, with no evil circumstance,

which the Commander can foresee or ought to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> (for all these pre-cautions were expesly put in the proposition which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied) <hi>is a sinful Command, for no other reason, but because the Act Commanded may be by Accident a sin.</hi>

            <p>Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then know, and (if he have inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity enough) confess, that the words I spoke (as to this particular) were <hi>words of truth,</hi> and <hi>words of charity</hi> also, as being intended and spoken to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to undeceive that People, who by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his person too much in admiration (as if he could neither deceive nor be deceived) had been so long and so dangerously misl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Neither could I expect less from the boldness of this man and that Party, who have had the confidence publickly to own the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Covenant, even since it hath been condemned to be burnt by the Parliament. And truely I see no reason why all those Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which have been Preach'd and Printed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Covenant, or to maintain the same or worse principles of Sedition then are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, should not be burnt also. Nay I dare be bold to say, that if the Authors of such Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were not still of the same opinions (and if they be, God deliver us from such Preachers) if they were not still, I say, of the same opinions, but did truely repent of them, and were heartly sorry

for the horrible mischief they have done by them, they would with those converted Exorcists, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. bring all those Conjuring Books of theirs together, and to save the Hang-man a labour, would publickly burn them all with their own hands, that so, though by the burning of their works they may perhaps suffer some loss in point of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with some of their Disciples, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may be saved, but so as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15.

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61479:23"/>2. If God permit Princes to turn so wicked as to be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of governing so as is consistent with the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he permits them to depose themselves, <hi>Thes.</hi> 136.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Providence statedly disable him that was the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign from the executing of the Law, protecting the just, and other ends of Government, it makes him an uncapable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the power, and so deposeth him. <hi>Thes.</hi> 137.</p>

               <p n="5">V. If the person <hi>(viz. the Soveraign)</hi> be justly dispossest, as by a lawful War, in which he loseth his right, especially if he violate the Constitution and enter into a Military state against the People themselves, and by them be conquered, they are not obliged to restore him, unless there be some special obligation upon them besides their Allegiance. <hi>Thes.</hi> 145.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If the person dispossess'd, though it were unjustly, do afterwards become uncapable of Government, it is not the Duty of his Subjects to seek his restitution. <hi>Thes.</hi> 146. No not although (<hi>saith he</hi>) the incapacity be but accidental, as if he cannot be restored but by the Armes of the Enemies of God or of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If an Army (of Neighbours, Inhabitants, or whoever) do (though injuriously) expel the Soveraign, and resolve to ruine the Commonwealth, rather then he shall be restored; and if the Commonwealth may prosper without his restauration, it is the Duty of such an injured Prince for the Common good to resign his Government, and if he will not, the people ought to judge him as made uncapable by Providence, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61479:23"/>
not to seek his restitution to the apparent ruine of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, <hi>Thes.</hi> 147.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where by the way we are to note, he makes the people judge of this and all other incapacities of the Prince, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when or for what he is to be Depos'd, or not Restored by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If therefore the rightful Governour be so long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd, that the Commonwealth can be no longer without, but to the apparent hazard of its ruine, we (<hi>that is, we the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or we the Rebels that dispossess'd him</hi>) are to judge that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath dispossess'd the former, and presently to consent to another. <hi>Thes.</hi> 149.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. When the People are without a Governour, it may be the duty or such as have most strength, <hi>ex charitate,</hi> to protect the rest from injury. <hi>Thes.</hi> 150. <hi>and consequently they are to submit themselves to the Parliament, or to that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which deposed or dispossess'd or murdered the rightful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. Providence by Conquest or other means doth use so to qualifie some persons above others for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the place is void, that no other persons shall be capable competitors, and the persons (<hi>doth not he mean the</hi> Cromwells?) shall be as good as named by Providence, whom the people are bound by God to choose, or consent to, so that they are usually brought under a divine obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to submit to such or such, and take them for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, before those persons have an actual right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. <hi>Thes.</hi> 151.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Any thing that is a sufficient sign of the will of God, that this is the person, by whom we must be Governed is enough (as joyned to Gods Laws) to oblige us to consent and obey him as our Governour. <hi>Thes.</hi> 153.</p>

                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61479:24"/>XII. When God doth not notably declare any person or persons qualified above others, there the people must judge as well as they are able according to Gods general rules. <hi>Thes.</hi> 157.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>And yet</hi> All the people have not this right of choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Governours, but commonly a part of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be compelled to consent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Those that are known enemies of the Common Good in the chiefest parts of it, are unmeet to Govern or choose Governours, but such are multitudes of ungodly vicious men. <hi>Pag.</hi> 174. <hi>So that if those that are strongest (though fewest) call themselves the Godly Party, all others besides themselves are to be excluded from Governing or choosing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.

               <p n="15">XV. If a People that by Oath and Duty are obliged to a Soveraign, shall sinfully dispossess him, and contrary to their Covenants, choose and Covenant with another, they may be obliged by their latter Covenant notwithstanding their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and particular subjects that consented not in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their former Covenants, may yet be obliged by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their latter choice to the person whom they choose. <hi>Thes.</hi> 181.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. If a Nation injuriously deprive themselves of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prince, the hurt will be their own, and they punish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;

but if it be necessarily to their welfare, it is no injury to him. But a King that by war will seek reparations from the body of the People, doth put himself into an hostile State, and tells them actually that he looks to his own good more then theirs, and bids them take him for their Enemy, and so defend themselves if they can. <hi>Pag.</hi> 424.</p>

                  <hi>HE denies the government of</hi> England <hi>to be Monarchical in these words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The real Soveraignty here amongst us was in King, Lords, and Commons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 72.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As to them that argue from the Oath of Supremacy and the title given the King,<note place="margin">He might have referr'd them to himself, pag. 460. where he gives the same answer to the same objection.</note> I refer them (<hi>saith Mr.</hi> Baxter) to Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Hobb</hi>'s Politicks, where he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61479:25"/>
sheweth that the Title is often given to the single Person for the honour of the Commonwealth and his encouragement, because he hath an eminent interest: but will not prove the whole Soveraignty to be in him: and the Oath excludeth all others from without, not those whose interest is implied as conjunct with his— The eminent dignity and interest of the King above others allowed the name of a Monarchy or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Commonwealth, though indeed the Soveraignty was mix'd in the hands of the Lords and Commons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 88.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>He calls it</hi> a false supposition, 1. That the Soveraign power was only in the King, and so that it was an absolute Monarchy. 2. That the Parliament had but only the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Lawes, and that they were Enacted only by the Kings Authority upon their request. 3. That the power of Armes and of War and Peace was in the King alone. And therefore (<hi>saith he</hi>) those that argue from these false suppositions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Parliament being Subjects, may not take up Arms without him, and that it is Rebellion to resist him; and most of this they gather from the Oath of Supremacy, and from the Parliaments calling of themselves his Subjects; but their grounds <hi>(saith he)</hi> are sandy, and their superstructure false. <hi>Pag.</hi> 459, <hi>&amp;</hi> 460.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us,</hi> that though the Parliament are Subjects in one capacity, yet have they their part in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty also in their higher capacity, <hi>Ibid. And upon this false and trayterous supposition he endeavours to justifie the late Rebellion, and his own more then ordinary activeness in it. For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Where the Soveraignty (<hi>saith he</hi>) is distributed into several hands (as the Kings and Parliaments) and the King invades the others part, they may lawfully defend their own by war, and the Subject lawfully assist them, yea though the power of the Militia be expresly given to the King, unless it be also exprest that it shall not be in the other. <hi>Thes.</hi> 363.</p>
               <p>The conclusion <hi>(saith he)</hi> needs no proof, because Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61479:25"/>
as such, hath the power of Arms and of the Laws themselves. The Law that saith the King shall have the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> supposeth it to be against Enemies and not against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, nor them that have part of the Soveraignty with him. To resist him here is not to resist power, but usurpation and private will; in such a case the Parliament is no more to be resisted then he. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. If the King raise Warre against such a Parliament upon their Declaration of the dangers of the Common-wealth, the people are to take it as raised against the Common-wealth. <hi>Thes.</hi> 358.</p>
               <p>And in that case (saith he) the King may not only be resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ceaseth to be a King, and entreth into a state of Warre with the people. <hi>Thes.</hi> 368.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Again, if a Prince that hath not the whole Soveraignty be conquered by a Senate that hath the other part, and that in a just defensive Warre, that Senate cannot assume the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, but supposeth that government in <hi>specie</hi> to remain, and therefore another King must be chosen, if the former be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable. (<hi>Thes.</hi> 374.) <hi>as he tells us, he is,</hi> by ceasing to be King, <hi>in the immediately precedent</hi> Thes.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>And yet in the Preface to this Book he tells us that</hi> the King withdrawing (<hi>so he calls the murdering of one King and the casting off of another</hi>) the Lords and Commons ruled alone; <hi>was not this to change the</hi> species <hi>of the Government? Which in the immediate words before he had affirmed</hi> to be in King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which constitution (<hi>saith he</hi>) we were sworn, and sworn, and sworn again to be faithful to and to defend. <hi>And yet speaking of that Parliament which contrary to their Oaths changed this Government</hi> by ruling alone, and taking upon them the Supremacy,<note place="margin">Vid.

                  <hi>What then was he that deposed them? one would think Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>should have called him a Traytor, but he calls him in the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> the Lord Protector, <hi>adding,</hi> That he did prudently, pious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faithfully, and to his immortal honour exercise the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>which he left to his Son,</hi> to whom (<hi>as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>saith pag.</hi> 481.) he is bound to submit as set over us by God, and to obey for conscience sake, and to behave himself as a Loyal Subject towards him, because (<hi>as he saith in the same place</hi>) a full and free Parliament had owned him: <hi>thereby implying, That a maimed and manacled House of Commons, without King and Lords, and notwithstanding the violent expulsion of the secluded Members</hi> were a full and free Parliament; <hi>and consequently that if such a Parliament should have taken Arms against the King he must have sided with them. Yea, though they had been never so much in fault, and though they had been the beginners of the Warre, for he tells us in plain and express terms,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That if he had known the Parliament had been the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of the Warre and in most fault, yet the ruine of the Trustees and Representatives, and so of all the security of the Nation being a punishment greater then any faults of theirs against the King could deserve from him, their faults could not disoblige him (<hi>meaning himself</hi>) from defending the Common-wealth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 480.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that he might do this lawfully, and with a good Conscience, he seems to be so confident, that in his Preface, he makes as it were a challenge, saying, that</hi> if any man can prove that the King was the highest power in the time of those Divisions, and that he had power to make that war which he made, he will offer his head to Justice as a Rebel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As if in those times of Division the King had lost or forfeited his Soveraignty, and the Parliament had not only a part, but the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty in themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Finally Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us, Pag.</hi> 486. That having often searched into his heart, whether he did lawfully engage into
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61479:26"/>
the War or not, and whether he did lawfully encourage so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands to it; he tells us, I say, that the issue of all his search was but this,— That he cannot yet see that he was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the main cause, nor dares he repent of it, nor forbear doing the same, if it were to do again in the same state of things. <hi>He tells us indeed in the same place,</hi> that if he could be convinced he had sinned in this matter, he would as gladly make a publick recantation, as he would eat or drink: <hi>which seeing he hath not yet done, it is evident he is still of the same minde, and consequently would upon the same occasion do the same things,</hi> viz. <hi>fight, and encourage as many thousands as he could to fight against the King for any thing that calls it self, or which he is pleased to call</hi> a full and Free Parliament: <hi>as likewise that he would own and submit to any Vsurper of the Soveraignty</hi> as set up by God, <hi>although he came to it by the murder of his Master, and by trampling upon the Parliament.</hi> Lastly, <hi>That he would hinder as much as possibly he could the restoring of the rightful Heir unto the Crown. And now whether a man of this Judgement, and of these affections, ought to be permitted to Preach or no, Let any, but himself, judge.</hi>
