         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I might at the nexte Midsommer haue worne
Doctor <hi>Stories</hi> cappe for a fauor. For I trauelled almost
throughout all England, admired for my ingenious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie:

my art, and drawing in a Tanner for a tame Conie,
assoone as he had lost two shillings he made this replie.

cognisance to countenance you withall, and beare the
port of a Gentleman, yet I see you are a false knaue and
a Conny-catcher, and this your companion your setter,
and that before you and I part Ile proue.</p>
            <p>At these wordes Conny-catcher and Setter, I was
driuen into as great a maze, as if one had dropt out of
the clowds, to heare a pesant cant the wordes of art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging
to our trade: yet I set a good face on the matter
and asked him what he ment by Cony-catching. Marry
(q. he) althogh it is your practise, yet I haue for 3. pence
bought a litle Pamphlet, that hath taught me to smoke
such a couple of knaues as you be. When I heard him
talke of smoaking, my heart waxed cold, and I began to
gather into him gently. No no sir (q. he) you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not verse
vpon me, this booke hath taught me to beware of cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting:
<pb facs="tcp:5319:3"/>
And so to be breefe he vsed me curteously, and
that night causd the Constable to lodge mee in prison,
&amp; the nexte morning I was carried before the Iustice,
where likewise he had this cursed book of Cony catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so that hee could tel the secretes of mine art better
then my selfe: whereupon after strict examination I was
sent to the gaole, &amp; at the Sessions by good hap &amp; some
friend that my money procured mee, I was deliuered.
Assoone as I was at liberty, I got one of these bookes,
&amp; began to tosse it ouer very deuoutly, wherin I found
one art so perfectly anotomized, as if he had bene prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner
in our facultie forty winters before: then with
a deepe sigh I began to curse this <hi>R. G.</hi> that had made a
publike spoyle of so noble a science, and to exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that palpable asse whosoeuer, that would make

sequel, I smoothered my sorrowe in silence, and away I
trudged out of Deuonshire, &amp; went towards Cornwal,
&amp; comming to a simple Ale-house to lodge, I found at
a square table hard by the fire halfe a doozen countrie
Farmars at cardes. The sight of these penny-fathers at
play, draue me straight into a pleasant p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the mony they had, mine by proper interest. As thus
I stood looking on them playing at cros-ruffe, one was
taken reuoking, whereat the other said; what neighbour
wil you play the cony-catcher with vs? no no, wee haue
read the booke as wel as you. Neuer went a cup of small
beare so sorowfully down an Ale-knights belly in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
morning, as that word stroke to my hart, so that for
feare of trouble I was fain to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry my good hap a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and yet doe as simply as I could, I was not onelie
suspected, but called Conny-catcher and crosse-biter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5319:4"/>
But away I went with the money, and came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to London, where I no sooner arriued amongst
the crue, but I heard of a second parte worse then the
first, which draue mee into such a great choller, that I
began to enquire what this <hi>R. G.</hi> should bee. At last I
learned that hee was a scholler, and a Maister of Artes,
and a Conny-catcher in his kinde, though not at cards,
and one that fauoured good fellowes, so they were not
palpable offendors in such desperate lawes: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
reading his bookes, and surueying euery line with
deepe iudgement, I began to note folly in the man, that
would straine a Gnat, and lette passe an Elephant: that
would touch small scapes, and lette grosse faultes passe
without any reprehension. Insomuch that I resolued
to make an Apologie, and to aunswere his libellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues,
and to proue that we Conny-catchers are like
little flies in the grasse, which liue: or little leaues and
doe no more harme: whereas there bee in Englande
other professions that bee great Conny-catchers and
caterpillers, that make barraine the field wherein they
baite.</p>
            <p>Therfore all my good friends vouch of my paines,
and pray for my proceedings, for I meane to haue about
with this <hi>R. G.</hi> and to giue him such a veny, that he shalbe
afrayd heereafter to disparage that mysticall science of
Conny-catching: if not, and that I proue too weake for
him in sophistrie, I meane to borrowe <hi>Wili Bickertons</hi>

it were best for you to make a deed of gift of all your landes,

and deferred not to put in practise his counsell, for he made an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

his grounds, and began to grow out of debt, so that his creditors
were willing to beare with him. Against the three yeares were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
he made shift by the helpe of his friends for the money, and
carryed it home to the Usurer, thanking him greatly, and crauing
a returne of his deed of gift. Nay soft sir (sayth the olde Churle)
that bargaine is yet to make, the land is mine to mee and mine
heyres for euer, by a deed of gift from your owne hand, and what
can be more sure: take the money if you please, and there is your

               <p>At this the Gentleman was amazed, and began to plead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with him, but in vaine: whereuppon he went sorrowfully
home and told his wife, who as a woman halfe lunatike ran with
hir little children to his house, and cryed out, but bootlesse: For

the law had graunted him the fee simple thereof he would not part

you winke at it, but I wil tel all, yet heare out the end of my tale,

hir wits, went his way, and left al to his wiues discretion. She af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hir husband was foure or fiue dayes from home, was visited
by the Usurer, who vsed hir very kindly, and sent victuals to hir
house, promising to sup with hir that night, and that she should not
want any thing in hir husbands absence. The gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or two, as olde Iades wynnie when they cannot wagge the tayle,
began to be very pleasant with his tenant, and desired her to shew
him al the roomes in hir house, and happily (saith he) if I die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

be fauorable to you.</p>
               <p>The gentlewoman lead him through euery part, and at last
brought him into a backe roome much like a backhouse, where she
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5319:7"/>
Sir, this roome is the most vnhandsomest in all the house, but if
there were a dormar built to it, and these shut windows made bay
windows and glazd, it would make the properest parlour in al the
house: for (saith she) put your head out at this window, and looke
what a sweet prospect belongs vnto it.</p>
               <p>The Usurer mistrusting nothing, thrust out his craftie sconce,
and the Gentlewoman shut to the windowe, and called her maids
to helpe, where they bound and pinyond the caterpillers armes
fast, and then stood he with his head into a backeyard, as if he had
beene on a pillory, and struggle he durst not for stifling himselfe.
When she had him thus at the vauntage, she got a couple of sixe
peny nayles and a hammer, and went into the yard, hauing her
children attending vpon her, euery one with a sharpe knife in theyr
handes, and then comming to him with a sterne countenance, shee
looked as <hi>Medea</hi> did when she attempted reuenge against <hi>Iason.</hi>

               <p>Ah vile and iniurious caterpiller, God hath sent thee to seeke

For sith thy wealth doth so couutenance thee, that we cannot haue

these little infants, whose right without conscience or mercie
thou so wrongfully deteinest. Looke on this old Churle litle babes.
this is he that with his coossenage wil driue you to beg and want
in your age, and at this instant brings your Father to all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
miserie, haue no pittie vppon him, but you two cut off his
eares, and thou (quoth she to the eldest) cut off his nose, and so be
reuenged on the villaine whatsoeuer fortune me for my labour. At
this the Usurer cryed out, and bad her stay her children, and hee
would restore the house &amp; land again to hir husband. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
thee base churle q. she, for thou that wouldst periure thy selfe
<pb facs="tcp:5319:8"/>
against so honest a Gentleman as my husband, wil not sticke to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
thy selfe were thou at liberty and therefore I wil mangle
thee to the vttermost. As thus she was ready to haue her children
fal vpon him, one of hir maydes came running in, and told her, her
neighbors were came to supper: bid them come in, quoth she, and
behold this spectacle. Although the Usurer was passing loath to
haue his neighbors see him thus tyranously vsed, yet in they came,
and when they saw him thus mannerly in a new made pillory, and
his eares fast nayled, some wondred, some laught, and all stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
till the Gentlewoman discourst to them all the coosenage,
and how she meant to be reuenged: some of them perswaded her
to let him go, others were silent, and some bad him confesse: he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them debate the matter, and not to offer to helpe him, cryed
out: why, and stand you staring on me neighbors, and wil not you
saue my life? No quoth the Gentlewoman, he or she that stirs to
helpe thee shal pay dearely for it, and therefore my boyes, off with
his eares: then he cryed out, but stay, and he would confesse all,
when from point to point he rehearst how he had coossened hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
by a deed of gift only made to him in trust, and there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to giue him the two hundreth markes freely for amends, and
to yeeld vp before any men of worship the land againe into his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and vpon that he bad them all beare witnes. Then the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
let loose his eares, and let slip his head, and away went
he home with his bloody lugges, and tarryed not to take part of
the meat he had sent, but the gentlewoman &amp; her neighbors made
merry therwith, and laught hartily at the vsage of the vsurer. The
next day it was bruted abroad, and came to the eares of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful
of the country, who sate in commission vppon it, and found
out the coossenage of the Usurer, so they praised the witte of the
Gentlewoman, restored her husband to the land, and the old churle
remained in discredit, and was a laughing stocke to all the country
all his life after.</p>

of Edmondton.</head>
               <p>AN Alewife of <hi>Edmondton,</hi> who had a great vent for spiced
Cakes, sent her sonne often to <hi>Endfield Mill</hi> for to haue her
<pb facs="tcp:5319:9"/>
wheat ground, so that the Boy who was of a quicke spirit &amp; rype
wit, grew very familiar both with the Miller and his man, and
his man, and could get his corne sooner put in the Mil then any
Boy in the country beside. It fortuned on a time, that this good
wife wanting meale, bad her Boy hie to the Mil, and be at home
that night without faile, for she had not a pint of floure in the house.
Iacke her sonne, for so we wil cal his name, layes his sacke on his
mares backe, and away he rides singing towardes <hi>Endfield:</hi> as
he rode, he mette at the washes with the Miller, and gaue him the
time of the day, Godfather quoth he, whither ride you? to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Iacke quoth the Miller: Oh good Godfather quoth the boy,
tel mee what store of griest is at the Mil? marry great store quoth
the Miller: but Iacke if thou wilt do me an arrant to my man, ile
send thee by a token that thou shalt haue thy coru cast on &amp; ground
assoone as thou commest, Ile say and doe what you wil to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht,
for my mother hath neyther Cakes nor floure at home:
then Iacke saith the Miller, bid my man grind thy corne next, by
that token he looke to my Bitch and feed her wel. I wil Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith the Boy, and rides his way, and marueiled with himself
what Bitch it was that he bad his man feede, considering for two
or three yeares he had vsde to the Mil, and neuer saw a Dog nor
Bitch, but a little prickeard Shault that kept the Mil doore. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thus musing with himselfe, at last he came to <hi>Endfield,</hi> and
there he had his corne wound vp: assoon as he came vp the stairs,
the Millers man being somewhat sleepy began to aske Iack drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
what newes, Marry quoth the Boy, the newes is this, that I
must haue my corne laide on next: soft Iacke quoth the Millers
man, your turne wil not rowe afore midnight, but ye are alwayes
in hast, soft fire makes sweet mault, your betters shal be serued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

at the washes-riding to <hi>London,</hi> and tolde him what hast I
had, and so he bids my griest shal be layde on next, by that token
you must looke to his Bitch and feed her wel. At that the Millers
man smilde, and said he should be the next, and so rose vp and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a pinne behind the Hopper. Iacke markt al this, and beeing a
wily and a witty Boy, mused where this Bitch should be, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none began to suspect some knauery, and therefore being very

note of their names and dwelling, and the hands and seales of euerie

a rich Farmers daughter, but now was gone downe to his friendes
in Yorkshire, and would be at home againe within a weeke, for hee
had been eight weekes alreadie from home. The woman inquired no

Assoone as he had done, there came in more gentlemens men with
worke, that the taylor was very busie &amp; regarded not, the seruingma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who seeing the taylors cloke lying lose, lifted it away &amp; caried it home
with him to his mistris house, where he discourst to his maister &amp; his
mistris what he had seen, &amp; how he had stole the tailors cloake, not to

he, when he brings home my mistris gown, he wil complain of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse

who when he had dispatcht his customers, was ready to walke
with one of them to the tauern, &amp; then mist his cloke, searcht al about,
but find it he could not, neither knew he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suspect: so with much
griefe he past it ouer, &amp; when he had ended the gentlewomans gown
(because she was a good customer of his) he himself tooke his nag &amp;
rid home withal: welcome he was to the gentlewoman and hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and the gown was passing fit, so that it could not be amended,
insomuch that the gentlewoman praisd it, and highly thankt him. Oh
mistris (quoth he) thought it is a good gown to you, tis an infortunate
gowne to me, for that day your man brought the taffata, I had a cloke
stoln that stood me but one fortnight before in foure pound, and neuer
since could I heare any word of it. Truly said the Gentleman, I am
passing sorry for your losse, but that same man that was at your house
is passing skilful in Negromancy, and if any man in England can tel
you where your cloke is, my man can: marry q. he, and I wil giue him
a brace of angels for his labour: so the fellow was cald and talkt with
all, and at his mistris request was content to do it, but he would haue
his twenty shillings in hand, and promised if he told him not where it
was, who had it, and caused it to be deliuered to him again, for his two
angels he would giue him ten pounds: vpon this the taylor willingly
gaue him the money, and vp went he into a closet like a learned clark,
and there was three or foure houres laughing at the taylor, he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

answer to all questious that he demanded of him faithfully: the taylor
granted and swore on a bible, then hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded al should go out but
his maister, his mistres, the taylor and himself. Then he began thus:
wel, you haue taken your oth on the holy bible, tel me q. he, did you not
