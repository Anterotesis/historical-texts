            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>QVeenes,</hi> the Mothers of our Kings, by whom is continued the blessing of succession that preserues the Kingdome, hauing their parts running in the times wherein they liue, are likewise interressed in the Histories thereof, which containe their memories and all that is left of them, when they haue left to be in this world. And therefore to you, great Queene of <hi>England</hi> (and the greater by your loue to the nation, and the blessing you haue brought forth for the continuation of the future good thereof) doe I your humblest seruant addresse this peece of our History; which, as it is a worke of mine, appertaines of right to your Maiestie, being for the most parte done vnder your Roofe, during my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon your sacred person: and if euer it shall come to bee an intire worke, and merit any acceptation in the world, it must remaine among the memorials of you, and your time, as brought forth vnder the splendor of your goodnes. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this which is done shall yet shew how desirous I haue beene to lay out my time and industry, as farre as my ability would extend to doe your Maiestie, and my Country seruice in this kinde.</p>
            <p>And though at high Altares, none but high Priests ought to sacrifize, yet vouchsafe mighty Queene, to accept this poore oblation from the hand of your Maiesties</p>

            <head>Certaine Aduertisements to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THis Peece of our History, which here I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulge not, but impart priuately to such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons as haue fauoured my indeauors therein, should long since haue beene much more: and come abroade with <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Preface,</hi> and all the Complements of a Booke, had my Health and Meanes beene answerable to my desire: But being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I must intreate my Friends, to be content to be payd by peeces, as I may, and accept my willingnesse to yeeld as much as mine abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can performe. It is more then the worke of one man (were hee of neuer so strong forces) to Compose a passable contexture of the whole History of <hi>England.</hi> For, although the inquisition of Ancient times, written by others be prepared, yet the Collection and Disposition I finde most Laborious: and I know, <hi>quam sit magnum dare ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in manus hominum,</hi> especially in this kinde, wherein more is expected then hath beene deliuered before. Curiosity will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Ordinaries. For mine owne part I am so greedy of doing well, as nothing suffices the appetite of my care herein. I had rather be Master of a small peece handsomely contriued, then of vaste roomes ill proportioned, and vnfurnished: and I know many others are of my minde.</p>
            <p>Now for what I haue done, which is the greatest part of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story (and wherein, I dare auow, is more together of the mayne, then hath beene yet contracted into one peece) I am to render an account whence I had my furniture: which if I haue omitted to charge my Margin withall, I would haue the Reader to know, that in the Liues of <hi>William</hi> the First, <hi>William</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and
<pb facs="tcp:7690:4"/>
               <hi>Stephan;</hi> I haue especially followed <hi>William Malmsbury, Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Roger Houueden, Huntingdon,</hi> with all such Collections, as haue beene made out of others for those times. In the Liues of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, <hi>Richard</hi> the First, <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third: <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis, Rushanger, Mat. Paris, Mat. Westminst. Nich. Triuet, Caxton,</hi> and others. In the Liues of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and Third: <hi>Froissart</hi> and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> with such collections as by <hi>Pollidore Virgile, Fabian, Grafton, Hall, Holingshead, Stow</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> dilligent and famous Trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in the search of our History, haue beene made and diuulged to the world. For forrayne businesses (especially with <hi>France,</hi> where we had most to doe) I haue for Authors, <hi>Paulus AEmilius, Haillan, Tillet,</hi> and others, without whom we cannot truely vnderstand our owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And where otherwise I haue had any supplyes extraordinary, either out of Record, or such Instruments of State, as I could procure, I haue giuen a true account of them in the Margin. So that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall be sure to be payd with no counterfeit Coyne, but such as shall haue the Stampe of Antiquitie, the approbation of Testimony, and the allowance of Authority, so farre as I shall proceed herein.</p>
            <p>And for that I would haue this Breuiarie to passe with an vn-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted deliuery of the especiall affaires of the Kingdome (without imbroyling the memory of the Reader) I haue in a body apart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of an <hi>Appendix,</hi> Collected all Treaties, Letters, Articles, Charters, Ordinances, Intertainments, prouisions of Armies, businesses of Commerce, withother passages of State appertayning to our History; which assoone as I haue meanes to Print, shall, for the better satisfying of such Worthie persons, as may make vse of such Materials, accompany this Collection: and to this <hi>Appendix,</hi> I haue made references in the Margin, as occasion requires.</p>
            <p>For the Worke it selfe I can chalenge nothing therein but only the sowing it together, and the obseruation of those necessary circumstances, and inferences which the History naturally ministers: desirous to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things done, in as euen, and quiet an order, as such a heape will permit, without quarrelling with the <hi>Beliefe</hi> of Antiquity, deprauing the actions of other Nations to aduance our owne, or keeping backe those Reasons of State they had, for what they did in those times: hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it fittest and best agreeing with integritie (the chiefest duty of a Writer) to leaue things to their owne Fame, and the Censure thereof
<pb facs="tcp:7690:4"/>
to the Reader, as being his part rather then mine, who am onely to recite things done, not to rule them.</p>
            <p>Now for the errors herein committed, either by mine owne mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, or the Printers ouersight, I must craue a pardon of course, it is a Fate common to Bookes and Booke-men, and wee cannot auoide it: For besides our owne faylings, wee must heere take vp many things vpon other mens credits, which often comes imperfect to our hands: as the summes of Monies, numbers of Souldiers, Shippes, the slaine in Battayle, Computation of Tymes, differences of Names and Tytles &amp;c. wherein our Authors agree not. And it were to bee wished that wee had more assured notes of these particulars then wee haue, especially for summes of Monies (in regard it serues much for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) wherein I doubt many of our Collectors haue beene but ill Acountants, reckoning Markes for Pounds, and Pounds for Markes. The Computation of Tymes is not of so great moment, figures are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaken, the 10. of Iuly, and the 6. of August, with a yeare ouer or vnder, makes not a man the wiser in the businesse then done, which is only that hee desires. But these things being but of the By, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Reader will not much care to set at them, and therefore I referre him to the Mayne of more important consideration.</p>

               <p>VNdertaking to collect the principall affaires of this Kingdome, I had a desire to haue deduced the same from the beginning of the first Brittish Kings, as they are registred in their Catalogue: but finding no authentical warrant how they came there, I did put off that desire with these considerations: that a lesser part of time, and better knowne (which was from <hi>William</hi> the first, Surnamed the <hi>Bastard</hi>) was more then enough for my abilitie: and how it was but our curiositie to search further backe into times past, then we might well discerne, and whereof, we could neither haue proofe, nor profit: how the beginnings of all people, and states were as vncertaine, as the heads of great Riuers: and could not adde to our vertue, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture little to our reputation to know them. Considering, how commonly they rise from the springs of pouertie, pyracie, robberie, and violence, howsoeuer fabulous writers (to glorifie their nations) striue to abuse the credulitie of after ages with heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or miraculous beginnings. For states (as men) are euer best seene, when they are vp, and as they are, not as they were. Besides (it seemes) God in his prouidence to check our presumtuous inquisitions, wraps vp all things in vncertaintie, barres vs out from long antiquity, and bounds our searches within the compasse of a few ages, as if the same were sufficient, both for example, and instruction to the gouernment of men. For had wee the particular occurrents of all ages, and all nations, it might more stuffe, but not better our vnderstanding. We shall finde still the same corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to hold in the actions of men: Vertues, and Vices the same, though rising, and falling, according to the worth, or weakenesse of Gouernors: the causes of the ruines, and mutations of states to be alike: and the trayne of affaires carried by precedent, in a course of Succession, vnder like colours.</p>

Which was, since the <hi>Romans</hi> made it a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary Prouince to their Empire. For before, as it lay secluded out of the way, so it seemed out of the knowledge of the world. For <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> beeing but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side in <hi>Gaule,</hi> could not attaine to any particular information of the state of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> by any meanes he could vse, but by certaine Merchants (of whom he got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as many as he could) who told him somthing of the coast-townes, but of the state, and condition of the in-dwellers, they could say nothing: either so incurious were they of further knowledge then what concerned their trade, or the people here so warie to keep their state reserued and vnknowne to strangers.

                  </note> this subiection, the first certaine notice wee haue (is also by the same <hi>Caesar</hi>) who tells vs how they were deuided into many seuerall states: nominates foure Princes of <hi>Kent</hi> by the title of Kings: how <hi>Casseuellaunus,</hi> by the common councell was elected, in this their publique danger, to haue the principall administration of the state, <note place="margin">Caes. Comment. lib. 5.</note> with the businesse of warre: and afterward, how the cities sent their hostages vnto him. Whereby wee perceiue it was no Monarchie, as it is reported to haue beene, but like to the <hi>Gaules,</hi> with whome it was then one in religion (and much a like in <note place="margin">Complures sunt apud eos domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationes <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> lib. 4.</note> fashion, and language) deuided into a multitude of petty regiments, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire rule, or combination. As now, wee see all the west world (lately discouered) to be, and generally all other Countries are in their first, and naturall free nakednesse, before they come to be taken in; either by some predominant power from abroad, or grow to head within themselues, of strength, and vnderstanding to ouer-maister, and dispose of all about them; introducing such formes of rule, as ambition, or their other necessities shall beget. And such was then the state of <hi>Brittaine, Gaule, Spaine, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and all the west parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the <hi>Romans</hi> (ouer-growing first the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Italy</hi> in like manner deuided) did by strength, and cunning, vnlocke those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of theirs. And such as were then termed Kings, were but as their Generalls in warre, without any other great iurisdiction, within those small limits they held. So that to tell vs of the state of a Monarchie in this Land before that time (as if alone vnlike, or more in State then all other nations) is to giue intertainement to those nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row conceits, as apprehend not the progresses in the affaires of mankinde, and only the inuention of such, as take all their reason, from the example, &amp; <hi>Idea</hi> of the present Customes they see in vse. For had there beene an absolute Monarch in these parts, which might haue affronted the <hi>Romans</hi> with the power of a well-vnited state, it had been impossible for them (hauing oftentimes much to doe euen with some poore Prince of a small territorie) to haue circumuented, or confounded (with all their stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and iniustice) the peace, and liberty of the world in such sort as they did. And though the <hi>Brittaines</hi> were then simple, and had not that fire-brand of letters, yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they more iust, and honest, and brought forth on the stage of action men as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous (and toucht with as true a sense of honour, and worthinesse) as themselues. But hauing no firme combinements to chayne them together in their publique dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they lay loose to the aduantage of the common enemy; working vpon the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and emulations, vsuall to such diuisions, and were made the instruments of their owne subiection: for whilst euery one defended them apart, the whole was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p>So that with what credit, the accoumpt of aboue a thousand yeares from <hi>Brute</hi> to <hi>Casseuellaunus</hi> (in a line of absolute Kings) can be cleared I doe not see; and therefore will leaue it on the booke to such as will bee creditors, according to the substance of their vnderstanding. And yet, let me craue pardon least being but to report, I might

               <p>Besides it is strange how the Greeke tongue, and the knowledge of Philosophie, should be brought hither so farre off, and so soone; seeing it was late (as <hi>Liuy</hi> saith) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came into <hi>Italie,</hi> being so neere at hand.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7690:7"/>
subiection, then a tollerable tribute, which, it seemed, they were content to endure with the rest of their neighbours. But after <hi>Augustus</hi> time, when the corruptions of that State, had bred miserable inflammations in all parts of the world, the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> what with their owne factions, and those of their <hi>Romane</hi> commanders, remayned in an vncertaine obedience, till the time of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emporor; who hauing much of the fume of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and little fire to raise it otherwhere: casts an especiall eye on this Prouince, to make it the pompous matter of his triumph. And, to prepare the way, without aduenture of himselfe, foresends <hi>Publius Ostorius Scapula</hi> a great warrier, <hi>Pro-praetor</hi> into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where he met with many turbulencies, and a people hardly to be driuen, howsoeuer they might be led: yet as one who well knew his mestier; and how the first euents are those which incusse a dauntingnesse, or daring, imployed all means to make his expeditions sodaine, and his executions cruell. Notwithstanding did <hi>Carodocus</hi> (one of the British Kings) hold these great <hi>Romanes</hi> worke for nine yeares together, and could not bee sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, till betrayed by his owne Nation, he was deliuered into their hands, and brought to <hi>Rome</hi> captiue, with his wife and children, to be the subiect of their triumph: whereof notwithstanding the glory was his.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Claudius</hi> had the honour of taking in the whole Isle of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, which though thus wonne, was not, till a long time after, ouercome.

Besides the chiefe men of the <hi>Iceni</hi> (as if all the Region had beene giuen in prey) were reft of their goods, and the Kings kinsmen esteemed as captiues: with which contumely, and feare of greater mischiefe, they conspire with the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> and others (not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to seruitude) to resume their liberty.

And in the end, growing base with their fortune (as loosing their vertue with their libertie) became vtterly quailed, and miserably held downe to subiection, by the powrefull hand of foureteene Garisons, disposed in seuerall limits of the Land, with their companies, consisting of sundry strange nations, computated in all to be 52. <note place="margin">De Notitia, vtr.

               <p>This is briefly so much of especiall note, as I can collect out of the <hi>Roman</hi> historie, concerning the State, and government of <hi>Brittain:</hi> finding else-where little certaintie, and from hence forth (during their short possession of this Land) farre lesse. Whereof <hi>Gildas</hi> the <hi>Brittain</hi> complaines, laying the cause on the barbarism of their enemies, who <note place="margin">Gildas <hi>de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidio</hi> Britaniae.</note> had destroyed all their monuments, and memorials of times past. And though himselfe wrote, about forty yeares after the invasion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and was next these times we come now to remember, yet hath hee left (in his enigmaticall passions) so small light thereof, as we discerne very little thereby. Nor hath the <hi>Brittaines</hi> any honour by that antiquity of his, which over-blacks them with such vgly desormities as we can see no part cleere: accusing them to be <hi>neither strong in peace, nor faithfull in war:</hi> and vniversally casts those aspersions on their manners, as if he laboured to inveigh, not to informe. And though no doubt there was (as ever is) in these periods of States a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencie of disorder, and a generall loosenesse of disposition that met with the fulnesse of time; yet were there no doubt, some mixtures of worth, and other notions of that age, wherewith after-times would haue beene much pleased to haue had acquaintance. But it seemes his zeale and passion (in that respect) wider then his charity tooke vp the whole roome of his vnderstanding, to whom the reverence of antiquity, and his title of <hi>Sapiens</hi> doth now giue Sanctuary, and we must not presume to touch him.</p>
               <p>Such was the State of <hi>Brittain</hi> left without Armes, or order; when <hi>Vortigern</hi> (either <note place="margin">Anno 450.</note> by vsurpation, or faction) became King, and is said to be the author of the first calling in (or imploying, being in) the <hi>Saxons</hi> to make good his owne establishment, and the <note place="margin">

And first they had the Ifle of <hi>Thanet</hi> allowed them to inhabite: then the whole Countrie of <hi>Kent</hi> was made ouer to <hi>Hengist</hi> by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction, <note place="margin">

And besides force, they are said to haue vsed treachery (in murthering three hundred of the <hi>Brittish</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) at an assembly of peace at <hi>Amesbury,</hi> where they tooke their King prisoner, and would not release him, but vpon the grant of three Prouinces more. Also the long life of <hi>Hengist</hi> (a politique leader) of almost forty yeares continuance made much for the settling here of their estate: which yet they could not effect, but with much trauaile, and effusion of blood. For the <hi>Brittaines</hi> (now made martiall by long practise, and often battailes) grew in the end so inraged to see their Countrie surprized from vnder their feet, as they solde the inheritance therof at a very dearcrate. Wherein we must attribute much to the worthinesse of their Leaders (whence the spirit of a people is raised) who in these their greatest actions were, especially <hi>Ambrosius</hi> the last of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> the noblest of <hi>Brittaines:</hi> A man in force, &amp; courage aboue man, <note place="margin">King <hi>Arthur.</hi>

In the end, himselfe ouerthrowne by treason, the best men consumed in the warres, and the rest vnable to resist fled into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and remote desarts of the West parts of the Isle, and left all to the inuadors dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing more, and more vpon them.</p>
               <p>For many principall men of <hi>Saxony</hi> (seeing the happy successe, and plantation here of <hi>Hengist</hi>) entred likewise on diuerse coasts to get Estates for themselues, with such multitudes of people, as the <hi>Brittains</hi> making head in one place were assaulted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and euery where ouerwhelmed with new increasing numbers.</p>
               <p>For after <hi>Hengist</hi> had obtained the dominion of <hi>Kent</hi> (which from him became to be a kingdome) and <hi>Otha,</hi> and <hi>Ebuse</hi> possest of all the North-countries from <hi>Humber</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Having thus (in a manner) surrounded the best of the whole State of <hi>Brittaine;</hi> they after invaded the inner, and middle part.

               </p>
               <p>And with all these Princes, and Leaders before they could establish their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Brittaines</hi> so desperately grappled, as plant they could not, but vpon destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and desolation of the whole Country, whereof in the end they extinguished both the Religion, Lawes, Language, and all, with the people and name of <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Which having beene so long a Province of great honour, and benefit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, could not but partake of the magnificence of their goodly structures, Thermes, Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, High-waies, and all other their ornaments of delight, ease, and greatnesse: all which came to bee so vtterly razed, and confounded by the <hi>Saxons</hi> as there is not <note place="margin">The <hi>Brittaines</hi> vtterly subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons.</hi>
                  </note> left standing so much as the ruines to point vs where they were: for they being a people of a rough breeding that would not bee taken with these delicacies of life, seemed to care for no other monuments but of earth, and as borne in the field would build their fortunes onely there.

               <p>Which generall subversion of a State is very seldome seene: Invasion, and devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Provinces haue often beene made, but in such sort as they continued, or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, with some commixtion of their owne with the generation of the invadors. But in this, by reason of the vicinage, and innumerous populacie of that Nation (transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hither both sexes) the incompatibility of Paganism, and Christianity, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense bloud-shed on both sides, wrought such an implacable hatred, as but one Nation must possesse all. The conquest made by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> was not to extirpate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, but to master them. The <hi>Danes,</hi> which afterward invaded the <hi>Saxons,</hi> made onely at the first depredations on the coast, and therewith for a time contented themselues. When they grew to haue further interest, they sought not the subversion, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and in the end a Soveraignty of the State, matching with the women they here found, bringing few of their owne with them. The <hi>Normans</hi> dealt the like with the Province of <hi>Nuestria</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who also after they had the dominion, &amp; what the victorie would yeeld them in <hi>England,</hi> were content to suffer the people here to haue their being, intermatched with them, and so grew in short space into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But this was an absolute subversion, and concurred with the vniversall mutation, <note place="margin">The absolute subversion of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the generall mutation of other States of the world.</note> which about that time happened in all these parts of the world; whereof, there was no one Countrey, or Province but changed bounds, inhabitants, customes, language, and in a manner, all their names.</p>
               <p>For vpon the breaking vp of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (first devided into two, and then by faction disioynted in each part) imploying the forces of many strange Nations to fortifie their sides, were made so wide ruptures in the North, and North-east bounds of that Empire, as there burst out infinite streames of strange people that over-ranne, and laid open the world againe to liberty, other formes, and limits of State: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon followed all these transmigrations, and shiftings of people from one Country to another. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Burgognons</hi> dispossest the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and gaue the name of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Burgogne</hi> to their Province. The <hi>Gaules</hi> transplanted themselues on some coasts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where they could finde, or make their habitation: and of them had

                  <hi>Gallicia</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> their name. The <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Auari</hi> subdued <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gaue the name of <hi>Hungarie.</hi> The <hi>Longbeards,</hi> a people of <hi>Germany,</hi> bordering vpon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lumbardie</hi> so called of the Longberds.</note> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> entred <hi>Italy,</hi> got the greatest part thereof, and left there their name to a principall Prouince, remayning to this daie. The <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi> miserably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the rest, sackt <hi>Rome,</hi> and after subdued, peopled, and possest <hi>Spaine.</hi> So that it was not in the fate of <hi>Brittaine</hi> alone, to bee vndone, but to perish, almost, with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall dissolution of other States, which happened about the same age.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we are now here to beginne with a new Bodie of people, with a new State, and gouernment of this Land, which retained nothing of the former, nor held other memory but that of the dissolution thereof: where scarce a Citie, Dwelling, Riuer, Hill, or Mountaine, but changed names. <hi>Brittaine</hi> it selfe was now no more <hi>Brittaine,</hi> but <hi>New Saxonie,</hi> and shortly after, either of the Angles (the greatest people of the inuadors) or of <hi>Hengist,</hi> called <hi>Engist-Land,</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> The distance, made by the rage of warre, lay so wide betweene the conquering and conquered people, that nothing either of Lawes, Rites and Customes, came to passe ouer vnto vs from the <hi>Brittaines:</hi> nor had our Ancestors any thing from them, but their Country: which they first diuided into eight kingdomes: all which, continued to the last extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Brittaines</hi> vnder <hi>Caretius</hi> their King, with whom they were driuen ouer <hi>Seuerne,</hi> 136. yeares after the first entertainment of <hi>Hengist.</hi> And soone after, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> encroching vpon each others parts, or States (which neuer held certaine bounds) and the stronger vsurping vpon their weaker neighbours, reduced them to seauen kingdomes; that of the <hi>Northanimbrains,</hi> being made one of two: and then to sixe (the West <hi>Saxons</hi> taking in the kingdome of <hi>Sussex</hi> to their dominion.) And so it continued about 250 yeares.</p>
               <p>At the first, by the space of 150 yeares, they were meerely gouerned by their owne Lawes, without mixture of any other. But after <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monke, sent with fortie others, by Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> had conuerted <hi>AEthelbert,</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and some other, they all shortly after receiued the Christian faith, and had their Lawes and Rites ordered according to Ecclesiasticall constitutions. Many of their Kings, when their sterne asperitie grew molified by humility of the Religion, beganne to raise present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so many and great monuments of their piety, in all parts of the Land, as if they striued who should exceed therein, and had no other glorie: Diuers of them renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their temporall dignities for Spirituall solitude, and became Monkes; as <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and <hi>Kinred,</hi> Kings of <hi>Merena-Land; Offa</hi> King of the East <hi>Saxons; Kadwalla,</hi> and <hi>Ina,</hi> Kings of the West <hi>Saxons; Eadberte</hi> King of <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>At length the kingdomes of <hi>Merc-naland,</hi> and West Sax, so farre ouer-grew the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in power, as betweene them two it lay, who should haue all. For <hi>Ina,</hi> a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, wise, and religious Prince, gouerning the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> first aduanced that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to a preheminencie, and did much to haue subdued <hi>Merc-naland:</hi> but yet <hi>Offa,</hi> (afterwards King thereof) was in faire possibility to haue swallowed vp both the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> &amp; all the rest of the Kingdoms. For whilst he liued, which was in the time of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> (which whom he held league &amp; amity) he was esteemed as the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall King of the Land. But the many wrongs he did, and the murther committed in his house vpon <hi>Aethelbert</hi> K. of the East Angles, comming to him vnder publique faith, and a suitor to his daughter, were iustly reuenged vpon his posteritie, which after him declining, in the end lost al. For <hi>Egbert,</hi> discended from <hi>Inegild,</hi> the brother of <hi>Ina,</hi> attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the kingdome of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> beganne the way to bring all the rest into subiection. And being a Prince, who (from a priuate fortune, wherein he liued below, with, and not aboue other men) had learned sufferance and moderation; and by the Estate of an exile, experience; grew to haue great aduantages ouer the time, and others borne-fortunes, and rose by these meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ina,</hi> his great Vncle, renouncing the world, with his kingdome, and dying without issue, left the succssion imbroiled, and out of the direct royall lyne as hee found it. So that those foure Kings of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> who seuerally succeeded him. <hi>Ethelard, Sigibert, Kinulph</hi> and <hi>Britric,</hi> were rather Kings by election, and their owne power,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7690:10"/>
then by right of discent. And <hi>Britric</hi> knowing the weakenesse of his title, and the much promising forwardnesse of <hi>Egbert;</hi> with his propinquitie in bloud, to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings, practized to haue him made away; which hee perceiuing, fled first to <hi>Offa,</hi> King of <hi>Mercna-land,</hi> where finding little security, in regard <hi>Britric</hi> had (to strength himselfe) married the daughter of the King, hee escaped into <hi>France,</hi> and there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till the death of <hi>Britric,</hi> and then returning, obtaines that kingdome of the <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saxons;</hi> subdues <hi>Cornewall,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Brittaines;</hi> and after sets vpon <hi>Bernulph,</hi> newly inuested in the Kingdome of <hi>Mercna-land;</hi> a State (by the rupture of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all line) likewise growne tottering. For <hi>Egferth,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Offa,</hi> enioyed but foure monethes, the inheritance of his fathers immanitie: whereby that Kingdome discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded collaterally to <hi>Kennulph,</hi> who left it to <hi>Kenelme</hi> a childe, after murthered by his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Quinred. Ceolulph,</hi> brother to <hi>Kennulph,</hi> succeeding, after his first yeares raigne, was expeld by <hi>Bernulph,</hi> and <hi>Bernulph by Egbert,</hi> who made that Kingdome tributarie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egbert</hi> obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which by him was named Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> to the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> as he did after that of the South, and East <hi>Saxons,</hi> with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> And by this meanes (in a manner) attained to a soueraignty of the whole country. But the <hi>Danes</hi> imbroiling his peace in the end of his raigne, held him backe from enioying such a fulnesse of power, as that wee may account him the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarch of the Kingdome, nor yet any of his successors, so long as the <hi>Danes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anno 802.</note> continued vnsubiected. For they hauing first made irruptions into the State, in the raigne of the late King <hi>Britric</hi> (his predecessor) euer after held a part therof, and afflicted the whole, till they had attained the absolute soueraigntie to themselues.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> were a people of <hi>Germanie,</hi> next neighbours to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and of language and manners little different: Possessing besides <hi>Cimbrica Chersonesus</hi> (now called <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi>) <note place="margin">The discripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Danes.</note> all the Isles adiacent in the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea, and sometimes the kingdome of <hi>Norway:</hi> A mightie, rough, and martiall Nation; strong in shipping, through their exercise of piracie, and numerous in people for all suppliments. Who perceiuing here the happie successe, and plantation of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> were drawne with desire and emulation, likewise, to put in for a part; the coast lying open to inuasion, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuisions of the Land, with the discord of Princes, making them an easie way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. So that in a manner, as soone as the <hi>Saxons</hi> had ended their trauailes with the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> and drew to settling of a Monarchie; the <hi>Danes,</hi> as if ordained to reuenge their slanghters, beganne to assault them with the like afflictions. The long, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and horrible encounters betweene these two fierce Nations, with the bloudshed, and infinit spoiles committed in euery part of the Land, are of so disordred and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous memory, that what with their asperous names, together with the confusion of place, times, and persons, intricately deliuered, is yet a warre to the reader to ouer-looke them. And therefore to fauour mine owne paines and his, who shall get little profit thereby, I passe them ouer.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Egbert, Aethelwolph,</hi> his sonne succeeded in the State, with the title of King of the West <hi>Saxons</hi> onely, and was a Prince more addicted to deuotion then action: as may be seene by his donation of the tenth part of his Kingdome (with exemption of all regall seruice) for the seruice of God: besides an annuitie of three hundred markes, to be bestowed in pious vses at <hi>Rome;</hi> whither he went twice in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

After which, raigning but two yeares, <hi>Aethelbald</hi> succeeded in the whole, and with great infamy, marrying his fathers widow, <hi>Iudith,</hi> daughter to <hi>Charles le Chauue,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> enioyed it but two yeares and a halfe; when <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> the second sonne of <hi>Aethelulph,</hi> entred to the gouernment, which hee held
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7690:10"/>
fiue yeares in continuall conflict with the <hi>Daues.</hi> After whom, ALFRED, the mirrour of Princes (made a King before he had a kingdom) at <note place="margin">An. 872.</note> two and twenty years of his age (&amp; in a yeare wherein eight seuerall battailes <note place="margin">Alfred.</note> had been giuen to the <hi>Danes</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi>) began his troublous raigne, wherein he was perpetually in warre, either against his enemies, or else against vices.</p>
               <p>First after a great danger to lose all, he was forced to yeeld vp a part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which was that of the East angles, and <hi>Northumberland</hi>) to <hi>Guthrum,</hi> leader of the <hi>Danes,</hi> whom (vpon his baptization) he made his confederate, and owner of that by right, which before he vsurped by violence.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding all the continuall, and intricate toyle hee indured amidst the clattering and horror of armes, he performed all noble actions of peace, collecting first <note place="margin">K. <hi>Alfred</hi> first made collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Lawes.</note> the Lawes of his predecessors, and other the Kings of the <hi>Saxons</hi> (as those of <hi>Offa,</hi> King of <hi>Mercna-land,</hi> and <hi>Aethelbert</hi> the first Christian English King) of which, by the graue aduise, and consent of his States assembled, hee makes choice of the fittest (abrogates those of no vse) and addes other according to the necessity of the time.</p>
               <p>And for that the wildenesse of warre, by the reason of these perpetuall conflicts with strangers, had so let out the people of the Land to vnlawfull riots, and rapine, that no man could trauaile without conuoy: he ordained the diuision of shires, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, <note place="margin">The first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Land into Shires, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Tithings.</note> and Tithings, that euery Englishman (now the generall name for all the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>) liuing legally might be of a certaine Hundred, or Tithing, out of which, hee was not to remooue without security: and out of which, if hee were accused of any crime, hee was likewise to produce sureties for his behauiour, which if hee could not finde, hee was to endure the punishment of the Law. If any malefactor before, or after hee had put in suerties escaped, all the Tithing, or Hundred were fined to the King, by which meanes he secured trauailers, and the peace of his Country.</p>
               <p>The opinion he had of learning made him often complaine the want thereof, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it amongst his greatest infortunes to haue been bred without it, and to haue his kingdome so vtterly destitute of learned men, as it was, through the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this barbarous warre: which made him send out for such, as were any way famous for letters, and hauing gotten them, hee both highly preferred them, and also (as they doe, who knowe not to much themselues) held them in great veneration: Rarenesse then, setting a higher price on meaner parts, then after Plenty did on more <note place="margin">Publique Schooles first erected.</note> perfections. <hi>Grimbald,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> hee drew out of <hi>France: Asser</hi> (who wrote his life) out of Wales, other from other parts: hee was the first lettered Prince we had in <hi>England,</hi> by whose meanes and incouragement publique Schooles had here, either their reuiuing, or beginning.</p>
               <p>Those wants of his owne, made him take a greater care for the education of his sonnes, with whom (were bred vnder most diligent masters) almost all the children of the Nobility within his kingdome.</p>
               <p>All his owne time he could cleare from other businesse, he bestowed in study, and did himselfe, and caused others to translate many things in the vulgar tongue, which he laboured (it seemes) much to adorne, and especially affected the <hi>Saxon</hi> meeters, <note place="margin">Mat. Westm.</note> whereby to glorifie that of a King, he attained the title of Poet.</p>
               <p>The naturall day, consisting of 24 houres, hee cast into three parts: whereof eight he spent in prayer, study, and writing, eight in the seruice of his body, &amp; eight in the affaires of his State. Which spaces (hauing then no other engine for it) hee measured by a great waxe light, deuided into so many parts, receiuing notice by the keeper thereof, as the seuerall houres passed in the burning.</p>
               <p>With as faire an order did he proportion his reuenues, equalling his liberties to all <note place="margin">The first sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay of the kingdome.</note> his other expences, whereof to make the current run more certaine, he tooke a precise notice of them, and made a generall suruay of the kingdome, and had all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his estate registred in a booke, which he kept in his treasury at <hi>Winchester.</hi> And within this circumference of order, hee held him in that irregularity of fortune, with a weake disposition of body, and raigned 27 yeares, leauing his sonne <hi>Edward,</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie successor to maintaine the line of Noblenesse thus begun by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7690:11"/>EDWARD, though hee were farre inferiour to him in learning, went much beyond him in power: for he had all the kingdom of <hi>Mercna-land</hi>

For this affliction held them so in, as hauing little out-lets, or leisure for ease, &amp; luxury; they were made the more pious, iust, &amp; carefull in their gouernment: otherwise it had been impossible to haue held out against the <hi>Danes,</hi> as they did being a people of that power, &amp; vndauntable stomack, as no fortune could deterr, or make to giue ouer their hold. And the imbecility of some vnactiue Prince at that time had beene enough to haue let them quite into the whole. Which may be the cause, that in the succession of some of these Kings were certaine ruptures made out of course, in respect of their able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. As first, after the death of this renowned King <hi>Edward Senior,</hi> his sonne</p>
               <p>ATHELSTAN of full yeares, and spirit, was (notwithstanding the bracke <note place="margin">An. 924.</note> in his birth) preferred before his legitimate sonne <hi>Edmond</hi> vnder age: Nor <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athelstan</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard preferred before the lawfull sonne.</note> did <hi>Athelstan</hi> disappoint the kingdome in this worke, but performed all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of Religion, Iustice, and Magnanimitie, &amp; after sixteen yeares raigne died without issue.</p>
               <p>EDMOND his brother succeded him. A Prince likely to haue equalled <note place="margin">An. 940.</note> the worth of his Predecessors, had he not vntimely perished by the hand of a base Out-law in his owne house, at a festiuall, amidst his people that deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Edmond.</note> loued, and honoured him. And though he left two sonnes, yet was</p>
               <p>EDRED his brother preferred to the kingdome before them: who (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">An. 946.</note> no variation from the line of Vertue continued by his ancestors) was <note place="margin">Edred or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> held perpetually in work by the <hi>Danes</hi> during the whole time of his raigne, which was of ten yeares.</p>
               <p>EDWIN his nephew, the eldest sonne of <hi>Edmond,</hi> succeded him (an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">Edwin.</note> youth) who interrupting the course of goodnes liued dissolutely, &amp; died wishedly. Otherwise had <hi>Edgar</hi> (the other sonne of <hi>Edmond</hi>) continued that rare succession of good Princes, without the interposition of any ill, which is not in the Fate of a kingdome.</p>
               <p>EDGAR, though he were but sixteen yeares of age, yet capable of counsell, <note place="margin">An. 959.</note> was by the graue aduise of his Bishops (who in that time of zeale held espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Edgar.</note> the raines on the hearts, and affections of men) put, &amp; directed in the way of goodnesse, and became a most heroicall Prince.</p>
               <p>Amongst other his excellent actions of gouernment, hee prouided a mighty Nauy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edgar</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides shipping</note> to secure his coasts from inuasion, which now he found (though late) was the onely meane to keepe out those miseries from within, that thus lamentably afflicted the land euer before negligent, or not inured to Sea-affaires. For when the <hi>Romans</hi> first subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same, there was no shipping but a few small vessells made of wicker, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with hides: whereby they, and after the <hi>Danes</hi> (both mighty, as those times gaue, in shipping) found that easie footing they had. Yet <hi>Egbert</hi> is said to haue prouided a strong Nauy, about the yeare 840. And <hi>Alfred</hi> thirty, or forty yeares after did the <note place="margin">A most vsefull progresse.</note> like. But either now dis-used, or consumed by the enemy, <hi>Edgar</hi> re-edifies, and sets forth a Fleet consisting (as some write) of 1600 saile, others a farre greater number, &amp; those hee deuides, and places in foure parts of the Realme, making his progresses year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with part of his mighty Nauy, round about the whole Isle, whereof hee assumed the title of King.</p>
               <p>And to reduce it all to one name, &amp; Monarchie, he was intitled King of all <hi>Albion,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7690:11"/>
as testifies his Charter granted to the Abby of <hi>Maldesmesbury,</hi> in these words: <hi>Ego Edgarus totius Albionis Basileus, nec non Maritimorum, seu insulanorum Regum circum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantium &amp;c.</hi> For he hauing first of all other made peace with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them quiet cohabitation through all his dominions; had the soueraigntie ouer them: And <hi>Kenneth,</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> did him homage, whether for <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Westmerland</hi> giuen to that Crowae by King <hi>Emond</hi> his father; or for his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; I cannot say. And fiue Kings of <hi>Wales</hi> did the like for their Country, and came all to his Court at <hi>Cardiffe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that hee seemes the first, and most absolute Monarch of this land, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we finde: The generall peace that held all his time, honoured his name with the title of <hi>Pacificus:</hi> and rendred his Kingdome (neuer before acquainted with the glory of quietnesse) very flourishing. But as if the same had beene giuen to shew, and not to vse (like a short calme betwixt stormes) it lasted but little beyond his raigne of sixteene yeares: being too short to close the diffeuered ioynts of a commixed <note place="margin">Hee raigned 16. yeares.</note> Kingdome; which was onely, to haue beene the worke of Time: and that none of these late Princes (who were best like to haue aduanced, and confirmed the State of a Monarchie) were ordained to haue.

Nor shall thy sinne, nor the sinne of thy ignominious mother, with her Councellors, bee expiated, but by long auengement.</hi> And this (whether so vttered or not) was ratisied in the cuent.

               <p>For the <hi>Danes,</hi> hauing now beene so long inmates with the English, dispread ouer all parts by intermatching with them, and multiplying with the late peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations, had their party (though not their rule) greater then euer: so that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of a young and vnsettled Prince, in a new and brangling State, drew ouer <note place="margin">The spoiles made by the <hi>Danes.</hi>
                  </note> such multitudes of other of the same Nation: as euery coast and part of the Land, were miserably made the open rodes of spoile and saccage: in such sort, as the State knew not where to make any certaine head against them: for if incountred in one place, they assailed another, and had so sure intelligence what, and where al preparations were raised, as nothing could be effected auaylable to quaile them; Whereupon <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> in the end, was faine, seeing he could not preuaile with the sword, to assaile them with mony, &amp; bought a peace for 10000 pounds: which God wot, proued after, a very deere penny-worth to the comon wealth, shewing the seller therof, how much was in his power, &amp; the buyer, at how hard a rate his necessity was to be serued; &amp; yet not sure of his bargaine, longer then the contractor would. Who hauing sound the benefit of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7690:12"/>
this market, raised the price thereof almost euery yeare. And yet had not <hi>Ethelred</hi> what he paide for: the Land in one part or other, neuer free from spoile and inuasion; but rather the more now opprest, both by the warre, and this taxation. Which was the <note place="margin">The originall of <hi>Dane</hi> gelt, the first impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition laid vpon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> first we finde in our Annales, laide vpon the Kingdome (and with heauie greeuance raised in a poore distressed State) continuing many ages after the occasion was extinct: And in the end (though in another name) became the vsuall supplyment, in the dangers of the Kingdome, and the occasions of Princes.</p>
               <p>And hereby <hi>Ethelred</hi> both inlarged the meanes, and desire of the enemy, so that at length, came <hi>Swain,</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Aulafe,</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> in person, as if like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to receiue hier for committing outrage, and were both returned with great sums, and <hi>Aulafe</hi> of a milder disposition, with baptisme. These calamities from abroad, were made more, by the disloyalties at home: faith and respect (being seldome found safe in lost fortunes) held not in most of the principall men imployed in the defence. <hi>Aelfric,</hi> Admirall of the Nauy, is said to haue giuen intelligence of all Sea-preparations, and disappointed that worke. The Earles <hi>Fran, Frithigist, Godwin,</hi> and <hi>Turkettle,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of <hi>Danike</hi> progeny, and of greatest commaund, deceiucd the armies by Land, and were the aucthors of discouragement to the people they led. <hi>Edric Earle</hi> of <hi>Marc-land,</hi> after them made Generall of the Kings forces, is branded with euerlasting ignominie, and the title of <hi>False,</hi> for his barbarous disloyaltie, frustrating all attempts wherein he was imployed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wolnod,</hi> a Nobleman, for his misdemeanor outlawed, made depredations on the coastes, with twentie shippes, and was the cause that fourescore more sent to take him in, were vtterly consumed. This defection of his Nobilitie, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it might bee by their owne discontent, emulation, corruption, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is laide to the pride of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> whom yet wee finde more vnfortunate then weake, howsoeuer they haue set his marke: and neglected no occasion to make resistance and reparations against all euents, bringing often his affaires to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of dispatch, and yet put by, at an instant from all, as if nothing went with him, but his will to doe worthily: which howsoeuer it were (besides the miserie to loose) hee must haue (that which accompanies infelicity) <hi>Blame,</hi> and <hi>Reproch.</hi> Though the many and desperate battailes hee made; the good consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions for the gouernment; the prouisions to supply all important occasions, shew, that hee was not much behinde the best Princes, but onely in fortune</p>
               <p>By the example of <hi>Edgar</hi> his father, hee procured a mightie Nauie; causing of euery three hundred and tenne Hide or Plough-land throughout the Kingdome, a Shippe to be built, and of euery eight, a Corslet to bee found: Yet all this shipping stood him in little stead, but was either quasht with tempest, consumed with fire by the enemy, or otherwise made vnusefull by neglect, or ignorance: whereby the hope and infinite charge of the State were disappointed. Famine, and mortality, the attendants of warre, with strange inundations, wrought likewise their part, as if conspirators of destruction, and all concur'd to make a dismall season.</p>
               <p>Many yeares it was not, ere <hi>Swaine</hi> King of <hi>Danes,</hi> returned to raise againe new summes, by new afflictions; and tormenting heere this poore turmoyled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more then euer; receiues a fee for bloud-shed, to the summe of 48000 pounds; granted in the generall assembly of the States at <hi>London,</hi> and a peace, or rather pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on os seruitude concluded; with quiet cohabitation, vse of like liberties, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnion betweene the two Nations, confirmed by oathes of either part, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages deliuered of ours.</p>
               <p>But this as a breathing time, scarce hold out the yeare.

This priuate iniustice (which often may be more in compassion, then hurt to the State) hee sought to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with all publique satisfactions: repairing the naufrage of the common-wealth (made by the rage of warre) both in ornament and order: erecting Churches and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, with large patents of prouisions; both for the expiation of his immanities fore-committed, and to memorize the places of his victories with his thankefulnesse to God. The Constitutions Ecclesiasticall and Ciuile, diuulged in the language of that time, testifie his tender piety, and care of Iustice: and are so full of religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, <note place="margin">His erection of Churches, and of Church gouernment.</note> as it seemes he held, the best meanes to haue lawes obserued, was, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them first enacted in the consciences of men. Amongst others, hee inflicted exact punishment on all intempetances of his people, and offences committed against publique manners. Seuere he was, but not cruell: few of his lawes sanguinarie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the custome of the time: which though rough, yet found meanes to maintaine publique order, without that luctuall remedie of bloud. No punishments capitall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse conspiracies: the rest were all pecuniarie mulcts, banishments, bondage, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment. To shew his clemeucy, this (amongst many) is one example: there was a law, that <hi>Whosoeuer had committed theft, and the goods found in his house, all his family were made bond, euen to the child in the cradle:</hi> This he abrogates as most vniust, and ordaines, <hi>That onely the malefactor, and such as should aide him, should endure the punishment: and that the wife (vnlesse the things stolne, were found vnder her locke) should not be guilty ef her husbands offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was hee to his people, with whom, hee is sayd to haue so well cleered himselfe (howsoeuer he did with God) that he became King of their affections, as well as of their Countrie. And to maintaine this opinion, hee did many popular acts: as first all Rites of Honor and reuerence to the memorie of the late King <hi>Edmond,</hi> his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: besides, the executing all such as could bee found to haue had any hand in that murther. Then married he here at home, <hi>Emme,</hi> late wife to King <hi>Ethelred</hi> (though it were more for his honour then hers, to accept his bed, that had beene the persecutor of her husband and children) whereby hee held the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing for his Nephewes, in regard, his sister might haue other by him.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus established this mightie Kingdome, occasion prepares him another. The people of <hi>Norway,</hi> contemning the debilitie of their King, and conspiring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, grew into faction: whereupon hee fastens; and with the great forces hee brought out of England, the might of money, and high estimation of his worthinesse, so preuailed, as hee soone obteyned that Kingdome; and was now the most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and potent Prince in all these parts of the world: intitled, King of <hi>England, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi>

                  <hi>Leofrike,</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford</hi> (men of as great State and spirit) seeing him most for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, became more for the King, and had their turne in performing very noble actions. Nor did their emulation, but much conduce to the present benefit both of the King, and State; For the Earle <hi>Syward,</hi> would not be behind hand, in effecting as braue deeds in the North, as <hi>Harold,</hi> Earle of <hi>Westsex,</hi> the sonne of the Earle <hi>Godwin</hi> performed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Welsh,</hi> in the West: For thefirst depriued of life, and Crowne, <hi>Macbeth,</hi> an vsurper, and inuested <hi>Malcolin,</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the other defeited <hi>Ris,</hi> and <hi>Griffine,</hi> two brothers, Kings of <hi>Wales,</hi> and subdued that Prouince to this Crowne.</p>
               <p>Besides the Earle <hi>Godwin,</hi> had to struggle with an Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Robert,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> preferred, from a Monke, first to <hi>London,</hi> and after to that Sea, by the King, inwardly affecting most that nation, as being part of their bloud, and bred amongst them. Of whom it seemed (notwithstanding the former order taken to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) he had many about his person, whose neerenesse, being strangers, whatsoeuer they did, could not auoide to be thought, to doe ill offices against the Earle, and the <hi>English</hi> in generall: whereby, what went not right in the line of mens desires, was thought to be their cause.

pursues, and slue the homicide, with 18 other. The City seeing this tooke armes, and in the bickering, the Earle lost 22. of his men, whereupon, backe he hasts to the King, aggrauates the insolency of the Citizens so farre; that the Earle <hi>Godwin</hi> is sent for, and commanded with a power of men, to make against the City of <hi>Douer,</hi> to chastice the people. The Earle (considering it was vpon the information of one side) aduised the King rather to send for the cheife of the City, to vnderstand what they could say for themselues, and accordingly to proceede, which (being taken, for a coldnesse in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and of fauour to his Countrymen) gaue the King and his enemies occasion to suspect his affection.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the Earle is summoned to an Assembly at <hi>Glocester,</hi> where neither he, nor any of his sonnes would appeare; and suspecting some practise against him by his <note place="margin">Earle <hi>Godains</hi> insurruction.</note> enemies, raises forces, pretending to suppresse the <hi>Welsh,</hi> who were not found to offend; whereupon the Assembly remoues to <hi>London,</hi> summons him againe to make his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to dismisse his forces, and to come onely attended with twelue persons. He sends them word; to dismisse his forces he was content, or any thing else the King would command him, so it were with the safety of his life and honour; but to come disaccompanied, was for neither. Then was he commanded within fiue dayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Realme, which he did, and with <hi>Toustaine,</hi> and <hi>Swayne</hi> his sonnes, gets him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flaunders,</hi> where <hi>Toustone</hi> married the daughter of the Earle <hi>Baldouin</hi> the 5. <hi>Harald</hi> his eldest sonne, departs into <hi>Ireland:</hi> the King puts from him the Queene, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the disgrace, and misery of her house; who is described (by the writers of those times) to haue beene a Lady of rare parts, excellently learned, beautifull, and as faire of minde as body. The Earle <hi>Godwin</hi> in this desperate fortune (whilst the <hi>French</hi> and his enemies possest the King) fell to Piracy, distuibed the coasts, approached <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> by the Riuer; and being so popular, as no forces would oppose against him, made <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> forsake the Court, and Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> at length his owne peace with power; in such sort, as the <hi>French</hi> fearing reuenge, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke both the Court, and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This (as fore-pointing to a storme that was gathering on that coast) began the first difference with the <hi>French</hi> nation: which, thus acquainted with the distraction of the Kingdome. and factions of great men, wrought on those aduantages, and were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw on the fatall enterprize that followed.</p>
               <p>The weaknesse of the King, and the disproportionate greatnesse of the Earle <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> being risen vp from so great a fall (learning thereby, to looke better to his seete, and make his sides strong) increased these discontentments, and partialities in the State; wherein many acts of iniustice, by the sway of power and passion, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; which did much blacken that time of peace, and made a good man (not by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but induring ill) held to be a bad King.</p>
               <p>And it is sayd, that <hi>Emme,</hi> the Queene mother, had her part of much affliction in his raigne, suffering both in her goods and same: and now to purge her selfe of a scandall raised on her with <hi>Alwyn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> she vnder-went the triall of <hi>Fire-Ordeall</hi>

And the reason why, both her sonne and the State so little respected this great Lady (whose many yeares had made her and actor in diuerse fortunes) was, for that she neuer affected King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> nor the children she had by him: and for her marriage with <hi>Knute,</hi> the great enemy and subduer of the Kingdome, whom she euer much more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued liuing, and commended dead.</p>
               <p>It seemed these priuate grudges, with mens particular ends, held these times so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, that the publicke was neglected, and an issue-lesse King, gaue matter for ambition and power, to build hopes and practises vpon: though for his owne part, he shewed to haue had a care for the succession, in sending for his Nephew <hi>Edward,</hi> intitled the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, with his children, out of <hi>Hungary.</hi> But <hi>Edward,</hi> shortly after his artiuall died, and <hi>Edgar</hi> his sonne (surnamed <hi>Atheling</hi>) to say Prince <hi>Edgar</hi>) whom he had by his wife <hi>Agatha,</hi> daughter to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. who (either by reason of his youth, which yet was no barre to his right, or being borne and bred a stranger, little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>And the first man, which beganne to disturbe his new gouernment, was his owne yonger brother <hi>Toustayne,</hi> who (in the time of the late King <hi>Edward,</hi> hauing the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The Kings brother <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne</hi> bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) was for his pride and immanities shewed in those parts, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Kingdome; and now by reason of his former conceiued hatred against his brother, easily set on, by the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Baldouin,</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> (whose two daughters the Duke and he had married) assailes first the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and after sets vpon the coast of <hi>Kent,</hi> whence he was chased by the power of <hi>Harald,</hi> and forced to withdraw into the North parts; and there seeking to land, was likewise repulsed, by the Earles <hi>Morchar</hi> and <hi>Edwyn.</hi> Then craues he aide of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and after of <hi>Harald,</hi> surnamed <hi>Harfager,</hi> King of <hi>Norwey,</hi> being then taking in the Orchades, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing piracy in those parts; whom he induced with all his forces to inuade <hi>England.</hi> And landing at <hi>Tinmouth</hi> (discomfeiting their first incounters) they marched into the heart <note place="margin">His death with the King of <hi>Norwey.</hi>

               <p>But from hence was he called with his wearied and broken forces, to a more fatall businesse in the South.

               <p>Besides, the <hi>Normans</hi> had a peculiar fight with long bowes, wherewith the <hi>English</hi> (then altogether vnacquainted) were especially ouerthrowne. And yet their owne Writers report, how the maine Battallion of the <hi>English</hi> (consisting of Bils, their chiefe and antient weapon) held in a body so close lockt together, as no force could dissolue them: till the <hi>Normans</hi> (faining to flye) drew them to a disordered a route, And so they excuse the fortune of the day.</p>
               <p>The body of King <hi>Harald,</hi> which at the sute of his mother (who sent two Monkes of the Abbey of <hi>Waltham</hi> to intreate the same of the Conqueror) was after much <note place="margin">King <hi>Harold</hi> buried at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</hi>

For as first, the Conquest of the <hi>Danes;</hi> brought it to the intyrest Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment it euer possest at home, and made it most redoubted of all the Kingdomes of the North: so did this of the <hi>Norman</hi> by comming in vpon it, make a way to let out, <note place="margin">

               <p>But the <hi>Normans,</hi> hauing more of the Sunne, and ciuility (by their commixtion with the <hi>English</hi>) begat smoother fashions, with quicker motions in them then before.

So that in the end, <hi>Charles</hi> was faine to buye his peace with the price of an alliance, and the whole Countrey of <hi>Nuestria</hi> (or <hi>Westrich</hi>) which of the <hi>Normans,</hi> was after called <hi>Normandy.</hi> And thereupon <hi>Roul</hi> became a Christian, and baptized, had the name of <hi>Robert,</hi> giuen by <hi>Robert,</hi> brother to <hi>Eudes</hi> late King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who then stood in competition for that Crowne with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Simple:</hi> and is sayd to haue vnder-aided <hi>Roul</hi> secretly, of purpose to make him friend his deseignes; though after he vrged it in an article against <hi>Charles,</hi> the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away his Countrey, and the sauouring of strangers.</p>
               <p>And thus came <hi>Roul</hi> to establish a State to his posterity, ordering the same with that iudgement and equity, as he left his name in a perpetuall reuerence, and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors a firme foundation to plant vpon. From him, in a direct line, descended sixe Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> in the space of 120. yeares: <hi>William,</hi> 1. <hi>Richard</hi> 1. <hi>Richard</hi> 2. who had two sonnes, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> that successiuely inherited the Dukedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> after he had gouerned eight yeares (either meerely for deuotion, which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ought rather deeme) or expiation for some secret guilt, wherewith his conscience might stand charged, about his brothers death (which because it was vntimely, might be thought vnnaturall) resolues to visite the Holy Sepulchre. And acquainting his Nobility therewithall, was by them much diswaded, in regard he had no issue: and for that (already they sayd) <hi>Alain,</hi> Earle of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> were in contestation, who should succeed him in the Dutchie: so that vpon his death, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7690:19"/>
their strife the Country was like, to become a prey to the souldier, from which, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science he was bound, by his best meanes to secure it. The Duke willed them to bee content: I haue (said he) a little Bastard, of whose worthinesse, I haue great hope, and I doubt not, but he is of my begetting: him will I inuest in the Dutchie as mine heire: And from hence forth I pray you take him for your Lord. The Earle of <hi>Brittaine</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his competition) to shew the affiance I haue in him I will constitute his gouernour, and Seneschall of <hi>Normandie;</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> shalbe his Guardian, and so I will leaue him to God, and your loyalties.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the Bishops and Barons did their homage to this base sonne, named <hi>William,</hi> who was the sixt Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> after <hi>Roule,</hi> begotten on <hi>Arlette,</hi> a meane woman of <hi>Falaise.</hi> And Duke <hi>Robert</hi> taking his intended iourney, deliuers the Child with his owne hand, to <hi>Henrie</hi> the first, King of <hi>France:</hi> whom before hee had mainely aided in preseruing his Crowne (left him by his father King <hi>Roberts</hi> Testament) against his elder brother, and his mother <hi>Constance,</hi> which with a great side of Nobility, stood for the right of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> according to the custome of <hi>France:</hi> And therefore might the more presume (if good turnes done to Princes could weigh so much, as their selfe-respects would not turne the skale) to haue had a faire discharge of his trust; and him for a Protector, whose power was best able to bee so. And causing the Childe to doe homage for his Duchie of <hi>Normandie,</hi> commits him to his Royall faith; departs his Court, and shortly after his life, in <hi>Asia.</hi> Whereupon his successor, but nine yeares of age, became obnoxious to all the miseries thar afflict Princes in their pupillage: besides the reproach of his birth; which though his honour and vertue might get ouer, yet lay it euer a barre in his way, and hindred his standing cleere, stood he neuer so high.</p>
               <p>The Nobles of <hi>Normandie</hi> soone (after his fathers death, by much intreaty, got him out of the <hi>French</hi> Kings hands) thinking the hauing him amongst them, would adde more to his Counsellors, and such as were in office: and the State of of a Court, awe his State the better. But soone they found, the hauing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (without his power) was, but to put them out, into more discord, and faction.</p>
               <p>For presently followed the murthering, and poysoning of Gouernors, displacing Officers, intrusion, supplantation, surprizings, and recouerings of his person, by a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, stubborne, haughtie, and incompatible of each others precedencie or neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But this was the least, as being done all for his person. Now followed more daungerous practises against him. His right was quarrelled by competitors, cleere in bloud, and great in meanes. Whereof the first (though farthest off in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) was <hi>Roger de Tresny,</hi> bringing a faire line from <hi>Roule,</hi> and much proofe of his owne worth, by hauing gotten great experience, in the <hi>Sarazine</hi> warre in <hi>Spaine:</hi> whereby vpon his returne, entertayning and feasting the great, and especiall men of worth; hee was growen powerfull, well followed, and beloued of many: in so much that at length, measuring his owne heigth, hee vrges, <hi>What wrong it was that a Bastard, and a Childe, should bee preferred before him, in the succession of the Dutchie, his Auncestors had noblie gotten: and what a shame the</hi> Normans (<hi>a people of that worth) would indure to bee so gouerned; seeing they had others of the renowned race of</hi> Roule, William <hi>and</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Normandie, of a lawfull and direct line, if they held him vnworthie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite the State.</hi> And being impatient (as is ambition that euer rides without raines) of any long delay, brings his claime to a strong battaile in the field, which by the valiancie of <hi>Roger de Beaumount,</hi> was vtterly defeited, and himselfe with his two brethren slaine. Whereby all feare, that way, was extinquished, and the reputation of the Duke and his, so much aduanced, as the King of <hi>France</hi> (notwithstanding his tutelarie charge) tooke from him the Castle of <hi>Thuilliers,</hi> and demolisht it, pretending the insolencies committed there, by the Garrisons, vpon his subiects: and makes shew as yet, onely to keepe things euen. But long it was not, ere hee plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his minde; aiding in person <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Arques,</hi> brother to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> and sonne to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second making his claime to the Dutchie, &amp; brings a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie army to succour <hi>Arques,</hi> assieged by Conte <hi>Guiffard,</hi> the Dukes Generall; who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7690:19"/>
(by a stratagem so trayned the <hi>French</hi> into an ambush) as hee ouerthrew their whole power, and returnes the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> with great losse, and dishonor: leauing (<hi>Arques</hi> the first <hi>Arch</hi> of triumph) to this Conquerour, not yet ariued to seuenteene yeares of age; and the discomfeited competitor (to seeke his fortunes with <hi>Eustace</hi> Earle of <hi>Bologne</hi>) finding vpon his returne little grace in Court; where fortune euer alters cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, and few regard men ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>This storme ouerpast, another succeeds more dangerous; there liued with Duke <hi>William,</hi> a young Lord of like yeares, named <hi>Guy</hi> sonne to <hi>Regnalt,</hi> Earle of <hi>Borgogne,</hi> and <hi>Alix,</hi> daughter to <hi>Richard</hi> the second, who comming to bee sensible of his interest, was aduised by some stirring spirits, to attempt for the Duchie, which they said apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to him in right, and was wrongfully vsurped by the Bastard: And to aduance his purpose, there happens deadly hostility betweene two of the greatest Lords of <hi>Normandie (Viconte Neele,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Bessin</hi>) whose debate, Duke <hi>William</hi> did not, or could not pacifie. This <hi>Guy</hi> (lately made Earle of <hi>Bryorn,</hi> and <hi>Vernon,</hi> interposed himselfe to compose this discord; and by the aduice of <hi>Grimoult de Plessis</hi> (a principall mouer in this worke) so wrought, that either of these Lords, turned the point of their malice vpon him, who in their quarrell fauouring neither, made both to hate him; and easily conspire with <hi>Guy</hi> to murther him at vnawares: which they had done, had not a certaine Foole (whom, for being held a naturall, they suspected not) noting their preparations, got away in the dead of the night to <hi>Valogne,</hi> knocking and crying at the gate, till hee was admitted to the Dukes presence, whom he willed in hast to flie, or he would bee murthered. The Duke seeing the Foole in this affright, thought dangers were not to be weighed by the <note place="margin">A Conspiracie discouered strangely.</note> worth of the reporter, but by their likelyhood; and knowing his fortune was liable vnto all suddaine assasinations; instantly takes horse and all alone postes to <hi>Fallaise,</hi> his especiall place of strength: on the way, his horse being tyred, about breake of daie, he comes to a little village called <hi>Rye,</hi> where, by good fortune, the gentleman of the place, was standing at his doore readie to goe abrode; of whom the Duke enquires the next way to <hi>Fallaise:</hi> The Gentleman perceiuing who hee was (though as then very vnwilling to be knowne) humblie craues the cause of his so strange and vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riding alone: The Duke seeing himselfe discouered, tels the occasion: the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (whose name was <hi>Robert de Rye</hi>) furnishes him with a fresh horse, and sends two of his sonnes to conduct him the neerest way to <hi>Fallaise:</hi> No sooner was he gone out of sight, but after post the conspirators, enquiring of the same Gentleman, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee saw the Duke; who answered, that hee was gone a little before, such a way (shewing them a diuers path) and rode on with them, offering his seruice to Conte <hi>Bessin;</hi> where they made themselues so powerfull, as the Duke withdrew him to <hi>Roan,</hi> and from thence to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to craue his aide, putting him in minde of, the faithfull seruice his father had done him: how he was his homager, vnder his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telarie charge, and had no other sanctuary of succour to flie vnto, in this case of his mutinous and turbulent Nobilitie; the effect whereof was of dangerous consequence to that Crowne. And so farre vrged the importancie of reliefe, as the King at length (who seemes was yet content to haue him bee, though not too strong, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture rather him then his competitor <hi>Guy de Burgogne</hi>) aided him in person with a puissant Army against these competitors, whom they found in the vale of <hi>Dunes</hi> with as great power and resolution to bid them battaile, as they to assaile them. Here one <hi>Guilleson,</hi> Vncle to <hi>Viconte Neel</hi> by the mother, forced his horse into the battailion of the <hi>French,</hi> and made at the King, and strake him downe with his Launce: which Conte Saint <hi>Paule</hi> perceiuing, hastes to incounter him with that violence, as both fell to the earth: but <hi>Guilleson</hi> soone gets vp, and though his horse was slaine vnder him, by <hi>Chastillon,</hi> hee escapes out of the presse, and after fled into <hi>Apulia</hi> with others. The King recouered, and more inkindled with this affront, spared not his person, to auenge his wrath. Duke <hi>William</hi> likewise (as it stood him most vpon) shewed effects of an all-daring and magnanimous Prince. And yet had not <hi>Ralfe de T<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7690:20"/>
After which, diuers of the conspirators (who had too great hearts to yeeld) passed the mountaines into <hi>Italie,</hi> to <hi>Robert Guiscard</hi> their Countryman (who of a priuate Gentleman, was now by his prowesse, become Lord of <hi>Apulia Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Sicile,</hi> within the space of twelue yeares) to whom they were exceeding welcome, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Guilleson,</hi> for hauing incountred with a King in the middest of his battaile, which made him of wider note. But the better to know, what starre these <hi>Norman</hi> spirits had, as borne for the reuolutions of those times, it shall not lie out of our way to shew, how they first came into <hi>Italie,</hi> vpon this occasion.</p>
               <p>There happened a debate betweene one <hi>Osmond Drengot,</hi> and <hi>William Repostell,</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen both valiant, and of great parentage in <hi>Normandie,</hi> who as they hunted in the forrest of <hi>Rouuerie</hi> (neere <hi>Rouan</hi>) with Duke <hi>Robert; Drengot</hi> slue <hi>Repostell,</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and fearing the fury of the Duke, and the friends of the slaine, fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so to <hi>Naples,</hi> where hee, with his small company of <hi>Normans</hi> that followed him, was entertained of the Duke <hi>de Bencuento,</hi> to serue him against the <hi>Sarasins,</hi> and <hi>Affricans,</hi> which miserably infested <hi>Apulia,</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> at that time. The bruite of which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement was no sooner spred in <hi>Normandy,</hi> but diuers valiant Gentlemen and Souldiers, allured with the hope of good fortune, passed the Alpes, got to their nation, and so wrought, as they grew formidable to these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and in the end, vtterly chaced and extinguished them. The <hi>Calabrians</hi> and <hi>Apulians,</hi> seeing themselues ridde of their enemies, would haue beene glad likewise (their turne serued) to bee rid of their friends, and either vsing them, more vnkindely then of custome, or they presuming more of desert, turned their swords vpon their intertayners. And first got a little place, which they fortified for the <hi>Rendeuous,</hi> and receipt of booty: And so augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting still their winnings, obteyned Territories, Cities, and Fortresses. After the death of <hi>Drengo,</hi> succeeded other gallant leaders, and at length <hi>Tancred, Signior de Hauteuille,</hi> in Constantine, with his twelue sonnes, came into <hi>Apulia,</hi> of whom his third sonne <hi>Robert,</hi> surnamed <hi>Guiscard,</hi> attained the commaund, and was a man of a faire sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cleere iudgement, and indefatigable courage. Hee conquered all <hi>Apulia, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria</hi> and <hi>Cicile,</hi> passed the Sea into <hi>Greece;</hi> releeued <hi>Michaell Diocrisius,</hi> Empetour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> defeited <hi>N cephorus</hi> that vsurped the Empire, and shortly after <hi>Alexius</hi> attempting the like: and in one yeare vanquished two Emperours, the one of <hi>Greece,</hi> the other of <hi>Germanie:</hi> Swayed the whole Estate of <hi>Italie,</hi> and was in a faire way to haue attained the Empire of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for himselfe, had hee not died in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beomond</hi> his eldest sonne, by his first wife, became after Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and is much renowned in the holy warres. <hi>Roger</hi> (of his second marriage with the daughter of the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi>) succeeded in the States of <hi>Italie,</hi> as more theirs by birth and bloud. His daughters were all highly married; Thus from a priuate Gentleman, came this famous <hi>Norman</hi> to leaue a succession of Kings, and Princes after him, and died the same yeare as did this <hi>William,</hi> his concurrent in the loue and fauour of fortune. And to this man fled all the discontented and desperate <hi>Normans</hi> during these ciuill warres the Duke had with so many competitors: and euery ouerthrow hee gaue them, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <hi>Guiscards</hi> forces in <hi>Italie;</hi> and especially this battaile of <hi>Dunes;</hi> which ended not the Dukes trauailes, for <hi>Guy de Burgogne</hi> escaping the fight, fortified the Castles of <hi>Briorn</hi> and <hi>Verneuille,</hi> but in the end was faine to render them both, and himselfe, to the Dukes mercie, and became his pencioner, who was his competitor; which act of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in the Duke, brought in many other to submit themselues; whereby they re-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned their segniories, but had their Castles demolished.</p>
               <p>Hauing ended this worke, new occasion to keepe him in action, was ministred by <hi>Geoffry Martle,</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> who warring vpon the <hi>Poictouins,</hi> incroached also vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neighbours States, and vsurped <hi>Alenson, Dampfront,</hi> and <hi>Passais,</hi> members of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandie:</hi> which to recouer, the Duke leauies an Armie, and first got <hi>Alenson,</hi> where (for that he was opprobriously skorned by the besieged who, when they saw him, would cry <hi>La Pel, La Pel,</hi> in reproach of the basenesse of his mother, and the trade of the place of his birth) hee shewed extreame cruelty. Then layes he siege
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7690:20"/>
to <hi>Dampfront;</hi> which to releeue, Conte <hi>Martel</hi> comes with his greatest forces: and the Duke to take notice of his strength, sends out <hi>Roger de Mongomerie,</hi> with two other knights to deliuer this message to the Earle, <hi>That if he came to victuall</hi> Dampfronte, <hi>he should finde him there the Porter to keepe him out:</hi> whereto the Earle returnes this answere: <hi>Tell the Duke, to morrow by daie breake, hee shall haue mee there on a white horse, readie to giue him the Combate, and I will enter</hi> Dampfront <hi>if I can; And to the end hee shall know me, I will weare a shield d'</hi> or, <hi>without any deuise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roger</hi> replies, <hi>Sir you shall not neede to take that paines, for to morrow morning, you shall haue the Duke in this place, mounted on a bay horse; And that you may know him, hee shall weare on the point of his Launce, a streamer of tasfata, to wipe your face.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with returning, each side prepares for the morning: when the Earle, busie in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his battailes, was aduertised by two horsemen, that came crossing the field, how <hi>Dampfronte,</hi> for certaine was rendred to the Duke; whereupon in great rage, hee presently departs with his Army: whereof a part, was (in passing a streight) cut off, by <hi>Viconte Neel,</hi> who for that seruice, redeemed his former offence, and was restored to the Dukes fauour, whom euer after hee faithfully serued. Those of <hi>Dampfronte,</hi> desperate of succour, presently yeelde themselues to the Duke, who with his ingines and forces remooues from thence to <hi>Hambrieres,</hi> a frontier Towne of Conte <hi>Martels,</hi> and by the way (had it not beene by himselfe discouered) hee had beene vtterly ouerthrowne by an ambush, which gaue him much to doe, and lost him verie many braue men. Wherewith hee grew so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that hee rushed into the troupes of his enemies; made at Conte <hi>Martel,</hi> stracke him downe with his sworde, claue his helmet, and cut off an eare: but yet hee escaped out of the preasse, though diuers were taken, and the <hi>Aniouuins</hi> vtterly defeited.</p>
               <p>Whilst thus hee was trauailed with an outward enemy, two more, were found at home, to conspire against him. <hi>William Guelan,</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortagne,</hi> discended from <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the second. And <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Eu,</hi> and <hi>Montreul,</hi> issuing from <hi>William,</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same <hi>Richard,</hi> and of <hi>Esselin,</hi> Countesse of <hi>Montreul:</hi> the first vpon suspition, the other vpon proofe, of an intention, was banished, and their estates seized: the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> he gaue to <hi>Robert:</hi> that of <hi>Eu</hi> to <hi>Odo</hi> (after Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi>) both his brethren by the mother. These assaults from abroade, these skornes, conspiracies, and vnder-workings at home, he passed before he was full 32 yeares of age: and thus his enemies made him, that sought to vndoe him. But now, more to vnderset and strengthen his State, against future practises, hee conuokes an assemblie of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Barons, and Gentlemen, causing them to receiue their oath of Fealtie, and raze their Castles, which done, he married <hi>Matilde,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Baldouin</hi> the sift Earle of <note place="margin">The Duke marries <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilde</hi> daughter of <hi>Balaouine</hi> the fift Earle of <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  <hi>Flaunders,</hi> but not without contrast and trouble: for his Vncle <hi>Mauger,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> excommunicates him, for matching within the forbidden degrees of kindred: she being daughter to <hi>Elinor,</hi> daughter to <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and so his fathers sisters daughter. To expiate for which offence (vpon a dispensation from Pope <hi>Victor</hi>) they were enioyned the building of certaine Hospitals for blind people: and two Abbeyes, the one for men, the other for women: which were erected at <hi>Caen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This match, and the ouer-matching his enemies, set him so high a marke of enuie in <note place="margin">The reasons why the King of France, warres with the <hi>Normans.</hi>
                  </note> the eye of <hi>France,</hi> which naturally loued not the <hi>Normans</hi> (whom in reproach they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called <hi>Trewans</hi>) as they easily incensed their King, who of himselfe was forward enough, to abate a power, growne so out of proportion with the rest of the Princes of his Dominions, to finde a quarrell (which confiners easily doe) to set vpon him: and to make it looke the fairer, pretends to correct the insolencies of the <hi>Normans</hi> committed on his territories, and to releeue Count <hi>Martel,</hi> opprest by the Duke; besides alleadging, <hi>It concerwed him in honour and iustice, to haue that Prouince, which held of his Crowne, to bee gouerned by a Prince of lawfull bloud, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christian order and Lawes Ecclesiasticall:</hi> And therefore resolueth vtterly to exterminate the Duke, and establish a legittimate Prince in the Dutchie. For which effect, two armies are gathered from all parts of his Kingdome; the one sent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7690:21"/>
along the riuer <hi>Sein,</hi> the other into the Country of <hi>Bessin,</hi> as meaning to incompasse him.</p>
               <p>The Duke likewise deuides his forces into two parts: sends his brother <hi>Odo,</hi> Earle of <hi>Eu, Walter Guifford</hi> Earle of <hi>Longueuill,</hi> and others with the one, to the Country of <hi>Caux;</hi> himselfe with the other takes towards <hi>Eureux</hi> (to make head to the King that was at <hi>Mante</hi>) and withdrawes all cattle and prouisions out of the flat Country, into Cities and Fortresses, for their owne store, and disfurnishment of the enemie. The Kings army marching from <hi>Beanuois,</hi> to <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and finding there a fat Country full of all prouisions, betooke them to make good cheere, and rests there all that night; thinking the <hi>Norman</hi> forces were yet with the Duke at <hi>Eureux;</hi> which, the army in <hi>Caux,</hi> conducted by <hi>Odo</hi> vnderstanding, marched all night, and by breake of day, gaue them so hot an alarme, and so sodaine, as put them all in rout, leauing horse, and armour, <note place="margin">The defeiture of the Armie of the King of <hi>France,</hi> by the <hi>Normans.</hi>
                  </note> and all to the assaylants; who made such a distruction of them, as of forty thousand, not the fourth part escaped.</p>
               <p>With this defeiture, the King of <hi>France</hi> is againe returned home, with great rage and griefe, and the Duke, with the redemption of the prisoners, recouers his peace, and the Castle of <hi>Thuilliers,</hi> taken from him in his vnder-age. Cont <hi>Martell</hi> though much dismayd, with the Kings ouerthrow, yet leaues not to make some attempts for the recouering his Townes; but with no successe. The Duke he saw was to well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued &amp; followed, for him to do any good without a stronger arme. Wherfore the next spring, he goes, againe to importune the King of <hi>France,</hi> to aide him against the Duke: who (he said) <hi>Was now growne so insolent vpon this peace, and the victorie he had stolne, and not wonne, that there was no liuing for his neighbours neere him:</hi> Besides, the <hi>Normans</hi> had the <hi>French</hi> in such derision, and base esteeme, as they made their act (at <hi>Mortimer</hi>) their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sport, and the subiect of their rimes: as if a King of <hi>France,</hi> vpon the losse of a few men, was retired, and durst not breake a dishonourable peace.</p>
               <p>With which instigation, and being stung with the touch of reproach, hee raises ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army far mightier then before, wherein were three Dukes, and twelue Earles, and notwithstanding the sollemne peace made, and so lately sworne with the Duke, hee enters <hi>Normandie</hi> in the haruest time, ouer-runnes and spoiles all the Country, along the Coast to <hi>Bessin:</hi> from whence marching to <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and <hi>Caen,</hi> with purpose to paste the riuer <hi>Diue</hi> at <hi>Varneuille,</hi> to destroy the Countries of <hi>Auge, Liseux,</hi> and <hi>Roumoys,</hi> euen to <hi>Roan:</hi> and finding the case-way long, and the bridge narrow, caused his vantguard to passe ouer first: and, to secure his <hi>Arierguard,</hi> conducted by the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe stayes behind in <hi>Caen,</hi> till his people, and their carriages were passed. Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> whom (all this while, stores his sortresses with men and victuall) makes himselfe as strong in the Towne of <hi>Falaise,</hi> as he could; hath no army in the field, but a running campe to be readie to take all aduantages: lets the fury of the storme spend it selfe, and hauing aduertisement of this passage, marched all night with 10 thousand men, and in the morning early, sets vpon the <hi>Arierguard,</hi> with so sodaine a cry and fury, as they who were before on the Case-way hearing this noise behinde, thrust forward their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, hasting to get ouer the bridge, with such a crowd and presse, as they brake it, &amp; many were drownd in the riuer. They who were gotten ouer, could not returne to aide the rest; nor the King (by reason of Marishes on both sides) yeeld any succour to his people; but stood a spectator of their slaughter, and the taking of sixe of his Earles, of whom one was the exiled Earle of <hi>Eu,</hi> whom the King (fauouring his great worth) had made Conte <hi>De Soissons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The griefe of this ouerthrow, shortly after gaue the King of <hi>France</hi> his death, and <note place="margin">The Armie of the King of <hi>France</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne at <hi>Varneuille</hi> by the <hi>Normans.</hi>
                  </note> the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> a ioyfull peace, which hee nobly imployed in the ordering and adorning his State: building, endowing, and decking Monasteries and Churches: gathering reliques from all parts to furnish his Abbeyes at <hi>Caen</hi> (where hee also erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Tombe for himselfe and his wife) feasting and rewarding his Nobles and men of worth: whereby hee so possest him of the hearts of all his people generally, as they were entirely his, for what he would.</p>
               <p>During this calme of his life, hee makes a iourney ouer into <hi>England,</hi> as if to visite <note place="margin">The Duke comes to visit his kinsman.</note> King <hi>Edward</hi> his kinsman: who, in regard of the preseruation, and breeding hee had

in <hi>Normandy,</hi> by Duke <hi>Richard</hi> the second (Grandfather to them both) gaue him most Royall entertainement: And here he shewed himselfe; and here (no doubt) hee found matter for his hopes to worke on. In this enteruiew hee discouered <hi>England,</hi> being to be presupposed, he came not to gather cockle-shels, on the shore, Nor was it long after ere <hi>Harold</hi> (whether of purpose to ratifie some paction closly contriued betwixt them: or by casualty of weather driuen into <hi>France</hi> (and so faine to make it seeme a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Harald</hi> goeth ouer into <hi>Normandy.</hi>
                  </note> iourney of purpose to the Duke is not certainely deliuered) was gallantly entertained in <hi>Normandy,</hi> presented with all shewes of Armes, brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there likewise feasted in that Court. And at his returne to <hi>Rouen,</hi> something was concluded, either <note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in likely-hood to deuide the Kingdome betweene them, or that <hi>Harold</hi> being a coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweller, and had the strongest hand in the State, should let in the Duke, and doe his best to helpe him to the Crowne, vpon conditions of his owne greatnesse, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was; promises were made and confirmed by oathes vpon the Euangelists, and all the sacred Reliques at <hi>Rouen,</hi> in the presence of diuers great persons. Besides for <note place="margin">His promises to the Duke.</note> more assurance, <hi>Harald</hi> was fyanced to <hi>Adeliza,</hi> the Dukes daughter, and his brother <hi>Wolnot,</hi> left a pledge for the performance.</p>
               <p>This intercourse made the trans-action of the fate of England, and so much was done, either by King <hi>Edward</hi> or <hi>Harald</hi> (though neithers act, if any such were, was of power to preiudice the State, or alter the course of a right succession) as gaue the Duke a colour to claime the Crowne, by a donation made by Testament, which being against the Law and Custome of the Kingdome, could be of no validity at all. For the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> being held, not as Patrimoniall, but in a succession by remotion (which is a succeeding to anothers place) it was not in the power of King <hi>Edward</hi> to collate the same by any dispositiue and testamentary will, the right discending to the next of bloud, onely by the Custome and Law of the Kingdome: For the Successour is not sayd properly to be the heire of the King, but the Kingdome, which makes him so, and cannot bee put from it by any act of his Predecessour. But this was onely his claime; the right was of his owne making, and no otherwise, For as soone as hee had heard of the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> with the Election, and Coronation of <hi>Harald</hi> (for they came both together) hee assembles the States of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and acquaints them with the right he had to <hi>England, Soliciting an extention of their vtmost meanes for</hi>

                  <hi>his recouery thereof, and auengement of the periured Vsurper</hi> Harald; <hi>shewing them apparant probabilitie of successe, by infallible intelligence hee had from the State, his strong partie therein, with the debility and distraction of the people; What glorie, wealth, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it would adde to their Nation, the obtayning of such a Kingdome, as was thus oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely layd open for them, if they apprehended the present occasion.</hi> All which remonstrances notwithstanding, could enduce but very few to like of this attempt, and those such who had long followed him in the warres, exhausted their estates, and content to runne vpon any aduenture that might promise likelyhood of aduancement. The rest were of diuers opinions: some that it was sufficient to hold and defend their owne Country; without hazarding themselues, to conquer others; and these were men of the best abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: others were content to contribute, but so sparingly, as would little aduance the businesse: and for the most part they were so tyred with the former warres, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to embrace the blessing of peace, as they were vnwilling to vndergoe a certaiue trouble for an vncertaine good. And with these oppositions, or faint offers, the Dukes <note place="margin">The subtil proceeding of the Duke with his Nobles.</note> purpose, at first, had so little way, as did much perplex him: At length, seeing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and difficulty in generall: he deales with his neerest and most trusty friends in particular, being such as he knew affected the glory of action, and would aduenture their whole estates with him. As <hi>William fitz Auber, Conte de Bretteuile Gualier Guifford</hi> Earle of <hi>Logueuille, Roger de Beaumont,</hi> with others, especially his owne brothers, <hi>Odo</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne:</hi> these in full assembly hee wrought to make their offers: which they did in so large a proportion; and especially <hi>William fitz Auber</hi> (who made the first offer, to furnish forty ships with men and munition; the Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> forty the Bishop of <hi>Mans</hi> thirty, and so others, according, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their abilities) as the rest of the assemblie, doubting if the action succeeded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7690:22"/>
without their helpe (the Duke aryuing to that greatnesse) would beare in minde, what little minde they shewed to aduance his desires, beganne to contribute more largely. The Duke, finding them yeelding, though not in such sort as was requisite for such a worke; dealt with the Bishops and great men a part, so effectually, as at length hee gote of them seuerally, which of altogether hee could neuer haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, and causing each mans contribution to bee registred; inkindled such an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation amongst them, as they who lately would doe nothing, now striued who should doe most.</p>
               <p>And not onely wan he the people of his owne Prouinces, to vndertake this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">The French likewise ayde the Duke.</note> but drew by his faire perswasions and large promises, most of the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> to aduenture their persons, and much of their estates with him; as <hi>Robert fitz Haruays,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Brittaine, Ponthien, Bologne, Poictou, Mayne; Neuers, Hiesms, Aumal; Le Signior de Tours,</hi> and euen his mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Martel,</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> became to bee as forward as any. All which, hee sure could neuer haue induced, had not his vertues and greatnesse gained a wide opinion and reputation amongst them. Although in these aduancements and turnes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there is a concurrency of dispositions, and a constitution of times prepared for it: yet is it strange, that so many mighty men of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, would aduenture their liues and fortunes to adde <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Normandie,</hi> to make it more then <hi>France,</hi> and so great a Crowne to a Duke, who was to great for them already. But where mutations are destined, the counsels of men must be corrupted, and there will fall out all aduantages to serue that businesse.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> who should haue strangled this disseigne in the birth, was a <note place="margin">The reason of the Dukes powre.</note> child, and vnder the curature of <hi>Baldouin,</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> whose daughter the Duke had married, and was sure to haue rather furtherance then any opposition that way: Besides, to amuze that Court, and dazella young Prince, he promised faithfully, if hee conquered this Kingdome; to hold it of that King, as he did the Dutchie of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and doe him homage for the same; which would adde a great glory to that Crowne. Then was hee before hand with Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> (to make religion giue reputation and auowment to his pretended right) promising likewise to hold it of the Apostolique Sea, if hee preuailed in his enterprize. Whereupon the Pope sent him a Banner of the Church, with an <hi>Agnus</hi> of Gold, and one of the haires of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> 4. sent him a Prince of <hi>Almaine</hi> with forces, but of what name, or his number, is not remembred: so that wee see it was not <hi>Normandie</hi> alone that subdued <hi>England,</hi> but a collected power out of all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> with the aydes of other Princes. And by these meanes, made hee good his vndertaking, and within eight monethes was readie furnished with a powerfull Army at Saint <hi>Valerie</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> whence he transported the same into <hi>England</hi> in 896 shippes, as some write. And this was the man, and thus made to subdue <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now hauing gotten, the great and difficult battaile, before remembred, at <note place="margin">1066. Anno. Reg. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Hastings,</hi> the foureteenth of October 1066. bee marched without any opposition to <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morchar,</hi> Earles of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Mercland</hi> (brothers of eminent dignitie and respect in the Kingdome) had laboured with all their power to stirre the hearts of the people for the conseruation of the State, and establishing <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> the next of the Royall issue, in his right of the Crowne: whereunto other of the Nobilitie had likewise consented; had they not seene the Bishops auerse or wauering. For, as then, to the Clergie, any King (so a Christian) was all one: they had their Prouince a part, deuided from secular domination: and of a Prince (though a stranger) who had taken vp so much of the world before hand, vpon credite and fame <note place="margin">Reason for the yeelding of the Clergie.</note> of his piety and bountie, they could not but presume well for their estate: and so were content to giue way to the present Fortune.</p>
               <p>(The Nobility, considering they were so borne, and must haue a King: not to take him (that was of power to make himselfe) would shew more of passion then prouidence: &amp; to be now behind hand to receiue him, with more then submission, was as if to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: <note place="margin">What moued the Nobles to yeeld.</note> which (with the distrust of each others faith) made them striue &amp; run headlong

who should be first to pre-occupate the grace of seruitude, and intrude them into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine subiection.</p>
               <p>The Commons (like a strong vessell that might haue beene for good vse) was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by left, without a sterne, and could not moue but irregularly. So that all estates in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, either corrupted with new hopes, or transported with feare, forsooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and their distressed Countrey. Vpon his approach to <hi>London,</hi> the Gates were all set open: the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Stigand,</hi> with other Bishops, the Nobility, Magistrates, and People, rendting themselues in all obedience vnto him: and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning plausible protestations of his future Gouernment, was on <hi>Christmas</hi> day, then next following, Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by <hi>Aldred,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> for that <hi>Stigand</hi> was not held Canonically inuested in his Sea: and yet thought to haue beene a forward mouer of this alteration.</p>
               <p>Heere, according to the accustomed forme, at his Coronation, the Bishops and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons <note place="margin">The Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oath of <hi>William</hi> 1.</note> of the Realme, tooke their oaths, to be his true and loyall subiects, and he reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally (being required thereunto by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi>) made his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall oath, before the Altar of Saint <hi>Peter, To defend the Holy Churches of God, and the Rectors of the same: To gouerne the Vniuersall people, subiect vnto him iustly: To establish equall Lawes, and to see them duely executed.</hi> Nor did he euer claime any power <note place="margin">King <hi>Williams</hi> submission to the orders of the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> by Conquest, but as a regular Prince, submitted himselfe to the orders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: desirous rather to haue his Testamentary title (howsoeuer weake) to make good his successiou, rather then his sword. And though the Stile of <hi>Conqueror</hi> by the flattery of the time, was after giuen him; he shewed by all the course of his Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he assumed it not: introducing none of all those alterations (which followed) by violence, but a milde gathering vpon the disposition of the State, and the occasions offered, and that by way of reformation. And now taking Hostages for his more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and order for the defence and Gouernment of his Kingdome, at the opening of the spring next, he returnes into <hi>Normandy,</hi> so to settle his affaires there, as they might not distract him from his businesse in <hi>England,</hi> that required his whole powers.</p>
               <p>And to leaue here all sure behind him, he commits the rule of the Kingdome, to his brother the Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and to his Cosin <hi>Fitz</hi>

               <p>In his absence, which was all that whole sommer, nothing was here attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, but onely that <hi>Edric,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Forrester,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Kings of the <hi>Welsh,</hi> to his aide, and forraged onely the remote borders of that Country. The rest of the Kingdome stood quiet, expecting what would become of that new world, wherein as yet they found no great alteration, their lawes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties remaining the same they were before, and might hope by this accession of a new Prouince; the state of <hi>England</hi> would be but inlarged in dominion abroad, and not impaired in profit at home, by reason the Nation was but small, and of a plentifull, and not ouer-peopled Countrey, likely to impester them.</p>

               <p>Wherein, he had more to do, then in his battell at <hi>Hastings;</hi> seeing all remunerations, with supplies of money, must be raised out of the stocke of this Kingdome, which could

not but be likesome to the State in generall, and all preferments and dignities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser'd on his, to be either by vacancies, or displacing others, which must needs breed very feeling grieuances in particular. And yet wee finde no great men thrust out of their roomes, but such as put themselues out, by reuolting, after his establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their fealtie giuen, as appeares by the controuersie betweene <hi>Warren</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Sherburn</hi> of <hi>Sherburn</hi> Castle in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> which castle though the King had giuen to <hi>Warren,</hi> yet (when <hi>Sherburn</hi> alledged, <hi>How hee neuer bare Armes against him: <note place="margin">Cambden Nors.</note> that hee was his subiect as well as the other, and held his Lands by that Law which he had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished amongst all his subiects,</hi> the King gaue iudgement against <hi>Warren,</hi> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Sherburn</hi> should hold his Land in peace. So that it seemes, hee contented himselfe and his, for the time, onely with what he found here ready, and with filling vp their places, who were slaine in the battell, or fled, as many were, with the sonnes of <hi>Harald</hi> out of the Kingdome. Such Gentlemen as he could not presently preferre, <note place="margin">M.

Which induced him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertaine this Prince, dispossest of his right, but to enter league with him for the publique safetie; And to inchaine it the stronger, hee takes to wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> the <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Scots</hi> enters league with the English Nobility and marries <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars</hi> sister.</note> sister of <hi>Edgar</hi> (a Ladie indued withall blessed vertues) by whom the bloud of our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings was preserued, and conioyned with the <hi>Norman</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and so became <hi>English</hi> againe.

               <p>And after King <hi>William</hi> had appeased a Commotion in the West, which the sonnes of <hi>Harald,</hi> with forces out of <hi>Ireland</hi> had raised, &amp; also repressed the rebellions of <hi>Excester,</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> he takes his iourney in person Northward with all expedition (least the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy there, should grow to high in heart and opinion, vpon the great slaughter of his people, made at <hi>Yorke;</hi> and the defeiture of his Brother and Leiuetenant, <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> slaine with seuen hundreth <hi>Normans</hi> at <hi>Durham</hi>) where, at his first comming he so wrought, that he either discomfeited, or corrupted the Generals of the <hi>Danicque</hi> forces (newly arriued to ayde the Lords; sent by <hi>Swaine,</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> vnder the conduct of his two sonnes, <hi>Harald</hi> and <hi>Knute,</hi> with a Nauie of three hundreth saile) and after sets vpon the Army of the Lords, weakened both in strength and hope, by this departure of their Confederates, and puts them to flight: Which done, he vtterly wasted, and laide desolate, all that goodly Countrey betweene <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> the space of 60. miles, as it might be no more a succour to the enemy: And the like course he used on all the Coasts where any aptlandings lay for inuasions; and so returnes to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most of the Lords after this defeit, came in, vpon publique faith giuen them, and were conducted to <hi>Barkehamsted,</hi> by the Abbot <hi>Fredricke;</hi> where, vpon their submission, and Oath of Allegeance re-taken, they had their pardon, and restitution of grace graunted by the King, who it seemes was so willing to acquiet them, that againe he takes his personall Oath before the Arch-bishop <hi>Lanfrancke,</hi> and the Lords, <hi>To obserue</hi>

               <p>But long it was not ere many of these Lords (whether vpon intelligence of new <note place="margin">1074. Anno.

The Earle <hi>Edwyn,</hi> making towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was murthered by his owne people. The Lords <hi>Morchar,</hi> and <hi>Hereward,</hi> betooke them to the Isle of <hi>Eley,</hi> meaning to make good that place for that Winter; whether also repaired the Earle <hi>Syward,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the King, who was no time-giuer vnto growing dangers, besets all the Isle with flat boates on the East, and made a bridge of two miles long on the West, and safely brought in his people vpon the enemy; who seeing themselues surprized; yeelded all to the Kings mercy, except <hi>Hereward,</hi> who desperatly marched with his people through the Fennes; and recouered <hi>Scotland:</hi> The rest were sent to diuerse Prisons, where they died, or remained during the Kings life.</p>
               <p>Those Lords who persisted loyall vpon this last submission, were all imployed and well graced with the King, as <hi>Edric</hi> the Forrester (and first that rebelled in his Raigne) was held in cleere trust, and neere about him. <hi>Gospatrice</hi> he made Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and sent him against <hi>Malcolin,</hi> who in this time, subdues the Countries of <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, Cleueland,</hi> and <hi>Comberland: Waltheof,</hi> sonne to the Earle <hi>Syward,</hi> he held so worthy to be made his, as he married him to his Neece <hi>Iudith,</hi> though he had beene a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall actor in the Northerne commotion (and in defending the Citty of <hi>Yorke</hi> against him: is sayd to haue striken off the heads of diuerse <hi>Normans,</hi> one by one, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a breach, to the admiration of all about him) shewing therein that true touch of the noblest nature, to loue vertue, euen in his enemies.</p>
               <p>And now seeing <hi>Scotland</hi> to be the especiall retraite for all conspirators, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented in his Kingdome, yeelding them continuall succour, and assistance, and where his compecitor <hi>Edgar</hi> liued, to be get and nurse perpetuall matter for their hopes, and at hand for all aduantages; he enters that Kingdome with a puissant Army: which, incountring with more necessities then forces, soone grew tired, and both Kings, considering of what difficulties the victory would consist, were willing, to take the safest way to there ends, and vpon faire ouertures, to conclude a peace;

               <p>Shortly after this late made peace, Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> voluntarily came in, and submitted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> submitted him selfe to King <hi>William.,</hi>
                  </note> himselfe to the King, being then in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and was restored to grace, and a faire maintenance, which held him euer after quiet. And it made well at that time for the fortune of the King, howsoeuer for his owne, being thought to haue ill-timed his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires (either through want of seasonable intelligence, or dispaire of successe) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">1075. Anno. Reg. 9.</note> too soone that submission, which was latter or neuer to be done. For in this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King, <hi>Roger Fits Auber,</hi> the young Earle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandement, gaue his sister in marriage to <hi>Raph Waher,</hi> Earle of <hi>Northfolke,</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and at the great Solemnization thereof, the two Earles conspired with <hi>Eustace</hi> Earle of <hi>Boloigne</hi> (who secretly came ouer to this festiuall) and with the Earle <hi>Waltheof,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Lords, to call in the <hi>Danes,</hi> and by maine power to keepe out and dispossesse the King. Who hauing thus passed ouer so many gulfes of forraine <note place="margin">1076. Anno. Reg. 10.</note> dangers, might little imagine of any wracke so neere home; and that those, whom he had most aduanced, should haue the especiall hand in his destruction: But no rewards, are benefits (that are not held so) nor can euer cleere the accounts with them that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their merits. And had not this conspiracy bene opportunely discouered (which some say, was by the Earle <hi>Waltheof,</hi> moued with the vglinesse of so soule an ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) they had put him againe to the winning of <hi>England.</hi> But now the fire bewrayed before it flamed, was soone quenched by the diligence of <hi>Odon</hi> the Kings Vice-gerent, the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> and others, who kept the Conspirators from ioyning their forces: So that they neuer came to make head, but were either surprized, or forced to flye. The Earle <hi>Roger Fitz Auber</hi> was taken, and some say executed; and so was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Earle <hi>Waltheof,</hi> whose dissent from the act, could not get him pardon for his former consent, though much compassion in respect of his great worthinesse. But the <note place="margin">1077. Anno. Reg. 11.</note> wide distent of these tumors, fed from many secret vaines, seemed to be of that danger, as required this extremity of cure, especially in a part so apt for infection, vpon any the like humours.</p>
               <p>For this Conspiracy seemes to take motion from a generall league of all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes here about, as may well be gathered by their seuerall actions. First in the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> by defending <hi>Dole</hi> in <hi>Brittaigne</hi> (a Castle of <hi>Raph de Waher</hi>) against the King of <hi>England,</hi> and in likelihood, imploying the Earle of <hi>Boloigne</hi> to wards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators: In <hi>Swayne</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> by sending a Nauy of two hundreth saile, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of his sonne <hi>Knute,</hi> and others. In <hi>Drone</hi> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the sonnes of <hi>Harald</hi> with 65. ships. In <hi>Malcoline,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Wales,</hi> by their readinesse to assist. But the <hi>Danes</hi> being on the coast, and hearing how their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates had sped, with the great preparations the King had made, after some pillage taken vpon the coast of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> returned home, and neuer after arriued to disturbe this land. Though in <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 19. <hi>Knute,</hi> then King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> after the death of <hi>Swaine</hi> (intending to repaire the dishonour of his two last aduentures past)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7690:24"/>
and to put for the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> his predecessors had holden, prepared a Nauie of a thousand saile, and was aided with sixe hundreth more by <hi>Robert le Frison</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> (whose daughter he had married.) But the winds held so contrary for two yeares together, as vtterly quasht that enterprize; and freed the King, and his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors for euer after, from future molestation that way.</p>
               <p>But this businesse put the State to an infinit charge, the King entertayning all that time (besides his <hi>Normans</hi>) <hi>Hugh,</hi> brother to the King of <hi>France,</hi> with many companies <note place="margin">1078. Anno. Reg. 12.</note> of <hi>French.</hi> Finding the <hi>English</hi> (in respect of many great families allied to the <hi>Danes</hi>) to incline rather to that Nation, then the <hi>Norman,</hi> and had experience of the great and neere intelligence continually passing betweene them.</p>
               <p>And these were all the warres he had within the Kingdome, sauing in <hi>An. Regni</hi> 13. he subdued <hi>Wales,</hi> and brought the kings there, to doe him homage. His warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <note place="margin">1079. Anno. Reg. 13</note> were all about his Dominions in <hi>France,</hi> first raised by his owne sonne <hi>Robert,</hi> left Lieuftenant gouernor of the Dutchie of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Countie of <hi>Mayne,</hi> who in his fathers absence, tasting the glorie of commaund, grew to assume the absolute <note place="margin">The Kings of <hi>wales</hi> doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to King <hi>william.</hi>
                  </note> rule of the Prouince, causing the Barons there, to do him homage (as Duke) not as Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, &amp; leagues him with the King of <hi>France,</hi> who working vpon the easinesse of his youth, and ambition, was glad to apprehend that occasion to disioynt his estate, who was growen too great for him. And the profusse largesse, and disorderlie expence, whereto <hi>Robert</hi> was addicted, is nourished by all waies possible, as the meanes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brake him in those difficulties of still getting mony, that could not but needs yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall occasion to intertain both his own discontent &amp; theirs from whom, his supplies must be raised. And though thereby he purchased him the title of <hi>Courtois,</hi> yet he lost the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Robert</hi> of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy titled <hi>Courtois.</hi>
                  </note> opinion of good gouernment, and constrayned the estates of <hi>Normandie,</hi> to complaine to his father of the great concussion, and violent exactions he vsed amongst them.</p>
               <p>The King vnderstanding the fire thus kindled in his owne house, that had set others all in combustion, hasts with forces into <hi>Normandie,</hi> to haue surprized his sonne; who aduertised of his comming, furnisht with two thousand men at Armes, by the King of <hi>France,</hi> lay in ambush where he should passe; sets vpon him, defeited most of his people, and in the pursuite happened to incounter with himselfe, whom hee vnhorsed, and wounded in the arme, with his Launce; but perceiuing by his voice, it was his father, he hasted to remounte him, humbly crauing pardon for his offence: which the father (seeing in what case he was) granted, howsoeuer he gaue; and vpon his submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, tooke him with him to <hi>Rouen;</hi> whence, after cured of his hurt, hee returned with his sonne <hi>William</hi> (likewise wounded in the fight) into <hi>England.</hi>

Anno. Reg. 15.</note> and his young sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> with the association of charge and like power (but of more trust) to the gouernment of <hi>Normandie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the two Princes had beene there a while, they went to visite the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Constance,</hi> where feasting certaine dayes, vpon an after dinner, <hi>Henry</hi> wanne <note place="margin">1082.

                     <hi>Louis</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> sonnes of the Kings of France, and England.</note> they suddenly tooke horse, and with much adoe they recouered <hi>Pontoise,</hi> from the Kings people that pursued them. This quarrell arising, vpon the in-ter-meeting of these Princes (a thing that seldome breeds good bloud amongst them) re-enkindled
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7690:25"/>
a heate of more rancor in the fathers, and beganne the first warre betweene the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> For presently the King of <hi>France,</hi> complots againe with <hi>Robert</hi> (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a partner) cnters <hi>Normandie,</hi> and takes the Citie of <hi>Vernon.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> inuades <hi>France,</hi> subdues the Country of <hi>Zaintonge</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> and returnes to <note place="margin">1026.

                  <hi>Rouen,</hi> where the third time, his sonne <hi>Robert</hi> is reconciled vnto him, which much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints and vexes the King of <hi>France,</hi> who thereupon, summons the King of <hi>England,</hi> to doe him homage for the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> which he refused to doe, saying, <hi>Hce held it of none but God and his sword.</hi> For the Dutchie of <hi>Normandie</hi> hee offers him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: but that would not satisfie the King of <hi>France,</hi> whom nothing would, but what <note place="margin">King <hi>William</hi> denies to do homage for England, to the King of France.</note> he could not haue, the Maistery: and seekes to make any occasion the motiue of his quarrell: and againe inuades his territories, but with more losse then profit. In the end, they conclude a certaine crazie peace, which held no longer then King <hi>William</hi> had recouered a sicknesse, whereinto (through his late trauaile, age, and corpulencie) he was falne: at which time, the King of <hi>France,</hi> then yong and lustie, ieasting at his great belly, wherof he said, he lay in, at <hi>Rouen</hi> so irritated him, as being recouered, he gathers al <note place="margin">1087. Anno.

               <p>Now for his gouernment in peace, and the course hee held in establishing the <note place="margin">His gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in peace.</note> Kingdome thus gotten; first after he had represt the conspiracies in the North, and well quieted all other parts of the State (which now being absolutely his, hee would haue to bee ruled by his owne Law) hee beganne to gouerne all by the Customes of <hi>Normandie.</hi> Whereupon the agreeued Lords, and sadde people of <hi>England,</hi> tender their humble petition, <hi>Beseeching him, in regard of his oath made at his Coronation: And by the soule of Saint</hi> Edward, <hi>from whom hee had the Crowne, and Kingdome; vnder whose Lawes they were borne and bred; That he would not adde that miserie, to deliuer them vp to bee iudged, by a strange Law they vnderstood not.</hi> And so earnestly they wrought, that hee was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to confirme that by his Charter, which hee had twice fore-promised by his oath: <note place="margin">What were the lawes of England.</note> And gaue commaundement to his Iusticiaries to see these Lawes of Saint <hi>Edward</hi> (so called, not that he made them, but collected them out of <hi>Merchen</hi>-Law, <hi>Dane</hi>-Law, and <hi>Westsex</hi>-Law) <hi>To be inuiolablie obserued throughout the Kingdome.</hi> And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this confirmation, and the Charters afterward granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and King <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the same effect; there followed a great inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation both in the Lawes and gouernment of <hi>England:</hi> So that this seemes rather done to acquiet the people, with a shew of the continuation of their auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and liberties, then that they enioyed them in effect. For the little confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie betweene them of former times, and these that followed vpon this change of State, shew from what head they sprang. And though there might bee some veynes issuing from former originals, yet the maine streame, of our Common-law, with the <note place="margin">The originall of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law now vsed.</note> practise thereof, flowed out of <hi>Normandie,</hi> notwithstanding all obiections can bee made to the contrary. For before these collections of the <hi>Confessors,</hi> thère was no vniuersall Law of the Kingdome, but euery seuerall Prouince held their owne Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes: all the inhabitants from <hi>Humber</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> vsed the <hi>Danique</hi> Law: <hi>Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the middle part of the Countrie, and the State of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> had their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall constitutions, as being seuerall Dominions: And though for some few yeares there seemed to bee a reduction of the <hi>Heptarchie,</hi> into a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> yet held it not so long together (as we may see in the succession of that broken gouernment) as to settle one forme of order current ouer all; but that euery Prouince, according to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular founders, had their customes a part, and held nothing in common (besides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the constitutions thereof) but with the vniuersalitie of <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the rites of nations, and that <hi>ius innatum,</hi> the Common-law of all the world, which we see to be as vniuersall, as are the cohabitations, and societies of men,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7690:25"/>
and serues the turne to hold them together in all Countries, howsoeuer they may differ in their formes. So that by these passages, we see what way wee came, where wee are, and the furthest end wee can discouer of the originall of our Common-law; and to striue to looke beyond this, is to looke into an vncertaine vastnesse, beyond our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning. Nor can it detract from the glory of good Customes, if they bring but a pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of 600 yeares to approue their gentilitie; seeing it is the equity, and not the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of of lawes, that makes them venerable, and the integritie of the professors thereof, the profession honored. And it were well with mankinde, if dayes brought not their corruptions, and good orders were continued with that prouidence, as they were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. But this alteration of the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> bred most heauie doleances, not onely in this Kings time, but long after: For whereas before, those Lawes they had, <note place="margin">The Law of England put into a forraine Language.</note> were written in their owne tongue, intelligible to all; now are they translated into <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and practized wholly in the <hi>Norman</hi> forme and Language; thereby to draw the people of this Kingdome, to learne that speech for their owne need, which otherwise they would not doe; And seeing a difference in tongue, would continue a difference in affections; all meanes was wrought to reduce it to one <hi>Idiom,</hi> which yet was not in the power of the Conqueror to doe, without the extirpation, or ouerlaying the Land-bred people; who being so far in number (as they were) aboue the inuadors; both retaine the maine of the Language, and in few yeares, haue those who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them, vndistinguishably theirs. For notwithstanding the former Conquest by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and now this by the <hi>Norman</hi> (the solid bodie of the Kingdome, still consisted of the <hi>English</hi>) and the accession of strange people, was but as riuers to the Ocean, that changed not it, but were changed into it. And though the King laboured what hee could to turne all to <hi>French, By enioyning their children here to vse no other Language, with their</hi> Grammer <hi>in schooles, to haue the Lawes practized in</hi> French, <hi>all petitions and businesse of Court in</hi> French, <hi>No man graced but he that spake</hi> French, yet soone after his dayes, all returnes naturall English againe (but Law) and that still held forraine, and became in the end wholly to be inclosed in that language: nor haue we now, other marke of our subiection and inuassellage from <hi>Normandie,</hi> but onely that, and that still speakes <hi>French</hi> to vs in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>And herewithall, <hi>New Termes, new Constitutions, new Formes of Pleas, new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Courts,</hi> are now introduced by the <hi>Normans;</hi> a people more inured to litigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of spirits more impatient, and contentious, then were the <hi>English:</hi> who (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their continuall warre, wherein Law is not borne, and labour to defend the publicke) were more at vnitie in their priuate: and that small time of peace they had, Deuotion, and good fellowship entertained. For their Lawes and constitutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee see them plaine, briefe, and simple, without perplexities, hauing neither fold nor pleite, commanding; not disputing: Their grants and transactions as briefe and simple, which shewed them a cleere-meaning people, retayning still the nature of that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Append.</note> plaine realnesse they brought with them, vncomposed of other fashion, then their own, and vnasfecting imitation.</p>
               <p>And for their tryals (in cases criminall) where manifest proofes failed, they continued their antient custome, held from before their Christianitie (vntill this great alteration) which trials they called <hi>Ordeal;</hi> Or (<hi>signifying) Right,</hi> Deale, <hi>Part, whereof they had these</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The English trials in cases criminall.</note> 
                  <hi>kinds:</hi> Ordeal <hi>by fire, which was for the better sort, and by water for the inferiour: That of Fire, was to goe blindfold ouer certaine plough-shares, made red hote; and laide an vneuen distance one from another. That of Water was either of hot, or cold: in the one to put their armes to the elbow, in the other to bee cast headlong.</hi> According to their escapes or hurts, they were adiudged: <hi>Such as were cast into the riuers, if they sancke were held guiltlesse, if not, culpable, as eiected by that Element.</hi> These trials they called <hi>the iudgements of God, and they were performed with solemne Oraisons.</hi> In some cases, <hi>The accused was admitted to</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7690:26"/>With these, they had <hi>the triall of Campefight, or single combat</hi> (which likewise the <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> originally of the same <hi>German</hi> Nation, brought into <hi>Italy) permitted by the Law, in cases either of safetie, and fame, or of possessions.</hi> All which trials, shew them to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in any other forme of Law, or to neglect it; Nor would they bee induced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe these Customes, and determine their affaires by Imperiall or Pontificiall Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, no more then would the <hi>Lumbards</hi> forsake their duellary Lawes in <hi>Italy,</hi> which their Princes (against some of their wils) were constrained to ratifie, as <hi>Luyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prandus,</hi> their King, thus ingeniously confesses. <hi>Wee are vncertaine of the iudgement of God, and wee haue heard many by fight, to haue lost their cause, without iust cause; yet in respect of the custome of our Nation, we cannot auoide an impious Law.</hi> But all these formes of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and trials, had their seasons; Those of Fire, and Water, in short time after the Conquest, grew disused, and in the end vtterly obrogated by the Pope; as deriued <note place="margin">The English trials.</note> from Paganisme; That of combat continues longer-liued, but of no ordinarie vse: And all actions now, both criminall and reall, beganne to be wholly adiudged by the verdict of twelue men, according to the custome of <hi>Normandy,</hi> where the like forme is vsed, and called by the name of <hi>Enquest,</hi> with the same cautions for the Iurors, as it is here continued to this day. Although some hold opinion, that this forme of triall, was of vse in this Kingdome from all antiquitie, and alledge an Ordinance of King <hi>Ethelred</hi> (father to the Confessor) <hi>willing in their Gemote, or conuentions, monethly held in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hundred, twelue graue men of free condition, should with the</hi> Greue, <hi>the chiefe Officer amongst them, sweare vpon the Euangelists, to iudge euery mans cause aright.</hi> But here wee see twelue men were to be assessors with the <hi>Greue</hi> to iudge, and no Iurors, according to this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of triall now vsed; Besides, had there beene any such forme, we should aswell haue heard thereof in their Lawes and practise, as of those other kinds of <hi>Ordeal,</hi> onely, and vsually mentioned.</p>
               <p>But whatsoeuer innouations were in all other things; the gouernment for the peace <note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Law for the peace.</note> and securitie of the Kingdome (which most imported the King to looke vnto) seemes to be contrnued as before, and for that businesse he found here better Lawes establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the wary care of our former Kings, then any hee could bring. Amongst which especially was <hi>the Borough Law, wherby euery free man of the Commons stood as surety for each</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Borough Law of the Saxons.</note> 
                  <hi>others behauiour, in this sort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kingdome was deuided into Shieres or Shares, euery Shiere consisting of so many Hundreds, and euery Hundred of a number of Boroughs, Villages, or Tythings, contayning ten housholders, whereof;</hi> If any one should commit an vnlawfullact, the other nine were to attach and bring him to reason: If hee fled, 31 dayes were enioysed him to appeare: If in the meane time apprehended, hee was made to restore the damage done; otherwise the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughead (to say the Tythingman) was to take with him two of the same Village, and out of three other Villages next ad oyning as many (that is, the Tythingman, and two other of the principall <note place="margin">Saxon Lawes.</note> men) aud before the officers of that Hundred, purge himselfe and the Village of the fact, restoring <note place="margin">Lambert.</note> the damage done with the goods of the malefactor; which, if they suffized not to satisfie, the Free-borough, or Tything, must make vp the rest, and besides take an oath to bee no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to the fact; and to produce the Offendor, if by any meanes they could recouer him, or know where hee were. Besides euery Lord and Maister, stood <hi>Borough,</hi> for all his familie, whereof if any seruant were called in question, the Maister was to see him answere it in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, where hee was accused. If he fled, the Maister was to yeeld such goods as hee had to the King. If himselfe were accused to bee aiding or priuie to his seruants slight, hee was to cleere himselfe by fiue men, otherwise to forfeit all his goods to the King, and his man to bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed.</p>
               <p>These lincks thus intermutually fastened, made so strong a chaine to hold the whole frame of the State together in peace and order, as, all the most pollitique regiments vpon earth, all the interleagued societies of men, cannot shew vs a streighter forme of combination. This might make the Conqueror, comming vpon a people (thus Law-bound hand and foote) to establish him, so soone, and easily as he did; This <hi>Borough-law</hi> (being as a Cittadell, built to guard the Common-wealth, comming to bee possest by a Conquering Maister) was made to turne all this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7690:26"/>
vpon the State, and batter her selfe with her owne weapon: and this Law may <note place="margin">No popular insurrection before the Conquest.</note> be some cause, we finde no popular insurrection before the Conquest. For had not this people beene borne with these fetters, and an idie peace (but had liued loose, and in action) it is like they would haue done as noblie, and giuen as many, and as deepe wounds ere they lost their Country, as euer the <hi>Brittaines</hi> did, either against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or the <hi>Saxons,</hi> their predecessors, or themselues had done against the <hi>Danes;</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple far more powerfull, and numerous then these. The Conqueror, without this, had not made it the worke of one day, nor had <hi>Normandie</hi> euer beene able to haue yeelded those multitudes for supplies, that many battailes must haue had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now.</hi> First the strict executing this Law. Secondly, dis-wcop'ning the Commons. Thirdly, <note place="margin">The meanes vsed by the <hi>Norman,</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish his Conquest.</note> preuenting their night-meetings with a heauie penalty, that euery man at the day closing, should couer his fire, and depart to his rest. Fourthly, erecting diuers Fortresses in sit parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Fifthly, collating all offices, both of commaund, and iudicature, on those who were his; <hi>made his domination such as he would haue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where before the Bishop and the Alderman were the absolute Iudges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <note place="margin">Alteration of the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> all businesse in euery Shiere, and the Bishop in many cases shared in the benifit of the Mulcts with the King, now he confin'd the Clergie, within the Prouince of their owne Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, to deale onely in businesse concerning rule of soules, according to the Cannons, and Lawes Episcopall.</p>
               <p>And whereas the causes of the Kingdome were before determined in euery Shiere, <note place="margin">The order of deciding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauerfies in the Saxons time.</note> and by a Law of King <hi>Edward</hi> Senior; all matters in question should, vpon especiall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, without further deferment, bee finally decided in their <hi>Gemote,</hi> or conuentions held monthly in euery hundred: now he ordained, <hi>That foure times in the yeare, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies, the same businesses should bee determined in such place as he would appoint, where</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>hee constituted Iudges to attend for that purpose, and also others, from whom, as from the bosome of the Prince, all litigators should haue Iustice, and from whom was no appeale.</hi> Others hee appointed for the punishment of malefactors, called <hi>Iusticiarij Pacis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What alteration was then made in the tenure of mens possessions, or since intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <note place="margin">The alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tenures.</note> we may find by taking note of their former vsances. <hi>Our Auncestors had onely two kinde of tenures,</hi> Boke-land, <hi>and</hi> Folk-land, <hi>the one was a possession by writing, the other</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lambert.</note> 
                  <hi>without. That by writing was as free-hold, and by Charter, hereditarie, with all immunities, and for the free and nobler sort. That without writing, was to hold at the will of the Lord, bound</hi>

                  <hi>to rents and seruices, and was for the rurall people.

With which strange and suddaine show being much mooued, the Arch-bishop <hi>Stigand,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Egelsin</hi> (who had raised this commotion by showing the people in what daunger they <note place="margin">The Customs of <hi>Kent</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by the mediation of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Stigand.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For such as were Tenants at the will of their Lords (which now growne to a greater number, and more miserable then before) vpon their petition, and compassion of their oppression he releeued, their case was this. All such as were discouered to haue had a hand in any rebellion, and were pardoned, onely to enioy the benefit of life, hauing all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7690:27"/>
their liuelihood taken from them, became vassals vnto those Lords to whom the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions were giuen, of all such lands forfeited by attaindors. And if by their diligent seruice, they could attaine any portion of ground, they held it but onely so long as it pleased their Lords, without hauing any estate for themselues, or their children, and <note place="margin">Villenage.</note> were oftentimes violently cast out vpon any small displeasure, contrary to all right: whereupon it was ordained, that whatsoeuer they had obtained of their Lords, by their obsequious seruice, or agreed for, by any lawfull pact, they should hold by an inuiolable Law, during their owne liues.</p>
               <p>The next great worke after the ordering his Lawes, was the raising and disposing of his reuenues, taking a course to make, and know the vtmost of his estate, by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suruey of the Kingdome, whereof he had a president by the <hi>Dome</hi> booke of <hi>Winchester,</hi> taken before by King <hi>Alfride.</hi> But as one day informes another, so these actions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">A suruay made of the Kingdome.</note> grew more exact in their after practise: and a larger Commission is graunted, a choice of skilfuller men imployed, to take the particulars both of his owne possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and euery mans else in the Kingdome, the Nature and the quality of their Lands, their estates, and abilities; besides the descriptions, bounds, and diuisions of Shieres and Hundreds, and this was drawne into one booke, and brought into his treasurie, <note place="margin">Geruasius Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burien: de Scatc: Dome <hi>booke.</hi>
                  </note> then newly called the Exchequer (according to the soueraigne Court of that name of <hi>Normandy</hi>) before termed here the <hi>Taleè,</hi> and it was called the <hi>Dome</hi> booke (<hi>Liber iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarius</hi>) for all occasions concerning these particulars.</p>
               <p>All the Forests and Chases of the Kingdome, hee seized into his proper possession, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and exempted them from being vnder any other Law then his owne pleasure, to serue as <hi>Penetralia Regum,</hi> the withdrawing Chambers of Kings, to recreate them after their serious labours in the State, where none other might presume to haue to doe, and where all punishments and pardons of delinquents were to bee disposed by himselfe, absolutely, and all former customes abrogated. And to make his command the more, he increased the number of them in all parts of the Land, and on the South coast dispeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the Country for aboue thirty miles space, making of old inhabited possessions, a new Forest, inflicting most seuere punishments for hunting his Deere, and thereby <note place="margin">The new Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
                  </note> much aduances his reuenues. An act of the greatest concussion, and tyranny, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in his raigne, and which purchased him much hatred. And the same course held (almost euery King neere the Conquest) till this heauie grieuance was allayed by the Charter of Forests, granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>Besides these, he imposed no new taxations on the State, and vsed those hee found very moderately, as <hi>Dangelt,</hi> an imposition of two shillings vpon euery hide or plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note place="margin">He imposed no new tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</note> (raised first by King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> to bribe the <hi>Danes,</hi> after to warre vpon them) hee would not haue it made an Annuall payment, but onely taken vpon vrgent occasion, and it was seldome gathered in his time, or his successors (saith <hi>Geruasius</hi>) yet wee finde in our Annals, a taxe of 6. shillings vpon euery hide-land, leauied presently after the generall suruey of the Kingdome. <hi>Esouage</hi> (whether it were an imposition formerly <note place="margin">The occasion of paying <hi>Escuage.</hi>
                  </note> laide, though now newly named, I doe not find) was a summe of money, taken of euery Knights fee: In after times, especially raised for the seruice of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And this also, saith <hi>Geruasius,</hi> was seldome leauied but on great occasion, for stipends, and donatiues to souldiers; yet was it at first a due, reserued out of such lands as were giuen by the Prince for seruice of warre; according to the Custome of other Nations. As in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> time wee finde Lands were giuen in reward of seruice to the men of warre, for terme of their liues, as they are at this day in <hi>Turkey:</hi> After they became Patrimoniall, &amp; <note place="margin">The Custome of <hi>Eiefs.</hi>
                  </note> hereditarie to their children. <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperor was the first who permitted the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men of warre, to inioy their Fiefs, prouided that they followed Armes. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to reward his principall Captaines, granted them a perpetuity in the Lands assigned them. The estates which were but for life, were made perpetuall in <hi>France,</hi> vnder the last Kings of the race of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> Those Lords who had the great Fiefs of the King, <note place="margin">By what meanes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Reuenues.</note> sub-deuided them to other persons, of whom they were to haue seruice.</p>
               <p>Mulctuary profits, besides, such as might arise by the breach of his Forest-lawes, hee had, few or none new, vnlesse that of Murther, which arose vpon this occasion.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7690:27"/>
In the beginning of his raigne, the rankor of the English towards the new-come <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> was such, as finding them single in woods, or remote places, they secretly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them; and the deed doers (for any the seuerest courses taken) could neuer bee discouered: whereupon, it was ordained, that the Hundred, wherein a <hi>Norman</hi> was <note place="margin">The law for Murther, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, first made, by King <hi>Knute, vide</hi> Appon.</note> sound slaine and the murtherer not taken, should bee condemned to pay to the King: some 36 pounds, some 28 pounds, according to the quantity of the Hundred, that the punishment, being generally inflicted, might particularly deter them, &amp; hasten the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of the malefactor, by whom so many must (otherwise) be interessed.</p>
               <p>For his prouisionary reuenues, he continued the former custome held by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, which was in this manner. The Kings Tenants, who held their Lands of the <note place="margin">Geruasius Tilb.</note> Crowne, paide no money at all; but onely Victuals, Wheate, Beifes, Muttons, Hay Oates, &amp;C: And a iust note of the quality and quantity of euery mans ratement was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken throughout all the Shieres of the Kingdome, and leauied euer certaine, for the maintenance of the Kings house. Other ordinarie in-come of ready moneys was there none, but what was raised by mulcts, and out of Cities and Castles where Agriculture was not vsed. What the Church yeelded him, was by extent of a power that neuer reached so farre before; and the first hand, hee layd vpon that side which weighed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nily, was his seizing vpon the Plate, Iewels, and Treasure within all the Monasteries of <note place="margin">King <hi>William</hi> seased vpon the Treasure commitied to Monasteries.</note> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> pretending the rebels, and their assistants, conueyed their riches into these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses (as into places priuiledged, and free from seizure) to defraud him thereof.</p>
               <p>Besides this, he made all Bishoprickes, and Abbeys that held Barronies (before that time free from all secular seruices) contributary to his warres, and his other occasions. And this may be the cause why they, who then onely held the Pen (the Scepter, that rules ouer the memory of Kings) haue laide such an eternall imposition vpon his name, of rigour, oppression, and euen barbarous immanity, as they haue done. When the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; necessary disposition of his affaires (being as he was) may aduocate for him, &amp; in many things much excuse his courses. But this name of Conquest, which euer imports violence and misery, is of so harsh a sound, and so odious in nature, as a people subdued cannot giue a Conquerour his due (how euer worthy) and especially to a stranger, whom onely time must naturalize, and incorporate by degrees, into their liking and opinion. And yet therein this King was greatly aduantaged, by reason of his twenty yeares gouernment, which had much impaired the memory of former customes in the yonger sort, and well inured the elder to the present vsances and forme of State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the rule was made more easie to his sonnes: who (though they were farre inferiour to him in worth) were somewhat better beloued, then he; and the rather, for that their occasions made them, somewhat to vnwrest the Soueraignty from that height, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he had strayned it.</p>
               <p>How hee was vnderset with able ministers for the managing of these great affaires of his, though time hath shut vs out from the knowledge of some of them (it being in <note place="margin">His Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</note> the fortune of Kings, to haue their ministers like riuers in the Ocean, buried in their glory) yet no doubt, being of a strong constitution of iudgement, hee could not but be strongly furnished in that kind; for weake Kings haue euer weake sides, and the most renowned Princes are alwaies best stored with able ministers. The principall of highest imployment, were <hi>Odon,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Kent: Lanfranc,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz Auber,</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford: Odon</hi> supplied the place of Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy in the Kings absence, and had the management of the Treasury. A man of a wide and agile spirit, let out into as spacious a conceipt of greatnesse, as the heighth of his place could shew him: And is rumor'd by the infinite accumulation of mony (which his auarice, &amp; length of office had made) either to buy the Popedome, or to purchase the people of <hi>England,</hi> vpon the death of the King his brother: who (vnderstanding he had a purpose of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and seeing a mighty confluence of followers gathering vnto him) made a close prison stay his iourney: excusing it to the Church, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> as an Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> committed to prison.</note> not a Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> but an Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> an Officer accomptant vnto him. Yet, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death-bed shortly following (after many obsecrations, that he would, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of bloud &amp; nature, be a kind mean for the future peace of his sons) he released him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:7690:28"/>But the Bishop failed his request therein, and became the onely kindlefire to set <note place="margin">Reserued for greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> them all into more furious combustion. The motiue of his discontent (the engine wherewithall Ambition euermore turnes about her intentions) was the enuy he bare to <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> whose councell, in his greatest affaires, the King especially vsed: and to oppose and ouer-beare him, he tooke all the contrary courses, and part with <hi>Robert,</hi> his Nephew, whom (after many fortunes) hee attended to the holy warre, and died in the siege of <hi>Antioche.</hi>

                  <hi>Lanfranc</hi> was a man of as vniuersall goodnesse, as learning, borne in <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> and <note place="margin">Lanfranc.</note> came happily a stranger, in these strange times to doe good to <hi>England;</hi> vpon whose obseruance, though the King might (in regard hee raised him) lay some tye, yet his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections could not but take part with his piety and place: in so much as hee feared not to oppose against <hi>Odon,</hi> the Kings brother, seeking to gripe from the State of his Church: And in all he could, stood so betweene the kingdome and the Kings rigor, as stayed many precipitious violencies, that he (whose power lay as wide as his wil) might else haue fallen into. For the Conqueror (howsoeuer austere to others) was to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies milde and yeelding, as if subdued with his grauity, and vertue.</p>
               <p>He reformed the irregularity, and rudenesse of the Clergie, introducing a more <note place="margin">The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergie by <hi>Lanfranc.</hi>
                  </note> Southerne formalitie and respect, according to his breeding, and the Custome of his Country: concurring herein likewise to be an actor of alteration (though in the best kinde) with this change of State. And to giue entertainment to deuotion, hee did all he could to furnish his Church with the most exquisite ornaments might be procured: added a more State and conueniencie to the structure of religious houses, and beganne the founding of Hospitals. Hauing long struggled, with indefatigable labour, to hold things in an euen course, during the whole raigne of this busie new state-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding King, and after his death, seeing his successor in the Crowne (established especially by his meanes) to faile his expectation, out of the experience of worldly causes, deuining of future mischiefes by present courses, grew much to lament (with his friends) the teadiousnesse of life, which shortly after hee mildly left, which such a sicknesse, as neither hindred his speech nor memory: a thing he would often desire of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Fiz Auber</hi> (as is deliuered) was a principall councellor and instument in this action for <hi>England;</hi> wherein hee furnished forty ships at his owne charge. A man of great meanes, yet of a heart greater, and a hand larger then any meanes would well suffice. His profuse liberalities to men of armes, gaue often sharpe offence to the King, who could not indure any such improuident expences. Amongst the Lawes hee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>William Fitz Auber</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> made Lawes in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince.</note> made (which shewes the power these Earles then had in their Prouinces) he ordained, <hi>That in the Countie of</hi> Hereford, <hi>no man of (or souldiour) should bee fined for anie offence whatsoeuer, aboue seuen shillings;</hi> when in other Countries, vpon the least occasion of disobeying their Lords will, they were forced to pay 20. or 25. shil. But his estate seeming to beare no proportion with his minde (&amp; enough it was not to be an eminent Earle, an especiall Councellor, in all the affaires of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> a chiefe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorite to so great a Monarch) but that larger hopes drew him away; designing to marrie <hi>Richeld,</hi> Countesse dowager of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to haue the gouernment of that Countrie, during the non-age of <hi>Arnulph</hi> her sonne; of whom, with the King of <hi>France,</hi> he had the tutelarie charge, committed by <hi>Baldouin</hi> the sixth, Father to <hi>Arnulph;</hi> whose estate, <hi>Robert Le Frison,</hi> his Vncle (called by the people to the gouernment, vpon the exactions inflicted on them by <hi>Richeld</hi>) had vsurped. And against him <hi>Fitz Auber</hi> opposing, was with <hi>Arnulph</hi> surprized and slaine.</p>
               <p>And this was in the fate of the Conqueror, to see most of all these great men, who had beene the especiall actors in all his fortunes, spent and extinct before him; As <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Monfort, Harcourte, Hugh de Gourney, Vicount Neele, Hugh de Mortimer, Conte de Vannes</hi> &amp;c. And now himselfe, after his being brought sicke to <hi>Rouan,</hi> and there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <note place="margin">The death of <hi>William</hi> the first.</note> his estate, ended also his act, in the 74 yeare of his age, and the one and twenty of his raigne.</p>
               <p>Three dayes the Corpes of this great Monarch is sayd to haue layne neglected while
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7690:28"/>
his seruants attended to imbessill his moueables: in the end, his yongest sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> had it conueyed to the Abbey of <hi>Cane;</hi> where first at the entry into the Towne, they <note place="margin">His Corps lay vnburied 3. dayes.</note> who carried the Corpes, left it alone, and ran all to quench a house on fire: Afterward brought to be intombed, a Gentleman stands sorth, and in sterne manner, forbids the interment in that place, claiming the ground to be his inheritance, descended from his <note place="margin">His interment hindered.</note> Ancestors, and taken from him at the building of that Abbey, appealing to <hi>Row,</hi> their first founder, for Iustice: whereupon they were faine to compounded with him for an Annuall rent. Such adoe had the body of him after death (who had made so much in his life) to be brought to the earth; and of all he attained, had not now a roome to containe him, without being purchased at the hand of another, men esteeming a liuing Dogge more then a dead Lyon.</p>
               <p>He had a faire issue by <hi>Maude</hi> his wife, foure sonnes, and sixe daughters. To <hi>Robert</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His issue.</note> his eldest, he left the Duchy of <hi>Normandy:</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the third sonne, the Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the yongest, his treasure, with an annuall pension to be payd him by his brothers. <hi>Richard</hi> who was his second sonne, and his darling, a Prince of great hope, was slaine by a Stagge hunting in the new, Forrest, and began the fatalnesse that followed in that place, by the death of <hi>William</hi> the second, there slaine with an arrow, and of <hi>Richard,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who brake his necke.</p>
               <p>His eldest daughter <hi>Cicilie,</hi> became a Nunne, <hi>Constance</hi> married to the Earle of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: Adula</hi> to <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Biois,</hi> who likewise rendred her selfe a Nunne in her age; such was then their deuotion, and so much were these solitary retires, affected by the greatest Ladies of those times: <hi>Gundred</hi> married to <hi>William de Warrein,</hi> the first Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the other two <hi>Ela</hi> or <hi>Adeliza</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> died before marriage.</p>
               <p>Now, what he was in the circle of himselfe in his owne continent, we find him of <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>William</hi> the first.</note> an euen stature, comely personage, of good presence, riding, sitting, or standing, till his corpulency increasing with age, made him somewhat vnwildy, of so strong a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as he was neuer sickly till a few moneths before his death. His strength such, as few men could draw his Bow, and being about 50. of his age, when he subdued this Kingdome, it seemes by his continuall actions, he felt not the weight of yeares vpon him, till his last yeare.</p>
               <p>What was the composition of his mind; we see it (the fairest) drawne in his actions, and how his abilities of Nature, were answerable to his vndertakings of Fortune, as pre-ordained for the great worke he effected. And though he might haue some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the time, wherein we often see men preuaile more by the imbecility of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then their owne worth; yet let the season of that world be well examined, and a iust measure taken of his actiue vertues, they will appeare of an exceeding propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor wanted he those incounters and concurrencies of sufficient <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>For his deuotion and mercy, the brightest starres in the Spheare of Maiesty, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare aboue all his other vertues, and the due obseruation of the first, the Clergie (that loued him not) confesse: the other was seene, in the often pardoning, and receiuing into grace, those (who rebelled against him) as if he held submission satisfactory, for the greatest offence, and sought not to defeit men, but their enterprises: For we find but one Noble man executed in all his Raigne, and that was the Earle <hi>Waltheof,</hi> who <note place="margin">But one Noble man executed in all the time of this Kings Raigne.</note> had twice falsified his faith before: And those he held prisoners in <hi>Normandy,</hi> as the Earles <hi>Morchar</hi> and <hi>Siward,</hi> with <hi>Wolfnoth,</hi> the brother of <hi>Harald,</hi> and others (vpon compassion of their indurance) he released a little before his death.</p>
               <p>Besides, he was as farre from suspition, as cowardize, and of that confidence (an especiall note of his magnanimity) as he gaue <hi>Edgar</hi> his competitor in the Crowne, the liberty of his Court: And (vpon his suite) sent him well furnisht to the holy warre, where he nobly behaued himselfe, and attained to great estimation, with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Almaine,</hi> which might haue beene held dangerous, in respect of his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7690:29"/>
alliances that way, being graund-child to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the third. But these may be as well vertues of the Time, as of Men, and so the age must haue part of this commendation.</p>
               <p>He was a benefactor to Nine Abbeys of Monkes, and one of Nunnes, founded by his Predicessors in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and during his owne time were founded in the same Prouince seuen Abbeys of Monkes and sixe of Nunnes; with which fortresses (as he <note place="margin">His workes of piety.</note> sayd) he furnisht <hi>Normandy;</hi> to the end men might therein fight against the flesh, and the Diuell. In <hi>England</hi> he founded a goodly Abbey, where he fought his first Battell, whereof it had the Denomination, and two Nunneries, one at <hi>Hinching-Brooke</hi> in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon shire,</hi> and the other at <hi>Armthewt</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> besides his other publique workes.</p>
               <p>Magnificent he was in his Festiuals, which with great solemnity and ceremony (the formall entertainers of reuerence and respect) he duly obserued. Keeping his <hi>Christmas</hi> at <hi>Glocester,</hi> his Easter at <hi>Winchester,</hi> and Penticost at <hi>Westminster:</hi> whither he summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his whole Nobility; that Embassadors and Strangers might see his State, and largenesse.

Comming to succeed in a Gouernment, fore-ruled by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and graue Counsell, he was so ouer-whelmed with his Fathers worth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as made him appeare of a lesser Orbe then otherwise he would haue done.

                  <hi>should haue bragged, they had wonne the saddle from vnder him; and how great an indignity it was, for a King to suffer inferiours to force any thing from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the end <hi>Henry</hi> grew to extreame want of drinke and water; although he had all <note place="margin">1092. Anno.

               <p>Many skirmishes interpassed, with surprisements of Castles, but in the end a treaty of peace was propounded: wherein to make his conditions, what he would; King <hi>William</hi> seemes hard to be wrought, and makes the more shew of force; sending ouer into <hi>England</hi> for an Army of thirty thousand men, which being brought to the shore, ready to be shipped: an offer was made to be proclaimed by his Lieftenant, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ten shillings a man, whosoeuer would, might depart home to his dwelling.

(wherein hee vsed the best strength of <hi>England</hi>) it was soone ended, with the confusion of the vndertakers.

               <p>The Earle was committed to the Castle of <hi>Windsor, William d' Ou</hi> at a Councell at <hi>Salisbury</hi> being ouercome in Duell (the course of triall) had his eyes put out, and his priuie members cut off. <hi>William de Alueric,</hi> his Sewer, a man of goodly personage, and allyed vnto him, was condemned to be hanged: though <hi>both in his confession to</hi> Osmond <hi>the Bishop there, and to all the people as hee passed to his execution,</hi> hee left a cleere opinion of his innocency, and the wrong, hee had by the King.</p>
               <p>But now; whilst these fractures heere at home, the vnrepairable breaches abroad, (were such) as could giue the King no longer assurednesse of quiet, then the attempters would: and that all the Christian world was out, either at discord amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or in faction, by the schisme of the Church; Pope <hi>Viban,</hi> assembling a generall Councell at <hi>Cleirmont</hi> in <hi>Auergne,</hi> to compose the affaires of Christendome, exhorted all the Princes thereof, to ioyne themselues in action, for the recouery of the Holy Land, out of the hands of infidels.

(more honorable for the sellers then the buyers) vnto a greater meanes then euer. For by aduising the vndertakers, seeing their action was for <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his Church: rather to make ouer their estates to the Clergie, of whom they might againe redeeme the same, and bee sure to haue the fayrest dealing; then vnto Lay men; he effected this worke. Whereby the third part of the best Fiefs in <hi>France</hi> came to bee possest by the Clergie: and afterward vpon the same occasion, many things more sold vnto them in <hi>England,</hi> especially when <hi>Richard</hi> the first vndertooke the voyage, who passed ouer diuers Mannors to <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (and also for his mony) created him Earle of <hi>Durham,</hi> as appeares in his life.</p>
               <p>This humor was kept vp, and in motion almost 300 yeares, notwithstanding all <note place="margin">An Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> 2 Kings of <hi>France</hi> with their wiues, a King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wey</hi> went all thither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> the discouragements, by the difficulties in passing, the disasters there through contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arising from a disagreeing clime: and the multitudes of indigent people, cast of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes into miserable wants. It consumed infinit Treasure, and most of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest men of all our West world, and especially <hi>France.</hi> For <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> those who were the Popes friends, and would haue gone, were stayed at home by dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to make good his partie against the Emperour, who notwithstanding still strugled with him; but in the end, by this meanes the Pope preuailed. Yet these were not all the effects this voyage wrought: the Christians who went out to seeke an enemy in <hi>Asia,</hi> brought one thence: to the daunger of all Christendome, and the losse of the fairest part thereof. For this long keeping it in a warre, that had many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions with firs of heates and coldnesses (as made by a league, consisting of seuerall Nations, emulous, and vnconcurrent in their courses) taught such, as were of an entire bodie, their weakenesses, and the way to conquer them. This was the great effect, this voyage wrought.</p>
               <p>And by this meanes King <hi>William</hi> here was now ridde of an elder brother, and a Competitor, had the possession of <hi>Normandy</hi> during his raigne, and more absolutenesse, and irregularity in <hi>England.</hi> Where now, in making vp this great summe to pay <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> he vsed all the extreme meanes could be deuised: as hee had done in all like bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses before. Whereby he incurred the hatred of his people in generall, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Clergie, being the first King which shewed his successors an euill prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of keeping their Liuings vacant, and receiuing the profits of them himselfe, as he did that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> foure yeares after the death of <hi>Lanfranc:</hi> and had holden it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but that being dangerously sicke at <hi>Glocester,</hi> the sixth yeare of his raigne, his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, in the weakenesse of his body, tooke to worke vpon his minde, so as hee vowed, <note place="margin">1099. Anno. Reg. 12.</note> vpon his recouerie to see all vacancies furnished, which he did, but with so great adoe, as shewed that hauing escaped the daunger hee would willingly haue deceiued the Saint. And <hi>Anselme,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> borne, though bred in <hi>Normandy,</hi> is in the end preferred to that Sea. But, what with his owne stiffenesse, and the Kings standing on his rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, he neuer enioyed it quietly vnder him. For betweene them two, began the first contestation about the inuestitures of Bishops, and other priuiledges of the Church, which gaue much to doe, to many of his successors. <hi>Anselme</hi> not yeelding to the Kings will, forsooke the Land, whereupon his Bishopricke was re-assumed and the King held in his hands at one time, besides that of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes of <hi>Winchester, Sarum,</hi> and eleuen Abbayes whereof he tooke all the profits.</p>
               <p>He vsually sold all spirituall preferments those would giue most, and tooke fines of Priests for fornication: he vexed <hi>Robert Bluet</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> in suite, till hee payd him 5000 pounds. And now the Clergie, vpon this taxe, complaying their wants, were answered, <hi>That they had Shrines of Gold in their Churches, and for so holy a worke, as this warre against infidels, they should not spare them.</hi> Hee also tooke money of Iewes, to cause such of them as were conuerted, to renounce Christianity, as making more benefit <note place="margin">The Kings shew of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> by their vnbeleefe, then their conuersion. Wherein hee discouered the worst peece of his nature, <hi>Irreligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides his great taxations layd on the Layetie, he set informers vpon them, and for <note place="margin">The antiquity of Informers.</note> small transgressions made great penalties. These were his courses for raysing moneys,

Twice he appeased the King of <hi>France</hi> with money, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion was such, as put him euermore into extreme wants.</p>
               <p>This one Act, shewes both his violence and magnanimity: As he was one day hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a Messenger comes in all haste out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and tels him how the Citty of <hi>Mans</hi> was surprised by <hi>Hely</hi> Conte <hi>de la Flesche</hi> (who by his Wife pretended right ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and was aided by <hi>Fouques d' Angiers,</hi> the antient enemy to the Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>) and that the Castle which held out valiantly for him, was, without present suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, to be rendered. He sends backe the Messenger instantly, wils him to make all the speed he could, to signifie to his people in the Castle, that he would be there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight daies, if Fortune hindred him not. And sodainely he askes of his people about him, which way <hi>Mans</hi> lay, and a <hi>Norman</hi> being by, shewed him: Presently he turnes his Horse towards that Coast, and in great haste rides on: when some aduised him to stay for fit prouisons, and people for his iourney, hee said; <hi>They who loue mee, will follow me.</hi> And comming to imbarke at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> the Maister told him the weather was rough, and there was no passing without eminent danger; <hi>Tush,</hi> said he, <hi>set forward, I neuer yet heard of King that was drowned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By breake of day he arriued at <hi>Harfleu,</hi> sends for his Captaines, and men of warre to attend him all at <hi>Mans,</hi> whither hee came at the day appointed. Conte <hi>de la Flesche,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more right than power, after many skirmishes, was taken by a stratagem, and brought prisoner to <hi>Rouen;</hi> where, more inraged, then dismaide with his fortune, he let fall these words; that had hee not beene taken with a wile, hee would haue left the King but little Land on that side the sea, and were hee againe at libertie, they should not so easily take him. Which being reported; the King sent for him, <hi>Set him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, gaue him a faire Horse, bad him goe his waie, and doe his worst.</hi> Which act ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Conte</hi> more then his taking, and a quiet end was made betweene them. That he affected things of cost, euen in the smallest matters (is shewed) in the report of his finding fault with his seruant, which brought him a new paire of hose, whereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the price, was told how they cost threc shillings, wherewith being angrie, he asked his seruant if that were a fit price of a paire of hose for a King, and willed him to goe presently and to buy those of a marke, which being brought him though they were farre worse, yet he liked them much better in regard they were said to haue cost more. An example of the Weare of the time, the humor of the Prince, and the deceipt of the seruant.</p>
               <p>The King returnes into England with great iollity, as euer bringing home better fortune out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> then from any his Northerne expeditions: Feasts his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with all Magnificence, in his new Hall, lately finished at Westminster, wherewith he found much fault for being built too little; saying, <hi>It was fitter for a Chamber, then a Hallfor a King of</hi> England, and takes a plot for one farre more spacious to be added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And in this gayetie of State, when hee had got aboue all his businesses, betakes him wholly to the pleasure of peace, and being hunting with his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> in the New Forrest, <hi>Walter Terell,</hi> a Norman, and his kinsman, shooting at a Deere (whether mistaking his marke, or not, is vncertaine) strake him to the heart. And so fell this fierce King, in the 43 yere of his age when he had raigned nie 12 yeres. A Prince, who for the first two yeares of his raigne (whilst held in, by the graue counsell of <hi>Lanfrance,</hi> and his owne feares) bare himselfe most worthily, and had beene absolute for State; had hee not after sought to bee absolute in power, which (meeting with an exorbitant will) makes both Prince, and people miserable.</p>

                  <hi>Ralph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> chiefe Counsellor to the late King, a man risen by subtlety, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ralph</hi> Bishop of Durham committed to prison.</note> of his Tongue (from infimous condition, to the highest employments) was committed to a streight and loathsome prison, being famed to haue put his Maister into all these courses of exaction, and irregularities, and remaines amongst the examples of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ignominie.

The King banishes him the Kingdome, and takes into his hands his <note place="margin">110. Anno. Reg. 4.</note> Bishopricke. The Pope stands stifly to the power assumed by the Church, but in the end, seeing the King fast, strong, and lay too farre off out of his way to bee constrained (and hauing much to doe at that time with the Emperour, and other Princes, about the same businesse) takes the way of perswasion to draw him to his will, solliciting him <note place="margin">

               <p>Whilest these things were managing at <hi>Rome,</hi> there burst out here a flame, which <note place="margin">The Earle of Shrewsburies combination.</note> consumed the parties that raised it, and brought the King more easily to his ends, then otherwise he could euer haue expected. <hi>Robert de Belesme,</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> sonne to <hi>Roger de Mongomerie</hi> (a very fierce youth) presuming of his great estate, and his friends, fortifies his Castles of <hi>Shrewsburie, Bridgenorth, Tickhill,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> with some other peeces in <hi>Wales</hi> belonging to him; and combines with the Welch, to oppose against the present State (out of a desire to set all in combustion, for his owne ends, that were altogether vncertaine) which put the King to much trauell and charge: but within thirty dayes, by employing great forces, and terrors mixt with promises, hee scattered his complices, and tooke all his Castles; except that of <hi>Arundell,</hi> which rendred vpon condition, that the Maister might bee permitted to retire safe into <hi>Normandie;</hi> which the King easily granted, seeing now hee was but the body of a silly naked Creature, that had lost both Feathers and wings. And it made well for the King, his going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, from the loosing of his owne estate in <hi>England,</hi> and thereby aduancing the Kings reuenues, hee goes to loose <hi>Normandy</hi> also, and brings it to this Crowne. For, as soone as he came thither, hee fastens amity with one of like condition, and fortunes as himself (an exiled man) whose insolency had likewise stript him out of all his estate in <note place="margin">1104. Anno. Reg. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> and much wasted that in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which was <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> sonne to <hi>Robert,</hi> halfe Brother to King <hi>William</hi> the first. Who being also Earle of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> made sute likewise, to haue that of <hi>Kent:</hi> which his Vncle <hi>Odon</hi> lately held, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied it, and also euicted by Law, of certaine other parcels of Land, which hee claimed, retires with great indignation into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where not only he assaults the Kings Castles, but also vsurpes vpon the State of <hi>Richard,</hi> the yong Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> then the Kings Ward. These two Earles combine themselues, and with their Adherents committed many outragious actions, to the great spoile and displeasure of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whereof, though they complained to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> they found little remedy. For, he being now growne poore by his out-lauishing humour, began it seemes, to be little respected: or else falne from action, and those greatnesses his expectation had shewed him, was (as commonly great mindes dasht with ill fortunes are) falne likewise in spirit, and giuen ouer to his ease. Wherupon the the people of <hi>Normandy</hi> make their exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the King of <hi>England,</hi> who sends for his Brother <hi>Robert, Reprehends him for the sufferance of these disorders; aduises him to act the part of a Prince, and not a Monke:</hi> and in conclusion, whither by detention of his pension, or drawing him, being of a

facile Nature, to some act of releasing it: sends him home so much discontented, as hee <note place="margin">1105. Anno. Reg. 6.</note> ioynes with these mutinous Earles, and by their instigation, was set into that flame, as he raised all his vtmost forces to be reuenged on his brother.</p>
               <p>The King, touched in Conscience with the fowlenesse of a fraternall war (which the world would take he being the mightier to proceed out of his designes) stood douot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what to doe, when Pope <hi>Paschall,</hi> by his Letters written with that eloquence (saith <hi>Malmesburie</hi>) wherein hee was quicke perswaded him, <hi>That herein hee should not make a ciuill Warre, but doe a Noble and memorable benefit vnto his Countrey.</hi> Whereby (paide for remitting the Inuestitures) hee held himselfe countenanced in this businesse. Whereon, now he sets with more alacrity and resolution. And after many difficulties, and losse of diuers worthy men, in a mighty battaile, neere the Castle of <hi>Tenechbray,</hi> his <note place="margin">England wins Normandic.</note> enemies with much adoe, were all defeated. Whereby <hi>England</hi> won <hi>Normandy,</hi> and on the same day, by Computation (wherein forty yeares before) <hi>Normandy</hi> ouer-came <hi>England,</hi> such are the turnings in the affaires of men.</p>
               <p>And here <hi>Robert,</hi> who stood in a faire possibility of two Crownes, came to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued <note place="margin">1106. Anno. Reg. 7.</note> of his Dutchy and all hee had, brought prisoner into <hi>England,</hi> and committed to the Castle of <hi>Cardiffe.</hi> Where, to adde to his misery, hee had the misfortune of a long life (suruiuing after he lost himselfe 26 yeares) whereof the most part he saw not, hauing his eyes put out, whereby he was onely left to his thoughts, a punishment barbarously <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Normandy is imprisoned by King <hi>Hen.</hi>
                  </note> inflicted on him, for attempting an escape.</p>
               <p>He was a Prince, that gaue out to the world, very few notes of his ill, but many of his Noblenesse and valour, especially in his great voyage, wherein hee had the second command, and was in election to haue beene the first preferred to the Crowne of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and missed it hardly. Onely the disobedience in his youth shewed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which yet might proceed from a rough hand borne ouer him, and the animation of others, rather then his owne Nature) sets a staine vpon him: and then, his profusion (which some would haue liberality) shewed his impotency, and put him into those courses that ouerthrew him. All the Reuenues of his Dutchy, which should serue for his maintenance, hee sold or engaged, and was vpon passing the City of <hi>Roan</hi> vnto the Cittizens, which made him held vnfit for the gouernment, and gaue occasion to his Brother to quarrell with him.</p>
               <p>And thus came <hi>Henry</hi> sreed from this feare and absolute Duke of <hi>Normandy:</hi> had <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</note> many yeares of quiet, gathered great Treasure, &amp; entertained good intelligence with the Neighbour Princes. <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his Match, and doing their Princes good, hee held from doing him hurt; clearing them from vsurpations. <hi>Wales,</hi> though vnder his Title, yet not subiection, gaue him some exercise of action; which he ordered with great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. First he planted within the body of that Countrey, a Colony of Flemings, who at that time much pestred this Kingdome: being admitted heere in the raigne of King <hi>William</hi> the first, marrying their Country woman, and vsing their helpe in the action of <hi>England,</hi> where they dayly encreased, in such sort, as gaue great displeasure to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But by this meanes, both that grieuance was eased, and the vse of them made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the State: for being so great a number, and a strong people, they made roome for themselues, and held it in that sort, as they kept the <hi>Welch,</hi> all about them, in verie good awe. Besides, the King tooke for Ostages the chiefe mens sonnes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and hereby quieted it. For <hi>France</hi> hee stood secure, so long as <hi>Phillip</hi> the first liued: who, wholly giuen ouer to his ease and Luxury, was not for other attempts, out of that course: but his sonne he was to looke vnto, whensoeuer he came to that Crowne.</p>
               <p>With the Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> he had some debate, but it was onely in words, and vpon <note place="margin">1107. Anno. Reg. 8.</note> this occasion. King <hi>William</hi> the first, in retribution of the good his father in law, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douin</hi> the fift had done, by ayding him in the action of <hi>England,</hi> gaue him yearely three hundred markes, and likewise continued it to his sonne after him. Now, <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> of a collaterall line, returning empty from the Holy warres, and finding this summe paide out of <hi>England</hi> to his Predecessors, demaunds the same of King <hi>Henrie,</hi> as his due; who not easie to part with money, sends him word; that it was not the custome of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to pay tribute: If they gaue pensions they were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7690:34"/>
temporary, and according to desert. Which answere so much displeased the Earle, that though himselfe liued not to shew his hatred, yet his Sonne did, and ayded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>William,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Robert Curtoys,</hi> in his attempts, for recouery of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> against King <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus stood this King in the first part of his raigne: in the other, hee had more to doe abroad then at home, where hee had by his excellent wisdome so setled the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as it held a steady course without interruption, all his time. But now <hi>Lewis le Grosse,</hi> succeeding his father <hi>Philip</hi> the first, gaue him warning to looke to his State of <hi>Normandy:</hi> and for that he would not attend a quarrell, he makes one; taking occasion about the City of <hi>Gisors,</hi> scituate on the Riuer <hi>Epre,</hi> in the confines of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> quarrels with the King of France.</note> whilst <hi>Louys</hi> was trauailed with a stubborne Nobility, presuming vpon their Franchises, within their owne Signories, whereof there were many, at that time, about <hi>Paris,</hi> as the Contes of <hi>Crecy, Pissaux, Dammartin, Champaigne,</hi> and others, who by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and emulation, would bee absolute Lords, without awe of a Maister, putting themselues vnder the protection of <hi>Henry,</hi> wo being neere to assist them, fostred those humors, which in sicke bodies most shew themselues. But after <hi>Louys,</hi> by yeares ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering strength, dissolued that compact, and made his meanes the more, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscations.</p>
               <p>Now to entertaine these two great Princes in worke, the quarrell betweene the Pope and the Emperour, ministred fresh occasion. The Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">1108. Anno.

                  <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> according to the Decree of the Counsell of Rome, and made him take his Oath of fidelity betweene his hands, as to the true and lawfull Emperour. The Pope, so soone as <hi>Henry</hi> was departed home, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles a Counsell, nullifies this acknowledgement, as done by force, and shortly after deceased. The Emperour, to make himselfe the stronger against his successors, enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aliance with the King of England, takes to wife his daughter <hi>Maud,</hi> being but fiue <note place="margin">The Emperor <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. marries <hi>Maud.</hi>
                  </note> yeares of age. After this, <hi>Calixte</hi> sonne of the Conte <hi>de Burgogne,</hi> comming to be Pope, and being French (vnto their great applause) assembles a Counsell at <hi>Reimes;</hi> were, by Ecclesiasticall sentence, <hi>Henry</hi> the fift is declared enemy of the Church, and degraded of his Imperiall Dignity. The King of England, seeing this Counsell was held in France, and composed chiefely of the <hi>Galicane</hi> Church, desirous to ouer-maister <hi>Louys,</hi> incenses his sonne in law the Emperour (stung with this disgrace) to set vpon him (as the Popes chiefe piller) on one side, and he would assaile him on the other. The Emperour easily wrought to such a businesse, prepares all his best forces: the King of <hi>England</hi> doth the like. The King of <hi>France</hi> seeing this storme comming so impetuously vpon him, wrought so with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as they, weighing the future mischiefe of a warre, vndertaken in a heate, with the importance of a kind Neighbour-hood, aduise the Emperour not to enter thereinto, till hee had signifyed to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the <note place="margin">Historie of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> cause of his discontent. Whereupon an Embassage is dispatched: The King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> answers, <hi>That hee grieued much to see the two greatest Pillars of the Church, thus shaken with these dissentions, whereby might bee feared, the whole frame would bee ruined: that hee was friend to them both, and would gladly bee an inter-dealer for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, rather then to carry wood to a fire too fierce already, which hee desired to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, for the good and quiet of Christendome.</hi> This Embaslage wrought so, as it disarmed the Emperour, glad to haue <hi>Louys</hi> a mediator of the accord betweene the <note place="margin">The King of France ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords the Pope and Emperour.</note> Pope and him: to the great displeasure of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who expected greater matters to haue risen by this businesse. The accord is concluded at <hi>Wormes,</hi> to the Popes aduantage, to whom the Emperor yeelds vp the right of inuestitures of Bishops and other Benefices. But this was onely to appease, not cure the malady.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:7690:34"/>The King of <hi>England</hi> disappointed thus of the Emperours assistance, proceeds not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in his intentions against <hi>Louys.</hi> And seeing he failed of outward forces, he sets vp a party in his Kingdome, to confront him: aiding <hi>Theobald, Conte de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,</hi>

                  </note> with so great power, as he stood to do him much displeasure: besides, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a strong side in that Kingdome, by his aliances: for <hi>Stephen,</hi> Earle of <hi>Blois,</hi> had married his sister <hi>Adela,</hi> to whom this <hi>Theobald</hi> was Brother, and had wonne <hi>Foulke,</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> (an important neighbour, and euer an enemy to <hi>Normandy</hi>) to be his, by matching his sonne <hi>William</hi> to his daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Louys</hi> on the other side, failes not to practise all meanes to vnder-worke <hi>Henries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi>

               <p>Great, and many, were the conflicts betweene these two Princes, with the expence of much bloud and charge. But in the end, being both tyred, a peace was concluded, <note place="margin">1116. Anno.

               <p>Vpon the faire cloze of all these troubles, there followed presently an accident, which seasoned it with that sowernesse of griefe, as ouercame all the ioy of the successe. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the young Prince, the onely hope of all the <hi>Norman</hi> race, at seuenteene yeares of <note place="margin">Queene <hi>Maud</hi> liued not to see this disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> age, returning into <hi>England,</hi> in a ship by himselfe, accompanied with <hi>Richard</hi> his base brother, <hi>Mary,</hi> Countesse of <hi>Perch,</hi> their sister, <hi>Richard,</hi> Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> with his wife, the Kings Neece, and many other personages of honour, and their attendants, to the number of 140. besides 50.

The Prince had recouered a Cock-boat, and in possibility to haue bene saued, had not the compassion of his sisters cryes drawne him backe to the sinking ship to take her in, and perish with his company.</p>
               <p>Which sudden clap of Gods iudgement, comming in a calme of glory, when all these bustlings seemed past ouer, might make a conscience shrinke with terror, to see oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and supplantation repayd with the extinction of that, for which so much had bin wrought, and the line Masculine of <hi>Normandy</hi> expired in the third inheritor (as if to beginne the fate layde on all the future succession hither vnto; wherein the third heire in a right discent, seldome or neuer inioyed the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> but that either by vsurpation or extinction of the male bloud, it receiued an alteration) which may teach Princes to obserue the wayes of righteousnesse, and let men alone with their rights, and God with his prouidence.</p>

as if heire also of his fathers fortunes, admitted to the Earledome, miscarried in the rule, was deptiued, and slaine in battaile; and in him all of <hi>Robert Curtoys</hi> perished.</p>
               <p>And now the whole care of King <hi>Henry,</hi> was the setling of the succession vpon <hi>Maude</hi> (of whom he liued to see two sonnes borne) for which he conuokes a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England,</hi> wherein, an oath is ministred to the Lords of this Land, to bee true to her and her heires, and acknowledge them as the right inheritors of the Crowne. This oath was first taken by <hi>Dauid,</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> Vncle to <hi>Maude,</hi> and by <hi>Stephen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1133. Anno.

               <p>So that now all seemes safe and quiet, but his owne sleepes, which are said to haue beene very tumultuous, and full of affrightments, wherein hee would often rise, take his sword, and be in act, as if hee defended himselfe against assaults of his person, which shewed, all was not well within.</p>
               <p>His gouernment in peace, was such as rankes him in the list amongst our Kings of <note place="margin">His gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in peace.</note> the fairest marke: holding the Kingdome so well ordred, as during all his raigne, which was long, hee had euer the least to doe at home. At the first, the competition with his brother, after, the care to establish his succession, held him in, to obserue all the best courses, that might make for the good and quiet of the State; hauing an especiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to the due administration of Iustice, that no corruption or oppression might disease his people, whereby things were carried with that euennesse, betweene the Great men and the Commons, as gaue all, satisfaction.

And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <note place="margin">The first vse of Progresses.</note> when so euer he was in <hi>England,</hi> hee kept no certaine residence, but solemnized the great festiuals in seuerall, and farre distant places of the Kingdome, that all might pertake of him.</p>
               <p>And for that he would not wrest any thing by an Imperiall power from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which might breed vlcers of dangerous nature) hee tooke a course to obtaine <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</note> their free consents to serue his occasions, in their generall Assemblies of the three Estates of the Land, which hee first, conuoked at <hi>Salisbury, Anno Reg.</hi> 15. and which, <note place="margin">He assembles the first Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the Conquest.</note> had from his time the name of Parliament, according to manner of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States, where Princes keepe within their circles to the good of their people, their owne glorie, and securitie of their posteritie. <note place="margin">See Appen.

               </p>
               <p>He was a Prince that liued formally himselfe, and repressed those excesses in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which those times entertained, as the wearing of long haire, wich though it were a gayetie of no charge (like those sumptuous braueries, that waste Kingdomes in peace) yet for the vndecencie thereof, hee reformed it, and all other dissolutenesse. His great businesses, and his wants taught him frugalitie, and warinesse of expence, and <note place="margin">His meanes to raise monies.</note> his warres being seldome <hi>Inuasiue,</hi> and so not getting, put him often to vse hard cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for his suppliments of treasure. Towards the marriage of his daughter with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the charge of his warre, he obtained (as it might seeme at his first Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Salisbury</hi>) <hi>Anno.

               <p>Punishments which were mutilation of member, hee made pecuniarie. And by reason of his often, and long being in <hi>Normandie,</hi> those prouisions for his house, which <note place="margin">Tilburiensis de Scaccario.</note> were vsed to bee paide in kinde, were rated to certaine prices and receiued in money, by the consent of the State, and to the great content of the subiect; who by reason that many dwelling farre off throughout all shires of <hi>England,</hi> were much molested with satisfying the same otherwise. He resumed the liberties of hunting in his Forests,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7690:35"/>
which tooke vp much faire ground of the Kingdome; and besides renuing former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, made an Edict, <hi>That if any man in his owne priuate woods, killed the Kings Deere, should forfeit his woods to the King.</hi> But he permitted them inclosures for Parkes, which vnder him seemes to haue had their originall, by the example of that of his at <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke,</hi> the multitude whereof grew to be afterward a disease in the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>His expences were chiefly in his warres, and his many and great fortifications in <note place="margin">His expences.</note> 
                  <hi>Normandy.</hi> His buildings were the Abbey of <hi>Reading,</hi> the Mannor of <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> and the great inclosure of that Parke, with a stone wall seuen miles about.</p>
               <p>The most eminent men of his Councell were, <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and the Earle <note place="margin">His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.</note> of <hi>Mellent,</hi> both, men of great experience in the affaires of the world. <hi>Roger</hi> was euer as Viceroy, had the whole management of the Kingdome in his absence, which was sometimes three, and foure yeares together. He had managed the Kings money and other affaires of his house, when he was a poore Prince, and a priuate man; whereby he gained an especiall trust with him euer after, and discharged his part with great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and vnderstanding; had the title of <hi>Iusticiarius totius Anglioe.</hi> Of whose magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence <note place="margin">The magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of Sarum.</note> and spacious mind, we haue more memorials left in notes of stone, then of any one Man, Prince, or other of this Kingdome. The ruines yet remaining of his stately structures, especially that of the Deuises in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> shewes vs the carkasse of a most <hi>Roman</hi>-like Fabricke. Besides he built the Castles of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Shirburne,</hi> two strong and sumptuous peeces: new walled and repaired the Castle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and all these he liued to see rent from him, and seased into the next Kings hands, as being things done out of his part, and lye now deformed heapes of rubble.

               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Mellent,</hi> was the son of <hi>Roger Beaumont;</hi> who of all the great men which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Robert Mellent</hi> an especiall Councellor to <hi>Hen.</hi> 1.</note> followed <hi>William</hi> the first in his ciuill warres of <hi>Normandy,</hi> refused to attend him in his expedition for <hi>England,</hi> though with large promises inuited thereunto, saying: <hi>The inheritance left him by his predecessors, was sufficient to maintaine his estate at home; and he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to thrust himselfe into other mens possessions abroad.</hi> But his sonne <hi>Robert</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and had a mighty estate both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> Was a man of great direction in councell, and euer vsed in all the weighty affaires of the State. His <note place="margin">The example of frugallitie in great men doth much good in a Kingdome.</note> frugallity, both in apparell and diet, was of such example, being a man of eminent note, as did much good to the Kingdome in those dayes. But in the end he fell into disgrace, (the fate of Court, and eminency) opposed against the King, and died berest of his estate.</p>
               <p>Besides these, this King was serued with a potent and martiall Nobility, whom his spirit led to affect those great designes of his in <hi>France,</hi> for the preseruation of his state in <hi>Normandy.</hi> Whither in the 32. yeare of his raigne, he makes his last voyage to dye there, and in his passage thither, happened an exceeding great Ecclips of the Sunne, <note place="margin">King <hi>Henries</hi> death.</note> which was taken to fore-signifie his death; for that it followed shortly after in the thirty fiue yeare of his raigne.</p>
               <p>He was of a gracefull personage, quick-eyed, browne haire (a different complexion <note place="margin">His personage</note> from his brothers) and of a close compacted temperament, wherein dwelt a mind of a more solide constitution, with better ordered affections. He had, in his youth, some taste of learning; but onely, as if to set his stomake, not to ouer-charge it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But this put many of his subiects into the fashion of the Booke, and diuers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men flourished in his time.</p>
               <p>He had by <hi>Maude</hi> his wife the daughter of <hi>Malcolin</hi> the third, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> none <note place="margin">His issue.</note> other children but <hi>Maude</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> of whom any certaine mention is made: but he is said to haue had of children illigitimate seuen sonnes, and as many daughters, which shewes vs his incontinencie: two of which sonnes of most especiall note, <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Raynold</hi> were Earles, the one of <hi>Glocester</hi> (a great Champion and defender of his Sister <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse) the other Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Castle-combe.</hi> His daughters were all married to Princes and Noble men of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> from whom discended many worthy families, as diuers writers report.</p>

               <p>THE Line <hi>Masculine</hi> of the <hi>Norman</hi> extinct, and onely a daughter left, <note place="margin">1135. Anno. Reg. 1.</note> and she married to a <hi>French-man, Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Bologne,</hi> and <hi>Mortagne,</hi> sonne of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Earle of <hi>Blois,</hi> and of <hi>Adela,</hi> daughter to <hi>William</hi> the first, was (notwithstanding the former oath taken for <hi>Maud</hi>) elected by the State, and inuested in the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> within thirty daies after the death of <hi>Henry.</hi> Vpon what reasons of Councell, wee must gather out of the circumstances of the courses held in that time.</p>
               <p>Some imagine, <hi>The state refused</hi> Maude, <hi>for not being then the custome, of any other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reasons why <hi>Maude</hi> was not crowned.</note> 
                  <hi>Christian (whose Kings are annoynted) to admit women to inherit the Crowne;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might pretend to bee freed from their oath, as being vnlawfull. But <hi>Roger,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> one of the principall men then in councell, yeelded another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the discharge of this oath, which was, <hi>That seeing the late King had married his daughter out of the Realme, and without the consent thereof, they might lawfully refuse her.</hi> And so was <hi>Stephen,</hi> hauing no Title at all, but as one of the bloud, by meere election, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the Crowne. For if hee should claime any right in the Succession, as being the sonne of <hi>Adela,</hi> then must <hi>Theobald,</hi> Earle of <hi>Blois,</hi> his elder brother, haue beene preferred before him: and <hi>Henry Fitz Empresse</hi> (if they refused the mother) was neerer in bloud to the right Stem, then either. But they had other reasons that ruled that time. Stephen <hi>was a man, and of great possessions, both in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>had one</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reasons why <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of Bollogne was crowned King.</note> 
                  <hi>brother, Earle of</hi> Blois, <hi>a Prince of great estate: another, Bishop of</hi> Winchester (<hi>the Popes Legat in</hi> England, <hi>of power eminent) was popular for his affability, goodly personage, and actiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> and therefore acceptable to the Nobility, who, at that time, were altogether guided by the Clergy; and they (by the working of the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> induced to make choyce of him) hauing an opinion, that by preferring one, whose Title was least, would make his obligation the more to them: and so, they might stand (better secured of their liberties) then vnder such a one; as might presume of an hereditary succession. And to be the more sure thereof, before his admittance to the Crowne (he takes a priuate oath before the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury) To confirme the ancient liberties of the Church;</hi> and had his brother to vndertake, betwixt God and him, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof.</p>
               <p>But being now in possession of the Kingdome, and all the Treasure his Vncle had <note place="margin">King <hi>Stephen</hi> possesses the Treasure of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2.</note> in many yeares gathered, which amounted to <hi>one hundred thousand pounds of exquisite siluer, besides plate and iewels, of inestimable value.</hi> After the funerals performed at <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> hee assembles a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherein, <hi>hee restored to the Clergie, all their</hi>

                  <hi>former liberties, and freed the Layetie from their tributes, exactions, or whatsoeuer grieuances opprest them,</hi> confirming the same by his Charter, which, faithfully to obserue, hee tooke a publique oath before all the Assembly: where, likewise the Bishops swore fealty vnto him, but with this condition; <hi>So long as hee obserued the Tenour of this Charter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now as one that was to make good the hold he had gotten, with power, and his sword, prepares for all assaults, which hee was sure to haue come vpon him. And first graunts licence, to all that would, <hi>to build Castles vpon their owne Lands,</hi> thereby to fortifie the Realme, and breake the force of any ouer-running inuasion, that should maister the field. Which in setled times might bee of good effect, but in a season of distraction, and part-takings very dangerous. And being to subsist by friends, hee makes all he could; <hi>Creates new Lords, giues to many, great possessions, and hauing a fullpurse spares for no cost to buy loue, and fidelitie:</hi> a purchase very vncertaine, when there may bee other conueyances made of more strength to carry it.</p>
               <p>Two waies hee was to looke for blowes: from <hi>Scotland</hi> on one side, and <hi>France</hi> on the other: <hi>Scotland</hi> wanted no instigators: <hi>Dauid</hi> their King, mooued both by Nature and his oath to his Neece, turnes head vpon him: <hi>Stephen</hi> was presently there, with

the show of a strong Army, and appeased him with the restitution of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Earledome of <hi>Huntingdon:</hi> which, with that of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (as the Scortish writers say) was to discend vnto him by the right of his mother <hi>Maude,</hi> who was daughter to <hi>Waltheof</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and of <hi>Iudith</hi> Neece to <hi>William</hi> the first, by whose guift hee had that Earledome, and was the sonne of <hi>Syward</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> And for this the Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tooke his Oath of fealty to King <hi>Stephen</hi> which the father refused to doe as hauing first sworne to <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse. Though otherwise hee might bee indifferent, in respect that <hi>Stephen</hi> had married likewise his Neece, which was <hi>Maude</hi> daughter to the Earle of <hi>Bologne,</hi> and of <hi>Mary</hi> Sister to this King <hi>Dauid,</hi> who by this meane was Vncle both to <hi>Maude</hi> the Queene, and <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse.</p>
               <p>The King, returning from this voyage, found some defection of his Nobilitie, which presently put him into another action, that intertayned him sometime: After which, hee falls daungerously sicke, in so much as hee was noysed to bee dead, by which sickenesse, hee lost more then his health: For his friends, put in daunger thereby, cast to seeke another partie to beare them vp: it wakended <hi>Aniou,</hi> and sets him on to surprize certaine peeces in <hi>Normandie,</hi> to prepare for the recouerie of his wiues right, and made all this Kingdome wauer.

by them, putting the King in head, that all these great Castles, especially of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the <hi>Vies, Shirburne, Malmsbury,</hi> and <hi>Newarke,</hi> were onely to intertaine the partie of <hi>Maude,</hi> whereupon the King, whose feares were apt to take fire, sends for the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (most suspected) to <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Bishop, as if foreseeing the mischiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him, would gladly haue put off this iourney, and excused it by the debilitie of <note place="margin">1140. Anno. Reg. 5.</note> his age, but it would not serue his turne: thither he comes, where his seruants, about the taking vp of lodgings, quarrell with the seruants of the Earle of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and from words fall to blowes, so that in the bickering, one of them was slaine, and the Nephew of the Earle dangerously wounded. Whereupon the King sends for the Bishop, to satisfie his Court, for the breach of peace, made by his seruants: The satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction required, was <hi>the yeelding vp the keyes of his Castles, as pledges of his fealtie,</hi> but that being stood vpon, the Bishop, with his Nephew, <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned of their libertie, and shortly after sent as prisoners to the Castle of the <hi>Deuises,</hi>

               <p>This action, being of an extraordinary straine, gaue much occasion of rumor: some said: <hi>The King had done well in seizing vpon these Castles; it being vnfit, and against the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, that they who were men of religion, and peace, should raise fortresses for warre, and in that sort as might bee preiudiciall to the King.</hi> Against this, was the Bishop of <note place="margin">The Popes Legat a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, takes part with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops against the King his brother. <hi>Malmsburie.</hi>

Which was a violence against God. And that seeing the King would yeeld to no admonitions, hee had at length called this Councell, where they were to consult what was to bee done: that for his part, neither the loue of the King, though his brother, nor the losse of his liuing, or danger of his life, should make him fayle in the execution of what they should decree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, standing vpon his cause, sends certaine Earles to this Councell, to know why he was called thither: answere was made by the Legat: <hi>That the King, who was subiect to the faith of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>ought not to take it ill, if by the ministers of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>hee was called to make satisfaction, being conscious of such an offence as that age had not knowne: that it was for times of the Gentiles, for Bishops to bee imprisoned, and depriued of their possessions, and therefore they should tell the King, his brother, that if hee would voutsafe to yeeld consent to the Councell it should bee such, by the helpe of God, as neither the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, the Court of the King of</hi> France, <hi>nor the Earle</hi> Theobald, <hi>brother to them both (a manwise, and religious) should, in reason dislike it: that the King should doe aduisedly to render the reason of his act, and vndergoe a Canonicall iudgement: that hee ought in duetie to fauour the Church, into whose bosome being taken, hee was aduanced to the Crowne without any militarie hand.</hi>

that Nobilitie and stoutnesse, as would neuer voutsafe to come vpon any request to the late King, and yet for the loue of this, was desirous to see <hi>England:</hi> where, to haue this violence offred was an iniury to the King, and dishonour to the Realme, that the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hatred to the Earle of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> was the author of his mens sedition: that the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> secretly fauoured the Kings enemies; and did but subtlely temporize, as the King had found by diuers circumstances: especially when <hi>Roger de Mortimer,</hi> sent with the Kings forces in the great daunger of <hi>Bristow,</hi> hee would not lodge him one night in <hi>Malmsbury:</hi> that it was, in euery mans mouth, as soone as the Empresse came, He and his Nephewes would render their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles vnto him. That he was arested, not as a Bishop, but a seruant to the King, and one that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred his procurations, and receiued his monies. That the King tooke not his Castles by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but the Bishop voluntarily rendred them, to auoyd the calumnie of their tumult raysed in his Court: If the King found some money in his Castles, hee might lawfully seize on it, in regard <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> had collected it out of the reuenues of the King his Vncle, and predecessor: and the Bishop willingly yeelded vp the same, as well as his Castles, through feare of his offences; and of this, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not witnesses of the Kings part, who desired that the couenants, made betweene him, and the Bishop, might remaine ratified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Against this, Bishop</hi> Roger <hi>opposes:</hi> That he was neuer seruant to the King nor receiued his moneys; and withall added threatnings, as a man, not yet broken though bent with his fortunes: that if he found not iustice for his wrongs in that Councell, hee would bring it to the hearing of a greater Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Legat, mildly, as he did other things, said:</hi> That all what was spoken against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, ought first to be examined in the Ecclesiasticall Councell, whether they were true or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sentence should haue beene giuen against them contrary to the Canons: and therefore the King should (as it is lawfull in iudiciall trials) reuest the Bishops in their former Estates, otherwise, by the law of Nations being disseised, they shall not hold their Plea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After much debate, the Kings cause was (vpon a motion) put off till the next day, to the end the Archbishop of</hi> Roan, <hi>an especiall instrument for the King, might bee there; who deliueting his opinion, said:</hi> That if the Bishops could rightly prooue by the Canons, they ought to haue Castles, they should hold them; but if they could not, it proceeded of great improbitie to striue to doe otherwise. And be it (said he) their right to haue them; yet in a suspected time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of other Nations: all great men ought to deliuer the keyes of their Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to be at the Kings pleasure, who is to fight for the peace of all But it is not their right, by the decree of the Canons to haue Castles; and if by the Princes indulgence it bee tollerated, yet in a time of necessitie, they ought to deliuer the keyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lawier</hi> Alboric <hi>addes:</hi> That it was signified to the King, how the Bishops threatned, and had furnished some to go to Rome against him. But, said he, the King would haue you know, that none of you presume to doe it: for if any goe out of England, contrarie to his will, and the dignitie of the Kingdome, it will be hard returning. <hi>In conclusion the Councell brake vp, nothing was done. The Bishops durst not excommunicate the King, without the Popes</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Shortly after, though griefe, died the Bishop of <hi>Salisbary,</hi> and (according to the fate of ouer-minent and greedy Officers) vnpittied. He was a man (in his latter time) noted of much corruption, and vnsatiable desire of hauing. For whom, the present King in the beginning of his reigue had done very much, makingone of his Nephewes Chancellor, the other Treasurer, and vpon his fute, gaue to himselfe the Borough of <hi>Malmesbury;</hi> insomuch as the King would say to his familiars about him: <hi>If this man will begge thus still; I will giue him halfe the Kingdome but I will please him: and first shall be weary of crauing, ere I of granting.</hi> And sure the King had great reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his adhering to <hi>Maude,</hi> whose part he beganne to fauour: onely, out of the hatred he bare to <hi>Winchester,</hi> who yet was content to forsake his owne brother, in regard, by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7690:38"/>
his ingagement he was preferred to the Crowne, rather then to loose his good will, and the rest of the Clergie.</p>
               <p>But yet this breaking of the King into the Church (which had made him) vtterly dissolued him. For presently hereupon all his power fell asunder: the Empresse found now away open to let her in, and the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> presuming of a sure side, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into England.</note> conducted her into <hi>England</hi> onely with 150 men: puts her into the Castle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> and himselfe (attended but with twelue horse) passed away cleere through all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to <hi>Bristow:</hi> and from thence to <hi>Glocester,</hi> where he had leisure without opposition, to raise all the Country to take part with the Empresse; who from <hi>Arundell</hi> Castle, was afterward (by the Legate himselfe, and the Kings permission) conueyed to <hi>Bristow:</hi> receiued with all obedience, grew daily in strength, as she went and came at length to her brother (who had taken in <hi>Hereford,</hi> made himselfe strong with the Welsh, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led those parts) to gather vp more of the Kingdome by shewing herselfe and her power in diuers places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen,</hi> hauing no part cleere (by reason the Castles, vpon which he spent both his time and meanes, lay so thicke blockes in his way) as he could not make that speed to stop this streame, as otherwise he would: holding it not safe to goe forward, and leaue dangers behinde, that might ouer-take him. And first hee layes siege to the Castle of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> which, <hi>Brian</hi> sonne to the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> held against him: then to the Castle of <hi>Bristow</hi> and other places, working much, but effecting little: which seeing, to get time and stagger the swift proceeding of this new receiued Princesse, he causes a treatie of peace to be propounded at <hi>Bathe,</hi> where the Legat (who likewise earnestly solicited the same) with the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were appointed Commissioners for the King; and the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> for the Empresse; but nothing was effected, both returne to make good their sides. The Empresse seekes to recouer more, the King what he had lost. And least the North parts might fall from him, and the King of Scots come on, hee repaires thitherward: and finding the Castle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> possest by <hi>Ralph</hi> Earle of Chester, who had married a daughter of the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it not safe to bee in the hands of such a maister, in such a time, seekes to take it in by force. The Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> who held Newtall, attempting nothing against the King, tooke it ill, and stood vpon his defence: but being ouer-layd by power, conueyes himselfe out of the Castle, leaues his brother and wife within to defend it, and procures ayde of his father in law the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to succour him.</p>
               <p>The Earle takes in hand this businesse, sets out of <hi>Glocester</hi> with an Army of <hi>Welshmen</hi> and others, attended with <hi>Hugh Bigod,</hi> and <hi>Robert de Morley,</hi> ioynes with the Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> marches to <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where, in the battaile, King <hi>Stephen</hi> was taken, carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to <hi>Glocester,</hi> presented to the Empresse, and by her sent to bee kept in the Castle of <hi>Bristow,</hi> but in all honourable fashion, till his attempts to escape layd fetters on him.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Empresse (as at the top of her fortune) labours the Legat <hi>to hee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">She labours the Legat for the Crowne of England.</note> 
                  <hi>to the Kingdome, as the daugher of the late King, to whom the Realme had taken an oath to accept for soueraigne in the succession;</hi> and wrought so, as a Parle was appointed for this purpose, on the Plaine neere to <hi>Winchester,</hi> where in a blustring sad day (like the fate of the businesse) they met: and the Empresse swore, and made affidation to the Legat, <hi>That all the great businesses, and especially the donation of Bishoprickes and Abbeys, should bee at his disposing, if he (with the Church) would receiue her as Queene of</hi> England, <hi>and hold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall fidelitie vnto her.</hi> The same oath and affidation tooke likewise her brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester, Brian</hi> his sonne, Marquisse of <hi>Wallingford; Miles</hi> of <hi>Glocester</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Earle of <hi>Hereford</hi>) with many others for her. Nor did the Bishop sticke to accept her as Queene (though she neuer came to bee so) and with some few other, make like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affidation for his part, that so long as shee infringed not her couenant, hee would also hold his fidelity to her.</p>
               <p>The next day, shee was receiued with solemne procession into the Bishops Church at Winchester, the Bishop leading her on the right hand, and <hi>Bernard</hi> Bishop of Saint <hi>Dauids</hi> on the left. There were present many other Bishops, as <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7690:38"/>
Lincolne, <hi>and</hi> Nigel <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ely (<hi>the Nephewes of</hi> Roger, <hi>lately imprisoned</hi>) Robert <hi>Bishop of</hi> Bathe, <hi>and</hi> Robert <hi>Bishop of</hi> Worcester, <hi>with many Abbots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within a few dayes after came</hi> Theobald, <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>to the Empresse, inuited by the Legat; but deferred to doe fealty vnto her, as holding it vnworthy his person and place, without hauing conferd first with the King. And therefore hee, with many Prelats, and some of the Layety (by permission obtained) went to the King to</hi> Bristow. <hi>The Councell brake vp, the Empresse keepes her Easter at Oxford, being her owne towne. Shortly vpon Easter a Councell of the Clergie is againe called to</hi> Winchester, <hi>where the first day the Legat had secret conference with euery Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and then with euery Abbot and other, which were called to the Councell. The next day hee makes a publicke speech,</hi> Shewing how the cause (of their Assembly) was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult <note place="margin">The Legats speech to the Clergie, to Crowne the Empresse.</note> for the peace of their country, in great daunger of vtter ruine. Repeates the flourishing raigne of his Vncle, the peace, wealth, and honour of the Kingdome in his time: and how that renowned King, many yeares before his death, had receiued an oath both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> for the succession of his daughter <hi>Maude</hi> and her Issue. But, <hi>said he,</hi> after his decease, his daughter being then in <hi>Normandy,</hi> making delay to come into <hi>England,</hi> where (for that it seemed long to expect) order was to bee taken for the peace of the Countrey, and my brother was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to raigne. And although I interposed my selfe a surety betweene God and him, that hee should honour and exalt the holy Church, keepe and ordaine good Lawes; Yet, how hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe in the Kingdome, it grieues mee to remember, and I am ashamed to repeate. And then recounts he all the Kings courses with the Bishops, and all his other misgouernments. And then, <hi>said hee,</hi> euerie man knowes I ought to loue my mortall brother, but much more the cause of my immortall Father: and therefore seeing God hath shewed his iudgement on my brother, and suffered him (without my knowledge) to fall into the hand of Power: that the Kingdome may not miscarie for want of a Ruler, I haue called you all hither by the power of my Legation. Yesterday the cause was mooued in secret, to the greatest part of the Clergie, to whom the right appertaines to elect and ordaine a Prince. And therefore after hauing inuoked (as it is meete, the Diuine aide) Wee elect for Queene of <hi>England</hi> the daughter of the peacefull, glorious, rich, good, and in our time the incomparable King: and to her, wee promise our faith and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When all, who were present, either modestly gaue their voyce, or by their silence contradicted it, the Legat addes:</hi> The <hi>Londoners,</hi> who are (in respect of the greatnesse of their City) as among the optimacie of <hi>England,</hi> we haue by our messengers summoned, and I trust they will not stay beyond this day, tomorrow we will expect them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Londoners <hi>came, were brought into the Councell, shewed</hi> How they were sent from the Communaltie of <hi>London,</hi> not to bring contention, but prayer, that the King their Lord might be freed from captiuitie, and the same did all the Barons (receiued within their Liberties) earnestly beseech of my Lord Legate, and all the Clergie there present. <hi>The Legat answeres them at large, and loftily, according to his speech the day before, and added,</hi> That the <hi>Londoners,</hi> who were held in that degree in <hi>England,</hi> ought not to take their parts, who had forsaken their Lord in the warre, by whose Councell the Church had beene dishonoured, and who fauoured the <hi>Londoners,</hi> but for their owne gaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then stands there vp a Chaplaine to Queene</hi> Maude, <hi>wife to</hi> Stephen, <hi>and deliuers a letter to the Legat, which he silently read, and then said allowd,</hi> that it was not lawfull in the assembly of so many reuerend and religious persons the same should be publikely read, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matter retrehensible. <hi>The Chapline not to faile in his message, boldly reades the Letter himselfe, which was to this effect:</hi> That the Queene earnestly intreates all the Clergie there assembled, and namely the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the brother of her Lord, to restore him vnto the Kingdome, whom wicked men, which were also his subiects, held prisoner.</p>
               <p>To this the Legat answeres (as to the <hi>Londoners</hi>) and shortly after the Councel brake vp, wherein many of the Kings part were excommunicated: namely <hi>William Martell,</hi> an especiall man about the King, who had much displeased the Legat.</p>
               <p>Hereupon a great part of <hi>England</hi> willingly accepted of <hi>Maude,</hi> in whose businesses her brother <hi>Robert</hi> imployes all his diligence and best care, <hi>reforming Iustice, restoring
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7690:39"/>
the Lawes of</hi> England, <hi>promising releeuements, and whatsoeuer might be to winne the people;</hi> the Legat seconding all his courses.</p>
               <p>But now, shee being at the point of obtayning the whole Kingdome; all came so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly dasht by her ouer-hautie and proud carriage, and by the practise of the <hi>Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> who adhering to the other side, began openly to inueigh against her, who had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased them, and they had plotted to surprize her in their Citie, whereof she hauing notice, secretly withdrawes herselfe (accompained with her Vncle <hi>Dauid</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> who was come to visit her and her brother <hi>Robert</hi>) vnto <hi>Oxford,</hi> a place of more <note place="margin">The Legat leaues the Empresse.</note> securitie. The Leagat himselfe takes, or makes an occasion to bee slacke in her cause, vpon her denying him a sute for his Nephew <hi>Eustaee,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Stephen,</hi> about the inheritance of his Earledome of <hi>Mortaine</hi> in <hi>Normandie.</hi> Besides the Queene regnant, watchfull ouer all oportunities, found meanes to parle with the Legar, <hi>Sets vpon him with her teares, intreatie, promises, and assurance for the Kings reformation;</hi> in so much as <hi>shee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Is intreated with teares by the Queene regnant.</note> 
                  <hi>recalled him to the affections of Nature, brought him about againe to absolue such of the Kings part as he had lately excommunicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> seeing this sodaine and strange relaps of their affaires, striues by all meanes to hold vp Opinion, and re-quicken the Legats dispofition, which to keepe sound, was all. He brings the Empresse to <hi>Winchester,</hi> setles her, and her guard, in the Castle, where she desires to speake with the Legat, who first delayes, then denies <note place="margin">The Empresse besieged at Oxford, the Earle of Glocester ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner.</note> to come. Whereupon they call their best friends about them. Queene <hi>Maude</hi> and the Lords incompasse the Towne, and cut off all victuall from the Empresse, so that in the end, the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> wrought meanes to haue her conueyd from thence to the <hi>Vies,</hi> but himselfe was taken and in him most of her.</p>
               <p>This sets the sides both euen againe into the Lists of ther triall: the two prisoners are to redeeme each other: The disproportion of the quality betweene them, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet there was an euennesse of power, and the Earle would not consent to the Kings deliuery (who onely in that was to haue the precedence) but vpon most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure cautions. The Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Legate, vndertooke to yeeld themselues prisoners for him, if the King released him not, according to his promise: But that would not serue the turne, till they both had written their Briefes to the Pope, to intimate the course that was taken herein, and deliuered the same vnto him, vnder their hands and seales. So that, if the King should, as he might not care, to hold the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in prison: yet the Pope, if hard measure were offred, might releeue them. Which shewes the aduantage of credit in the businesse, lay on this side, and the King was to haue his fetters, though at liberty.</p>

Reg. 7.</note> remaine pledges in the Castle of <hi>Bristow</hi> till the Earle were released, which was done vpon the Kings comming to <hi>Winchester.</hi> Where the Earle in familiar conference, was, by all art possible, solicited to forsake the partie of <hi>Maude,</hi> with promise of all preferments of honour and estate: but nothing could mooue him being fixt to his courses, and rather would hee haue beene content to remaine a perpetuall prisoner, then that <hi>Stephen</hi> should haue beene released, had not his sister wrought him to this conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Legat, after this, calls a Councell at <hi>London,</hi> where the Popes letters, written vnto him, are openly read, which argue him (but mildly) of some neglect of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>The King himselfe came into the councell, complaines,</hi> How his subiects, to whom <note place="margin">King <hi>Stephens</hi> complaint.</note> hee had neuer denied Iustice, had taken him, and reproachfully afflicted him euen to death. <hi>The Legate, with great eloquence, labours to excuse his owne courses: alledging,</hi> How hee receiued not the Empresse by his will, but necessitie: that presently vpon the Kings ouerthrow, whilest the Lords were either fled, or stood in suspence attending the euent, shee and her people came thundring to the walles of <hi>Winchester:</hi> and that, what pact soeuer hee had made with her for the right of the Church, shee obstinately brake all: besides, hee was certainely informed, that shoe and hers had plotted, both against his dignitie, and life:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7690:39"/>
But God in his mercy, contrarie to her desire, had turned the businesse so, as hee escaped the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his brother was deliuered out of bands. And therefore hee, from the part of God, and the Pope, willed them, with all their vtmost power, to aide the King, annointed by the consent of the People, and the Sea Apostolique, and to Excommunicate all the disturbers of the peace that fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Countesse of <hi>Aniou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was in the Councell a Lay Agent for the Empresse, who openly charged the Legat, <hi>That in respect of the faith he had giuen the Empresse, to passe no act there, preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to her Honour: hauing sworne vnto her neuer to aide his brother with aboue twentie soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: that her comming into</hi> England, <hi>was vpon his often Letters vnto her: and his cause it was, that the King was taken and held prisoner.</hi> This, and much more sayd the Agent with great austerity of words, wherewith the Legat seemed not to bee mooued at all, nor would stoope to reply.</p>
               <p>Both parts thus set at libertie, were left to worke for themselues, holding the State broken betweene them; and no meanes made to interpose any barre to keepe them asunder. Their borders lay euery where, and then the ingagements of their Partakers, who (looke all to be sauers or to recouer their stakes when they were lost, which makes them neuer giue ouer) entertaine the contention. But the best was, they were rather troubles, then warres, and cost more labour then bloud. Euery one fought with Bucklers, and seldome came to the sharpe in the field, which would soone haue ended the businesse.</p>
               <p>Some few moneths after these inlargements, stood both sides at some rest, but not idle, casting how to compasse their ends. The Empresse at the <hi>Vies</hi> with her Councell, resolues to send ouer her brother into <hi>Normandy</hi> to solicit her husband the Earle of <note place="margin">The Earle of Glocester gets to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie.</note> 
                  <hi>Aniou,</hi> to come to aide her, with forces from thence: Her brother, the better to secure her in his absence, setles her in the Castle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> well furnished for all assaults: and takes with him the sonnes of the especiall men about her, as pledges to hold them to their fidelity. <hi>Stephen</hi> seekes to stop the Earles passage, but could not, and then layes siege to the Castle of <hi>Oxford;</hi> which held him all the time the Earle was abroad. <hi>Geffrey</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> desirous rather to haue <hi>Normandie,</hi> whereof, in this meane time, he had attained the most part, and in possibility of the rest, then to aduenture for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which lay in danger, refused to come in person, but sends some small aide, and his eldest sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> being then but eleuen yeares of age, that he might looke vpon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; be shewed to the people, to try if that would mooue them to a consideration of his right: which proned of more effect then an Army.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> safely returning, makes towards <hi>Oxford</hi> to releeue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <note place="margin">The Earles retuine with the Empresses eldest sonne <hi>Henry.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> seeing his enemy thus supplied, and like to grow, labours to winne friends, <note place="margin">1143. Anno.

               <p>The Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the chiefe pillar of the Empresse, within two yeares after his <note place="margin">The Earle of Glocester dies.</note> last comming out of <hi>Normandie</hi> died, and shortly after <hi>Miles</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall man of hers, which had vtterly quasht her, but that in stead of a brother shee had a sonne grew vp to bee of more estimation with the Nobility, and shortly after of ablenesse to vndergoe the trauailes of warre. His first expedition at sixteene yeares of age was Northward to combine him with <hi>Dauid</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> his great Vncle, to whom his mother had giuen the Country of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> After him followes <hi>Stephen</hi> with an Army to <hi>Yorke,</hi> least hee should surprize that Citie, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cept him in his returne: but according to his vsuall manner, and French-like, after the first heate of his vndertakings, which were quicke and braue, hee quailes:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7690:40"/>
nothing was effected, and both returne without incountring.</p>
               <p>Now to aduance the State and meanes of <hi>Henry,</hi> fortune, as if in loue with young Princes, presents this occasion. <hi>Louys</hi> the seuenth, King of France going in person to the Holy warres, and taking with him his wife <hi>Elenor,</hi> the onely daughter and heire of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Guien,</hi> grew into such an odious conceipt of her, vpon the notice of her lasciuious behauiour in those parts, as the first worke hee doth vpon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe, hee repudiates, and turnes her home with all her great dowrie, rather content to loose the mightie estate she brought him then to marry her person. With this great Lady matches <hi>Henry,</hi> before he was twenty yeares of age (being now Duke of <note place="margin">An. 1151.</note> 
                  <hi>Normandie,</hi> his father deceased, who had recouered it for him) and had by her the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all those large and rich Countries, apertayning to the Dutchy of <hi>Guien,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Earldome of <hi>Poictou.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Louys</hi> inraged to see him inlarged by this great accession of State, who was so neere, and like to be so dangerous and eminent a neighbour, combines with <hi>Stephen,</hi> and aydes <hi>Eustace</hi> his sonne (whom hee married to his Sister <hi>Constance</hi>) with maine power, for the recouery of <hi>Normandie,</hi> wherein hee was first possest. But this young Prince, furnished now with all this powerfull meanes, leaues the management of the affaires of <hi>England</hi> to his friends, defends <hi>Normandie,</hi> wrought so, as the King of <hi>France</hi> did him little hurt; and <hi>Eustace,</hi> his competitor, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home into <hi>England,</hi> where shortly after hee died, about 18 yeares of his age, borne neuer to see out of the calamities of warre, and was buried at <hi>Feuersham</hi> with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who deceased a little before, and had no other ioy nor glorie of a Crowne but what we see. <hi>Stephen,</hi> whilst Duke <hi>Henrie</hi> was in <hi>Normandie,</hi> recouers what hee could, and at length besieges <hi>Wallinford,</hi> which seemes in these times to haue beene a peece of great importance, and impregnable, and reduced the Defendants to that extremitie, as they sent to Duke <hi>Henrie</hi> for succour, who presently thereupon, in the middest of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ariues in <hi>England</hi> with 3000 foot, and 140 horse. Where first, to draw the King from <hi>Wallingford,</hi> he layes siege to <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and had most of all the great men in the West, and from other parts comming in vnto him. <hi>Stephen,</hi> now resolued to put it to the tryall of a day, brings thither all the power hee could make; and far ouer-went his enemy in number: but flouds and stormes, in an vnseasonable Winter, kept the Armies from incountring, till the Bishops, doubtfull of the successe, and seeing how daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it was for them, and the whole State, to haue a young Prince get the maistry by his sword, mediated a peace, which was after concluded in a Parliament at <hi>Winchester,</hi> vpon these conditions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That King <hi>Stephen,</hi> during his naturall life, should remaine King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Henrie</hi> inioy the Dukedome of <hi>Normandie,</hi> as discended vnto him from his mother, and bee proclaymed heire apparent to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> as the adopted sonne of King <hi>Stephen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That the partizans of either, should receiue no damage, but inioy their Estates according to their ancient Rights and Titles.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the King should resume into his hands all such parcels of inheritance belonging <note place="margin">Resumptions.</note> to the Crowne, as had beene aliened by him, or vsurped in his time. And that all those posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which by intrusion had beene violently taken from the owners since the dayes of King <hi>Henry,</hi> should bee vestored vnto them who were rightly possessed therein, when the said King raigned.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That all such Castles as had beene built by the permission of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and in his time (which were found to be 1117) should be demolished, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is a Charter of this agreement in our Annals, which hath other Articles of reseruation for the Estates of particular persons. And first for <hi>William,</hi> the second sonne <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Append.</note> of <hi>Stephen,</hi> to enioy all the possessions his father held before hee was King of <hi>England,</hi> and many other particulars of especiall note.</p>
               <p>After this pacification, and all businesse here, setled, Duke <hi>Henry</hi> returnes into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and likewise there concludes a peace with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and for that hee would be sure to haue it, buyes it, with twenty thousand markes.</p>
               <p>And now King <hi>Stephen</hi> hauing attained (that hee neuer had) Peace (which yet, it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7690:40"/>
seemes he enioyed not a yeare after) vses all the best meanes he could to repaire the ruines of the State, makes his progresses into most parts of the Kingdome, to reforme the mischiefes that had growne vp vnder the sword: and after his returne cals a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note place="margin">An. 1154.</note> at <hi>London,</hi> to consult of the best meanes for the publicke good. After the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <note place="margin">He raigned 18 yeares, and 10 moneths.</note> he goes to meete the Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Douer,</hi> who desired conference with him, and hauing dispatcht him, fals presently sicke, dies within few dayes after, and was buried (in the Abbey he founded) at <hi>Feuersham,</hi> with the vnfortunate Princes.</p>
               <p>A man so continually in motion, as we cannot take his dimension, but onely in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and that but on one side, which was warre: on the other, we neuer saw but a glaunce of him, which yet, for the most part, was such, as shewed him to bee a very worthy Prince for the Gouernment. He kept his word with the State concerning the relieuement of Tributes, <hi>and neuer had Subsidy that we find.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But which is more remarkeable, hauing his sword continually out, and so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and rebellions against him, <hi>He neuer put any great man to death.</hi> Besides it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that notwithstanding all these miseries of warre, <hi>There were more Abbeys built in his Raigne, then in an hundreth yeares before,</hi> which shewes, though the times were bad, they were not impious.</p>

               <p>But now the aduantage of power lying all on this side, and the King seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at large (and how much he was abroad) beganne to be more at home, and to <note place="margin">The King seekes to abate the power of the Clergy &amp; the cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> looke to the Prerogatiues of his Crowne, which as he was informed, grew much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by the Clergy: which, since the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, <hi>Were thought to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their iurisdiction beyond their vocation:</hi> and himselfe had found their power, in the election of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> with whom they made their owne conditions, with all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages for themselues, whereby they depriued his Mother and her issue, of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crowne. And though afterwards by their mediation, the peace twixt him, and <hi>Stephen</hi> was concluded, and his succession ratified: yet for that, might he thanke his Sword, the Iustice of his cause, and strong party in the Kingdome. What they did therein shewed him rather their power, then their affection: and rather put him in mind of what they had done against him at first, then layed any obligation on him, for what they did afterward. And his owne example, seeing them apt to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, all aduantages for their owne aduancement, made him doubt how they might deale with his Posterity, if they found occasion: and therefore is he easily drawne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their power in what he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this motion of the Kings dislike, the Lay Nobility (emulous of the others au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) layed more waights: alledging</hi> how the immunities of the Clergie tooke vp so much <note place="margin">Complaints against the Clergie.</note> from the Royalty, as his execution of Iustice, could haue no generall passage in the Kingdome: the Church held their Dominion apart, and free from any other authority then their owne: and being exempt from Secular punishments, many enormious acts were committed by Clergie-men, without any redresse to be had: <hi>and it was notified to the King, that since the beginning of his Raigne,</hi> There had beene aboue a hundreth Man-slaughters committed within the Realme of <hi>England</hi> by Priests, and men within Orders.</p>
               <p>Now had the King, a little before (vpon the death of <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>) <note place="margin">1161. Anno.

Kings as they are bred. At the beginning of this mans promotion, this reformation of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction is set vpon, <hi>a worke (in regard of that time of deuotion) of great difficultie:</hi> the Bishops, hauing from the beginning of Christianitie, first vnder the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, principally swaded the State: and though at the entrance of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> they were much abriged of their former liberties, <hi>they held themselues if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet quiet.</hi> For albeit they had not that power in temporall businesses as before; yet, <hi>within their owne circle, they held their owne iurisdiction, and immunities: and had since, both by the Law, ciuill warres, and the occasion of forraine affaires, much inlarged them.</hi> So that, any restriction, or diminution, of the powre they had, could not but touch vaines, that were very sensible in that part: especially, <hi>by reason of the vniuersall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Spirit that fed them:</hi> and therefore could not bee but a businesse of much trouble,</p>
               <p>The King conuokes a Councell at Westminster, and there first propounds to haue <note place="margin">A Parliament at Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> it enacted, <hi>That all such of the Clergie as should bee taken and conuicted for any heinous offence should loose the priuiledge of the Church, and bee deliuered to the ciuill Magestrate, to be punished</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1163. Anno. Reg. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for their offences, as other the Kings subiects were.</hi> For, if after Spirituall punishment, no secular correction should bee vsed; there would bee no sufficient meanes to restraine them from doing mischiefe: seeing it was not likely, such men would much care for their degrading and losse of Order, whom the Conscience of their calling did not hold in awe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Archbishop and his suffragans, with the rest of the Bishops, shewed the King</hi> how they were not to yeeld to any such Act, being against the liberties of the Church, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had sworne to defend, and maintaine: and therefore humbly besought him, that hee would not vrge auything to the preiudice of their iurisdiction, and such immunities as they had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to enioyed, both vnder him and his Noble Progenitors.</p>
               <p>The King, not liking this aunswere, demaunds, <hi>Whether they would submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Lawes and Customes, which the Archbishops and Bishops, in the time of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father</hi> Henry <hi>the first did obserue?</hi> they answered, <hi>they would; their Order, the honour of God; and holy Church, in all things saued,</hi> with which reseruation the King grew more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, the Parliament brake vp, and nothing effected at that time, for hee saw the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops fast to themselues, and the more by the animation of the Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, whom hee thought (in regard of all those his graces bestowed on him) to haue found more yeelding to his courses, and therefore his indignation was most against him: and because hee would make him see what the displeasure of so mightie a King was, who could as well cast downe as aduance: <hi>First denies him accesse: then takes from him, what hee could possibly, countenances all such as were his opposites, his businesses in any the Kings Courts goe against him, the Earle of</hi> Clare <hi>is supported in a contestation hee had with him, about his homage for the Castle of</hi> Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, <hi>and preuailes:</hi> nothing is left vndone, that might bee thought to humble him. And besides the King wrought so, <hi>As hee vnties the knot, gaines first the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of</hi> Yorke (<hi>the ancient Competitor with Canterbury in dignity) and after, the Bishops of</hi> Lincolne, Hereford, <hi>and the especiall Prelates: and seperates them both from the counsell, and company of the Archbishop</hi> Becket.</p>
               <p>Notice of this iarre being giuen abroad, a Messenger is sent from the Pope, and all the Cardinalls to reconcile it, and <hi>to charge the Archbishop to make peace with his Lord the King, and promise to obserue his Lawes without exception.</hi> The Archbishop pressed with this message, and the aduice of many great men, repaires to the King at Woodstooke, and there <hi>promises in good faith,</hi> without any euell meaning, <hi>to obserue the Kings Lawes so farre foorth as was required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King supposing now, things better prepared for his purpose then before, <note place="margin">A Parliament at Clarendon.</note> calls a generall Assembly of the Bishops and Nobilitie at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> of Oxford, the Kings Clerke was President of the Councell: and a charge is <note place="margin">1164. Anno. Reg. 10.</note> giuen from the King, <hi>That they should call to memorie the Lawes of his Grand-father</hi> Henrie <hi>the first, and to reduce them into writing:</hi> which beeing done, hee willed the Arch-bishoppe and Bishops, to set their Seales thereunto. Which when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7690:43"/>
the rest were content to do, <hi>The Arch-bishop</hi> Becket <hi>refused.</hi> Yet at length, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Bishops (vrging him to satisfie the Kings pleasure, and appease his wrath, in regard of his present danger, which, by the rushing vp and downe of the Kings seruants with threatning countenances, they suspected themselues likely to fall <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Becket,</hi> takes his oath to obserue the Kings lawes.</note> into) <hi>He tooke his Oath to obserue the Kings Lawes without any reseruation.</hi> And for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting desired to haue a copy, as if better to aduise thereof. And taking it into his hand, he turnes to the Clergie, and sayd: <hi>Brethren stand fast, you see the malice of the King, and of whom we are to beware.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Councell ended, but not the Kings displeasure against the Arch-bishop, whom onely he found, durst beare vp against his power, the rest all yeelding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <note place="margin">The king vseth all meanes to vex the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</note> unto. And therefore proceedes he, <hi>by all meanes to vexe and disgrace him, and to aduance his Concurrent the Arch-bishop of</hi> Yorke, <hi>whom he solicites the Pope</hi> (<hi>by his Agents</hi> Iohn <hi>of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and</hi> Geffery Riddle) <hi>to make his Legat of all</hi> England. Which the Pope (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned acquainted with this busines) refused to do: yet at the petition of those Agents granted <hi>that Legation to the King himselfe, but so as he should do nothing to grieue the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> which the King tooke as a great indignity, and sent backe his Agents with the Popes Graunt.</p>
               <p>The Arch-bishop <hi>Becket</hi> after his oath at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> so repented, as <hi>he suspended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop repents him of his oath.</note> 
                  <hi>from the seruice of the Altar, and did sharpe penance till he had obtained absolution from the Pope,</hi> Which (vpon his information of the case) was sent him. After this, as some write, he attempts to depart out of the Kingdome, contrary to <hi>a law made at</hi> Clarendon (<hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Arch-bishops, Bishops, and other Persons to depart out of the Realme without the Kings leaue. Which, although they obtained, yet were notwithstanding to secure the King, neither in their going, returning, or staying there, to practise any thing preiudicious to his State or Person</hi>) But being by contrary winds brought backe, he more exasperates the King against him.</p>
               <p>After this, he is summoned to an Assembly at <hi>Northampton</hi> (holden about the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Acts of <hi>Clarendon</hi>) where (to dispight him the more) the Kings horses <note place="margin">A Parliament at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> are placed in his Inne; And there, <hi>First had he a Case adiudged against him, concerning a Mannor, for which, one</hi> Iohn <hi>the Kings Marshall contended with him in Law, and besides the losse of the Mannor, was cast in arrerages fiue hundreth Markes,</hi> which the King was sayd to haue lent him, but he alledged how it was giuen: yet because he confessed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and could not prooue the gift, he was condemned to pay it. <hi>Then was he called to render an accompt to the King of all such receipts as in the time of his Chanceller ship he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop called to account.</note> 
                  <hi>for the King, of certaine Bishopricks and Abbeys during their vacancies, which amounted to the summe of three thousand Markes.</hi> For these accounts, he alledged, <hi>How the King knew well, he was discharged before his election to the Sea of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and how the Prince, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer, and</hi> Robert de Lucie, <hi>Chiefe Iustice of</hi> England, <hi>had made him his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance for all accounts, and Secular receipts, in the behalfe of the King: and so (free and cleered) was he chosen to the administration of that Office, and therefore would pleade the same no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, notwithstanding, vrging to haue iudgement passe against him, both for this, his late attempts, and disobedience, he was commanded the next day to attend his Censure. The morning before he was to appeare, he celebrates early with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, the Masse of Saint <hi>Stephen Protomartir,</hi> which hath these words: <hi>Etenim sede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Principes, &amp; aduersum me loquebantur:</hi> and so committing his cause to God, <hi>sets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Court in his Stole, his blacke Canonicall hood, carrying the Crosse in his right hand, and guiding his horse with the left.</hi> The people seeing him come in this fashion, flocke all about him, he entring the great Chamber, sate downe amongst them, the King being within, in his Priuie Chamber with his Councell: from whom, first came forth the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> and much blames him for comming so armed to the Court, and offered to pull the Crosse out of his hand, but the Arch-bishop held it so fast that he could not. Which the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> seeing, sayd to <hi>London, Brother let him alone, he ought well to beare the Crosse, London</hi> replies, <hi>You speake brother against the King, and it will be ill for you.</hi> After this, comes forth the Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> (the heate of whose antient hatred, saith <hi>Houeden,</hi> would not suffer him to speake in peace, and rebukes him very sharply, <note place="margin">Roger Houeden.</note>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:7690:43"/>
                  <hi>for comming in that fashion, as if to a Tyrant, or heathen Prince; and told him,</hi> that the King had a sword sharper then his Crosse, and if hee would bee aduised by him hee should take it from him. <hi>Canterbury replies,</hi> the Kings sword wounds carnally, but mine strikes Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and sends the soule to Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After much debate, the Archbishoppe</hi> Becket <hi>inuayes against this violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against him:</hi> How no age euer heard before, that an Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had beene adiudged in any of the Kings Courts for anie cause whatsoeuer, in regard both of his Dignity and place: and for that hee is the Spirituall Father of the King, and all other his subiects. <hi>Then to the Bishops,</hi> you see the world rageth against mee, the enemy riseth vp, but I more lament, the Sonnes of my Mother fight against mee. If I should conceale it, the age to come will declare, how you leaue mee alone in the battaile, and haue iudged against mee, being your Father, though neuer so much a sinner. But I charge you by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your obedience, and perill of your Order, that you bee not present in anie place of iudgement, where my person or cause comes to bee adiudged. And here I appeale to the Pope, <hi>charging you farther by vertue of your obedience,</hi> that if anie Temporall man laie handes on mee, you exercise the Sentence of the Church; as it becomes you for your Father the Archbishop, who will not shrinke howsoeuer, nor leaue the flock commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him.</p>
               <p>Then were all these great complaints of his contempt, Disobedience, and Periury, exhibited, and aggrauated against him before the Assembly, and they cried general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Complaints against the Archbishop.</note> hee was a Traytor, that hauing receiued so many benefits at the Kings hands, would refuse to doe him all earthly honour, and obserue his Lawes as hee had sworne to doe. The Bishops likewise, seeing all thus bent against him, <hi>renounced their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall obedience vnto him, cited him to</hi> Rome, <hi>and condemnes him as a periured man and a Traytor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Earle of Lecester accompayned with</hi> Reginald <hi>Earle of Cornwall came to the Archbishop, and charged him from the King to answere to what was obiected vnto him, or else to heare his iudgement.</hi> Nay, sonne Earle, <hi>sayd he, first heare you:</hi> It is not vnknowne to your selfe, how faithfully I haue serued the King, and how in regard thereof hee preferred mee to the place I haue (God is my witnesse) against my will. For I knew mine owne infermities, and was content to take it vpon mee, rather for his pleasure, then Gods cause; therefore now doth God withdraw himselfe, and the King from mee. At the time of my Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee made mee free from all Court bondage, and therefore touching those things from which I am deliuered, I am not bound to aunswere, nor will I. How much the soule is worthier then the bodie, so much are you bound to obay God and mee rather then any Earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: neither will Law or Reason permit the Sonnes to condemne the Father: and I refuse to stand either to the Iudgement of the King or anie other person; appealing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Pope by whom onely on Earth I ought to bee adiudged, committing all I haue to Gods protection and his: and vnder that authority I depart out of this place. <hi>And so went hee out and tooke his Horse, not without some difficultie in passing, and many repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Kings seruants.</hi>

               <p>Being gotten out of the Court, a great multitude of the common people (reioycing to see him deliuered) and diuers of the Clergie conuayed him honourably to the Abbay of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> whence disguised (by the name of <hi>Dereman</hi>) hee escaped ouer into Flanders, and so into France.</p>
               <p>This businesse of the Church, I haue the more particularly deliuered (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall report of the Writers of that time) in regard it laie so chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Temporall affaires of the State, and bewrayed so much of the face of that Age, with the constitution both of the Soueraignty, and the rest of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as it could not well bee omitted. Besides, the effects it wrought in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding raigne of this Prince, the vexation, charge; and burthen it layed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for manie yeares, is worthie of note, and shewes vs what spirit had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domination in that season of the World, and what Engines were vsed in this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation.</p>
               <p>Presently vpon the departure of this Great Prelate, the King sends ouer to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7690:44"/>
                  <hi>the King of France,</hi> Gillebert <hi>Bishop of London, and</hi> William <hi>Earle of</hi> Arundell, <hi>to intreat him,</hi> not onely to forbid the Archbishop his Kingdome, but to bee a meanes to the Pope, that his <note place="margin">The King sends Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssadors to the Pope.</note> cause might not bee fauoured by the Church, being so contumacious a rebell as he was against his Soueraigne Lord.</p>
               <p>The King of France notwithstanding this intreaty sends Frier <hi>Francis</hi> his Amoyner vnder hand to the Pope, to beseech him, as he tendred the honour of holy Church, and the ayde of the Kingdome of France, <hi>to support the cause of</hi> Thomas <hi>of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>against the Tyrant of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>sends likewise with all speed,</hi> Roger <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Yorke, <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Winchester, London, Chichester <hi>and</hi> Excester, Guido Rufus, Richard Iuechester, <hi>and</hi> Iohn <hi>of</hi> Oxford <hi>Clerkes:</hi> William <hi>Earle of</hi> Arundell, Hugh de Gundeuile, Bernard de Saint Walleric, <hi>and</hi> Henry Fitz Gerrard <hi>to informe the Pope of the whole cause, and preuent the Archbishoppes complaint. The multitude, and greatnesse of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners shewed the importance of the Ambassage, and the Kings earnest desire to haue his cause preuaile. They finde the Pope at the Citie of Sens, to whom,</hi> they shewed how peruers and disobedient the Archbishoppe had behaued himselfe to his Soueraigne Lord the King of <hi>England:</hi> how hee alone refused to obay his Lawes and Customes, which hee had sworne to doe: and that by his peeuish waywardnesse, the Church and Kingdome were like to bee disturbed, which otherwise would agree in the reformation thereof, as was fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: and therefore they besought him, as hee tendred the peace of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the loue of the King their Soueraigne, not to giue credit or grace, to a man of so turbulent, and dangerous a spirit.</p>
               <p>This Information (notwithstanding earnestly vrged) they found mooued not any disposition in the Pope to fauour the Kings cause, so that in the end, <hi>They besought him to send two Legats ouer into</hi> England, <hi>to examine the particulars of this businesse, and how it had beene carried: and in the meane time, to admit no other information of the cause, but referre it to their relation.</hi> The Pope refuses to send any Legat; the commissioners depart without any satisfaction. And with in foure dayes after, comes the Archbishop and prostrates himselfe at the Popes seete: deliuers him a coppie of those Lawes, which the King called his <hi>Grandfathers Lawes,</hi> which being openly read in the presence of all the Cardinals, Clergie, and many other people, <hi>the Pope condemned them for euer, and accursed those who obeyed or any way fauoured them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those Lawes among the Statutes of</hi> Clarendon, <hi>which the Archbishop so much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned (and most offended the Clergie) were (as by his owne letter to the Bishop of London appeares) these especially:</hi> That there should bee no appeale to the Apostolike Sea without the Kings leaue. That no Archbishoppe or Bishoppe should goe out of the Realme but by the Kings permission. That no Bishoppe excommunicate any, who held of the King, in Capite; or interdict any officiall of his without the Kings leaue, &amp;c. That Clergie men should bee drawne to secular iudgements. That Lay men (as the King and other should han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle causes of the Church, Tythes, and such like. <hi>And these were daungerous incrochments vpon their liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now the King, seeing his Ambassage to take no effect, and withall, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1166. Anno. Reg. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>contemned, presently makes his heauie displeasure, and the scorne hee tooke knowe by his seuere Edicts, both against the Pope, and the Archbishoppe, that they might see what edge his secular powre had in this case: ordayning,</hi> That if anie were found carrying Letter, or Mandat from the Pope, or Archbishoppe, contayning any <note place="margin">The Kings Edicts against the Pope and his agents.</note> interdiction of Christianity in <hi>England,</hi> should bee taken, and without delay executed as a Traytor, both to the King and Kingdome. That whatsoeuer Bishop, Priest, Monke, or Conuerser in anie Order, Clerke, or Layman should haue and retaine any such letters; should forfeit all their possessions, goods, and chattells to the King, and bee presently banished the Realme with their kinne. That no Clergie men, Monke or other should bee permitted to passe ouer Sea, or returne out of <hi>Normandie</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> without letters from the Iustices here, or from the King being there: vpon paine to bee taken as a Malefactor, and put in hold. That none should appeale to the Pope. That all Clerkes which had any reuenue in England should returne into the Realme within three monethes, vpon paine of forfeiting their estates to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7690:44"/>That <hi>Peter Pence</hi> should bee collected, and sequestred till the Kings pleasure were farther knowne.</p>
               <p>Besides, this hee banishes all that were found to bee any way of kinne to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, without exception of condition, sex, or yeres. And withall, takes occasion vpon the <hi>Scisme</hi> which was then in the Church to renounce Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and incline to the Emperors faction, which stood thus.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, <hi>Rouland</hi> a <hi>Geneuese,</hi> and a great enemy of the <note place="margin">The Election of two Popes.</note> Empire is by two and twenty Cardinalls elected Pope by the name of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, to which election foure Cardinals opposed, and made choyce of <hi>Octauian</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of <hi>Rome</hi> that would be called <hi>Victor</hi> the first. The Emperor <hi>Frederic Barbarossa</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons these two Popes to a Concel at <hi>Pauia,</hi> to vnderstand &amp; determin their right. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> makes the old answere, <hi>that the Pope could not be iudged by any man liuing,</hi> refuses to appeare before the Emperour, and withdrawes into Anagnia. <hi>Victor</hi> consents to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare there, or wheresoeuer the Emperour would appoint, so that, he was the man for that side. But all the other Princes of Christendom (except those of the Emperours fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) acknowledge <hi>Alexander</hi> for Pope, as elected by most voyces. And especially by the King of France who called him thither: and at Cocy vpon Loyr, he and the King of England receiued him with all honour and reuerence, in so much, as they are sayd to haue attended vpon his Stirrop, the one, on the right hand, the other on the left: after this, he calls a Councell at Tours, whether the Kings of England, Spaine and Hungarie send their Ambassadors, and there, are the constitutions of the Councell of Pauia, and the Emperours confirmation of <hi>Victor</hi> nullified, so that <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing his party day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increasing in Italy was shortly after receiued into Rome.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, the King of England finding him so auers in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, <hi>Falls off from him, renounces his Authority, turnes to the Emperours faction, seekes to strength himselfe with the Princes of</hi> Germanie, <hi>consents to match his daughter</hi> Maude <hi>to the Duke of</hi> Saxony, <hi>at the motion of</hi> Reginald <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Collen, <hi>sent ouer by the Emperour for that purpose, and intertaines a motion for another daughter to bee matched with the Emperours sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, by reason this contrary faction to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> grew to bee but feeble, all this working did the King no good, but exasperates the Pope, and sets him on the more to support the cause of the Archbishop, <hi>who, sollicites the Clergie of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> letter to the Clergie of England.</note> England <hi>threatnes, intreats, adiures them not to forsake their hold, nor giue way to the inuador of their liberties, which sought to confound the Priesthood and the Kingdome: and if they opposed not mainely at the first but suffered the least breach to bee made vpon them, they were vndone.</hi> Then excommunicates hee all the especiall Ministers of the King that adhered to the <hi>Teutonicque</hi> faction, or held intelligence with the Archbishop of Collen: As <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Oxford, Richard Iuechester, Richard de Lucie, Iosslin Balliol, Alan de Neuile,</hi> and with these all such as had entred vpon the goods of the Church of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which hee called the <hi>patrimony of the Crusifex, and the foode of the poore:</hi> and these were <hi>Ralph de Brocke, Hugh Saint Clare,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Fitz Barnard.</hi> Thus are both sides busied in this drie warre, wherein, though there were no sword, yet it gaue vexation ynough.</p>
               <p>And yet this was not all the worke that tooke vp the Kings time for during this dissention, the Welsh againe reuolt, and to supresse them he spent much labour, with <note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the Welch.</note> the losse of many great men, and was himselfe in that daunger, as had not <hi>Hubert Saint Clere</hi> receiued a wounde for him, by an Arrow aymed directly at his person, hee had there finished his part. In this expedition hee is sayd, to haue vsed extreame crueltie.</p>
               <p>After this, hee passes into Normandie to bee neere his businesse, which now lay all on that side. And first to entertaine the opinion of Pictie (though hee were falne out with the Pope) hee obtaines at an Assembly of his Bishops and Barons of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, <note place="margin">1166. Anno. Reg. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>two pence in the pound, of euery mans Lands and goods to beepayde that yeare</hi> 1166. <hi>and a penny of euery pound to be payde for foure yeares following,</hi> which was leuied for the reliefe of the Christians in the Holy warre, and sent vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7690:45"/>Then hee raises forces and takes in certaine Castles in the Countrey of <hi>Maine,</hi> and Marches of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> from diuers Lords and Barons that had disobayed him. And whilst he was busie abroade, <hi>Mathew</hi> sonne to the Earle of Flanders (who had married the Lady <hi>Marie Abbesse</hi> of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Stephen,</hi> &amp; had by her the Country of <hi>Bologne</hi>) attempted something on the Coast of England, either to try the affections of the people, or to make spoyle and booty, but without any effect at all, the King being to mighty for any such weake vndertaker.</p>
               <p>And to distend his powre yet wider, falls out this occasion: <hi>Conan</hi> Earle of Britaine dies, and leaues one onely daughter (which hee had by his wife <hi>Constance</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Scots</hi>) to succeed him in his State. The King of <hi>England</hi> being then in armes vpon the Marches of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> deales with the Guardians of the young Ladie to match her to his third sonne <hi>Geffry.</hi> The nobility of that Country being then of a rough, and haughty disposition (giuen to fewds, and perpetuall quarrelling one with another) were wrought vpon, and a side is wonne of such as could doe most in this businesse: which is effected to the great contentation of the King of England.</p>
               <p>This fell out to be in the 13 yeare of his raigne, wherein, as some write, died his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, a Lady of an high and actiue Spirit: illustrious by her birth, but more by her first match, and most by her sonne, whom she liued to see established in all these mighty States, in the glory of Greatnesse &amp; Peace: Fertile in issue, hauing now <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse.</note> had 4 sonnes and 3 daughters, linkes of loue and strength (oftentimes in priuate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) though seldome in Princes, and shee left him in the best time of his daies before any great tempest ouertooke him.</p>
               <p>Three yeares after this, hee imployes most in France, about the ordering and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the bounds of his Dominions from vsurpation, or incrochments of neighbour Lords (whom his greatnesse held all in awe) and they must haue no more then hee would: especially hee settles and reformes the State of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which was much out of order, and in muteny about the late Match: which being appeased, hee keepes a solemne Christmas at <hi>Nants,</hi> and Royally feasts the Nobilitie of the Countrey. <note place="margin">1169. Anno. Reg. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then returnes he into England, where, least Peace (by reason of his long and often absence) might afflict and corrupt his subiects, he lookes to that Diuine, and Almighty worke of Kings, the administration of Iustice, appoynting certaine commissioners as Syndicqs to examine the abuses and excesses committed by his Officers, and grieuously <note place="margin">Extortion and Bribety pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> punishes the Shriefes of the Land, for extortion and bribery.</p>
               <p>His Easter, he keepes at <hi>Windsor</hi> whither, repaires vnto him <hi>William</hi> King of Scots who lately succeeded <hi>Malcom</hi> his brother, and brings with him his younger brother <hi>Dauid,</hi> both to congratulate the King of <hi>Englands</hi> returne, and also continue his claime to those peeces in the North which hee pretended to bee vniustly detained from that Crowne. The King entertaines him, as hee had done his brother with faire words, and tells him, <hi>How it was not in his powre, to doe any thing therein, without the consent of the State in Parliament; which if hee would attend, there should bee that course taken, as hee hoped might giue him satisfaction.</hi> In expectation whereof this King came often into England, and once attended the King in an expedition into France, as his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or had done.</p>
               <p>But now all this while, the wrath of the Church continues, and the clowde hangs still ouer him, dayly threatning the great thunder-bolt. Although it seemes the Pope of himselfe, was not verie forward to proceede to that extremity but would gladly haue quieted the Archbishoppe otherwise; <hi>Who</hi> (hee sayd) <hi>had taken an ill time for this businesse, the King being mighty, and the Church in trouble:</hi> and therefore writes <note place="margin">The Pope writes to the Bishops of England.</note> he his letters to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Hereford, willing them to deale effectually with the King, and to admonish him to desist from intruding vpon the liberties of the Church, and to restore the Archbishop to his Sea and Dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Bishops wisely answere the Popes Letter, in substance thus:</hi> Wee haue (<hi>sayd they</hi>) done your <hi>Holinesse</hi> message, and as much as was decent for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie <note place="margin">The Bishops answere to the Popes Letter.</note> if a King, instantly vrged him to satisfie your desire, made by vs: and if hee had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7690:45"/>
erred from the way of truth and Iustice, that hee would not delay to returne thereunto: that hee would not inhibit such as were desirous to visit the Church of Rome, hinder Appeales, oppresso Churches and Churchmen, or suffer others so to doe: that hee would call home our Father the Archbishoppe, &amp;c. and persist in the workes of Pietie; that hee by whom Kings raigne might preserue vnto him his temporall Kingdome, and giue him an eternall in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and that vnlesse hee would yeelde to your Holy admonitions, you, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto indured, could in patience forbeare no longer. <hi>Besides we added this of our selues,</hi> how it was to bee feared, if hee amended not his errours, his Kingdome would not long stand, nor his prosper.</p>
               <p>The King receiued your admonitions with manie thankes, much Temperance and Modestie, and answeres to euerie point. First hee protested that in no sort hee auerted his minde from your <hi>Holinesse,</hi> nor euer purposed so to doe, but so long as you shewed him fatherly Grace, hee would loue you as a Father; reuerence, and cherish the Church as his Mother. And humbly obay your sacred Decrees, sauing his owne Dignity, and that of his Kingdome: and if of late hee hath not respected you with any reuerence, the cause was that, hauing with all his affection, and all his powre stood to you in your necessitie, hee was not answered worthily to his deserts vpon his recourse to you by his Ambassadours, but in euery petition had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse. And for hindring any which are willing to visit your <hi>Holinesse</hi> hee answeres hee will not, nor hath hitherto done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> for Appeales, <hi>by the ancient custome of the Kingdome,</hi> Hee chalenges that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and cumber to himselfe: that no Clergie man for any ciuill cause shall goe out of the Land, till hee hath tried, whether hee may obtaine his right by his Royall Authority, and Iustice at home; which if hee cannot, hee may (without any hinderance) when hee will make his Appeale. Wherein, if any way hee doth preiudice <hi>Your Honour</hi> hee offers, by the helpe of God to correct it, as it shall bee ordred by the Councell of the whole Church of his Kingdome. And for the Emperour, though hee knew him a Scismatique, hee neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood hee was excommunicate. But if hee bee by vs informed thereof, or hath entred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull league with him, or any other, hee promises likewise to redresse the same, by the sayd Ecclesiasticall Councell of his Kingdome. And for our Father, the Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury (hee sayth</hi>) that hee neuer expelled him out of his Kingdome, but as hee went out of his owne accord, so that, at his pleasure it was free for him to returne to his Church in peace: prouided, that his Maiestie might bee satisfied concerning those complaints of his, and haue him to obserue his Royall Dignity. And if it can bee proued, that any Church, or Churchman, hath beene opprest by the King or any of his, hee is ready to make full satisfaction, as shall bee thought fit by the whole Councell of the Church of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This (<hi>say they</hi>) wee haue receiued in answere from our Lord the King, and wish wee could haue had it fully according to your desire: but these things wee thought good to notifie to your <hi>Highnesse,</hi> that your <hi>Discretion</hi> may perceiue what is like to bee the conclusion of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. The King stands vpon the iustification of his owne cause, ready to obey the Councell and iudgement of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon wee thought good to beseech your Highnesse, that you would moderate, for a time, that zeale (which by the fire of the deuine Spirit, is worthily inkindled, to reuenge any iniury done to the Church of God) and forbeare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any sentence of interdiction, or that last iudgement of abscision, whereby inumerable Churches may bee miserably subuerted, and both the King and an infinite number of people with him, irreuocably (which God forbid) auerted from your obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they tell him,</hi> That better it were to haue a member bad, then cut off: absci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion brought desperation: a skilfull Chirurgion might recouer an infected part, and how it were filter to imploy meanes to heale the wound, then by cutting off a most noble part of the Church of God, to bring more disturbance to the same that hath to much alreadie. Though the King were stiffe, they ought not dispare of the grace of God, that a Kings stomacke was then to bee wonne, when hee had wonne, and might not blush to yeelde, when hee had ouercome: Patience, and Meekenesse, must pacifie him, &amp;c. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclusion, wee speake foolishly (<hi>say they</hi>) but yet withall Charitie: if it come to passe that the Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> loose both his goods; and liue besides in perpetuall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7690:46"/>
exile; and <hi>England</hi> which (God forbid) fall away from your obedience, were it not better to forbeare for a time, then with such zeale of seuerity to foster vp a party? what if persecution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seperate many of vs from you, yet will not there want knees to bow to <hi>Baall,</hi> and receiue the Pall of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at the hands of an Idoll, without choyce of religion, or Iustice: neither will there want suppliers of our <hi>Chayres</hi> that will obey him with all deuotion, and already, many deuoure these hopes; wishing that scandalls may come, and streight waies bee made crooked.</p>
               <p>Thus much out of their letters, which are the best peeces of History in the world, and shew vs more of the inside of affaires, then any relations else. And by this wee truely see what barres kept these two mighty powers back from their wills, and yet how lowde they threaten, and both a feard of each other.</p>
               <p>But the King of England stood safe ynough, and was like to haue his businesses runne in a strong and intire course, when by casting to make things safer, then fast: he layes open a way both to disioynt his owne power, and imbroyle his people with diuision, which was by the association of his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> in the gouernment, <hi>an act without example in this Kingdome,</hi> and strange that a Parliament, an assembly of the State, <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Henry</hi> crowned King</note> conuoked for the same businesse, would in so wise times, consent to communicate the Crowne, and make the Common-wealth a Monster with two heads. But it seemes the <note place="margin">1170. Anno. Reg. 16.</note> strong desire of the King was such, for the loue he bare his sonne, as he would not bee denied in this motion, nor hold it a sufficient Security, to haue twice before caused all the Kingdome to take an Oath of Fealty vnto him, &amp; to haue designed, vnlesse he were Crowned King, as he was, with all vsuall solemnities the 14 day of <hi>Iune</hi> 1170. by <hi>Roger</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, and had homage done vnto him that day by the King of <hi>Scots, Dauid</hi> his brother, and all the Nobility of England. But now with what reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this was done, wee are not particularly informed: whether there was an equall participation of rule, or onely but of Title: and that the Father, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Act, was to haue the especiall manage of the Gouernment, and the Sonne, though a King, yet a Sonne, with a limited powre. Howsoeuer, this young King shewed shortly after, <hi>That a Crowne was no State to bee made ouer in trust,</hi> and layd much griefe, and repentance, vpon his Fathers forwardnesse.</p>
               <p>What mooued the King with this precipitation (to be before hand with his Graue) may be deemed, the iealosie he had apprehended by his Mothers example, who <hi>for all the Oath of Fealtie sooften taken for her succession,</hi> was yet put by it, through the working of the Clergie, and now considering in what termes hee stood with them, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had wonne some few Bishops vnto him, was sure they loued him not, and what they might worke with the people, if himselfe should faile, made him ouer doe his worke.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> vnderstanding that his daughter was not Crowned with her husband (which by reason of her tender age was deferred) tooke it ill, and threatnes King <hi>Henry</hi> the Father with warre, if it were not presently done, which causes him to make more haste backe againe into <hi>Normandy</hi> (leauing the young King in <hi>England</hi>) to satisfie or preuent this quarreling Prince.</p>
               <p>And whilst he remained there, meanes was made that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (who had beene now sixe yeares in exile) was brought to haue conference with the King, by the mediation of the King of France, <hi>Theobald</hi> Earle of <hi>Bloys,</hi> and diuers great Bishops, which the King of <hi>England</hi> was the more willing to accept, in regard hee saw this breach with the Church might much preiudice his temporall businesses when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they should breake out: and how the Archbishop continually was working the Pope, and all the great Prelates of the Christian world against him: which, <hi>How much such a party as swayed the Empire of Soules might doe in a time of zeale, against a ruler of bodies,</hi> was to bee considered. And therefore discends he from the higth of his will to his necessity, and they meete at <hi>Montmiriall</hi> before the King of <hi>France,</hi> where the Archbishop kneeling at the feete of his Soueraigne Lord the King of <hi>England,</hi> sayd, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beckets</hi> submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the King.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee would commit the whole cause in controuersie to his Royall Order, Gods honour onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</hi>

                  <hi>The King (who had beene often vsed to that reseruation) grew into some choller, and sayd to the King of</hi> France <hi>and the rest:</hi> What soeuer displeaseth this man, hee would haue to be against Gods honour, and so by that shift, will challeng to himselfe all that belongs to mee: But because, you shall not thinke mee to goe about to resist Gods honour and him, in what shall bee <note place="margin">The Kings offer to <hi>Becket.</hi>
                  </note> fit, looke what the greatest and most Holy of all his Predecessors haue done to the meanest of mine, let him doe the same to mee and it shall suffice. <hi>Which answere being beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so reasonable, turn'd the opinion of all the company to the Kings cause, in so much as the King of</hi> France, <hi>sayd to the Archbishop,</hi> Will you bee greater then Saints? better than Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> what can you stand vpon? I see it is your fault, if your peace bee not made. <hi>The Archbishop replied to this effect:</hi> That as the authority of Kings had their beginning by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beckets</hi> reply:</note> Degrees, so had that of the Church, which being now by the prouidence of God, come to that Estate it was, they were not to follow the example of any, that had beene faint or yeelding in their places. The Church had risen, and increased out of many violent oppressions, and they were now to hold what it had gotten. Our Fathers (sayd hee) suffred all manner of afflictions, because they would not forsake the name of Christ, and shall I, to be reconciled to any mans fauour liuing, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing from his honour?</p>
               <p>This hauty reply of a subiect to so yeelding an offer of his Soueraigne, so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasted the hearers, as they held the maintenance of his cause, rather to proceed from obstinacy then zeale, and with that impression, the conference for that time, brake vp. But after this, were many other meetings and much debate about the businesse. And the King of <hi>France</hi> (at whose charge lay the Archbishop all this while) came to another conference with them, vpon the Confines of Normandie: <hi>Where, the King of</hi> England <hi>tooke the Archbishop apart, and had long speech with him; twice they alighted from their horses, twice remounted, and twice the King held the Archbishops bridell, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they part, prepared for an attonement, but not concluding any.</hi> In the end by media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The King and <hi>Becket</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> of the Archbishop of Rouen, the matter is quietly ended before the Earle of Bloys, at Amboys. And thereupon <hi>Henry</hi> the father, writes to <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne, being then in England, in this wise, <hi>Know yee, that</hi> Thomas <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>hath made peace with me (to my will) and therefore I charge you, that hee and all his, haue peace: and that you cause to bee restored vnto him, and to all such (as for him) went out of</hi> England, <hi>all their substances, in as full and honourable manner, as they held it, three monethes before their going, &amp;c.</hi> And thus by this letter we see, in which King, the command lay. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Becket</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes into England.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbishop returning into England (not as one who had sought his peace, but inforced it) with larger power to his resolution then before, <hi>Suspends by the Popes Bull, the Archbishop of</hi> Yorke <hi>from all Episcopall Office, for Crowning the young King within the Prouince of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>without his leaue, and against the Popes commandement: and without taking (according to the custome) the Cautionary Oath, for conseruation of the liberties of the Church.</hi> Hee brought also other letters <hi>to suspend</hi> in like manner, <hi>The Bishops of</hi> London, Salisbury, Oxford, Chester, Rochister, Saint Asaph, <hi>and</hi> Landaff, <hi>for doing seruice at the Coronation, and vphoulding the Kings cause against him.</hi> And by these Letters were they all to remaine suspended, till they had satisfied the Archbishop in so much, as he thought fit.</p>
               <p>Thus to returne home, shewed that hee had the better of the time, and came all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, which so terrified the Bishops that presently (hauing no other refuge) they repaire to the King in Normandie, and shew him this violent proceeding of the Archbishop, <hi>How since his returne hee was growne so imperious as there was no liuing vnder him.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King was so much mooued, as hee is sayd in extreame passion to haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these words. <hi>In what a miserable State am I, that cannot bee quiet, in mine owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for one onely Priest? is there no man will ridde mee of this trouble.</hi> Whereupon (they report) foure Knights, Sir <hi>Hugh Moruille,</hi> Sir <hi>William Tracy.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Brittaine,</hi> and Sir <hi>Raynold Fitz Vrs</hi> (then attending vpon the King, and gessing his desire by his words) depart presently into England, to bee the vnfortunate executioners of the same, but by some it seemes rather, these foure gentlemen were sent with Commission from the King to deale with the Archbishop in another manner. <hi>And first to wish him to take his Oath of Fealty to the young King: then to restore these Bishops to the execution of their

function: and thirdly, to beare himselfe with more moderation in his place,</hi> whereby the Church might haue comfort vpon his returne, and the Kingdome quietnesse.</p>
               <p>But they finding the Arch-bishop not answering their humor, but peremtory, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, without regarding their Masters message, grew into rage, &amp; first from threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">The murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Becket.</hi>
                  </note> force fell to commit it, and that in an execrable manner: putting on their armor (to make the matter more hideous) they entred into the Church, whither the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was with-drawn, the Monks at Diuine Seruice; and there calling him Traytor, and furiously reuiling him, gaue him many wounds, and at length strake out his braines, that with his bloud besprinkled the Altar. His behauiour in this act of death, his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to take it: his passionate committing the cause of the Church, with his soule to God, and his Saints: the place, the time, the manner, and all aggrauates the hatred, of the deed, and makes compassion, and opinion, to be on his side.</p>
               <p>The vnfortunate Gentlemen (hauing effected this great seruice, rifled the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops house; and after waighing the foulenesse of what they had committed, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether the King, though they had done him a great pleasure, would seeme so to acknowledge it) withdrew themselues into the North parts; and from thence pursued, <note place="margin">The Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers miserable ende.</note> fled into seuerall Countreys, where they all within foure yeares after (as is reported) died miserable Fugitiues.</p>
               <p>Soone ranne the rumor of this deed, with full mouth ouer all the Christian world, euery pen, that had passion, was presently set on worke.

               </p>
               <p>Theobald <hi>Earle of</hi> Bloys, <hi>a great and graue Prince (elder brother to King</hi> Stephen) <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Bloys</hi> informes likewise.</note> 
                  <hi>sends likewise his information to the Pope, and shewes him,</hi> how he was at the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making betweene the King of <hi>England</hi> and this blessed Martyr: and with what a cheerefull countenance, with what willingnesse the King confirmed the agreement, granting him power to vse his authority as it should please the Pope and him against those Bishops, which had contrary to the right, and dignity of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> presumed to intrude the new King into the Royallthrone. And this he would iustifie by his Oath, or howsoeuer: and in this peace (<hi>saith he</hi>) the man of God doubting nothing, puts his necke vnder the sword: this innocent lambe the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row vpon Saint <hi>Innocents</hi> day, suffered Martyrdome: the iust bloud was shed, where the shot of our saluation, the bloud of Christ is offered. <hi>And then:</hi> how Court dogges, the Kings familiars and domesticks, were his ministers to execute this horrible act, concluding with an exhortation likewise of reuenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> William <hi>Arch-bishop of</hi> Sens <hi>comes with a more maine outcry, as if he would wake the Pope, were he neuer so dead asleepe: and tels him,</hi> how he was appointed ouer <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Sens</hi> writes to the Pope.</note> Nations, and Kingdomes, to bind their Kings in fetters, and their Nobles with manacles of iron: that all power both in Heauen and Earth was giuen to his Apostleship: bids him looke how the Bore of the wood had rooted vp the Vineyard of the Lord of Saboath, &amp;c. and all, in that most powerfull phrase of holy writ. <hi>And after, hauing bitterly inueyed against the King, vses these words:</hi> It imports you, O most milde keeper of the walles of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to reuenge that which is past, and prouide for the future.

               <p>Such and so great was the vprore of the Church, raised vpon these motiues, as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency by Embassage to the Pope.</note> the King of <hi>England</hi> (then the greatest Prince of all the Christian world) imployed the most especiall men could be chosen in all his Dominions, <hi>for reputation, learning, and iudgement, to declare his innocencie to the Pope: to vowe and protest that he was so farre from willing such a deed to be done, as he was from doing it himselfe, and how grieuously hee</hi>

with them. Which, with the hard passage they had in going thither, by the many dangers and restraints they indured, and now the contempt they found there, did (as they signified to the King) much discourage them. Yet for all this were there those braue Spirits among them (as great Princes haue alwaies great Ministers) that neuer gaue ouer working to cleere their maisters honour, by Apologies, remonstrances, and all whatsoeuer wit could deuise: and delt so, as they kept off the great confounding blow of the highest Censure, though it were euery day threatned and expected. And hauing (by grauely vrging the mischiefes, might follow in the Church; if a King of so great a State, and stomacke, should bee driuen to take desperate courses) giuen some pawse, and allay to the first heare; they timed it out all that Spring, and a great part of the next Sommer; when, although they could giue the King no great security, yet they aduertise him of hope. But the sending of two Cardinals a <hi>Latere Gratianus</hi> and <hi>Viuianus</hi> downe into Normandie did exceedingly vexe him. For they were rough against him, and would haue interdicted him, and his Dominions: but being forewarned of their comming and intention, hee appeales to the presence of the Pope, and so put off that trouble. Returning out of <hi>Normandie</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> hee giues strict commandement, <hi>That no briefe carrier of what condition or order soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, without giuing good security for his behauieur to the King, and Kingdome, bee suffred to passe the Seas.</hi>

               <p>Notwithstanding all the vexation the Church put this King into, hee left nothing <note place="margin">The Conquest of Ireland.</note> vndone that concerned the aduancement of his affaires, but as if now the rather, to shew his powre and greatnesse, takes this time for an expedition into Ireland (hauing commanded a Nauie of foure hundred shippes to bee ready at <hi>Milford-Hauen</hi> for the transportation of Men, Victuals, and Armour) and sets soorth in the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, an vnseasonable time, both for those Seas, and the inuasion of a Countrey not well knowne. But the businesse (it seemes) was well prepared for him, hauing had an intention thereof, euer since the second yeare of his raigne, in which <hi>hee sent a solemne Ambassage to</hi> Pope Adrian the fourth, <hi>to craue leaue for the subdument of that Countrey, vnder pretence of reducing those rude people from their vicious fashions to the fayth and way of truth.</hi> Which the Pope willingly graunted, and returnes the Ambassadours, with an autenticall concession thereof in writing, to this effect, <hi>First shewing how laudable a thing it was, and how fitting the magnificence of so mighty a King to propagate his glorious name on Earth, and heape vp reward of eternall felicity in Heauen, by extending the bounds of the Church, reducing rude and vnlettered people from their vicious manners, to the veritte of the Christian faith, and ciuilitie.</hi> And <hi>then giues him powre to inuade the same, and to execute whatsoeuer should bee to the Honour of God, and good of the Countrey, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of</hi> Church-rights, <hi>and</hi> Peeter-pence (a penny of euery house yearely, which hee had promised by his Ambassadors) and so concluds with an exhortation <hi>to plant men of good and examplar life in the Clergie, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King at that time, hauing other occasions, left off the purpose of this, which comes now of late to bee againe imbraced by this meanes: <hi>Dermot Mac Marrgh</hi> one <note place="margin">

               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> (glad to finde a doore thus opened to his intention, that might yeeld passage of it selfe without being broken vp) intertaines this eiected King with promises of ayde: and though hee could not as then furnish him, being ingaged in other great affaires, he yet permits such of his subiects as would, to aduenture their fortunes with him.

               <p>His <hi>Christmasse</hi> he keepes at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he royally feasts all his Kings &amp; great men of the Countrey, the rest of his being there he imployes in fortifying and planting Garnisons where most need required: he makes <hi>Hugh Lacy</hi> Iustice of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> giues him the keeping of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and besides confirmed vnto him and his heires, by his Charter, the Countrey of <hi>Meth</hi> to hold the same in Fee, for the seruice of a hundreth Knights: he bestowes on <hi>Robert Fits Bernard</hi> the keeping of the Townes of <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Weisford</hi> (which he tooke from <hi>Fits Stephen</hi> the first inuador) with charge to build Castles in them: and to humble the Earle <hi>Strongbow,</hi> and leuell him with the rest of his subiects, he takes from him all his dependants, and makes them his.</p>
               <p>So was it but his winters worke to get a Kingdome, which though thus easily won it proued more difficult, and costly in the keeping, by reason the prosequution of a full establishment thereof was neither by him or his successors (hauing other diuertments) euer throughly accomplished.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Easter</hi> monday he sets out for <hi>England,</hi> where he makes no stay, but takes the young King along in his company, and passes ouer into <hi>Normandy</hi> to meete other two Legates (<hi>Theodinus</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi>) who were sent from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> (but in milder fashion then the last) to examine the murther of the late Arch-bishop <hi>Becket.</hi> Foure moneths were spent in debating the matter, and in the end, the King by his Oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon the Reliques of Saints, and the holy Euangelists, before the two Legates in the presence of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and all the Bishops, and Abbots of <hi>Normandy</hi> in the Citty of <hi>Auranches</hi> purged himselfe, of either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or consenting to the murther. Yet for that he doubted least they who committed <note place="margin">His purgation for <hi>Beckets</hi> murther.</note> the same might be moued thereunto by seeing him disturbed, and in passion: he tooke the same Oath; that in satisfaction thereof, he would faithfully performe these Articles following: <hi>First, neuer to forsake Pope</hi> Alexander, <hi>nor his Catholicke Successors, so long as they vsed him as a Catholicke King. Secondly, That Appeales should freely be made to the Pope, in causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> Prouided, that if any were suspected, to worke euill to him, or his Kingdome, they should then put in security before they departed. <hi>Thirdly, That he would (from Christmas next for three yeares to come) vndertake the Crosse, and the sommer fol lowing, in person go to</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>vnlesse he were stayed by the Pope, or his Successors, or imploied against the</hi> Sarasins <hi>in</hi> Spaine. <hi>Fourthly, That in the meane time, he should deliuer so much

money into the Templars hands as by their opinion would entertaine two hundreth souldiers in the Holy warre for one yeare. Fiftly, call home all such as had endured banishment for the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Sixtly. Restore his possessions. Seuenthly, and lastly, abolish all such customes as in his time had beene introduced to the preiudice of the Church.</hi> After himselfe had sworne, he caused <note place="margin">Both Kings sweare to these Articles.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> his sonne to sweare to all these Articles, except such as concerned his owne person. And for a more Memory in the Roman Church, he caused his Seale to be set vnto them, with that of the two Cardinals. So ended this tedious businesse, that made more noyse in the world, then any he had, and bowed him more: beeing his ill fortune, to grapple with a man of that free resolution as made his sufferings, his glory: had his ambition, beyond this world; set vp his rest, not to yeeld to a King; was onely ingaged to his cause, had opinion, and beliefe, to take his part: Which so much preuailed, as the King seeking to maister him, aduanced him; and now is he faine to kneele, and pray to his Shrine, whom he had disgraced, in his person, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had him aboue his will, whilest he liued, hath him now ouer his Faith, being dead. And yet 48. yeares after this, saith the <hi>French</hi> History, it was disputed among the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> whether he were damned or saued: And one <hi>Roger</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> maintained, he had iustly deserued death, for rebelling against his Soueraigne, the Minister of God.</p>
               <p>To make the better way to the ending of this businesse, and content the King of <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And to further the birth of this apprehension, fell out this occasion. The Father euer awake to aduance his greatnesse, takes a iourney in person into <hi>Auergnia,</hi> and so to <hi>Monferrato;</hi> and there purchases a match for the price of fiue thousand Markes, for his yongest sonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> with <hi>Alice</hi> the eldest daughter of <hi>Hubert,</hi> Earle of <hi>Mauriena</hi> (then, as it seemes) Lord of <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Sauoy,</hi> with condition to haue with her the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all those Countreys, containing many great Signories, Citties, and Castles, specified in <hi>Roger Houeden</hi> with all the circumstances, and couenants, very remarkeable, <note place="margin">

So vnto greatnesse (that easier increases then begins) is added more meanes, and euery way opens to this actiue, and powrefull King aduantages of State, <note place="margin">1173. Anno.

And being returned from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this Match in <hi>Piemont,</hi> there comes vnto him lying at <hi>Limoges, Raymond</hi> Earle of Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> (by whom was giuen the first affront he had in France) now to doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto him for the Earledome of <hi>Tholouse:</hi> and there became the man of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and of his sonne <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to hold <hi>Tholouse</hi> from them (by hereditary right) for seruice of comming vnto them vpon their sommons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning <note place="margin">The homage of <hi>Raymond.</hi> Earle of Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> for the Earld. of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse.</note> in their seruice fortie daies at his owne charge: and if they would intertaine him longer to allow him reasonable expenses.

               <p>About the same time also came the Earle <hi>Hubert</hi> to <hi>Limoges</hi> (to know what Land the King of <hi>England</hi> would assure his sonne <hi>Iohn</hi>) who resolued to giue vnto him the Castles of <hi>Chinon, Lodun</hi> and <hi>Mirabell.</hi> Where with King <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne grew much <note place="margin">

               <p>And though there were many other occasions, of this defection of the sonne, from

the Father; yet, that this for these Castles should first bee taken (may seeme to bee the worke of Gods especiall iudgement) being those peeces, which himselfe had taken from his owne brother <hi>Geffrey,</hi> contrary to his Oath, made vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as is before related: so (as if to tell iniustice, that it must bee duely repayed) the same Castles are made to bring mischiefe vpon him, and to giue a beginning to the fowlest discorde that could bee: wherein hee had not onely the Children of his owne bodie, but the Wife of his bedde to conspire, and practise against him.</p>
               <p>For, hereupon the sonne sodainely breaking away from the Father came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where, the King of <hi>France</hi> (who had no other meanes to preuent, the ouergrowing of a neighbour) but to deuide him; sommons and solicites, the Princes of <hi>France,</hi> and all the friends he could make to ayde King <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne against the father, and to take thir Oath, <hi>either to disposses him of his Estate, or bring him to their owne conditions.</hi> The young King likewise sweares vnto them, <hi>Neuer to haue peace with his father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consents, and all sweares to giue vnto</hi> Philip <hi>Earle of</hi> Flanders <hi>for his ayde a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds</hi> English <hi>by the yeare with the County of</hi> Kent, Douer, <hi>and</hi> Rochester Castles: <hi>To</hi> Mathew <hi>Earle of</hi> Bologne <hi>brother to the sayd Earle for his seruice</hi> Kerton Soak <hi>in</hi> Lindsey, <hi>the Earldome of</hi> Morton <hi>with the</hi> Honour of Heize: <hi>to</hi> Theobald <hi>Earle of</hi> Bloys <hi>two hundred pounds by yeare in</hi> Aniou: <hi>the Castle of</hi> Amboys <hi>with all the right hee pretended in</hi> Tureine &amp;c. and all these Donations with diuers other, he confirmed by his <hi>new Seale</hi> which, the King of <hi>France</hi> caused to be made.

               </p>
               <p>Besides they draw into their partie <hi>Richard,</hi> and <hi>Geffrey:</hi> whose youths (apt to bee wrought on, for increase of their allowance) are easily intised; and with them their mother inraged with iealosie, and disdaine for her husbands conceiued abuses of her bed. So that, this great King in the middest of his glory, about the twentith yeare of his raigne, comes sodainely forsaken of his owne people, and is driuen through distrust to hire, and intertaine strange forces; procuring twenty thousand <hi>Brabansons</hi> (which were certaine Mercinaries commonly called the Routs or Costerels) for the recouery and holding of his Estate.

               </p>
               <p>But how soeuer we haue seene the best of this Kings glorie, and though he had after this good successes, hee had neuer happinesse: labour hee did by all meanes to haue qualified the heat of his distempered sonne, by many mediations of peace: offring all conuenient allowances for his Estate, but all would not preuaile: his sword is drawne, and with him the King of <hi>France</hi> with all his forces enters vpon his territories on that side the Sea; on this the King of <hi>Scots</hi> seizes vpon <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and makes great spoyles.

               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> besieges <hi>Vernoul</hi> a place of great strength, and importance, which <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Beauchamp</hi> valiantly defended, and after a monthes siege, they of the towne (victualls fayling) obtained truce of the King of <hi>France</hi> and permission to send vnto their Soueraigne for succour, <hi>Which if it came not within three daies, they would render the Cittie, and in the meane time their Ostages.</hi> The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie day was the Eue of Saint <hi>Laurence.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> with King <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne, and with diuers great Lords and Bishops swore, if they rendred the Citie at the day appointed, their Ostages should bee redeiiuered, and no dammage done to the Citie.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7690:50"/>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Father with all the forces he could make came iust at the limitted day; disposes his Army to strike battaile with his enemies; but the King of <hi>France</hi> to auoyde the same, sends the Archbishoppe of <hi>Sens,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Bloys</hi> to mediate a parle, which was appointed the morrow: this day lost, lost <hi>Vernoul.</hi> For, to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Parle, the King of <hi>France</hi> neither comes, nor sends; but had entrance into the Towne (according to couenants) which contrary to his Oath, hee sackes, takes with him the Ostages, and spoyle thereof: remoues his Campe, and leaues the King of <hi>England</hi> disappointed; who that night, after hauing persued the flying Army with some spoyle, enters into <hi>Vernoul,</hi> and the morrow surprises <hi>Danuile</hi> a Castle of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with many prisoners. Thence he goes to <hi>Rouen,</hi> whence, hee sent his <hi>Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> into <hi>Brittaine</hi> against <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Fulgiers,</hi> who had possest themselues almost of the whole Country, but being not able to resist the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the field; they with all the great men in those parts, and that side of <hi>France</hi> recouered the Castle of <hi>Dole;</hi> where, they fortified and kept themselues, till King <hi>Henry</hi> the Father came in person besieged and tooke it: and with them, about foure score Lords, men of name and action. Whereupon all the rest of the Countrey yeelded themselues.</p>
               <p>This ouerthrow being of such import so terrified the aduersaries; as they nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a Peace, and a Parle is appointed betweene <hi>Gisors</hi> and <hi>Try</hi> wherein the King of <hi>England</hi> (though hee had the better of the day) condiscended to make offer to his sonne <hi>of halfe the reuenues of the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>with foure conuenient Castles therein;</hi> or if hee had rather remaine in Normandy, <hi>halfe the reuenues thereof, and all the reuenues of the Earledome of</hi> Aniou &amp;c.

               <p>But it was not in the purpose of the King of France, that the same should take effect: for such peruersnesse and indignitie was offred to King <hi>Henry</hi> in this Treaty, as <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Lecester</hi> is sayd to haue reproched him to his face, and offered to draw his sword vpon him, so that, they breake off in turbulent manner, and their troupes fell presently to bickering betweene <hi>Curteles,</hi> and <hi>Gisors,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> had the worse.</p>

               <p>This businesse ended, the Father and Sonne make their Progresses into all their Prouinces on that side to visit and reforme the disorders of Warre, and to settle their affaires there. <hi>Richard</hi> is sent into <hi>Aquitaine:</hi> and <hi>Geffrey</hi> into <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> vpon the same businesse, and there left with their Counsells to looke to their owne.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7690:52"/>
for detayning the reuenues which the Archbishop of Cologne had out of Saxonie; and refusing to come vnto tryall at the Imperiall Chamber, according to his faith, and promise made to the Emperour, so that hee was driuen to come (for succour with his Wife and Children) to his Father in Law, into England, where hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three yeares, and vpon the comming of the Archbishoppe of <hi>Cologne</hi> to visit the Sepulcher of <hi>Thomas</hi> of Canterburie, meanes was wrought to restore him to his Dutchie: and a motion is made of marriage for <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings sonne, with the daughter of the Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi> (notwithstanding the contract made with <hi>Alice</hi> daughter to the King of France long before) but this last intention was made frustrate, by the death of the Emperours daughter.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> sends his sonne <hi>Iohn</hi> to reside, in Ireland, to the end (that the Maiestie of a Court, and the number of attendants) which, the same would draw thither, might both a we, and ciuilise that Countrey: but hee being accompaned with many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, young as himselfe, who scorning, and deriding the Irish (in regard of their rude habits, and fashions) wrought an ill effect.

The Commissioners hauing found out, that <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of Durham had receiued of the Archbishop three hundred Markes of siluer to bee bestowed in those vses, demaund the same for the King. The Bishop replies, <hi>that hauing receiued it from the hands of the Archbishoppe hee had according to his will, distributed the same amongst the Leprous, Blinde, and Lame; in repayring Churches, Bridges, and Hospitalls: so that who would haue it, must gather it vp againe of them.</hi> Which answere so displeased the King, as (besides the seizing vpon the Castle of <hi>Dures'm</hi>) hee wrought this Bishop much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation.</p>
               <p>His meanes certaine (besides the reuenue of his Demesne, and the benefit of the Forests) were not then great in England; which caused him oftentimes in <note place="margin">The Vacancie of Lincoln held 18 yeares to the Kings vse.</note> his necessities to bee bould with the Church, and to hold their benifices vacant: as hee did the Bishopricke of Lincolne eighteene yeares.

And besides to saue his purse (in regard the continuall charge of Horse, and Armour was heauie vnto him) hee caused euerie mans Lands, and substance to bee rated for the furnishing thereof.

               <p>Great, and manifold were the expences of this mightie King, in respect of his entertainments, pensions, and rewards, hauing so wide an Estate and so many euer in his worke, both of his owne, and others who must alwaies be seed. And besides, oftentimes hee is faine to bribe the Popes Legates, in his businesse with the King of France, to haue them fauourable for his ends: to send many supplies, by their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for his owne reputation to the Holy warre.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 29. After a great Christmas kept at <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> with his sonnes <note place="margin">1183. Anno. Reg. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry, Richard</hi> and <hi>Geffrey,</hi> the Duke of Saxony with his Wife and Children, besides a great Nobility of all parts: The King willed King <hi>Henry</hi> his Sonne to take the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of his brother <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Greffrey</hi> Earle of Brittaine. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> refuses to doe it (but vpon perswasion) being afterwards content; his brother <note place="margin">Great festiuals oftentimes breake vp with great discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments.</note> refuses to take the same. Whereupon with great indignation <hi>Richard</hi> departs from his Fathers Court into <hi>Poictou:</hi> mans, and furnishes his Castles there. The King his brother followes by instigation of the Barons of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Aquitaine</hi> who were fallen from <hi>Richard,</hi> and adhered to the young King (as men that vnderstood what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of younger brothers Estates in such Dominions, where the elder brothers birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and powre, would carry all) and <hi>Greffrey</hi> Earle of Brittaine takes the King his brothers part, comes with forces to aide him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> sends for succour to his father, who with a powrefull Army (rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them to a peace, then to make warre) came downe into <hi>Poictou,</hi> where againe his three sonnes after the debatement of their grieuances swore to obey, and serue their Father, and to hold perpetuall peace among themselues. And for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry</hi> and his sonnes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> ratification of this Concord, they meete all at <hi>Mirabell,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne, desires, that the Barons of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Aquitane</hi> (whom he had sworne to defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his brother <hi>Richard</hi>) might be there at the concluding this peace, and to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for any former act committed. Which request is granted, and <hi>Geffrey</hi> Earle of <hi>Brittaine</hi> sent to bring the Barons thither. But the Barons (holding this peace, either not safe, or not profitable) so worke, as they winne the messenger to take their part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Father, and keepe him with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne notwithstanding, continues to mediate still for the Barons, and to get his Father, and brother <hi>Richard</hi> to receiue them into grace. And vndertaking to bring in both them, and his brother <hi>Geffrey;</hi> is permitted by the Father to go treat with them at <hi>Limoges,</hi> whither also, by another way, and with small company; it was agreed the Father should come, which he did; but his approach was met with arrowes so dangerously shot at his person, as the next man to him was slaine, and himselfe with his sonne <hi>Richard,</hi> forced to retire from the place. And yet afterwards desirous out of a fatherly affection to haue conference with his sonnes for the quiet ending of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse (vpon their assurance of his safety) he enters into the Citty: when againe from the Castle is short a barbed arrow, which had tooke him directly on the brest, had not his horse, by the sudden lifting up his head receiued it in the forehead. Which act his sonnes neuer sought to find out and punish, but still, vnderhand held amity with the Barons. At length, notwithstanding King <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne comes to the Father, and protests, that vnlesse the Barons would come and yeeld themselues at the Kings feete, he would vtterly renounce them. And after, hauing againe (vpon his Fathers promise of pardon and peace) dealt with them: and finding as he auowed their obstinacie, made shew to forsake their party, and returnes to his Father with great submission, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7690:53"/>
vp vnto him his horse and Armor in assurance thereof.</p>
               <p>But many dayes he spent not with him, when againe (either for the intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge he found his Father meant to prosecute against the Barons) whose protection hauing vndertaken, he held himselfe in his honour, engaged to preserue: or by the working of some mutinous ministers about him, whose element was not peace: he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of King <hi>Henry</hi> the son.</note> enters Oath and League with them. But therein finding his power short of his will, and desperate of all successe in his courses; he suddenly breakes out into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame passion, before his Father, fals prostrate at the Shrine of Saint <hi>Martiall,</hi> and <note place="margin">His vowe.</note> vowes presently to take vpon him the Crosse, and to giue ouer all worldly businesse beside.</p>
               <p>With which strange and sudden passion, the Father much moued, besought his son with teares to alter that rash resolution, and to tell him truly, whither indignation, or religion induced him thereunto. The Sonne protests, that it was meerely for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sinnes, committed against his person. And vnlesse his Father would now giue him leaue (without which he could not go) he would there instantly kill himselfe <note place="margin">His resolution.</note> in his presence. The Father (after hauing vsed all meanes to diswade him, and finding him still obstinate) sayd vnto him, <hi>Sonne, Gods will be done, and yours: for your furnishing I will take such order as shall befit your Estate.</hi>

               <p>The sonne (whilst the Fathers passion had made him tender) wrought thereupon, and besought him, that he would deale mercifully with those of the Castle of <hi>Limoges,</hi> the Barons of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and pardon them. To which, the Father in the end (though vnwillingly) yeelds, so that, they would put in their pledges for securing their fidelity, <note place="margin">His request for the Barons of <hi>Aquitaine.</hi>
                  </note> and the peace, which they seemed content to do. But vpon the deliuery, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of these pledges new ryots were committed by such as could not indure the peace (which is neuer faithfull, but where men are voluntarily pacified) and these young Princes againe take part with their Confederates, and are made the heads of rebellion, committing rapin, and sacrelidge to supply their necessities, &amp; feed their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. And in the end the young King hauing much strugled in vaine, through griefe, and vexation of spirit (which caused the distemprature of body) fell into a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">His death.</note> feuer with a fluxe, whereof, within few dayes he died. A Prince of excellent parts, who was first cast away by his Fathers indulgence, and after by his rigor; not suffering him to be what himselfe had made him, neither got he so much by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation as to haue a name <hi>in the Catalogue</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sorrow of the Father (although it be sayd to be great) hindred not his reuenge vpon the Barons of <hi>Aquitaine;</hi> whom he now most eagerly persecuted, seazed on their Castles, and rased to the ground that of <hi>Limoges.</hi>

                  <hi>Geffrey</hi> vpon his submission, is receiued into grace, and the yeare after died at <hi>Paris:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Earle <hi>Geffreys</hi> submission and death.</note> hauing (in a conflict) bene troden vnder horses feete, and miserably crushed: so that, halfe the male issue wherein this King was vnfortunate, he saw extinct before him, and that by deaths as violent; as were their disposition. The other two, who suruiued him, were no lesse miserable in their ends.</p>
               <p>Now the young King of <hi>France, Phillip</hi> the second (in whose fate it was, to do more then euer his father could effect, vpon the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the sonne) requires the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the Countrey of <hi>Vexin,</hi> which was giuen in dowre with his Sister <hi>Margaret,</hi> but the King of <hi>England</hi> (not apt to let go any thing of what he had in possession) was <note place="margin">1184. Anno. Reg. 30.</note> content to pay yearely to the Queene dowager 17050. pounds <hi>Aniouin.</hi> And the more to hold faire with this young King, whose spirit, he saw, grew great, and actiue, and with whom he was like to haue much to do, did homage vnto him, for all he held in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which he neuer did to the Father, being the first discent of Maiestie, he euer <note place="margin">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7690:53"/>
choyce a little before his death. The Earle followed by <hi>Odo</hi> Earle of <hi>Borgogne,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Champague, Hainalt, Namur</hi> Saint <hi>Pol</hi> and others, warres vpon the King of <note place="margin">The Earle of Flanders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the King of France to compound.</note> 
                  <hi>France,</hi> and commits great spoyles within his territories, so that hee was faine in the end to compound with him to his disaduantage. After this, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> meete betweene <hi>Gisors,</hi> and <hi>Tri;</hi> where the King of <hi>England</hi> sweares to deliuer <hi>Alise,</hi> vnto <hi>Richard</hi> his sonne. And the King of <hi>France</hi> her brother graunts her in dower, the Countrey of Velxin, which <hi>Margueret</hi> his other Sister had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But these tyes held them not long together, for the yong King of <hi>France</hi> so wrought with <hi>Richard,</hi> as hee drew him from his Fathers obedience, and they liued together in <note place="margin">1185. Anno. Reg. 31.</note> that amitie, as on bed and boord, is sayd, to haue serued them, both which so iniealosed the olde King, as he called home his sonne and before his Bishops and Nobility, caused him to sweare vpon the Euangelists, to obserue fealty vnto him, against all persons whatsoeuer, which hauing done; and ready to passe ouer into <hi>England,</hi> hee is informed of the great preparation made by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who gaue out that hee would spoyle, and ransacke both <hi>Normandie,</hi> and the rest of the Kings of <hi>Englands</hi> territories in <hi>France;</hi> vnlesse he would presently deliuer vp his Sister <hi>Alice</hi> vnto <hi>Richard,</hi> or render <hi>Gisors,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Velxin</hi> into his hands. Whereupon the King returnes backe, and comes againe to a parle betweene <hi>Gisors</hi> and <hi>Try.</hi> Where, the Archbishop of <hi>Tyre</hi> (sent from the East to call vp ayde, for the Holy warre) did with that powre of perswation so vrge his message, as it let out all the humour of priuate rancor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <note place="margin">The Kings of England and France ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and prepare for the holy war.</note> betweene these two great Kings, altred their whole Councells, their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their designes: turned them wholly to vndertake in person this laborious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and resolue to leaue their Kingdomes, their pleasures, and all the things of glorie they had at home, to prosecute the same, through all the distempratures of climes, and difficulties of passages, whereunto that voyage was obnoxious: so that now, no other thing was thought or talked on, but onely preparations, and furnishments for this businesse.</p>
               <p>And to distinguish their people, and followers (who all stroue which should bee most forward) it was ordred that they who followed the King of <hi>England,</hi> should weare a white Crosse: <hi>France</hi> a red: and <hi>Flaunders</hi> a greene. And for a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in the businesse, the King of <hi>England</hi> writes to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> a most comfortable and pious letter: in the end whereof he hath these words. <hi>Amongst other Princes I and my Sonne, reiecting the glory of this world, and dispising all the pleasures thereof in proper person, with all our strength, will, God willing visit you shortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to rayse money to defray this great enterprise, it was ordained by the two Kings, their Archbishops, Bishops Earles and others in <hi>France,</hi> that all whosoeuer as well Clerke as Lay (sauing such as went the voyage) should pay the tenth of all their reuenues of that yeare, and the tenth of all their Moueables and Chattles; as well in gold as filuer. And many excellent orders were made for restraynt of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both in apparell, and manners as was fitting for the vndertakers of so ciuile and deuout an action.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> hauing layde this imposition vpon all his Dominions in <hi>France,</hi> comes ouer, calls a Councell of his Bishops, Abbors, Earles, Barons, both <note place="margin">1186. Anno. Reg. 33.</note> of the Clergie, and Layty at <hi>Gayntington,</hi> and by their consents imposes the same taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon his Subiects of <hi>England. Sub Eleemosinae titulo vitium rapacitatis includens,</hi> sayth <hi>Walsingham,</hi> and presently sends foorth his Officers into euery Shire to collect the same according as it was done in <hi>France.</hi> But of euery Citie in <hi>England,</hi> he caused a choice to be made of the richest men: as in <hi>London</hi> of two hundred, in Yorke a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and so according to the proportion of the rest: and caused all these, at a certaine time and place to appeare before him; of whom he tooke the tenth of all their Moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, by the estimation of credible men which knew their Estates: such as refused hee imprisoned till they had payde it, of which example, and exaction, we must onely hold Pietie guilty, otherwise those times had not yeelded it.</p>
               <p>The King sends likewise <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> with other Commissioners, to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7690:54"/>
                  <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> to collect the tenthes in his Countrey, which he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <note place="margin">Prouision by king <hi>Henry</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> but offered to giue the King of <hi>England</hi> fiue thousand Markes of siluer for those tenthes, and the Castle which he claimed, but the King of <hi>England</hi> refused the same.</p>
               <p>Whilst these preparations were in hand, and the mony collecting, a quarrell arises betweene <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Raymond</hi> Earle of <hi>Tholouse</hi> vpon this occasion. <note place="margin">1187. Anno. Reg. 33.</note> The Earle of <hi>Tholouse</hi> by the perswasion of one <hi>Peter Suillar,</hi> had taken certaine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and vsed them hardly. The Earle of <hi>Poictou</hi> surprises this <hi>Peter,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisons him, and would not suffer the Earle of <hi>Tholouse</hi> to redeeme him, vpon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Whereupon, the Earle imprisons two Gentlemen seruants of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Robert,</hi> and <hi>Raph Poer,</hi> trauelling through his Countrey (as Pilgrimes) from S. <hi>Iames de Compostella,</hi> which Earle <hi>Richard</hi> tooke so ill, as he enters into the Earles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with an Army (prepared for a better act) wastes it with fire and sword, besieges <note place="margin">A meane qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell dashes and diuerts the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warre, and layes it vpon the selfe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> and takes his Castles about <hi>Tholouse.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> (vpon the lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the <hi>Tholousians</hi>) sends to the King of <hi>England</hi> to vnderstand, whether his son <hi>Richard</hi> did these things by his will and Councell. The King of <hi>England</hi> answers, <hi>That he neither willed, nor counselled him thereunto, and that his sonne sent him word (by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of</hi> Dublin) <hi>that he did nothing, but by the consent of the King of</hi> France. Who (not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this answer) enters presently into <hi>Bery</hi> with his Army, seases vpon the Countrey; takes in diuers Castles of the King of <hi>Englands,</hi> who makes himselfe ready to recouer the same. And thus that great intended enterprise, vndertaken with such feruor, became dasht, and ouerthrowne, at the very time, they appointed to haue set forward.</p>
               <p>All the meanes the Pope could vse by his Legates, nor all the perswasions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes might preuaile, to reconsile these two inraged Kings, though diuerse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruiewes <note place="margin">1188. Anno. Reg. 34.</note> were procured, diuerse ouertures propounded, yet none tooke effect; they euer depart more incensed then they met: in so much as at length, the King of <hi>France,</hi> in a rage, cut downe the great Elme (betweene <hi>Gisors</hi> and <hi>Try</hi>) vnder which, the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> were euer vsed to parle, and swore, <hi>There should be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> cuts downe the most eminent <hi>Elme</hi> of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parley.</note> 
                  <hi>no more meetings in that place.</hi> But yet after this, they were brought to another parle elsewhere, and therein the Popes Legate threatned to interdict the King of <hi>France,</hi> vnlesse he made peace with the King of <hi>England.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> told him, that he feared not his sentence, being grounded vpon no equity, and that it appertained not to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by sentence, or otherwise, to chastice the Kingdome, or King of <hi>France,</hi> vndertaking to reuenge the demerits, of the rebellious, that dishonored his Crowne; and flatly told the Cardinall, <hi>That he smelled of the Sterlings of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This enteruiew, wrought a worse effect then all the rest: for here the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (absolutely) refuses to render <hi>Alice</hi> to his sonne <hi>Richard,</hi> but offered to the King <note place="margin">Earle <hi>Richard</hi> (with the King of <hi>France</hi>) com bine against his father king <hi>Henry</hi> 2.</note> of <hi>France,</hi> to giue her to his sonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> with larger conditions, then should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the other: which so much alienated the heart of his sonne <hi>Richard,</hi> as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes wholly Liegeman to the King of <hi>France,</hi> did homage vnto him for <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and they both ioyne their forces against the father.</p>
               <p>And here now comes this mighty King of <hi>England</hi> (the greatest of all the Christian world in his time, or that the Kingdome euer saw) to fall quite asunder; forsaken both of his subiects, and himselfe, letting downe his heart, to yeeld to any conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: he who neuer saw feare (but in the backe of his enemies) leaues now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Mans,</hi> and flies away with seuen hundreth men (hauing promised the Citty, neuer to giue it ouer, in regard his Father was there buried, and himselfe borne) and afterward, comes to his last parle, with the King of <hi>France,</hi> betweene <hi>Turwin,</hi> and <hi>Arras:</hi> where at their first meeting (no man suspecting the wrath) a thunder-bolt, with so terrible a cracke lighted iust betweene them, as it parted their conference in a confused manner for that time.</p>
               <p>Within a while after, they came together againe, when suddenly began as fearefull <note place="margin">1189. Anno. Reg. 35.</note> a thunder as the former: which so amased the King of <hi>England</hi> (as he had falne off from his horse) had he not beene supported by those about him. And in this sort, beganne the Proem of that Treaty, wherein, the King of <hi>England</hi> yeelds to all whatsoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7690:54"/>
the King of <hi>France</hi> required, did him homage againe for all his dominions on that side (both kings hauing at the beginning of this warre, renounced their mutuall obligation in that kind) renders vp <hi>Alice</hi> for whom he had beene so much loden with scandall and turmoyle, vpon condition, she should be giuen in marriage to his sonne <hi>Richard</hi> at his returne from the holy warre; and in the meane time to remaine in the custody of any one of fiue whom <hi>Richard</hi> would nominate: grants that fealty be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him of all his Dominions, and pardons all his partakers. Besides coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <hi>to pay the King of</hi> France 20000 <hi>Markes of siluer for dammage done during these last warres. And that if he should not performe these Articles, his Barons should sweare to renounce him, and betake them to the part of the King of</hi> France, <hi>and Earle</hi> Richard. <hi>And for more caution, hee yeeldes to deliuer vp the Cities of</hi> Mans <hi>and</hi> Tureyn, <hi>with diuerse Castles into their Hands, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here was an end of this businesse, and within three daies after, of this kings life: whose heart, not made of that temper to bow, burst with the weight of a declining for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Some few howers before he died he saw a list of their names who conspired with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Earle <hi>Richard</hi> against him: and finding therein his sonne <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His death.</note> to be the first, fals into a grieuous passion, both cursing his sonnes, and the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe was borne: and in that distemprature departs this world, which so often himselfe had distempered; hauing reigned 39. yeares, 7. moneths, and 5. dayes.</p>
               <p>His sonne <hi>Richard</hi> approching the Corps, as it was carrying to be interred (adorned according to the manner of Kings with all royall ornaments open faced) the bloud <note place="margin">1189. Anno.

               <p>He had issue by his wife <hi>Elianor,</hi> foure sonnes, <hi>Henry, Richard, Geffrey</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> besides two other, <hi>William</hi> the eldest, and <hi>Phillip</hi> the youngest but <note place="margin">His Issue.</note> one, died young.

               <p>The first sonne <hi>William</hi> surnamed <hi>Longespee,</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (in right of <hi>Ela</hi> his wife; daughter and heire of <hi>William</hi> Earle of that County, sonne of Earle <hi>Patricke</hi>) had issue <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> &amp; <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Vlster.

Then procures he a power from the Pope, that whosoeuer himselfe pleased to dismisse from the iourney, and leaue at home, should bee free from taking the Crosse: and this likewise got him great Treasure which was leuied with much expedition by reason the king of <hi>France,</hi> in Nouember, after the Coronation sent the Earle of <hi>Perch,</hi> with other Commissioners to signifie to king <hi>Richard</hi> how in a generall Assembly at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had solemnly sworne vpon the Euangelists to bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at <hi>Tours,</hi> with all the Princes and people of his kingdome, who had vndertaken the Crosse, presently vpon Easter next following, thence to set forward for the Holy Land.

Which done, the King of <hi>England</hi> sends for Queene <hi>Elionor</hi> his mother, his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Winchester, Duresme, Norwich, Bath, Salisbury, Ely, Chester,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which came vnto him to <hi>Rouen:</hi> where hee commits the especiall charge of this Kingdome to <hi>William Longshamp</hi> Bishoppe of <hi>Ely,</hi> vnder the Title of Chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of <hi>England,</hi> and giues him one of his Seales and the Custodie of the Towre of <hi>London:</hi> and confers vpon <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Duresme</hi> the Iustice-ship of the North from <hi>Humber</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the keeping of <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, which after gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of dissention, to these two ambitious Prelates impatient of each others greatnesse, <hi>Hugh Bardolph, William Marshall, Geffrey Fitz Peter,</hi> and <hi>William Brewer</hi> are ioyned in commission with the Bishop of <hi>Ely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And least his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> (whose spirit hee well vnderstood) might in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> worke vpon the aduantage of his absence, hee first caused him to take an Oath <hi>not to come within this Kingdome for the space of three yeares next following.</hi> Which after, vpon better consideration, hee released, leauing him to his libertie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall respect.

               <p>For, this suspition of his Faith shewed him rather the waie to breake, then retaine it; whensoeuer occasion were offered: and the greater meanes hee had bestowed on him to make him content, did but arme him with greater powre for his designes.

               <p>Then the more to strengthen the reputation of his Viceroy the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> the King gets the Pope to make him his Legate of all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to the end his Gouernment might not bee disturbed through the emulation of another, hee confines the elect Archbishoppe of <hi>Yorke</hi> (his base brother, whose turbulency hee doubted) to remaine in <hi>Normandie</hi> till his returne, and takes his Oath to performe the same.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus ordered his affaires hee sends backe into <hi>England</hi> this Great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, furnished with as great and absolute a powre as hee could giue him, to prouide necessaries for his intended iourney.

               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> late king of <hi>Sicile</hi> who had married <hi>Ioane,</hi> sister to the King of <hi>England,</hi> was dead (which made the intertaynment of the <hi>English</hi> there, the worse) and <hi>Taneredi</hi> base sonne of <hi>Roger,</hi> grandfather to that <hi>William,</hi> was inuested in the kingdome, contrary to the will of the late King (dying without yssue) and the fidelitie of the people sworne to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> the lawfull daughter of the sayd <hi>Roger,</hi> married to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Almaine,</hi> sonne to the Emperour <hi>Frederic Barbarossa,</hi> by which occasion <hi>Tancredi</hi> was forced to vse all meanes to hold what hee had gotten by strong hand, and had much to doe against the Emperour and his sonne <hi>Henry.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> after great contention with him, to make the conditions of his sisters dowre the better, enters into league with <hi>Tancredi</hi> against all men to preserue his Estate, and gets in conclusion 20000 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gold for his Sisters dowre, and 20000 more, vpon a match to bee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Arthur</hi> Earle of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> sonne to <hi>Geffrey</hi> his next brother (who was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> if himselfe died without yssue) and the daughter of <hi>Tancredi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the opening of the Spring (both kings hauing beene reconciled, and new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles <note place="margin">The Kings reconciled.</note> of Peace and concord signed, and sworne) the King of <hi>France</hi> sets first forward to the Holy Land: but the king of <hi>England</hi> stayes in <hi>Sicile</hi> vntill Whitsontide after. And during his abode (which might therefore bee the longer) his Mother Queene <hi>Elionor</hi> (who in her youth had well knowne the trauaile of the East) came vnto him, <note place="margin">Berenguela fianced to King <hi>Richard.</hi>

And here our Histories say, hee married the Lady <hi>Berenguela,</hi> and caused her to bee Crowned Queene.</p>
               <p>These mischiefes suffred these two famous Isles of Christendome in the passage of these mighty Princes against Pagans, who peraduenture would haue as well vsed them for their goods, and treasure as these did, <hi>but Armies and powre know no inferior friends;</hi> it was their Fate so to lie in the way of great attempters, who, though in the cause of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would not sticke to doe any iniustice.</p>
               <p>From hence passes this famous king to the Holy Land, with the spoyles, and treasure of three noble rich Islands, <hi>England, Sicile,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> (besides what <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Guien</hi> could furnish him with all) and there consumes that huge collected masse, euen as violently as it was gotten, though to the exceeding great renowne of him, &amp; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

these mighty Princes, and drew them from the vtmost bounds of Europe, thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture themselues and consume their Estates.</p>
               <p>It was now foure score and eight yeares since <hi>Godsrey</hi> of <hi>Bologne,</hi> Prince of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> with his company recouered the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with the Countrey of <hi>Palestina,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Siria,</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> obtayned the Kingdome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and was Crowned with a Crowne of Thornes in example of our Sauiour, raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The State of Palestina.</note> one yeare, died, and left to succeed him his brother <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who gouerned eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, and left the Crowne to another of that name, <hi>Balwin de Burgo,</hi> who raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thirteene yeares, and left a daughter, and his Kingdome in dissention. <hi>Fulke</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> marries this daughter, and enioyes the Kingdome eleuen yeares, and left two young sonnes, <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and <hi>Almerique: Balwin</hi> raignes foure and twenty yeares, and after him his brother <hi>Almerique</hi> twelue, and leaues <hi>Baldwin</hi> his sonne to succeed him, who being sickly, and dispayring of yssue, made <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Nephew, sonne to the Marquesse of <hi>Monferrato</hi> and <hi>Sibilla</hi> his Sister, his successor: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the charge of him, with the administration of the Kingdome to <hi>Raymond</hi> Earle of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> whom <hi>Guy de Lusignan</hi> who had married <hi>Sibilla</hi> (the Widdow of <hi>Monferrato</hi>) put from that charge, and vsurped the Gouerment, and at length the Kingdome, not without suspition of poysoning the young King. <hi>Raymond</hi> making warre vpon him, <hi>Lusignan</hi> drawes in <hi>Sultan Saladin</hi> of Egipt to his ayde, who glad of that occasion, to augment his owne State destroyed them both, with their Kingdome, and wonne the Citie of <hi>Ptolomeide, Asoto, Berytho, Ascalon,</hi> and after one months siege, the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> foure score and eight yeares after it had beene conquered by <hi>Godfrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to recouer this confounded State, come these two Great Kings from a farre and a different clyme with an Army composed of seuerall Nations, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall humours, English, French, Italians and Germaines; against a mightie Prince of an vnited powre, within his owne ayre, neera at home, bred and made by the sword, inured to victories, acquainted with the fights, and forces of the Christians, and possessed almost of all the best peeces of that Countrey.</p>
               <p>And heere they sit downe before the City of <hi>Acon,</hi> defended by the powre of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Kings of England and France be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege Acon.</note> which had beene before besieged by the Christians the space of three yeares; and had cost the liues of many worthy Princes, and great personages, whose names are deliuered by our Writers, amongst whom I will remember these few of espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall note: <hi>Conradus</hi> Duke of <hi>Suenia,</hi> sonne of <hi>Frederic</hi> the Emperour (which <hi>Frederic</hi> was also drowned comming thither) with the Earles of <hi>Perch, Puntif,</hi> and olde <hi>Theobald</hi> Earle of <hi>Bloys,</hi> that famous <hi>Stickler</hi> betweene the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France: Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Sancerre:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Vandosme, Bertoldus</hi> a Duke of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Reoger</hi> and <hi>Ioselin</hi> Earles of <hi>Apulia &amp;c.</hi> And lastly <hi>Phillip</hi> Earle of <hi>Flaunders:</hi> and of our Nation <hi>Baldwin</hi> Archbishoppe of <hi>Canterbury.

               <p>At their entring into the Citie, the Ensignes of <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Austrich,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted on the walles, were with great scorne taken downe by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and those of the two Kings erected, which bred great rancour, and was afterward the occasion of much mischiefe to the king of <hi>England</hi> Besides, during this siege diuers stings, were ministred, or taken of displeasure, and malice betweene the two kings, apt to bee set on fire by the least touches of conceipt.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>France</hi> full of disdaine, for the reiection of his Sister, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the king of <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Berenguela;</hi> besides competition of honour (which their equality was subiect vnto) made any iot of the least disproportion thereof, a wounde without cure: And daylie occasions in so great hearts fell out to worke the same. The Article <hi>of equall deuiding their gaines in this voyage,</hi> concluded between them is questioned. The king of France, <hi>claimes halfe the Isle of Cyprus,</hi> the king of England,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7690:57"/>
                  <hi>halfe the Treasure and goods of the Earle of Flaunders,</hi> whereon the King of <hi>France</hi> had sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and therein, neither is satisfied.

               <p>But being recouered, the King of France had no longer will to stay there, where hee saw no more likelihood of honour or profit: and at home, hee knew was better good to be done with lesse danger, and the rather by the death of the Earle of Flaunders, whose state lay so neere, as it tooke vp part of his; whereof he had a purpose to abridge his successor, and therefore, craues leaue of the King of England (<hi>for without leaue of each other it was couenanted, neither of them should depart</hi>) to returne home, which King <hi>Richard</hi> was hardly wonne to grant, in respect he knew the daunger, it might worke him, in his absence, to let such an offended Lyon loose.</p>
               <p>But in the end through the earnest sollicitation of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) <note place="margin">The King of France de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the Holy warre.</note> confirmed by Oath not to doe anything offensiue to his Dominions in <hi>France,</hi> during his absence, he yeelds thereunto.

And it may be doubted whether the periurie of these two Kings, did not adde more to their sinne, then the action they vndertooke for the remission thereof could take away, for that <hi>a good worke impiously managed, meretts no more then an ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ten moneths the King of <hi>England</hi> stayes behind in these parts, consuming both his men and treasure without any great successe, though with much noble valor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding courage, finding euer great peruersuesse in the Earle of <hi>Borgogne,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his maisters instructions shewed no great desire to aduance the action, where another must carry the honour: but willing alwaies to returne home (pretending his want) drew backe when any businesse of importance was to bee done; and at length falls sicke, and dies at <hi>Acon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conrade,</hi> who was so much fauoured by the King of <hi>France,</hi> in his title for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">

His traine was said to be so great, and the pompe of attendants such, as where hee lay in any religious house but one night, 3 yeares reuenues would scarce suffice to recouer the charge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides being a stranger himselfe, and vsing only French men about him made his courses the more intollerable to the English: in so much, as at length the whole Clergie, and Nobility oppose against his proceedings, and the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> taking aduantage vpon these discontentments (to make himselfe more popular, and prepare the way to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vsurpation) ioynes with the state against this B. being the man that had euer crossed his courses hauing an especially eye vnto him, as the most dangerous person of the Kingdome, both in respect of the kings charge, and his owne saftie.</p>
               <p>And now there fell out a fit occasion to ruine the Chancellor by this meanes: <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>

And so this great Officer presuming to much in his place (hauing enuie so neere him, and a maister so sarre off) was throwne downe from his State, faine to resigne his Legan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Crosse at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to take vp that for the Holy warre: and priuily seeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to escape ouer Sea, was in the habit of a woman, with a webbe of Linnin cloth vnder his arme, taken vpon the shore at <hi>Douer,</hi> and most opprobriouslie made a spectacle to the people, and conducted with all derision to the Castle; whence after <note place="margin">He flies and is taken.</note> eight daies hee was by the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> released, and suffered to goe on his iourney; wherein, being the messenger of his owne misusage he had the aduantage of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and preuailed against them with the Pope, who tooke very tenderly the powre Legantine should be so vilified.</p>
               <p>The Earle <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and the other Iustices of the King, grant vnto the Citie of London <hi>their Common (or liberties</hi>) and the Citizens <hi>Swore fealtie to King</hi> Richard <hi>and his haire: and that if he died without issue, they would receiue the Earle</hi> Iohn <hi>for their Lord and King, and likewise swore fealty vnto him against all men, reseruing their faith to King</hi> Richard.</p>
               <p>In this forwardnesse was the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> for his brothers Crowne, whilst hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagaring <hi>Ascalon,</hi> and grapling with <hi>Saladin Sultan</hi> in the East.

                  </note> the Country of <hi>Vexin,</hi> contrarie to his Oath, hee takes the oportunity of an offer made by <hi>Saladin</hi> of a truce for three yeares, vpon condition <hi>that hee should restore</hi> Ascalon <hi>to the same State wherein hee found it before the siege:</hi> which hee did by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Templars, and the whole Armie. And presently leauing Wife, Sister, and people to come after him (as they could prouide) takes a shippe with some few followers, and returnes from this action, with as great precipitation as hee vndertooke it: hauing consumed therein all that mightie Treasure left him by his father, and all that otherwise hee could teare from his subiects, and others, by violent extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or cunning practises.</p>

                  <hi>Pardon vs Antiquitie, if we miscensure your actions which are euer (as those of men) according to the vogue, and sway of times, and haue onely their vpholding by the opinion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. wee deale with you but as posteritie will with vs (which euer thinkes it selfe the wiser) that will iudge likewise of our errors according to the cast of their imaginations.</hi> But for a King of <hi>England</hi> to returne in this fashion, cannot bee but a note of much inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had as pittifull an euent.

into <hi>Austrich,</hi> where Fame, that was a speedier post then himselfe, was before him. And comming to a Village nere to Viena, and reposing himselfe in a poore hosterie, was taken a sleepe, by meanes of his companion going forth to prouide necessaries for him, <note place="margin">King <hi>Richard</hi> taken prisoner</note> who as hee was changing money was knowne, taken, and brought before the Duke of <hi>Austrich,</hi> and vpon examination confessed where his maister was, of which prise the Duke was most ioyfull, in respect of his reuenge for the disgrace hee did him at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of <hi>Acon,</hi> and presently sends him to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, whom likewise he had offended for ayding <hi>Tancredi</hi> the base sonne of <hi>Roger</hi> in the vsurpation of the Crowne of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> against <hi>Constantia</hi> the lawfull daughter of the same <hi>Roger</hi> whom this Emperour had married.</p>
               <p>Newes hereof is presently sent by the Emperour to the King of <hi>France</hi> that he might likewise reioyce at this fortune, and hee tells him, <hi>That now the Enemy of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the disturber of the Kingdome of</hi> France, <hi>was fast in holde, and all the manner how.</hi> The State of <hi>England</hi> is likewise soone certified of this heauie disaster, and great meanes is made to redeeme their King out of captiuitie, who is sayd to haue borne his fortune with that magnanimitie, and so cleered himselfe of the scandalls layd on him for the death of <hi>Conrade</hi> the Emperours kinsman, &amp; other his actions in the East, in such sort, as he won the affection of the Emperor, so that he professed a great desire to restore him, and reconcile him to the King of <hi>France.</hi> But yet wee finde, <hi>That King</hi> Richard <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

               <p>And yet notwithstanding all this the King of <hi>France,</hi> combining with the Earle <hi>Iohn,</hi> preuailed so much with the Emperour as hee held him his prisoner; a whole yeare and sixe weekes through their offer of mighty summes they made vnto him. For he, and the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> fully accounted that he should haue beene held a perpetuall prisoner, and vpon that reckning the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> did his homage to the King of <hi>France</hi> for the Dutchy <note place="margin">Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> doth homage to the King of France for Normandy.</note> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and all the rest of those transmarine territories, and for <hi>England</hi> as it is sayd, and besides resignes vnto him <hi>Gisors,</hi> with the Country of <hi>Vexin,</hi> sweares to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his sister <hi>Alice,</hi> and to bee diuorsed from his other Wise the Daughter of the Earle of <hi>Glocester.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> couenants to giue him with his sister that part of <hi>Flanders</hi> which hee had taken from that Eareldome, and sweares to ayde him in the attayning both of <hi>England</hi> and whatsoeuer else the Lands of his brother.</p>
               <p>Then goes the Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> ouer into <hi>England</hi> carrying many strangers with him, and presently the Castles of <hi>Wallingford</hi> and <hi>Windsor</hi> are rendred vnto him: then comes hee to <hi>London</hi> and requires of the Archbishop of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and other the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and that fealty bee made vnto him, affirming his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dead, but they not giuing credit vnto him, and denying his desire; with rage and strong hand, hee fortifies his Castles, and in hostile manner inuades the Lands of his brother, finding many partakers to ioyne with him.</p>
               <p>The Queene mother, the Iustices of <hi>England,</hi> and all the faithfull seruants of the King, guard and defend the ports, against the inuasion of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> who in great numbers seeke to ayde the Earle <hi>Iohn,</hi> and also they labour the redemption of the King, whose ransome the Emperour rates at 100 thousand Marks, with the finding of fiftie Gallies ready furnished, and two hundred souldiers to attend his seruice in the holy warres for one yeare.</p>

And with these vexations (saith <hi>Houeden</hi>) all <hi>England</hi> from Sea to Sea was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to extreame pouerty, and yet it ended not heare: another torment is added to the confusion of the Subiects by the Iustices of the Forests, <hi>Hugh Neuile,</hi> chiefe Iustice, <hi>Hugh Wac,</hi> and <hi>Ernise de Neuile,</hi> who not onely execute those hidious lawes introduced by the <hi>Norman,</hi> but impose other of more tyranicall seuerity, as the memory thereof being odious, deserues to be vtterly forgotten, hauing afterwards by the hard labour of our noble ancestors, and the goodnes of more regular Princes, beene assuaged and now out of vse.</p>
               <p>Besides in the same yeare, this King <hi>imposes</hi> 5 <hi>shil. vpon euery Hide or Plough-land, (which contayned an hundred Acres</hi>) for the leuying whereof a most strict course was taken: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he required by his Vicegerent the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that <hi>the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land should finde three hundred Knights for one yeare to remaine in his seruice, or so much money, allowing for euery Knight, three shillings</hi> per diem. Against which <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyncoln</hi> opposes, and saies, that <hi>he would neuer yeeld to the Kings will in this, for the detriment it might be to the Church, and example to posterity, that should not complaine thereof, and say: our Fathers haue eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge,</hi> and turning to the Archbishop, <hi>wished him, that he would doe nothing whereof he might be a shamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Archbishop so husbanded the Kings businesse that in <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 7. he yeelded <note place="margin">Vudecies cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na millia Marc. Houed.</note> an accompt vnto him, that hee had Ieuied of the Kingdome within the space of two yeares eleuen hundred thousand Markes of siluer; which, considering that time is a most remarkeable summe. And now as the first act of this King was his violent violent proceeding in a businesse of Treasore with <hi>Stephen Thurstan Seneshall</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> so was it likewise the last, and the cause of his distruction: for, <hi>Widomare, Viscont</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moges,</hi> hauing found a great treasure of siluer, and gold in the ground, sends a good part thereof to the King, which he refuses, laying clayme to the whole: <hi>Widomare</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, the King layes fiege to his Castle where he imagined the treasure was hid; they of the Castle being but weake, offered to render the same, their liues members, and Armor saued, which the King would not yeeld vnto, but swore that hee would sack the Castle, and hang them all. Wherevpon desperatly they resolue to stand to their defence. King <hi>Richard</hi> with <hi>Marchard,</hi> generall of the <hi>Brabanzons</hi> going about the Castle to view what place was sitiest for an assault; <hi>Bertramd: Gurdun,</hi> from the walls shot a barbed arrow that hit the King in the arme, with such a deadly blow, as he was presently sent to his lodging: notwithstanding commands he his forces to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the assault without intermission which they did, and tooke the Castle putting to execution all the defendants except <hi>Bartram,</hi> who by the Kings command was reserued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:7690:60"/>But the arrow drawne out with great torture, left the head behinde, which being by a rude Chirurgion, after much mangling the flesh hardly cut out, brought the King to dispaire of life, and to dispose of his Estate, leauing to his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> three parts of his treasure, and the fourth to his seruants.</p>
               <p>Which done, he willed <hi>Bertram Gurdun</hi> to be brought vnto him, of whom he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what hurt he had done him, that prouoked him to doe this mischiefe, to whom <hi>Bertram</hi> replies: <hi>thou hast killed my father and my two brothers with thine owne hand, and now wouldest haue slaine mee, take what reuenge thou wilt. I willingly indure what soeuer torture thou canst in flict vpon mee, iu respect I haue slaine thee, who hast done such and so great mischiefe to the world.</hi> The King notwithstanding this rough and desperate answere, caused him to be let loose, and not onely forgaue him his death, but commanded 100 shillings <note place="margin">The death of King <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </note> sterling to be giuen vnto him, but <hi>Marchard</hi> after the King was dead caused him to be hanged and flayed.</p>
               <p>This was the end of this Lyon-like King, when he had raigned nine yeares, and 9 monthes, wherein hee exacted, and consumed more of this Kingdome, then all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors <note place="margin">1599.

Neuer had Prince more giuen with lesse a doe and lesse noyes then hee. The reason whereof, as I haue said, was his vndertaking the Holy warre, and the cause of Christ, with his suffring therein; &amp; that made the Clergie, which then might doe all, to deny him nothing: and the people, fed with the report of his miraculous valour, horrible incounters in his voyage abroade (and then some victories in <hi>France</hi>) were brought to beare more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer otherwise they wold haue don.</p>
               <p>Then had he such Ministers here to serue his turne as preferred his, before the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and did more for him in his absence, then euer peraduenture hee would, or could haue done for himselfe by being here present. For, both, to hold their places, and his good opinion, they deuise more shifts of rapine, then had euer bin practised before in this Kingdom, &amp; cared not so he were satisfied, what burthen they layd on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; which rent, &amp; torne by continuall exactions was made the more miserable, in that they came betrayed with the shew of <hi>Religion</hi> &amp; <hi>Law,</hi> the maine supporters of humane societie, ordayned to preserue the state of a people, &amp; not to confound it. But the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ouercharging the state in these times gaue occasion to the future, to prouide for themselues; Excesses euer procute alterations. And the Successors of this King were but little beholding vnto him; for out of his irregularitie, their boundlessnes came to bee broght within some limits. Yet what this King wold haue proued, had his daies allowed him other then this rough part of warre, we know not; but by the operation of a poore Hermits speech made vnto him, we are shewed that he was conuertible. For being by him vehemently vrged to be mindefull of the subuersion of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and to abstaine from things vnlawfull, therby, to auoyd the vengeance of God, he vpon an insuing sicknes (a sounder Counsailor then health) remembring this aduertisment, vowes a reformation of his life: and did afterward vpon his recouery, euery morning rise early to heare deuine seruice. For which <hi>Houeden</hi> hath this note: <hi>how glorious it is for a Prince to begin and end his actions in him, who is beginning without beginning, and iudges the ends of the Earth.</hi> Besides he growes hospitable to the poore, and made restitution of much Church ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that had beene taken and sold for his ransome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though this King had no issue, yet was hee told by a Priest in</hi> France <hi>that he had three euill</hi>

                  <hi>daughters, and admonished to put them away and bestow them abroad to auoyde the punishment of God.

                  <hi>IOHN</hi> hauing his brothers Army in the field, with all his Seruants and followers, intertaines them generally with promises of large rewards, <note place="margin">1199. Anno. Reg. 1.</note> and thereby had the aduantages <hi>of time, power, and opinion</hi> to help him on to his desires. <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being vpon busines in those parts, and the most potent minister he could wish, for so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a worke, he presently dispatches for <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>William</hi> Marshall Earle of <hi>Striguil, Geffery Fitz Peter,</hi> &amp;c. to prepare the people to receiue him for their King: who, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially dealing with those were most doubted would oppose him, and vndertaking for him that he should restore vnto them their rights, and gouerne the Kingdome, as hee ought, with moderation; wrought so as they were all content vpon those conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to sweare Fealte vnto him against all men. These vndertakers, likewise, send word to <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> (to hold him in, from any attempt) that hee should also haue full satisfaction for what hee claymed in <hi>England,</hi> vpon the returne of their new Maister. And so were all things made cleare on this fide. But on the other, the right of succession, which was in <hi>Arthur</hi> the Elder brothers Sonne, stirred affections of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, the nobility of <hi>Aniou, Maine</hi> and <hi>Tureine,</hi> maintayning the vsuall custome of inheritance, adhere to <hi>Arthur,</hi> whom his mother <hi>Constance</hi> puts vnder the Protection of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who receiues him and vndertakes the defence of his right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing his chiese ayme at the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> could haue no time of stay to close those ruptures that so violently brake out there, but hauing receiued the inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohns</hi> Coronation.</note> of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and performed all those rites, he speedily, with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elionor</hi> (who must haue her part in euery act of her Sonnes) passes ouer into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and by way of election receues the crowne vpon the Assention day, at the hands of <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbish. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who in his Oration, (as it is recorded in <hi>Mat. Pa.</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Assembly of the state shewed, <hi>that by all reason, deuine &amp; humaine, none ought to succeed in the Kingdome, but who should be for the worthynesse of his vertues, vniuersally chosen by the state, as was this man, &amp;c.</hi> which then, seemes especially vrged, in respect his title of succession would not carry it. And the Archbishop afterward, vpon this poynt, being questioned, confessed to his friends, <hi>that he foresaw this man would, (what bloud and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe soeuer it should cost) in the end obtayne the crowne. And therefore the safer way was, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent confusion, that the land should rather make him King, then he make himselfe; and that this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection would be some tye vpon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So came <hi>Iohn</hi> to the crowne of <hi>England</hi> which he gouerned with as great iniustice as he gat it, and imbraked the state, and himselfe, in those miserable incombrances, thorow his violences and oppression, as produced desperat effects, and made way to those great alterations in the gouernment which followed. The Queene Mother, a woman of an high and working spirit, was an especiall agent in this preferment of her Sonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> in respect of her owne greatnesse, knowing how shee should be more by him, then shee could be by her grand-childe <hi>Arthur,</hi> who had a mother would looke to become Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent here, and so ouer-shaddow her estate, which was a thing not to be indured. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Arthur</hi> was a child, borne and bred a stranger, and neuer shewed vnto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so that he had nothing but his right to draw a party, which could not be such (in regard of the daunger of the aduenture, things standing as they did) that could doe him any great good.

The King of <hi>France</hi> vnder pretence of working for <hi>Arthur</hi> gets for himselfe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discouered, <hi>Arthur</hi> with his mother <hi>Constance</hi> are brought (by the perswasion of their chiefe Minister <hi>William de la Roche</hi>) to commit themselues to the protection of King <hi>Iohn;</hi> of whom likewise conceiuing a sodaine iealofie (or else informed of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flie to <hi>Angiers.</hi>

After many attempts, and little gaine on either side, another treaty is media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Popes Legats, wherein King <hi>Iohn</hi> buyes his peace vpon these yeelding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: <hi>That</hi> Louys, <hi>eldest sonne to King</hi> Philip <hi>should marry his Ncece</hi> Blanch <hi>daughter of</hi> Alphonso <hi>King of Castile, and haue with her in Dowre, the Citie and County of</hi> Eureux, <hi>with sundry Castles in</hi> Normandy, <hi>and 30 thousand Markes of Siluer.

               <p>Then is he assailed on one side by the King of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> on the other by <note place="margin">He takes his Nephew <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> prisoner.</note> 
                  <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Barons in <hi>Aniou</hi> who lay siege to <hi>Mirabel,</hi> defended by <hi>Elionor</hi> the Queene mother, and were vpon the point of taking it; when King <hi>Iohn,</hi> with greater expedition and force then was expected, came and defeited the whole army of the assayliants, tooke prisoner the Earle <hi>Arthur, Hugh le Brun</hi> with the Barons of <hi>Poictou</hi> and aboue 200 Knights, and men of command, all which hee carried away bound in Carts, and dispersed into diuers Castles both of <hi>Normandie</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This victorie, which might seeme ynough to haue established his Estate, vndid him, for by the ill vsing thereof he lost himselfe and his reputation for euer. <hi>Arthur</hi> is shortly after murthered in prison, and the deed layde to his charge, which, with the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arthur</hi> mur. thered.</note> cruell execution of many his prisoners and Ostages so exasperates the Nobilitie of <hi>Brittaine, Aniou</hi> and <hi>Poictou</hi> as they all take Armes against him, and summoned he is to answere in the Court of Iustice of the King of <hi>France</hi> to whom they appeale, which, he, refusing is condemned both to loose the Dutchy of <hi>Normandie</hi> (which his Ancestors <note place="margin">1203. Anno. Reg. 5.</note> had held by the space of 300 yeares) and all his other Prouinces in <hi>France,</hi> whereof the next yeare after, either through his negligence being (as they write) giuen ouer to the pleasures of his yong wife, or by the reuolt of his owne Ministers (incensed likewise against him) he became wholy dispossessed.</p>
               <p>And in this disastrous Estate, he returnes into <hi>England,</hi> and charges the Earles and <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohn</hi> fines the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</note> Barons with the reproach of his losses in <hi>France</hi> and fines them to pay the seuenth part of all their goods for refusing him ayde.

               </p>
               <p>But all this treasure collected, amounted not to answere his wants, or the furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fresh supplies for the recouery of his losses (for which he vrges the same to bee raised) and therefore againe in lesse then the space of an yeare, another leauie (but by <note place="margin">1205. <hi>Anno.

A Parliament is conuoked at <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherein is granted two Markes and an halfe of euery Knights fee for militarie ayde, neither departed the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie from thence till they had likewise promised their part. No sooner is this money gathered but a way is opened, into that all-deuouring Gulph of <hi>France</hi> to issue it, through a reuolt begunne in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> by <hi>Guido</hi> (now husband to <hi>Constance,</hi> mother of <hi>Arthur</hi>) <hi>Sauari de Malleon,</hi> and <hi>Almeric Lusignian,</hi> consederats with many others; who receiuing not that satisfaction, expected from their new Maister, call in, their olde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to shew vs, that mens priuat interests, howsoeuer Honour and Iustice are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, onely sway their affections, in such actions as these.</p>
               <p>And ouer hastes King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by the powre he brought, and what he found there, won the strong Castle of <hi>Mont Alban,</hi> and after the Citie of <hi>Angiers;</hi> and was in a faire way to haue recouered more; but that the King of <hi>France,</hi> by the fortune of one day (wherein he ouerthrew and tooke prisoners the chiefe confedrats, <hi>Guido, Almeric,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueri</hi>) forced him to take truce for two yeares, and returne into <hi>Eng.</hi> for more supplies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:7690:62"/>And here another imposition is layde of the thirteenth part of all moueables, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1206. Anno.

               </p>
               <p>And hence grew the beginning of a miserable breach betweene a King and his people, being both, out of proportion, and disioynted in those iust Ligaments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">1207. Anno. Reg. 9.</note> and Obedience that should hold them together, the reducing whereof into due forme and order againe, cost more adoe, and more noble bloud then all the warres for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne had done since the Conquest. For this contention ceased not (though it often <note place="margin">

(though obserued truely of neither) was in the maturity of a iudiciall Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the first, freely ratifyed <hi>An. Reg.</hi> 27. which was aboue foure score yeares. And was the first ciuill dissention that euer we finde, since the establishing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Kingdom, betweene the King, and his Nobles of this nature. For the better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, we are to take a view of the face of those times, the better to iudge of the occasions giuen and taken of these turbulencies.</p>
               <p>It was this time, about 140. yeares since <hi>William</hi> the first had here planted the <hi>Noro man</hi> Nobility, whose yssue being now become meere English, were growne to bee of great numbers, of great meanes, and great spirits, euer exercised in the warres of France, where most of them were Commanders of Castles, or owners of other Estates, besides what they held in <hi>England:</hi> and being by this violent, and vnsuccesfull King shut out from action, and their meanes abroad, they practise to preserue what was left, and to make themselues as much as they could at home. Which, by their martiall freedome, and the priuiledges of the Kingdom (necessity now driuing them to looke into it) they more boldly presume to attempt, in regard they saw themselues, &amp; the Kingdome brought to be perpetually harassed at the Kings will, &amp; that violence and corruption hath no facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prescribe vpon them: wherin their cause was much better then their prosecution. For whilst they striue to recouer what they had lost, and the King to keepe what he by aduantage of time and sufference had gotten, many vniust and insolent courses are vsed on either side, which leaue their staine to posterity, &amp; make foule the memory of those times. We can excuse no part herein, all was ill; and out of order. A diseased Head first made a distempred body, which being not to be recouered a part, rendred the sicknesse so long and teadious as it was. Besides, the strange corruption of the season concurred, to adde to this mischiefe: An ambitious Clergy polluted with auarice, brought Piety in shew to be a presumptiue party herein, &amp; takes aduantages vpon the weakenesses they found, for which, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church heares ill to this day. And the occasion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition in this busines, began about the Election of a new Archb. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (<hi>Hubert</hi> being lately dead) which the Monkes of that Couent had made secretly in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reginald</hi> first chosen Atehb. by the Monks.</note> night, of one <hi>Reginald</hi> their Subprior; to preuent the King whom they wold not, should haue a hand in the busines, which they pretended to appertaine freely to themselues by their ancient priuiledeges. And this <hi>Riginald</hi> (thus elected) they instantly dispatch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome</hi> taking his Oath of secresie before hand. But the fulnesse of his ioy burst open that locke and out comes the report of his aduancement, vpon his landing in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which the Monkes hearing, and fearing what would follow, send to the king to craue leaue to Elect a fit man for that Sea. The King nominates vnto them <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> whom hee especially fauoured, and perswaded them (vpon great promises of their good) to preferre: the Kings desire is propounded to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and after much debate, is <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> aduanced to the Chayre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:7690:63"/>Wherein their last error (<hi>sayth</hi> Mat. Par.) was worse then their first, and began that discord which after proued an irreparable dammage to the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The King sends to <hi>Rome</hi> certaine of the Monkes of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (amongst whom was one <hi>Helias de Brandfield</hi> a most trusty seruant of his) with bountifull allowance, to obtaine the Popes confirmation of this Election. And about the same time like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise send the Bishops suffragans (of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) their complaynts to the Pope against the Monkes for presuming to make election without their assistance, as by Right and Custome they ought: allegation, examples of three Archbishops so elected. The Monkes, oppose this allegation, offering to bring proofe that they onely, by the speciall priuiledge of the Roman Bishops were accustomed to make this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Pope appoints a peremptorie day for deciding this Controuersie, wherein the first Election for being made in the night, out of due time, and without solemne ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is oppugned by the Kings procurators: the last was argued by some of the Monkes to be ill, by reason there was no cassation of the first, which iust or vniust ought to haue beene, before any other Election, could iuridically be made.</p>
               <p>The Pope seeing the procurators not to agree vpon one person, by the Councell of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Innotent.</hi> the ninth.</note> the Cardinalls adiudged both Elections voyde, and presents vnto them a third man, which was <hi>Stephan de Lancton</hi> a Cardinall of great spirit, and an Englishman borne, who had all the voyces of those Monkes which were there, through the perswasion of the Pope, alledging it was in their powre by his prerogatiue to make good this choyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephan Lancton</hi> thus elected, and after consecrated at Viterbo, the Pope dismisses <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stephan Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> elected Archbishop of Canterbury.</note> the Monkes and the rest of the Agents with letters to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> exhorting him, <hi>benignly to receiue this Archbishop Canonically elected, natiue of his Kingdome, learned in all the Sciences, a Doctor in Theologie, and, which exceeded his learning, of a good life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation: a man fit, both for his bodie, and his soule, &amp;c.</hi> withall he writes to the Prior, and Monkes, of Canterbury, charging them <hi>by the vertue of Holy obedience to receiue the Archbishop to their Pastor, and humbly to obay him in all Spirituall and Temporall matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These letters, with the notice of what was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> so inraged the King, as with all precipitation he sends <hi>Foulke de Cantlo,</hi> and <hi>Henry de Cornhill,</hi> two fierce knights, with armed men, to expell the Monkes of Canterbury, as Traytors, out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to seize vpon all they had, which presently was as violently executed as commanded, and away packe the Prior and all the Monkes into Flanders (except such as were sicke and not able to goe) and all their goods confiscated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here withall, he writes a sharpe letter to the Pope,</hi> accusing him of the wrong hee did in <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohn</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with this Election writes to the Pope.</note> cassing the election of <hi>Norwich</hi> whom he especiall fauoured, and aduancing <hi>Stephan Lanction,</hi> a man vnknowne vnto him, bred euer in the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> &amp; among his enemies; and, what was more, to his preiudice, and subuersion of the liberties appertayning to his Crowne, without his consent (giuen to the Monkes,) which should first haue beene required, hee had presumed rashly to prefer him; so that he much meruailed that the Pope, and the vniuersall court of <hi>Rome,</hi> would not call to minde how necessary his friendship had hitherto beene to that sea: and consider, that the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> yeelded the same greater profit, and commoditie, then all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes else on this side the <hi>Alpes. Besides,</hi> that he wouldstand to the liberties of his Crowne to the death: <hi>constantly affirming,</hi> that he could not be reuoked from the Election and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whom he knew euery way fit for the place. <hi>And in conclusion threatens,</hi> that if he be not righted in the Premises, hee would stop vp the passages of his people to <hi>Rome;</hi> and that if necessity required, he had in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and other his Dominions, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates of so sufficient learning, as they needed not goe to begge iustice, and iudgement of strangers. <hi>The Pope returnes answere to the Kings letter, and begins with these words,</hi> when about the business of the Church of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> we wrote vnto you, exhorting and requesting you humbly, earnestly, and benign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you againe wrote backe to vs (as I may say, by your leaue) in a fashion threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, reprouing, contumacious, aud stubbornely, and whilstwee tooke care, to giue you aboue your right, you regarde not to giue vs according to our right, respecting vs lesse then becomes you. And if your deuotion bee most necessary for vs, so is ours no lesse fit for you. When wee, in such a case haue honoured no Prince so much as you, you sticke not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7690:63"/>
to derogate from our honour, more then any Prince in such a case would haue done: pretending certaine friuolous occasions, wherein you alledge that you cannot consent to the Election of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sonne Maister <hi>Stephan Praesbiter</hi> by the title of Saint <hi>Chrysogonus</hi> Cardinall, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Monkes of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for that hee hath beene bred among your Enemies, and his person is altogether vnknowne vnto you. <hi>Then argues hee;</hi> that it was not to bee imputed vnto him for a fault, but was his glory to haue liued long at <hi>Paris,</hi> where hee so profited in study as hee deserued to bee Doctor, not onely in the liberall Sciences, but also in Theologie: and his life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his learning was thought fit to obtaine a Prebend in <hi>Paris.</hi> Wherefore hee held it a maruaile if a man of so great note natiue of <hi>England</hi> could be vnknowne vnto him, at least in fame, since (<hi>saith hee</hi>) you wrote thrice vnto him after hee was, by vs preferred to bee Cardinall: that though you had a desire to call him to your familiar attendance, yet you reioyced that hee was exalted to a higher Office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then excuses hee the point that the Kings consent was not required, in regard that they who should haue required the same affirmed how their letters neuer came to his hands, &amp;c.</hi> Although (<hi>saith hee</hi>) in elections celebrated at the Apostolique Sea, the consent of Princes is not to bee expected. Yet were two Monkes deputed to come to require your consent, who were stayed at <hi>Douer,</hi> so that they could not performe their message in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them: <hi>with other allegations to this effect, so that at length, saith hee,</hi> wee were disposed to doe what the Canonicall Sanctions ordayned to bee done, without declyning either to the right hand, or the left, that there might bee no delay or difficultie in right inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, least the Lords flocke should bee long without pastorall cure: and therefore reuoked it cannot bee. <hi>In conclusion hee vseth these words,</hi> As wee haue had care of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour beyond right, endeauour to giue vs ours according vnto right, that you may more plentifully deserue Gods grace, and ours, least if you doe otherwise you cast your selfe into those difficulties whence you cannot easily get out. Since hee, in the ende must ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to whom all knees bow in Heauen, Earth, and Hell; whose Vicegerencie heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (though vnworthie) Wee exercise.

               <p>Thus we see how these two mighty powers striue to make good each other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, and defend their interests with words. But when the Pope vnderstood how the King of <hi>England</hi> had proceeded against the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hee sends presently his Mandate to the Bishop of <hi>London, Ely</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> to deale with the <note place="margin">The Popes Mandat to the B B.</note> King, by way of exhortation, to reforme himselfe; and if they found him still contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious, they should interdict the whole Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> If that would not correct him, then himselfe would lay a seuerer hand vpon him, and withall charged the Bishops suffragans of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by vertue of their obedience to receiue for father the Archbishop <hi>Stephan,</hi> and to obay him withall respect. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops as they were inioyned, repaire to the King.

               </p>
               <p>The King interrupting the Bishops speech, breakes out into violent rage against the Pope, and the Cardinall, swearing by the teeth of God, <hi>That if they or any other</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohns</hi> answere to the B B.</note> 
                  <hi>should dare to put his Kingdome vnder interdiction, he would presently send all the Clergie of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to the Pope, and confiscat their goods.</hi> Besides, <hi>if any of</hi> Rome <hi>were found within any part of his Land, he would cause their eyes to bee put out their noses cut, and so sent home, that by these markes they might be knowne of other Nations.</hi> Charging moreouer the Bishop plresently <hi>to auoyde his presence, as they would auoyde their owne daunger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:7690:64"/>Of this their ill satisfaction the Bishop certifies the Pope; and shortly after the <note place="margin">1208. Anno. Reg. 11.</note> whole Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is interdicted: all Ecclesiasticall Sacraments cease, except Confession, Extreame Vnction, and Baptisme of Children: the dead are carried out, and put into the earth without Priest or prayer. The Bishops of <hi>London, Ely, Worcester, Bathe</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> secretly get out of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>To answere this violence with the like, the King sends presently his Shriefes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ministers to command all Prelates and their seruants forth-with to depart out of the Kingdome, deputes the Bishopricks, Abbayes and Priories into the hands of Lay men confiscating all theis reuenues, but the Prelates themselues get into Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and would not out, except expelled by force, which the officers would not doe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no Commission for the same, but they seize on all their goods to the Kings vse.</p>
               <p>Here the Monasticall Writers of that time (of whom onely we haue notice of these proceedings, aggrauate the rigorous course taken in this businesse) telling vs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, of what Order soeuer, found trauayling, were pulled from their horses, robb'd, and vily treated by the Kings seruants, and none to doe them Iustice. And how the seruants of a Shriefe bringing bound vnto the King a theese, who had robbed and killed a Priest) to know what should be done with him: the King said, <hi>loose him and let him goe, he hath killed our enemy.</hi> But howsoeuer this were, there were Excesses to many committed in a time so vntied as this was.</p>
               <p>The King to preuent the defection of his subiects which hee dayly doubted would <note place="margin">The King takes pledges of his Nobles for their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> follow vpon this his breach with the Church; sends with a militarie powre, to all the Potent men of the Kingdome, to require pledges for the assurance of their fidelitie; wherein many of them satisfied the Kings will, sending, some their sonnes, some their Nephewes, other the nearest of their kinne. <hi>William de Brause</hi> a Noble man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to deliuer his pledge, his wife preuenting her husbands answere, tells the Commissioners, <hi>that the King should haue none of her sonnes to keepe, that was so ill a keeper of his owne brothers sonne, Arthur:</hi> For which sodaine, and intemperat speech, the Baron sharply reprehending his wife before the Kings seruants, told them he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if he had offended, to satisfie the King, without any pledge, according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Court, or that of his Peeres, at any time, or place wheresoeuer.</p>
               <p>Vpon the report of this answere the King sends downe priuely to apprehend the <note place="margin">His crueltie she wed to the wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>W. Brause.</hi>
                  </note> Baron, but he hauing notice, or doubting what would follow fled with his Wife, and Children into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, afterward this afflicted Lady to recouer mercy of the King, is said, to haue sent Queene <hi>Isabel</hi> foure hundred kine, and a Bull, which yet could not mediate her pardon, or pacifie his wrath. But in the end she was there taken with her 2 sons (the husband escaping into <hi>France</hi>) and sent prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> where she with her innocent children were famished to death: so deerely payed she, for the offence of her rash tongue.</p>
               <p>The King displeased with the <hi>Londoners</hi> remoued his Eschequer to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and <note place="margin">The Esche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton.</note> with a great army marches towards <hi>Scotland</hi> to make warre vpon that King for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his enemies, and ayding them against him.

Returning backe, hee caused all inclosures within his forests to be layde open, a worke of great griefe to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, whom, though in nothing hee sought to satisfie, yet seeks he what he may to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten them in their obedience (whereof loue, and not rigour is the surest bond) and takes homage of all free Tenants, yea euen of Children of twelue yeares of age throughout the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Two yeares, to the great distraction of the State, the interdiction held, when the <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Pope, seeing no yeelding in the King, proceeds to the excommunication of his person, that extreame course of abscicion, which his Predicessor <hi>Alexander,</hi> better aduised, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to take, vpon suggestion of a more hainous act committed by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, vpon the person of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> and by this violence, thinking to quaile the heart of a most vnmaisterable King, put him into more desperate rage with the Clergie, who, notwithstanding the Popes mandate, durst not execute the same for many dayes after.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7690:64"/>
And first one <hi>Geffery,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Norwich,</hi> seruing in the Kings Exchequer confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the rest of his assistants, about this Sentence, affirmed, it was not safe for men beneficed to remaine in the obedience of an excommunicated King; and so without <note place="margin">The Archd. of Norw forsakes the kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; death.</note> leaue retired himselfe home; and was the first subiect of his maisters wrath. Who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sent Sir <hi>William Talbot</hi> with force to apprehend him, and lay him fast in fetters in a most straight prison, and afterward, vpon the kings commandement, he was put into a sheete of lead, wherein, with the waight, and want of victualls he soone perished.</p>
               <p>This excommunication of the King of <hi>England,</hi> was accompained the same yeare with that of the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> his Nephew, and are noted to be straines of an vniust na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>especially for being both done in cases of the Popes owne particular interrest, seeking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> excom.</note> 
                  <hi>a predomination, beyond the bounds allowed vnto piety, which was onely to deale with means soules, and not their Estates.</hi> For in the aduancement of this Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the third, the Pope had an especiall hand, opposing, for his owne ends the Election of <hi>Phillip</hi> Sonne to the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossa.</hi> And in the vancancy of the Empire had seised vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine peeces in Italy appertayning therevnto; which, <hi>Otho</hi> seeking to reuoke, procured vndeseruedly the Popes displeasure, who sent vnto him diuers messages wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to desist both from the prosecution of this recouery, as also from that which <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Sicile</hi> (who was vnder the tuition of the Apostolike Sea) had seised vpon.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, is said to haue answered the <hi>Popes</hi> Nuncij, in this manner: <hi>If the Pope vniustly desires to vsurp what apertaines to the Empire, let him absolue me from the Oath he caused me to take at my Coronation,</hi> Which was; <hi>that I should reuoke whatsoeuer rights were distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the same; and I will desist.</hi> But the Pope refusing the one, and the Emperour not yeelding vnto the other, the sentence of excommunication is pronounced against him. And all the states, as well of Germany as the rest of the Roman Empire, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued of their fealty vnto him. Thus were these two mighty Princes, the greatest of all the Christian world, leaft to the mercy of their subiects, who, though they were, by this meanes, all vntyed from obedience, yet many were not so from their affections, or other obligations that held them firme vnto their Souraignes. For there are so many ligaments in a state that tye it together, as it is a hard thing to dissolue them altogether, vnlesse it is by an vniuersall concurrency of causes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a generall alteration thereof. And it is seldome seene of what temper soeuer Kings are, but they finde an eminent party in the greatest defections of their people. As this King (the first of <hi>England,</hi> we finde put to this straight) had yet many noble mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of power, besides the chiefe officers of the kingdome (whom their places confirme) that stuck vnto him. Whose names are recorded in <hi>Mat. Par.</hi> and other writers.</p>
               <p>And the better to hold his reputation, and his people in action, hauing now no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment abrode, hee seekes to secure all other members of the Crowne of England, <note place="margin">1210. Anno. Reg. 12.</note> which were vnder his dominion. And hauing ransackt great treasure from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> makes an expedition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> vpon intelligence of some reuolt and disorder there. And at his first ariuall, all the great men which held the maritime Castles and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion countries came in, and did homage and fealty vnto him at <hi>Wublin:</hi> such as inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the remote partes, and fastnesses of the Kingdome kept them selues away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes <hi>Ireland</hi>
                  </note> to come. Here to reduce the country into better order, he ordaines the same to be gouerned by the lawes and customes of England, causes English money to be coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there, and to be of equall valew with that of this Kingdome, and currant alike in both. With many other orders, which had they beene with that care continued, as they were aduisedly begun, would (as wise men deeme) haue setled that Kingdome in an intire obedience, and saued all that great toyle, and expence which the neglect thereof cost this state, in succeeding ages. And now hauing deputed <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> Iusticiar there, after onely three moneths stay, hee returnes into England <note place="margin">The Clergy pay to the K. 100000. ster.</note> where presuming now vpon his new gathered strength, hee summons all the Prelates of the kingdome to appeare before him at London; of whom saith <hi>Mat. Par.</hi> he extorted for their redemption the summe of an hundred thousand pounds sterling.</p>
               <p>And the next yeare, being the twelfe of his raigne, with this treasure hee reduces
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7690:65"/>
                  <hi>Wales</hi> (that had rebelled) to his obedience, and takes eight and twentie children of <note place="margin">1211. Anno.

Returning thence exacts of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knight, that attended not his Army in that expedition two marks, and at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is pleased to receiue the Popes Agents, <hi>Pandolphus</hi> and <hi>Durandus</hi> (sent to make peace betweene the Kingdome and Priesthood) by whose exhortation, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the State of his Kingdome, hee consented that the Archbishop and the Monkes of Canterbury with all the exiled Bishops should in peace returne to their owne. But refusing to make satisfaction for their goods confiscated, the Agents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnsatisfied, to the greater preiudice of the King, whom now the Pope finding to be yeelding in any thing, falls to bee more imperious to constraine him to all whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he desired. And absolues all the Kings subiects of what condition soeuer from their obedience, strictly forbidding them, vnder paine of excommunication, his Board, <note place="margin">1212. Anno.

Who about this time takes occasion, vpon the breaking out of certaine poore Mountainers of <hi>Wales</hi> that make pillage vpon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to raise another Army to inuade the whole Countrey. And being at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> prepared for this action (before he would sit downe to dinner) caused those eight and twenty children, the innocent pledges of the <hi>Welsh,</hi> to be all hanged in his presence. But before hee had dyned, letters came that gaue him intelligence of a conspiracie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for his owne distruction; and that if he went forward in this warre he would be either slaine of his owne people, or betrayed to the enemy. Whereupon he returnes to <hi>London,</hi> againe requires, and hath pledges of those Nobles he suspected, and here <hi>Eustace de Vescy,</hi> and <hi>Robert Fitz Walter</hi> are accused of the conspiracie, who fled, the one into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the other into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the Pope, for the last, and greatest sentence that euer yet was giuen against <note place="margin">1213. Anno. Reg. 15.</note> any Soueraigne King of this Kingdome, pronounces his absolute deposition from the Royall gouernment thereof; and writes to the King of France, <hi>that as hee looked to haue remission of his sinnes hee should take the charge vpon him, and expell King</hi> Iohn <hi>out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of</hi> England, <hi>and possesse the same for him, and his heires for euer.</hi> To the same effect <note place="margin">The Pope giues the Kingdome of England to the King of France.</note> sends he likewise his letters to the Princes, and great men of other Nations, <hi>That they should ayde the King of</hi> France <hi>in the deiection of this contumacious King of</hi> England, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of the iniuries done to the Vniuersall Church; granting like remission of their sinnes as if they vndertocke the Holy warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with this Commission is the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other exiled Bishop of <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Pandolphus</hi> dispatched to the King of <hi>France</hi> for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. Which, notwithstanding, seemes rather done to terrefie King <hi>Iohn,</hi> then any way to aduance the King of France, whom the Pope desired not to make greater then he was, howsoeuer, to amuse the world, hee made shew to ingage him in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. For he gaue a secret charge to <hi>Pandolphus</hi> a part, that if <hi>vpon the preparation, and forces gathered by the King of</hi> France <hi>for this deiection, hee could worke the King of</hi> England <hi>to such conditions as hee should propound; absolution, and restorement should bee graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> vpon this act of the Pope, and the sollicitation of his Ministers, <note place="margin">The King of France assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his forces for England.</note> commaunds all the Princes and Nobilitie within his Dominions to assemble their forces with Horse, Armor, and all Munition to assist him in this businesse, and bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vnder paine of exheredation, at the Spring of the yeare; preparing, likewise a great Nauie for the transportation of these forces into <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Iohn,</hi> vpon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence hereof sends to all the Ports of his Kingdome commandement, to haue all shipping whatsoeuer possible to bee made readie with all expedition: summoning likewise <hi>all Earles, Barons, Knights, and who else could beare Armes of any condition, to bee ready at</hi> Douer, <hi>presently vpon Easter, furnished with horse, armour, and all military prouision to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon so great numbers resorted to <hi>Douer, Feuersham, Ipswich,</hi> and to other places suspected, as exceeded the meanes both of furnishment, and prouision to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine

               </p>
               <p>And thus prepared King <hi>Iohn</hi> expects his enemies, when secretly, two Knights, Templars, sent by <hi>Pandolphus</hi> so wrought with him, as notwithstanding all this great power of his, he discends to accept of a treatie with him. whereof <hi>Pandolphus</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently aduertised, and withdrawes himselfe out of the <hi>French</hi> Kings army, comes ouer, and so terrifies King <hi>Iohn</hi> with the mighty forces bent against him, and the eminent daunger wherein he stood, as he yeelds to any conditions whatsoeuer propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And not onely graunts restitution and satisfaction of what euer had beene taken from the Archbishop, and the Monks of Canterbury; the Bishops of <hi>London, Ely, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> (who were sled to the Archbishop.) But also laies downe his Crowne, <note place="margin">K. <hi>Iohn</hi> deliuers vp the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with his Crowne to <hi>Pandolphus.</hi>

               <p>Two daies (some wright sixe) it was before the Legat restored him his Crowne: at the receiuing whereof, he swore (and his Earles vndertaking for him) <hi>that hee and his successors should hold the Kingdome of England, and Lordship of Ireland from the Sea of</hi>

                  <hi>Rome, at the annuall tribute of a thousand Markes of siluer.</hi> And this, with his homage and fealty, he confirmed by his Charter at a house of the Templars neere Douer. The <note place="margin">The causes that moued K. <hi>Iohn</hi> to this act</note> especiall waights that moued King <hi>Iohn</hi> to this extreame lowenes, they of those times note to be. First, the consideration of his offences to God, hauing liued fiue yeares excommunicated, to the great deformity of his Kingdome. Secondly, the greatnesse of his enemy the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his adherence. Thirdly, the doubtfull fayth of his Nobilities, whom he had offended. Fourthly, for that the <hi>Assencion</hi> day was at hand; after which, one <hi>Peter,</hi> an Hermit and Southsayer had prohesied, he should be no more King of England. Which though mistaken in the manner, was fulfilled in a sort by this resignation, and a new condition of Estate. But the Southsayer with his Sonne, suffered shortly after the penalty of death, for his otherwise interpreted diuination.</p>
               <p>Now, notwithstanding this act and submission of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the interdiction of the <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> now all in readinesse for this great inuasion, inuasion, and full, with hope of victory, receiuing this sodaine, and vnexpected Message grew into great rage, and was, in regard of his honour, and infinite charge, hardly diuerted from this enterprise. Yet in the end, seeing his confederates, and followers quailed with this menace of the Church, extreamely discontent, he giuesit ouer.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, for his owne reputation and desire of reuenge hauing all these great forces on foote, &amp; his nauie ready in the mouth of Seine, would vndertake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The French K. sets vpon <hi>Flan.</hi>
                  </note> to giue satisfaction both to the aduenturers, and his owne people interressed in this action.

Ferrand,</hi> seeing this tempest come to light vpon him, sends for ayd to king <hi>Iohn;</hi> who glad, hauing es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped at home the occasion of a defensiue War, to enter into an offensiue abroad, both to imploy this great collected Nauie of his, and also put his people in action, whose dismission, without some satsfaction, he knew would breed no safe humor; dispatches fiue hundred sayle, with seauen hundred knights into <hi>Flanders,</hi> vnder the conduct of his base brother <hi>William Long-sword</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisbury, Reginald</hi> Earle of <hi>Bologn,</hi> whom
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7690:66"/>
he had lately intertayned with a pension, being for some demerit driuen out of <hi>France.</hi> And these ariuing at the Port of <hi>Dam,</hi> where they found the <hi>French</hi> Nauie vnorderly dispersed, and without defence (their forces going out to inuade the Country) set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vtterly defeited the same, and afterward ioyning their powre with that of <hi>Ferrand,</hi> draue the King of <hi>France</hi> home with great dishonour, and exceeding losse.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iohn,</hi> raised with this victorie, and his peace with the Church, sets vpon great designes, taking oportunitie of this disaster of the King of <hi>France,</hi> whom, in reuenge of his iniurie, and hope of recouering his transmarine Dominions, he plots to assaile on all sides: stirring vp his Nephew <hi>Otho</hi> to ayde the Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for an Inuasion on the East part, whilst himselfe withall his powre should enter vpon the West. For execution whereof, first hee sends supplies of treasure to his Chieftaines in <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> then assembles a great Army at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> wherewith, hee resolues to passe the Seas.</p>
               <p>But his designe contrarie to his desire and haste, came to be delayed by the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing <note place="margin">The Nobility refuse to ayde King <hi>Iohn.</hi>

Yet afterward, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand some more particulars of the madnes of this King of <hi>England,</hi> he called for <hi>Robert</hi> the Clearke, and had priuat conference with him apart about many particulars which hee himselfe reuealed to many in the hearing of <hi>Mathew</hi> the monke of Saint <hi>Albons,</hi> who wrot and declared these things, discribing the person of this <hi>Robert,</hi> to be of a low stature, blacke, one arme shorter then another, two fingers vnnaturally growing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of visage like a <hi>Iew, &amp;c.</hi> which relation we are not vtterly to contemne, proceeding from an Author of that grauity and credit, and liuing so neere those times, though to vs that are so farre off both in fashion and faith, it may seeme improbable in some part; yet if we consider whereto the desperat violence of this King, (who had made vtter wracke of conscience, and all humane respect) might carry him, seeing himselfe in that Estate he was, we may not thinke it voyd of likelihood, to haue had this dealing with an heathen king (who, in that time, was formidable to all Christendome, and had on foot the mightiest army that euer the <hi>Moores</hi> had in <hi>Spaine</hi>) which might either be to hold amity with him, or intertayne him otherwise for his owne ends. Though for the point of offring to forgoe the Christian fayth, we may in charity forbeare to make it a part of ours. Although this relator giues vs a note (amongst other which hee supprest) that poynted at the irreligion of this King who at the opening of a fat Stag, iestingly said: see how prosperously this beast hath liued, and yet neuer heard Masse.

               <p>But this Embassage, either neglected by <hi>Miramumalim,</hi> or disappointed by the ouer throw of his great army with the death of his Sonne, which shortly after followed) King <hi>Iohn</hi> sets vpon another course, assayles Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> (prone to be wrought by guifts to doe any thing) with great summes of money, and a reassurance of his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary subiection, which shortly after he confirmes by a new oath, and a new Charter

For which the King vpon account already, had payd twenty seauen thousand Markes, and thirteene thousand more were vndertaken by Suerties to be answered by a certaine daie.</p>
               <p>And herevpon is the interdiction released, hauing continued sixe yeares three moneths and fourteene dayes, to the inestimable losse of the Church, and Churchmen, <note place="margin">The interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction released.</note> whereof an innumerable multitude of all orders now repayre to the Legat for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of damages receiued by the Kings ministers during this interdiction.

               <p>Vpon these misfortunes, and fearing the outrage of a necessitous and distempred King, the Barons of England assemble themselues at S. <hi>Edmondsbury,</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the late produced Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and swore vpon the high Altar that if King <hi>Iohn</hi> refused to confirme and restore vnto them those liberties (the rights of the Kingdome) they would make war vpon him vntill he had satisfied them therein: and further agreed that after Christmas next they would petition him for the same, and in the meane time prouide themselues of horse and furniture, to be ready if the King should start from his Oath made at <hi>Winchester</hi> at the time of his absolution for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of these liberties, and compell him to satisfie their demand.

               <p>The Barons vpon this answere, being as hasty as hee was auers, resolue to seize on <note place="margin">The Lords seize on the Kings Castles.</note> his Castles, and presently march towards <hi>Northampton,</hi> which they besiege, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Robert Fitz Walter</hi> their General, intituling him the <hi>Mareschall of the Army of God, and holy Church.</hi> And after they assaile the Castle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> where <hi>William de Beauchamp</hi> rendring his charge, receiues them: and the Londoners send thither priuy message to ioyne with them, and deliuer vp the Citie to be garded by their direction.</p>

Wherein none should bee placed but such as were faithfull, and would obserue their Oath, &amp;c.

But by such Counsailors is he confirmed in his refractory humor.

               <p>Resolued he is (giuen ouer to confusion, and reuenge) to dissolue this tye, and priuily withdrawes himselfe into the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> from whence hee sends his Agents to <hi>Rome</hi>

               <p>But this must either argue that their end was onely to haue (but what they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned) <note place="margin">The error of the Barons.</note> the restitution of the Liberties of the Kingdome (which though thus recouered by violence they seemed desirous to hold with peace) or els their negligence; which may be thought strange in those wakefull and actiue times, to be such, as to leaue a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased King alone to his owne working, especially remoued to a place, where the sea being open vnto him, his outsendings might bee without view or noting: vnlesse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they presumed of his little credit abroad, or their owne powre at home.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But such was the insolence of the <hi>French,</hi> making spoyle and prey of whatsoeuer they could fasten on (and now inuested by <hi>Louys,</hi> contrarie to his Oath, in all those places of importance they had recouered) as made many of the English to relinquish <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont Melun at his death.</note> their sworne fidelitie, and forsake his part.

               <p>And first <hi>William</hi> Earle of Salisbury, mooued in bloud to succour his Nephew, tooke <note place="margin">Diuers Lords reuolt from <hi>Louys.</hi>

               <p>On the other part King <hi>Henry</hi> takes his Oath, and for him, the Legat, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, to restore vnto the Barons of this Realme, and other his Subiects, all their rights and heritages, with those liberties for which the discorde beganne betweene the late King, and his people.

               <p>And in this recouery, the industrie of <hi>Guallo</hi> the Legate wrought much, though what he did therein was for his owne ends, &amp; the pretended interest of the Pope, whose ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1219.

But the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by his spirituall power, and the rest of the nobility, more carefull to preserue the peace of the Kingdome, stood to the King, and would not suffer any proceeding in this kind, so as the Lords effected nothing at that time, but were constrained to come in, and submit <note place="margin">Resumptions.</note> themselues.

               <p>The Earle answeres that he would neither doe the one or the other: without the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Peeres; and so departes to his lodging, leauing the king much displeased with this answere.

to <hi>Hugh de Burgh,</hi> and not to himself, besides they require restitution to be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, of the liberties of the Forrests lately cancelled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> otherwise they <note place="margin">1226.

               <p>The King, to anoyd this daunger, appoints them &amp; day to come to an assembly at Northampton, where a concord is concluded: and to satisfie his brother, (besides the rendring vnto him his Castle) he grauntes him all that his mother had in dowre, and <note place="margin">s.

Which so strongly wrought in that credelous world as sixty thousand sufficient men, are reported to haue vndertaken that voyage: of whom <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of Winchester, and <hi>William</hi> Bishop of Excester are the leaders.</p>
               <p>The King is sollicited by <hi>Hugh le Brun</hi> Earle of March, who had marryed his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by other great men of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to come ouer into <hi>France</hi> to recouer his right, vpon the great alterations happening in those parts by this occassion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Louys</hi> the eight (who succeeded <hi>Phillip</hi> the second,) being lately dead after his great siege of <hi>Auignon,</hi> and his warres made against the Heretickes Albegeois in Prouince, leaues the Kingdome to his Sonne <hi>Louys</hi> of the age of twelue yeares, in whose minority his Mother <hi>Blanch,</hi> taking vpon her the regency, so discontented the Princes of the <note place="margin">French Hist.</note> bloud, as they oppose themselues against her, holding it both dishonorable and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that a woman and a stranger by the Councell of <hi>Spaniards</hi> (whom she aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aboue the Naturalls of the Kingdome) should gouerne all according to her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and therefore enter league against her. The chiefe of whom were <hi>Phillip</hi> Earle of <hi>Bologne,</hi> vncle, by the Father, to the King: <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Champaigne, Peter de Dreux</hi> Duke of <hi>Britagne,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Dreux</hi> his brother, and with these <hi>Hugh</hi> the Earle of <hi>March</hi> takes part, in regard the Queen Regent had erected the Country of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou</hi> to a Conty, and made Earle there of <hi>Alphonso</hi> her Sonne, brother to the young king, whereby finding himselfe inclosed within that County, he refuses to acknowledge <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> for Lord: instigated therevnto by his wife, a Queene <hi>Dowager</hi> of England, who could not comport a superior so neere her doore, in so much as they likewise draw in the Earle of <hi>Lusignan,</hi> brother to the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> who also, presuming vpon the greatnesse of his house discended of kings, was apt to take their part; and these with the Earle of <hi>Britagne</hi> call in the King of England. Who after he hed exacted great sums of the Clergy, of the Citie of London for redemption of their liberties, and taken the third part of al the goods of the Iewes, passes ouer with an Army, lands at Saint <hi>Mallos,</hi> is met by many Nobles of <hi>Poictou,</hi> who with the Earle of <hi>Britagne</hi> doe homage vnto him, and great preparations are made to recouer such peeces as had beene obtayned by the late King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queene Regent sets out a powerfull army to stop the proceeding of the King of England, and much mischiefe is wrought on both sides in <hi>Pocitou, Xaintonges, Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi> where their friends and enemies suffer all a like. At length, seeing no great good to arise by their trauaile, both weary of the busines, either a peace, or truce is concluded.</p>
               <p>The King of England besides an infinite expence of treasure hauing lost diuers of his Nobles and other valiant men in the iourny, without any glory returnes home, bringging with him the Earle of <hi>Britagne</hi> and many <hi>Poictouins</hi> to receiue their promised rewards, which, notwithstanding all the former expence must be wrung out of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the poore subiect of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon his returne hee intertaines a purpose of Marriage with a sister of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> against which, the Earles, and Barons of England generally oppose; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be vnfit that he should haue the younger Sister, when <hi>Hubert</hi> his chiefe Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar, had maryed the eldest: and the Earle of <hi>Britagne,</hi> by whose Councell he was now much directed, disswades him likewise from it. To this Earle (after supplies obtained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his expences, and debts in <hi>France</hi>) he giues fiue thousand markes, as if remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">The King calls his officers to accoumpt.</note> of the summe hee had promised. And for the rest of the <hi>Poictouins,</hi> their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rewards were to be had by the displacing and spoyles of his Officers, Receiuors, and others whom now hee calles to accoumpt, and castes for defrauding him

in their offices, of whom <hi>Ralph Breton</hi> treasorer of his Chamber is first, who was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prison and grieuoulsy fined: then <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> his chiese lusticiar, (a man who <note place="margin">1228. Anno. Reg. 13.</note> had long ruled all vnder him in a place euer obnoxious to detraction and enuy) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to accoumpt for such treasure as passed his office (which was then for all reliefes, and subsidies whatsoeuer raysed on the subiect) and, notwithstanding he had the kings Charter for it during life, yet is he thrust out of his office, and besides accused of hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crymes of treason.</p>
               <p>No sooner was this great officer, and inward councellor falne into the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, but presently a whole volly of accusations (which feare in time of fauour held in) were discharged vpon him, and euery act of his examined, and vrged according to the passion of the complainers. The city of London laies to his charge the execution of their citizen <hi>Constantine</hi> (in the time of a ryot committed betweene their people and those of Westminster at a wrastling in Saint <hi>lames</hi> feilds, <hi>Anno. Reg.</hi> 4.) as done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant and law, and craue Iustice for his bloud. <hi>Hubert,</hi> to auoyd this sodaine storme comming vpon him, fled to the Church of <hi>Merton</hi> for Santuary, whence, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men sent to pursue him, he is drawne out by force, and committed to prison. Of which violence done contrary to the priuiledge of that sacred place, the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in whose dioses it was, complaines, and so wrought that he is brought back againe to the same chappell. But yet all that could not shelter him from the Kings wrath, who giues strict commandement to the Shriefes of <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Sussex</hi> to set a guard about the place, that no sustenance be brought him. Hunger inforces him to commit himselfe to the Kings mercy, and away is he sent prisoner to the <hi>Vize,</hi> his money, left in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody <note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> of the templars, is brought forth, and seazed into the Kings hands; clayming that, and much more as stolne out of his exchequer. <hi>Stephen de Segraue</hi> is put into his office, a worse minister for the common-wealth (which seldome gaynes by such shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) and who must shortly runne the same fortune. <hi>Walter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carliel</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thrust out of his office of Treasorer, and <hi>William Rodon</hi> Knight, of his place of Marshall of the kings house, and all the chiefe Councellors, Bishops, Earles and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Kingdome, are remoued, as distrusted, and onely strangers preferred to their roomes. <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> lately returned from the holy warres to be the author of most vnholy discord at home, is charged to be the cause hereof, and with him, one <hi>Peter de Riuallis,</hi> now the sepeciall minion about the King.</p>
               <p>These straines of so strange and insufferably violences so exasperate the Nobility, as many (whereof <hi>Richard,</hi> now Earle Marshall vpon the death of his brother <hi>William</hi> was chiefe) do combine themselues for defence of the publique, and boldly do shew the King <hi>his error, and ill aduised course, in preferring strangers about him, to the disgrace and oppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion <note place="margin">The Lords combine for the publike defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the K.</note> of his naturall liege people, contrary to their lawes and liberties, and that vnlesse he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this excesse, whereby his crowne and Kingdome was in eminent daunger, he and the rest of the nobility would withdraw themselues from his councell,</hi> whervnto the Bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>replies: that it was lawfull for the King to callwhat strangers he listed about him for defence of his crowne and Kingdome, thereby to compell his proud, and rebellious subiects to their due obedience.</hi> With which answere the Earle, and the rest, depart with more indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: vowing that in this cause, which concerned them ail, they would spend their liues.</p>
               <p>Herevpon the King sodenly sends ouer for whole legions of <hi>Poictouins,</hi> and withall sommons a Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> whether the Lords refused to come, both in regard they found themselues dispised, and holding it not safe by reason of those multitudes <note place="margin">The Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to come to Parliament vpon summons</note> of strangers. Then was it decreed by the Kings Councell that they should be the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third time sommoned, to try whether they would come or not. And here, from the Pulpit, whence the voyce of GOD and the people is vttered, the King is bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed the way to redresse this mischiefe of the Kingdome, by one <hi>Robert Bacon</hi> a Fryer Predicant: but more comically by <hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> (in pleasant discourse) asking the king: <hi>my Lord, what is most nocent to Sea-men, and what feared they most,</hi> the King replies: Seamen know that best themselues; then, my Lord I will tell you: <hi>Petrae et Rupes,</hi> alledging to <hi>Petrus de Rupibus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:7690:72"/>After this, the Lords were summoned to a Parliament at Westminster: whether likewise they refused to come, vnles the King would remoue the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1232. Anno.

               <p>Vpon this threatning, pledges are required of the nobility to be deliuered by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine day for security of their alleagiance. But no act passed in this Parliament though <note place="margin">6.

               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> to weaken the party of the <hi>Mareschall,</hi> wonne the Eatles of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> with a thousand markes, and the King had so pleased his brother the Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> as hee likewise left them. Wherevpon they withdraw them into <hi>Wales,</hi> and confederat with <hi>Lewelin</hi> and other great men in that country, (whither also came <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> escaping out of the <hi>Vize</hi> Castle, and ioynes with them) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their oath intermutually, that no one without other should make their accord.</p>
               <p>The King goes himselfe in person with an Army, against these revolted Lords, into <hi>Wales,</hi> Where he had the worst of the busines, and much dishonour, returnes to <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The K. with an army against the Lords.</note> imployes new forces of strangers, but all without successe. Wherevpon a Fryer of the Order of Minors is imployed to confer with the Earle <hi>Mareschall,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to come in, and submit himselfe to the kings mercy, whom he had heard to say, that notwithstanding his great offences, he would pardon, and restore to his estate vpon submission; and besides giues him so much of <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> as should conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently mayntaine him. Besides the Fryer told him what he heard of other Councellors about the King, concerning the wishing of his submission, and in what forme they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <note place="margin">

And then, as of himselfe, he vses all inducements. possible to draw him therevnto, shewing how it was his duty, his profit, and safty so to doe. Wherewithall the Earle nothing moued, told the Fryer what iniuries hee had receiued, and that hee could not trust the King so long as hee had such Councellors about him: who onely sought the distruction of him, and his associats, who euer had beene his loyall subiects. And after many obiections made by the Fryer with vrging the Kings power, his owne weaknes, and the danger hee was in: the Earle concludes that he feared no danger: that he would neuer yeeld to the Kings Will, that was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by no reason: that he should giue an ill Example to relinquish the iustice of his cause to obay that Will which wrought all iniustice, whereby it might appeare, they loued wordly possessions more then right and honor, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So nothing was done, the war continues with much effusion of bloud, all the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Wales</hi> vnto <hi>Shrowesbury,</hi> are miserable wasted, and made desolate. At length meanes is vsed to draw the Earle <hi>Mareschall</hi> ouer into Ireland to defend his estate there, which was likewise seized vpon, by authority giuen vnder the Kings hand and Seale, and all those great possessions discended vnto him from his Ancestor the Earle <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> (the first conquerors of that country) spoyled, and taken from him. And here, seeking to recouer his liuelihood hee lost his life circumuented by treachery: his death gaue occasion of griefe both to his friends and enemies. The king disauowes the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1234. Anno.

               <p>After two yeares his affliction, a Parliament is assembled at Westminster, wherein the Bishops grauely admonish the King (by his Fathers example, and his owne experiene, <note place="margin">7 Parliament.</note> of the mischiefe of dissention betweene him, and his Kingdome, occasioned through the ill councell of his ministers) to be at vnion with his people, to remoue from him strangers, and others, by whose instigation, for their owne ends, these disturbances are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7690:73"/>
fostered, and his naturall Subiects estranged from him, to the great alienation of their affections, which was of dangerous consequence. Wherefore (after recitall of the Greeuances of the State, and the abuses of his Ministers, which were such as all corrupted times produce) they humbly besought him to gouerne his, according to the example of other Kingdomes, by the natiues of the same, and their Lawes: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would proceed by Ecclesiasticall censure, both against his Councellors, and himselfe.</p>
               <p>The King seeing no way to subsist, and get to his ends but by temporizing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to call home these Lords out of Wales, restores them to their places and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, amoues those strangers from about him, and calls his new Officers to accompt. The Bishop of <hi>Winchesler.

               <p>Things thus appeased the King giues his sister <hi>Isabel</hi> in marriage to the Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi> the second (successor to <hi>Otho,</hi> and grand-child to <hi>Frederic Barbarossa</hi>) the Archbishop of <hi>Cologne</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Louaine</hi> were sent for her. Shee is conducted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isabel</hi> the Kings Sister married to the Emperor.</note> by the King her brother to <hi>Sandwich</hi> with three thousand horse. The marriage is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnised at <hi>Wormes.</hi> She was the third wife of this Emperour, an alliance that yeelded neither strength or benefit (though that were both their ends) to either Prince. The continuall broyle which this Emperour held with all the Popes of his time, <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, <hi>Honorius, Innocent</hi> the fourth <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth) was such and so great as all hee could doe, was not enough for himselfe. For not to let goe that hold of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire he had in <hi>Italie,</hi> with his hereditarie Kingdomes of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicil</hi> which the Popes wrought to draw to the Church, he was put to be perpetually in conflict, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer free from vexations, thrust from his owne courses, enioyned to vndertake the Holy warres, to waste him abroade, weakened at home by excommunications, and fines for absolutions, for which, at one time hee payde eleuen thousand markes of Gold. And in the end the Popes so preuayled that in the Graue of this <hi>Frederic</hi> was buried the Imperiall Authority in <hi>Italy,</hi> after hee had thus raigned foure and thirty yeares, leauing his sonne <hi>Conrad</hi> successour rather of his miseries then his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Hee had a sonne by <hi>Isabel</hi> named <hi>Henrie,</hi> to whom hee bequeathed the Kingdome of <hi>Sicile,</hi> and a hundred thousand ounces of Gold, but hee liued not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it.</p>
               <p>To the marriage of this Sister, the King qiues thirty thousand markes, besides an Imperiall Crowne and other ornaments of great value: towards which, is raysed two <note place="margin">1236. Anno. Reg. 20.</note> Markes vpon euery Hide Land. And the next yeare after, himselfe marries <hi>Elianor</hi> daughter to <hi>Raymond</hi> Earle of Prouince, a match in regard of the distance of the place, with the meanes and degree of Estate, little aduantagious either to him, or his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the circumstance of alliance drew it on, with some other promises which were not obserued. So, that hee is neither greater, nor richer by these alliances but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lessened in his meanes, hauing no dowre with his wife, full of poore kindred, that must draw meanes from this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>After the solemnization of this marriage (which was extraordinarily sumptuous) a Parliament is assembled at London, which the King would haue held in the Towre, whither the Lords refusing to come, another place, of more freedome, is appoynted: where, after many things propounded for the good of the Kingdome order is taken that all Shriefes are remooued from their Offices vpon complaint of corruption; and <note place="margin">Shriefes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued for corruption.</note> others of more integritie, and abler meanes (to auoyde briberie) put in their roomes, taking their Oathes to receiue no guifts, but in victualls, and those without excesse.</p>
               <p>Here the King displaces his Steward, and some other Councellors, and offers to take from the Bishop of Chichester, then Chancellor, the great Seale, but the Bishop refuses to deliuer it, alledging, how hee had it by the common Councell of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and without assent of the same, would not resigne it, and hauing carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe irreprehensible in his Office, is much fauoured by the people. <hi>Peter de Riuallis,</hi> and <hi>Stephan Segraus,</hi> are againe receiued into grace: an argument of the kings leuitie,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7690:73"/>
and irresolution, moued, it seemes, with any Engine to doe and vndoe, and all out of time and order, wherein he euer looses ground.</p>
               <p>And now faine would he haue reuoked, by the Popes Authority, some grants of his made heretofore, as being don beyond his powre, &amp; without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the Church, which harsh intention addes more to the already conceiued displeasure of the people.</p>

Reg. 21.</note> opposition is made, and recitall of the many Leuies had beene exacted of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now of the twentith, now of the thirtith, and fortith parts: and that it was a thing vnworthy and iniurious, to permit a King, who was so lightly seduceble, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did good to the Kingdome, either in expelling, or repressing enemy, or amplyfing the bounds thereof, but rather lessening and subiugating the same to Strangers, that he should extort by so many pretences, so great summes from his naturall people (as from slaues of the basest condition) to their detriment, and benefit of <hi>Aliens.</hi> Which when the King heard, desirous to stop this generall murmur, promised by Oath that he would neuer more iniurie the Nobles of the Kingdome, so that they would benignly releeue him at that present, with this supply: in regard he had exhausted his treasure, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Sister, and his owne: whereunto they plainely answere, <hi>that the same was done without their Councell, neither ought they to be partakers of the punishment, who were free from the fault.</hi> After 4 daies consultation, the King promising to vse only the Councell of his naturall Subiects, disauowing and protesting against the reuocation lately propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and freely granting the inuiolable obseruation of the Liberties, vnder paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, hath yeelded vnto him the thirtith part of all moueables (reseruing yet to euery man his ready coyne, horse, and armour to be imployed for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For the collection of this subsidy, it was ordayned that 4 Knights of euery <note place="margin">Foure knights of euery shire ordained to take charge of the subsidy.</note> Shire, and one Clerke of the Kings should vpon their Oath receiue and deliuer the same, either vnto some Abbay or Castle, to be reserued there, that if the King fayle in performance of his Grants, it might be restored to the Country whence it was collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: with this condition often annexed, that the King should leaue the Councell of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> and onely vse that of his naturall Subiects. Wherein to make shew of his part, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly causes the Earles <hi>Warren</hi> and <hi>Ferrers,</hi> with <hi>Iohn Fitz Geffrey</hi> to be sworne his Councellors. And so the Parliament ended, but not the businesse for which it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the King not giuing that satisfaction to his subiects as he had promised concerning Strangers, and besides, that order concluded in Parliament was not obserued in the leauying and disposing of the susidie, but stricter courses taken in the valewing of mens Estates then was held conuenient. Moreouer <hi>William Valentine</hi> Vncle to the young Queene, is growne the onely inward man with the King, and possesses him so, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done without his Councell: the Earle of Prouince, the father; a poore Prince, is inuited to come ouer to participat of this Treasure, which seemes was disposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The comming of <hi>Simon Monford</hi> into into England.</note> it came in. <hi>Simon de Monford</hi> a French man borne (banished out of <hi>France</hi> by Queene <hi>Blanch</hi>) is intertayned in <hi>England,</hi> and preferred secretly in marriage to <hi>Elianor</hi> the Kings Sister (widow of <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Great Mareschall) and made Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> by right of his mother <hi>Amice</hi> daughter to <hi>Blanchman</hi> Earle of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi> Which courses (with other) so incense the Nobility, and generally all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as put them out into a new commotion. and <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings brother (whose youth and ambition apt to be wrought vpon, is made the head thereof; who being as yet Heire apparant of the Kingdome (the Queen being yong and child-lesse) the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the good thereof, is argued to concerne him, and hee is the man imployed <note place="margin">The Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances of the Kingdome.</note> to the King to impart the publike greeuances, and to reprehend, first the profusion of his Treasure (gotten by exaction from the subiect.) and cast away vpon Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who onely guide him, then the infinite summes hee had raised in his time: How there was no Archbishopricke or Bishopricke, except Yorke, Lincolne &amp; Bathe, but he had made benefit by their Vacancies: besides what fell by Abbayes, Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Baronies, Wardships and other Escheates, and yet his treasure, which should
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7690:74"/>
be the strength of the State, was nothing increased. Moreouer how hee as if both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pising his, and the Councell of his naturall Subiects, was so obsequious to the will of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and especially of the Legat whom he had inconsiderately called in, as hee seemed to adore his footsteps, and would doe nothing either in publique or priuate, <note place="margin">1238. Anno. Reg. 22.</note> but by his consent, so that he seemed absolutely the Popes Feudarie, which wounded the hearts of his people. The King vpon this harsh remonstrance of his brother, and the feare of a present commotion, after he had sounded the affections of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> whom he found resolued to take part against him, hee againe (by the aduice of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, who had earnestly delt with the Earle of Cornwall to reconcile himselfe to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but without effect) calls a Parliament at London. Whither the Lords came ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">10 Parliament</note> both for their owne saftie, and to constraine the King (if he refused to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the premices, and reformation of his courses.</p>
               <p>Here, after many debatements the King (taking his Oath) to referre the businesse to the order of certaine graue men of the Kingdome, Articles are drawne, sealed, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely set vp to the view of all, with the seales of the Legat, and diuers great men. But before it came to effect, <hi>Simon Monford</hi> working his peace with the Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> likewise (with whom he and the State were displeased) the Earle growes cold in the businesse. The Lords perceiuing the staffe of their strength to faile them, failed themselues, so that nothing is effected, and the miseries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome continue as they did.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the King takes displeasure against <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earle of Pembrooke (the third sonne of <hi>William</hi> the great Mareschall) and caused his gates to bee shut against <note place="margin">1239. Anno. Reg. 23.</note> him at Winchester, whereupon the Earle retyres into the North. And to shew how inconstant this King was in his fauours, <hi>Simon Norman</hi> (intituled Maister of the Kings Seale, and not onely so, but said to be Maister of the Kingdome; yea of the King, the Rector, and Disposer of Court) is throwne out with disgrace, the Seale taken from him, and giuen to the Abbot of Euesham. In like sort, his brother <hi>Geffrey</hi> a Knight Templar is put out of the Councell, both of them much maligned by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie; who had often before laboured their amouement, as held to be corrupt Councellors, and wrongers of the State, and now are they falne off themselues. But the cause of this their deiection may shew, that oftentimes Officers vnder weake Princes are not so much faulty, as the World holds them to be: for not yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to passe a Grant from the King made vnto <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> (the Queenes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy marrieth the inheretrix of the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which he held but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her life.</note> Vncle) of 4 pence vpon euery sacke of Wooll (an enormious act then accompted) they both lost their places, though not their reputations in this; their fall discouering what the Enuie that attended their fortune, hindred men to see. To this Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> the next yeare after the King grants (notwithstanding) 300 Markes (to bee payd out of his Eschequer annually, for his homage.</p>
               <p>Now, besides the great exactions of the King, and his wastes. The Sea of Rome extorts huge summes, as if one Gulph sufficed not to swallow vp the substance of the Kingdome, which opened the mouthes of our Clergie so wide; as they let out many exclamations against the auarice of the Popes of that time: and the <hi>Roman</hi> Factors, who by permission of the King, or by his negligence, presumed so farre vpon the easi-yeeldingnesse of the State, as they wrung out what they listed. In so much, as besides the fleece, they would now haue the bodies of their possessions. And the Pope sends his Mandat to haue three hundred <hi>Romans</hi> preferred to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which should bee first vacant in <hi>England,</hi> which so amazed the Clergie, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Edmond</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie, as hee; seeing no end of these concussions of the State, and Liberties of the Church: and himselfe (on whom the Scandall of all must light, vnable by reason of the Kings remissnesse to withstand it, tyred with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of worldly actions) giues ouer all; and betakes himselfe to a voluntarie exile in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edmond</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury giues ouer his Sea.</note> Abbay of <hi>Pontiniac</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and there applies him to the contemplation of a better life. But before his departure, he yeelds, as a ransom for his Church, 800 Markes to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Clergie, although thus left by their head, generally oppose what they could,

against the Popes rapine, who to get money for his wars with the Emperor vsed dayly <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9.</note> new and insolent pressures vpon them, in so much as they repaire to the King, declare how preiudiciall, and detogatory it was to his royaltie, and the liberty of the Kingdom to suffer this proceeding, which none of his Predecessors heretofore euct did: and of how dangerous consequence it was to his successors. The King, either not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue of the mischiefe, or content to ioyne with the Pope to punish and awe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not onely refers them to the Legat, but offers to deliuer the chiefe opposers vp vnto him. Whereupon they seeing themselues forsaken, and no powre to succor them but their owne, did what they could to withstand the Legats proceeding, who now by the Kings animation presumes more peremptorily to vrge them to supply the Popes present occasion, and holds a Conuocation at <hi>London</hi> for effecting the same. Wherein the Clergie declare how this contribution now required by the Pope for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Emperor, and effusion of Christian bloud was vnlawfull, hee being not an Heretike, nor condemned by the iudgement of the Church although excommunicated: That it was against the Liberties of the Church of England, being required vnder paine of Ecclesiasticall censure, as a thing of seruitude and compulsion: That they had heretofore giuen a Tenth to the Pope, on condition, that neuer any such exaction should againe be made, least it might be drawne to a Custome, for as much as <hi>binus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cod. de <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</hi> L. Nemo.</note>

That a generall contribution was to bee made by a generall Councell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding these reasons, though at first they staggered the Legat, yet such course was taken by winning some of them, vpon hope of preferment, as the rest could not without the note of contumacie but yeeld perforce, so, by this treason of deuision, the body of the Councell is entred into, and the Pope preuailes in this businesse.</p>
               <p>The King hath now a sonne lately borne, and <hi>Richard</hi> his brother Earle of <hi>Cornwall</hi>

               <p>The Earle of March with his wife, the Queene Mother, and many other Great Lords of <hi>Poictou,</hi> so worke by their earnest solieitation, with assurance of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, as the King is induced to vndertake another expedition into <hi>France.</hi> The <note place="margin">11 Parliament</note> matter is mooued in Parliament, generall opposition made against it, the great expence, and the ill it last brought to the Kingdome, vehemently vrged, <hi>How it was vnlawfull to breake the truce made with the King of</hi> France, <hi>who was now too strong for them to doe any good, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding many of the greatest Peeres drawne by faire promises, and their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7690:75"/>
owne hopes for recouerie of their Estates so preuaile as the action is resolued on, and an Ayde demaunded for the same. The very motion for money was so distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as presently all the Kings supplies made from the beginning of his raigne, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly againe, &amp; opprobriously rehersed, as the 13. 15. 16 and 40 part of all mens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueables, besides Carucage, Hydage, Escuage, Escheates, Amercements, and such like, <note place="margin">A repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Kings sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies formerly made.</note> which could not but fill his Coffers. Then the Popes continuall exactions, with the infinite charge for those who vndertooke the Holy warre, are likewise repeated. Besides they declare, how the 30 leuied about foure yeares past (in regard it was to bee layde vp in certaine Castles and not to bee issued but by the allowance of foure of the Peeres) was, as they held it yet vnspent: the King, to their knowledge, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had no necessarie occasion to imploy the same for the vse of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for which it was graunted, and therefore resolutely they denyed to yeeld him any more. Whereupon the King comes himselfe to the Parliament and, in most submissiue manner craues their ayde at this time, vrging the Popes letter, which hee had procured to sollicite and perswade them thereunto. But all preuailed not, their vow made to each other not to disseuer their voyces, or to be drawne to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnion held them fast together. In so much as the King is driuen to get what hee could of particular men, either by guift or loane, and vses such meanes, as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <note place="margin">The King car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ouer 30 Barrells of siluer into France.</note> he carries ouer with him thirty Barrells of sterling coyne, and taking with him his Queene, leaues the gouernment of the Kingdome to the Archbishop of Yorke, hauing first, for his better quiet at home, contracted a match betweene his daughter <hi>Margueret</hi> (yet an infant) and <hi>Alexander</hi> eldest sonne to <hi>Alexander</hi> 3 King of Scots to whom he commits the gouernment of the Marches.</p>
               <p>This second expedition into <hi>France,</hi> had no better successe then the first. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">The Kings se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into France.</note> he likewise consumed his treasure vpon strangers, discontented the English No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, was deceiued in his trust by the <hi>Poictouines,</hi> who failed him with his money, and after more then a whole yeares stay (the Lords of <hi>England</hi> leauing him) was driuen to make a dishonorable truce with the King of <hi>France.</hi> And after hauing beene releeued with much prouision out of <hi>England,</hi> and another imposition of Escuage, hee returnes, puts the Iewes to another redemption; exacts of the <hi>Londoners;</hi> is visited by his <note place="margin">An imposition of Escuage with another redemption of the Iewes.</note> wiues mother, the Countesse of Prouince, who, bringing with her <hi>Zanchia</hi> her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is (to adde to his other expencesses) sumptuously feasted, &amp; a marriage solemnized betweene the young Lady and <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cornewall, whose wife was late dead, and he returned from the Holy warres.</p>
               <p>The olde Countesse at her returne is presented with many rich guifts, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince mother to the Queen comes ouer into England to the great charge of the Kingdome.</note> receiued an annuall pension of 4000 Markes out of <hi>England</hi> for fiue yeares pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in consideration of a pact made, that King <hi>Henry</hi> should, after her discease haue the Earledome of Prouince. But shortly after her returne home, she disappoints him of that hope; and bestowes the same with her youngest daughter <hi>Beautrix,</hi> on <hi>Charles</hi> the French Kings brother, who was after King of Naples, and Sicile. So that she liued to see all her foure daughters Queenes; <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cornwall comming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be elected King of the Romans.</p>
               <p>Meanes now, vpon these profusions, to haue fresh supplie of Treasure, was <note place="margin">1244. <hi>Anno.

Here they desire to haue ordayned that foure of the most graue and discreet Peeres should be chosen as Conseruators of the Kingdome, and sworne of the Kings Councell, both to see Iustice obserued, and the Treasure issued, and these should euer attend about the King or at least 3, or 2 of them. Besides that the Lord Chiefe Iusticiar, and the Lord Chancellor should bee chosen by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall voyces of the States assembled, or else bee one of the number of those foure.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7690:75"/>
Besides they propound that there might bee two Iustices of the Benches, two Barons of the Eschequer: and one Iustice for the Iewes, and those likewise to bee chosen by Parliament. <hi>That as their function was publike, so should also be their Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whilst these things were in debating, the enemy of mankind and disturber of Peace, the Deuill, saith <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> hindred the proceeding, by the comming of <hi>Martin</hi> a new Legat sent from the Pope with a larger powre then euer any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to exact vpon the State; which hee supposed now to haue beene so wrought, and ready, as the Kings turne being seru'd, his likewise should bee presently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. But making too much haste before the first had passage, hee frustrates his owne desire, and receiues a most peremptory repulse of the whole Kingdome, in so much as his Agent was disgracefully returned home with this displeasing message. <hi>That the Kingdome was poore: had great warres, the Church in debt, not able to yeeld any more. Besides this course was of daungerous consequence to this State, which alone seemed exposed to the Popes will, and therefore seeing a generall Councell was shortly to bee held at</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>if the Church would bee relieued, it were fit the same should bee done by a generall consent in that Councell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, at this time the Emperour <hi>Frederic,</hi> by his Letters which were openly read <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Append. The Empetor <hi>Fredericks</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the King.</note> in this Assembly, first <hi>intreates, as before he had oftentimes done, that the Pope might haue no supplies out of</hi> England, <hi>which (he sayd) were only required to ruine him, whom contrarie to all Pietie and Iustice hee had oppressed, by seizing vpon his Cities, and Castles appertayning to the Empire. And for many yeares (notwithstanding his often submission and desire of Peace) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in all foule and Hostile manner against him, both by the sword, and vniust excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications. And seeing hee could obtaine no due hearing, hee had referred his cause to bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrated by the Kings of</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>and the Baronage of both Kingdomes. And therefore desires, hee might not receiue detriment, whence hee expected fauour, as a brother and friend.</hi> Adding in the end, <hi>that if the King would be aduised by him hee would by powre free this Kingdome from that vniust tribute which</hi> Innocentius <hi>the</hi> 3, <hi>and other Popes had layde vpon it.</hi> These letters pleased the Assembly and animated them the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny the Popes Mandate.</p>
               <p>The interposition of this businesse tooke vp so much time, as nothing else was done in this Parliament, onely they granted an Ayde to the King, for the marriage of his daughter, twenty shillings of euery Knights fee, and that with much adoe and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all former Aydes.</p>
               <p>After this, vpon a light occasion, the King vndertakes an expedition of great charge against <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> for which euery Baron which held in <hi>Capite,</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Lay, were commanded to bee ready withall Military prouision due for that seruice. Whereunto, likewise repaires <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of Flaunders with three score Knights and a hundred other seruants (thirsting for the Kings money) whose vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie <note place="margin">Another Greeuanees of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</note> comming was ill taken by the Barons of Eng. as if the strength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without him, were not sufficient for that Action, which was as sodainely ended as vndertaken, by a faire conclusion of Peace with King <hi>Alexander;</hi> a Prince highly commended for his vertues, by the Writers of that time.</p>
               <p>Vpon his returne, againe that Winter he assembles another Parliament, wherein hee moues for an Ayde, vpon a designe he had for Wales, and to supply his wants, and pay <note place="margin">13 Parliament</note> his debts, which were vrged to be so great, as he could not appeare out of his chamber for the infinite clamor of such to whom he owed for his Wine, Wax, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of House. But they all to his face, with one voyce, refused to grant him any thing. Wherevpon other violent courses are taken. An ancient quarrell is found out against the city of London for which they are commanded to pay fifteene thousand Markes. And <hi>Passeleise</hi> the Kings Clerke is imployed with others in a most peremptory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to inquire of all such lands, as had beene inforrested, and either to fine the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers <note place="margin">An inquirie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Lands inforested which bred great gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances.</note> thereof, at their pleasure, or take it from them and sell the same to others.

               <p>Now, in regard to shew the King the Estate of his kingdome, and the oppression of Popes; Inquiry was made of the reuenues which the Romans and Italians had in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which was found to be annually, sixty thousand Markes, being more then the <note place="margin">An inquiry of the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues in Eng</note> yearely reuenues of the Crowne of England: which so moued the King, as hee caused the same to be notified, withall other exactions, by his procurators to the general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell now assembled at <hi>Lyons;</hi> Which (with the ill vsage of <hi>Martin</hi>) so vexed the Pope, as he is said to haue vttered these words: <hi>It is fit that wee make an end with the Emperor that</hi>

               <p>And the Clergy of England were most forward to vindicate the State from that miserable oppression which of late by degrees they were drawne vnto, through the humility of their zeale: For, such is the nature of Domination, wheresoeuer it sits, that finding an yeeldingnes to indure, it neuer thinkes it hath power sufficient, vnles it hath more then enough: for, if the Popes (the professed souraignes of piety) vpon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of mens zeale, and beliefe, grew to make their will, and their power equall (so that to question their sanctions was taught to be sinne against the Holy Ghost) no meruaile if secular Princes, whose consciences are vntyed, striue to breake out into the wildnesse of their wills from those bounds wherein by the law of the state they are placed.</p>
               <p>But vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> reiecting the consideration of these greeuances of England (which were particularly deliuered in this councell at Lyons) and dispising the Kings <note place="margin">

                  <hi>England:</hi> and the King, for a time, bustles against these forraine exactions, in such sort as it gaue some hope of redresse. But being of an irresolute, and wauering nature, and a feard of threats, soone womanlike giues ouer what hee manfully vndertooke: so that the <hi>Pope</hi> continues his former rapine, though hauing by the continuall exclamations of the Clergy, bene brought to promise neuer to send any more Legats into England, yet imployes he other ministers, vnder the the title of Clarkes, who had the same power, as had his former Agents, and effected vnderhand his desires.</p>
               <p>Now the other part of the state haue new occasions of complaynt offered. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> brings ouer certaine maydes to be married to young noble <note place="margin">1247.

                  <hi>Then they reproue him</hi> for keeping vacant in his hands Bishoprickes, and Abbayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the liberties of the Church, and his Oath made at his Coronation.

               <p>The King patiently indures this reprehension, in hope to obtaine his desire and giues them promises of redresse, but nothing is effected; after many meetings and much debate the Parliament is proroged till Midsommet following, during which time, they would with Patience expect how the King would beare himselfe towards them; that accordingly they might obay, and satisfie his desire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this delay wrought no good, the King through ill Councell growes more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, and harsh to his people, in so much as at the next Session he makes this speech:</hi> Would you curbe the King your Lord, at your vnciuile pleasure, and impose a seruile condition <note place="margin">The Kings speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> vpon him? will you deny vnto him what euery one of you, as you list, may doe? It is lawfull for euery one of you to vse what counsell hee will, and euery maister of a famely to preferre to any office in his house whom he pleases, and displace againe when he list, and will you rashly deny your Lord, and King to doe the like? Whereas seruants ought not to iudge their Maister, nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects their Prince, or hold them to their conditions. For the seruant is not aboue his Lord, nor the Disciple aboue his Maister. Neither should hee bee your King, but as your seruant who should so incline to your pleasures: <hi>wherefore hee will neither remooue his Chiefe Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar, Chancellor, nor Treasorer, according to their motion. In like manner findes hee answeres to the rest of their Articles, and for the ayde he required, it concern'd (hee said) their Right as well as his. And so the Parliament brake vp in discontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King is aduised to furnish his wants with the sale of his Plate, and Iewells of the <note place="margin">

               <p>That Christmas also (without respect of Royall Magnificence) hee requires new yeares guifts of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and shortly after writes vnto them his letters imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously deprecatorie, to ayde him with money, which, with much grudging they doe, to the summe of 20000 pounds, for which, the next yeare after he craues pardon of the City, sending for them to <hi>Westminster Hall.</hi> And not with standing his continuall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp of all prouisions for his house, he so much lessens his hospitallity (introducing, <note place="margin">1249 Anno.

               <p>Then, whereas he could obtaine nothing of the States together, he calls vnto him, or writes to euery Noble man a part, declaring his pouertie and how hee was bound <note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares guifts.</note> by Charter in a debt of 30 thousand pounds to those of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and the <hi>Gascogines</hi> (who otherwise would not suffer him to depart home) at his last being in France. notwithstanding he required nothing but of fauour, which where he found, hee would returne with the like. And fayling likewise herein, hee addresses his letters to the Prelates, where he findes as little reliefe. By much importunitie, and his owne presence he got of the Abbot of Ramsey 100 pounds: but the Abbot of Borough had a face to refuse him the like sum. Though the King, told him it was more almes to giue vnto him, then to a beggar that went from doore to doore: the Abbot of Saint Albones

yet was more kinde, and gaue him 60 Markes. To this lownesse, did the necessity of this indigent King (through his profusion) decline him. The Iewes euer exposed to his will, feele the weight of these his wants, and their Estates are continually ransackt. One <hi>Abraham,</hi> found a delinquent, redeemes himselfe for 700 Markes. <hi>Aron</hi> another Iew, protests, the King had since his last being in <hi>France,</hi> taken from him by times, 30 thousand Markes of Siluar, besides hee had giuen 200 Markes in Gold to the Queene.</p>
               <p>The Lords assemble againe at <hi>London,</hi> and presse him with his promise made vnto <note place="margin">1250. Anno.

So that discontentment still gos on, <hi>and neither side get any thing but by hard wrestings, which became them both ill, and shew vs the miseries of a disioynted time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King labors the Couent of <hi>Duresme</hi> to prefer his brother <hi>Athelmar</hi> to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick the Couent refuses him, in regard of his youth and insufficiency: the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, <hi>that then he would keepe the Bishopricke</hi> 8. <hi>or</hi> 9. <hi>yeares more in his hand, till his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were of more maturity.</hi> Shortly after the Bishopricke of <hi>Winchester</hi> falles voyd; and thither hee sends presently his solicitors to prepare the Monkes of the Cathedrall <note place="margin">The Kings speach to the Chapter at Winchester.</note> Church, to elect his brother, and for that he would not haue also their repulse; he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly goes thither himselfe in Person, enters the Chapter house as a Bishop or Prior, gets vp into the Presidents Chayre, begins a Sermon, and takes this text: <hi>Iustice and Peace haue kissed each other,</hi> and therevpon vses these words: <hi>To mee, and other Kings, and to our Princes and Iusticiars, who are to gouerne the people, belong the rigor of Iudgement, and Iustice: to you, who are men of quiet, and religion; peace and tranquillity: and this day I heare, you haue (for your owne good) beene fauorable to my request. Iustice and Peace haue kissed each other. Once I was offended with you for withstanding me in the election of</hi> William Rale <hi>your late Bishop, a man I liked not, but now I am friends with you for this, and will both remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and reward your kindnesse, As by a woman came distruction to the world, so by a woman came the remedy.

And you are to consider how in this citty I was borne, and in this Church Baptised. Wherefore you are bound vnto me in a straighter bond of affection, &amp;c. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends he the high birth and good parts of his Brother, and what honor and benefit they should haue by electing him, but concludes with some threatning. So that the Monkes, seeing him thus to require the Bishopricke, held it in vaine to deny him: and</hi> Athelmar <hi>is elected though with this reseruation; if the Pope allowed thereof.</hi> Shortly after followes the memorable cause of <note place="margin">The cause of Sir <hi>H.

               <p>The king by Proclamation calls the Londoners to Westminster, and there causes <note place="margin">1252. Anno.

               </p>
               <p>The King, seeing the resolution of this graue Bishop, in great passion commanded his seruants to thrust him out of doore, perceiuing by this what was to be expected of the rest; and so falls to his former violent courses. During this Parliament (an ill time for sutors) <hi>Isabel</hi> Countesse of <hi>Arundel</hi> (widdow) comes vnto him a bout a Ward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned from her, in regard of a smale parcell of land held in Capite (which drew away all the rest) the King giuing her a harsh answere and turning away she said vnto him. <hi>My Lord, why turne you away your face from Iustice, that we can obtaine no right in your Court you are constituted in the middest betwixt God and vs: but neither gourne your selfe nor vs discrectely as you ought, you shamefuliy vex both the Church, and Nobles of the Kingdome by all meanes you may. To which speech the King disdainefully replies: Lady Countesse hath the Lords made you a Charter and sent you (for that you are an Eloquent speaker) to be their aduocate and prolocutrix? No Sir, saith she, they haue not made any Charter to mee. But</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ryots.</note> are made so insolent, as they commit many ryots and oppressions in the Kingdome. <hi>William de Valence</hi> (whose youth and presumption went which way his will led him) goes from his Castle of <hi>Hartford</hi> to a Parke of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> lying neere his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> where after hauing spoyled much game hee enters into the Bishops house and finding no drinke but Ale, causes the Cellar doore being strongly barred, to be broken open by his people, who after they had drunke their fill, let out the rest on the floore. But a greater violence then this was offred to an Officiall of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisnop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by the commandement of the Elect of <hi>Winchester</hi> (the one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Queene, the other to the King) which troubled them both, and gaue them much to doe before it was appeased. <hi>Guy de Lusignan,</hi> the other brother of the King comming as a guest to the Abbot of Saint <hi>Albones</hi> violates the Rights of Hospitality, and many other iniuties, are reported by our Authour to haue beene committed by strangers, and much complaint is made of that time, wherein, this was sayed to bee the vsuall exclamation. <hi>Our inheritance is giuen to Aliens, and our houses to Strangers,</hi> which notwithstanding the King seekes still to preferre.</p>
               <p>A daughter of <hi>Guy de Lusignan</hi> Earle of <hi>Angolesme</hi> is married to <hi>Richard</hi> (or <hi>Gilbere de Clare</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> a man eminent, and deerely loued of the Nobility: Learned in the Lawes of the Land; and held a great Patriot: which manacle of alliance lockt not yet his hands from defending the liberties of his Country, the King promises her a dower of fiue thousand Markes, which hee sought to borow of diuers, but could not.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> is againe compelled to the contribution of 1000 Markes: and the <hi>Gascoyns</hi> being vpon revolt (vnlesse speedy remedy were taken) generall musters are made, and commandement giuen that whosoeuer could dispend 13 pound <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> should furnish out a horse-man. This with the extreame wants of the King occasions another Parliament, wherein the State began, it seemes wisely to consider that all their opposition did no good, the Kings turne must bee serued one way or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7690:78"/>
other, some must pay for it; and where it lighted on particulars it was far more heauy, then it could be in generall: and therefore they agreed to relieue him rather by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall way, then force him to those extrauagant courses which he tooke. But so, as the reformation of the gouernment and ratification of their lawes might be once againe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly confirmed.</p>
               <p>And after fifteene daies consultation to satisfie the Kings desire, for his holy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">A Tenth, and Scutage gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Parl.</note> (a Tenth is granted by the Clergy) which yet by view of the Lords should, vpon his setting forth, be destributed for 3. yeares; and Scntage, (3. Markes of euery knights Fee) by the Laytie for that yeare. And now againe those often confirmed Charters are ratified, and that in the most solemne and ceremonicall manner, as <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> could euer deuise to doe.</p>
               <p>The King with all the great Nobility of England, all the Bishops and chiefe Prelates <note place="margin">1253. Anno. Reg. 37.</note> in their reuerent Ornaments, with burning candles in their hands assemble to heare the terrible sentence of Excommunications against the infringers of the same. And, at the lighting of those Candles, the King hauing receiued one in his hand, giues it to a Prelate that stood by, saying, <hi>it becomes not me being no Priest to hold this candle, my heart shalbe a greater testimony.</hi> and withall, layd his hand spread on his brest the whole time the sentence was read, which was thus pronounced: <hi>Autoritate dei omnipotratis, &amp;c.</hi> which done he caused the Charter of K. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Father granted by his free consent to be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Append.</note> likewise openly red. In the end, hauing throwne away their candles (which lay smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the ground) they cryed out: <hi>So let them who incurre this Sentence be extinct, and stincke in hell.</hi> And the King with a loud voyce said: <hi>As God me helpe, I will, as I am a Man, a Christian, a Knight, a King crowned, and anoynted, inuiolably obserue all these things.</hi> And therewithall the Bells rung out, and all the people shouted with ioy.</p>
               <p>Neuer were lawes amongst men (except those holy commandements from the mount) established with more maiesty of Ceremony to make them reuerend, and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected then were these: they wanted but thunder and lightning from heauen (which if prayers could haue procured, they would likewise haue had) to make the sentence gastly, and hydeous to the infringers thereof. The greatest security that could begiuen was an oath (the onely chaine on earth, besides loue, to tye the conscience of man, and humaine society together) which, should it not hold vs, all the frame of gouernment and order must needs fall quite a sunder.</p>
               <p>Now the busines of <hi>Gascoigne</hi> (that required present care) is in hand, which the <note place="margin">The K. resumes <hi>Gasoigny</hi> from his brother <hi>Richard,</hi> giues it to his sonne Prince <hi>Edward</hi>
                  </note> better to know, we must returne to the head whence it sprung. 27. yeares past, the King, by the councell of his Lords, freely granted to his brother <hi>Richard</hi> all that Prouince, who is there receiued as their Lord with their oathes of Fealty made vnto him; and so continues, vntill the King (hauing issue of his owne, by motion of the Queene) reuokes his guift, &amp; confers it vpon his eldest sonne <hi>Edward. Richard,</hi> though he were depriued of the possession would not yeeld to forgoe his right, and at the Kings last being in Gascoigny, many of them stand doubtfull whom to attend; the King in great displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure commanded his brother to resigne his Charter, and renounce his right; which, hee refusing to doe, the King commands those of <hi>Burdeax</hi> to take, and imprison him: but they (in regard of his high bloud, the homage they had made him, and the kings mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who might resent his owne commandement) would not aduenture there on. Then he assayles them with mony which effected more then his commandement: the Earle is indaunger to be surprised, escapes out of <hi>Bnrdeaux,</hi> and comes ouer into England.</p>
               <p>The King assembles the nobility of <hi>Gasconie</hi> at <hi>Burdeaux;</hi> invaighs against his brother: <hi>a man, hee saide was couetous, and a great oppressor, a large promiser, but a spare payer; and that hee would prouide them of a better gouernour:</hi> with all, promises them thirty thousand Markes (as a price of their obedience) and so nullifies the Charter of his former donation, with their homage, and takes their oath of Fealty to himselfe. Which yet they would not make vnto him, till hee had inwrapt himselfe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simon Monford</hi> Earle of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gascony.</note> both by his Charter and Oath for this promised summe: wherevnto they so held him, as thereby, afterward they lost his loue. And to be reuenged on them, he sends <hi>Simon Monford</hi> Earle of <hi>Leceister,</hi> a rough and Martiall man to Maister their pride: makes him
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7690:79"/>
a Charter for 6. yeares to come, and furnishes him with 10000. markes the better to effect his command. <hi>Monfort</hi> by his sterne gouernment so discontents the Gascoins, as after three yeares suffring, they send the Archbishop of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> with other great men, to complaine of his hard dealing, and accuse him of haynous crimes: their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uences are heard before the King and his councell. <hi>Monfort</hi> is sent for ouer, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for himselfe, the Earle of Cornwall for his receiued wrong in those parts, and, the Lords of England for their loue to him, take <hi>Monforts</hi> part; and that so egarly, as the King comes about to fauour and countenance the <hi>Gascons</hi> against <hi>Monfort;</hi> not for his loue to them, but to awe, and abate the other. Wherevpon <hi>Montfort</hi> enters into vndutifull contestation with the King, vpraydes him with his expencefull seruice: wherein, he saies, he had vtterly consumed his Estate: and how the King had broken his word with him: and requires him either to make it good, according to his Charter, or render him his expences. The King in great rage told him, no promise was to be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Monforts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation with the K.</note> obserued with an vnworthy traytor: Wherewith <hi>Monfort</hi> ryses vp protesting that he lyed in that word, and were he not protected by his royall dignity, hee would make him repent it. The King commands his seruants to lay hold on him, which the Lords would not permit. <hi>Monfort</hi> therevpon, grew more audacious saying, who will beleiue you are a Christian? were you euer confessed? if you were, it was without repentance, and satissaction. The King told him he neuer repented him of any thing so much, as to haue permitted him to enter into this Kingdome, and to haue honored, and it stated him, as he had done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> after this, are priuatly sent for by the king, who giues them all comfort, and incourages them against <hi>Monfort,</hi> whom yet he would againe send ouer to his charge, but with clipt winges, whereby both himselfe and they might the better be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on him, and withall confirmes the state of <hi>Gascoigne</hi> to his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> whom he promised them shortly to send ouer, wherwith they are much pleased, and after they had done their homage to the Prince, depart. The effect of this confused, and ill-packt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Monfort</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his charge.</note> businesse was such, as all indirect courses produce. <hi>Monfort</hi> returnes in flames to plague the <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> and they in like manner him, but he by his great alliance in <hi>France</hi> drawes together such a power, as beyond expectation, hee ouer matches the <hi>Gascoigne</hi> whose Estates he exposes to spoyle, and therewithall intertaines his great collected army. They againe send ouer their complaints, and vnlesse they were speedely relieued, they of force must put their country into some other hand that would protect them.</p>
               <p>And in this state stood <hi>Gascoigne</hi> now at the time of this last Parliament, whither the King, vpon this late supply granted (omitting his Easterne enterprise) goes with <note place="margin">The K. goes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into <hi>Gasc.</hi> with 300. great ships.</note> 300. Sayle of great ships and lands at <hi>Burdeux</hi> in August, <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 38. hauing first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Simon M.</hi> from the gouernment there, and makes voyde his Charter by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Monfort</hi> retyres from thence, and is offred intertaynment by the <hi>French,</hi> but refuses it. Before Winter the King had in some fort appeased the <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> and taken in such Castles, as had long held out against him, and the late gouernour. For they hauing put themselues vnder the protection of the King of Spaine; who being so <note place="margin">Alliance with the King of Spaine.</note> neere a neighbour, and the discontents and factions of the country strong, caused the King of England with more hast, and care to looke to his worke, and the rather for that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> pretended title to Aquitaine; of whom, that King <hi>Henry</hi> might be the more secure, he sends to treate with him of a mariage betwixt Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1254. Anno. Reg. 38.</note> and his Sister <hi>Elionor,</hi> wherevnto the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> willingly consents.</p>
               <p>The King of England keeps his Christmas at <hi>Burdeux.</hi> The Queene sends him a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares guift of 500. Markes, and the next Sommer, with the Prince, goes ouer vnto him. The marriage is solemnised at <hi>Burgos,</hi> where the king of Spain knights the Prince, <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ed.</hi> marries <hi>Elio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> sister to the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </note> and by his Charter quits his claime to <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> for him, and his successors for euer. The king of England inuestes the Prince, and his Wife therein, and besides giues vnto him <hi>Ireland, Wales, Bristow, Stanford, and Grantham.</hi> This businesse dispatched, the king prepares to returne, hauing consumed all whatsoeuer hee could get in this iourny, which, with the other two hee had before made, was reckned to haue cost him 27.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7690:79"/>
hundred thousand pounds, and was said to be more then all the Lands he had there (should they be sold) were worth, which, when he was told, he willed it might not be reuealed in publike to his disgrace.</p>
               <p>Now in regard of danger by sea hee obtaines leaue of the King of France (lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> comes to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris with 1000 horse, is teast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the K. of France.</note> from Captiuity) to passe through his Country, and comes to <hi>Paris</hi> with a 1000 horse, besides Sumpters, and Carts, where he stayes 8 daies, is sumptuously feasted, and with as great magnificence feasts the King of <hi>France.</hi> This meeting, in regard of the two Queens, Sisters, and their other two Sisters the Countesse of Cornwall, and Prouince (who were likewise afterward, Queenes) was made the more triumphant, and splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous. The King about Christmas ariues in England, and the first that payde for his comming home, were the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The <hi>Londoners</hi> presenting him with <note place="margin">He returnes into England fines the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners.</note> 100 pounds were returned without thanks: then being perswaded that plate would be better welcome, they bestow 200 pounds in a faire vessell: that had some thankes, but yet serued not the turne. An offence is found, about the escaping of a prisoner for which they pay 3000 Marks. Now complaines hee of his debts, which hee saies to bee 300 thousand Marks, and how his owne meanes was deminished by the preferment of the Prince, who carried away 15 thousand Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> and mony must be had how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer. First he begins to serue his present turne with loanes, and borowes great sums of the Earle of Cornwall, vpon pawne, &amp; after the King had wrung what he could from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he lets them out to farme to this rich Earle to make the best of them.</p>
               <p>Then a Parliament is called in Easter Terme, which yeelds nothing but returnes of <note place="margin">1257. Anno. Reg. 41.</note> greeuances, and complaints of breach of Charter, with requiting their former preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rights in electing the Iusticiar, Chancellor and Treasurer. After much debate to no purpose, the Parliament is prorogued til <hi>Michelmas</hi> after, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewise the Kings moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for money is disappointed, by reason of the absence of many Peeres being not, as <note place="margin">16. Parliament adiourned.</note> was alledged, sommoned according to the Tenor of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> New occasions of charge, and dislike arise. <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of Sauoy, the Queenes brother, hath warres with the City of <hi>Thuren,</hi> and must be supplied by the King, and Queene, and his brother <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The elect Bishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> brother to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> with other great men, come ouer, lie at the Kings charge, and are presented with great gifts. Shortly after, <hi>Elionor</hi> the Princes wife ariues with a multitude of Spaniards, and she must be met, and receiued by the Londoners in sumptuous manner; and her <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 4.</note> people after many feastings returned home with presents. The Pope sends the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bononia</hi> with a Ring of inuestiture, to <hi>Edmond</hi> the Kings second sonne for the Kingdome of <hi>Sicile</hi> (with the hope of which Kingdome his Predicessor <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4 <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edmond</hi> the Kings second sonne is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Kingdome of Sicile.</note> had before deluded the King himselfe) and hee is returned with a great reward. Then comes <hi>Rustandus</hi> with powre to collect the Tenth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the vse of the Pope and the King, and also to absolue him from his Oath for the Holy Warre: so that hee would come to distroy <hi>Manfred</hi> sonne to the Emperot <hi>Frederick,</hi> now in possession of the Kingdome of <hi>Sicile</hi> and <hi>Apulia.</hi> And this man likewise hath great guifts bestowed on him, besides a rich prebend in Yorke: but yet hee obtained not, what he came for, of the Clergie, who protested rather to loose their liues and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, then to yeeld either to the will of the Pope or the King, who they said, <hi>were as the Shepheard, and the Wolfe combined to macerat the flocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope sent likewise to borow of the Earle of <hi>Cornwall</hi> 500 Marks, in regard of his Nephewes preferment to the Kingdom of <hi>Sicile,</hi> but the Earle refused it, saying, <hi>he would not lend his mony to one on whom hee could not distraine.</hi> So this proiect came to nothing, though all meanes were vsed to draw it on. Newes was spred that <hi>Manfreds</hi> forces were vrterly defeated, and himselfe either slaine or taken prisoner: wherewith the King is so much ioyed as he presently vowes with all speed to make an expedition thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and giues his sonne <hi>Edmond</hi> no other title but King of <hi>Sicile.</hi> This vaine hope had already, by the cunning of the Popes inwrapt him in obligations, of a hundred and fifty thousand Markes. But shortly after this newes prooues false, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie is notified. <hi>Manfred</hi> is victorious, and the Popes powre defeated by those of <hi>Apulia,</hi> who tooke such indignation that the Pope should giue awaie their Country
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7690:80"/>
(without their consent) to an vnknowne Stranger, as with all their maine powre they ioyne to establish <hi>Manfred,</hi> who is now found to bee the legitimate sonne of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and confirmed in his right, which a strong sword will make howsoeuer.</p>
               <p>The King keepes his Christmas at Winchester, where the Merchants of Gascoigne <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Merchants of Gascoigne.</note> hauing their wines taken from them, by the Kings Officers, without due satisfaction, complaine to the Prince, being now their Lord, and shew him, <hi>How they were better to trade with</hi> Sarazins <hi>and</hi> Infidels <hi>then thus to be vsed here, as they were.</hi> The Prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses him to his father, and craues redresse herein. but the Officers hauing beene with <note place="margin">An ill Office of Officers.</note> the K. before to preuent the clamors of the <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> and telling him, <hi>how they falsely exclayme, relying wholly vpon the Princes fauor, who tooke vpon him their vniust cause (and that there ought to be but one in</hi> England, <hi>to whom the ordring of Iustice appertayned</hi>) put him into so great a rage with the Prince, as he breakes out into these words. <hi>See now my bloud, and mine owne bowells impugne mee, behold my sonne, as my brother hath done, is bent to afflict mee, the times of my grandfather</hi> Henry <hi>the second are againe renued, what will become of vs?</hi> but this passion being allayed by Councell, he dissembles the matter, and giues order that these iniuries should bee redressed. But yet the Prince for more caution, amplyfing his trayne rode with 200 horse. So easily are iealosies, by euill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters infused into Kings, who are of themselues too apprehensiue in that kinde, being a thing that soone turnes the bloud.</p>
               <p>And now to adde to the misery of these times, there are new mischiefes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the insolence of the Seruants of the Prince, who being himselfe young, was attended by many youthfull and violent spirits, many strangers, and men without meanes, who, wheresoeuer he went, made spoyle, and tooke for their owne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <note place="margin">Insolencies committed by the Princes seruants.</note> they could fasten on, to the extreame vexation of the subiect. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port how this Prince meeting a young man trauayling on the way caused one of his eares to bee cut off, and one of his eyes put out: which foule act, made many to suspect his disposition, and what hee would proue here after. And indeed, had hee not beene indued with an innated Noblenesse of Nature (which, with his long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in trauaile and great actions ouercame the Vices, the loosenesse of the time, and his owne breeding contracted) hee might haue prooued as bad, as any other. For vnlesse Princes of themselues, by instinction from aboue bee not indued with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall goodnesse, they shall gaine little by their education, wherein they are rather shewed what they are, then what they should be: and are apter to learne to know their greatnesse, then themselues: being euer soothed in all whatsoeuer they doe.</p>
               <p>These youthfull actions of this Prince, with his ryotous trayne (which are said to be more rauenous, then those which <hi>Louys</hi> brought out of <hi>France</hi> with him) put out the Welsh (of whom he had now the gouernment) into open act of rebellion, and to make spoyle of the English, as his did ofthem: whereupon he craues meanes of his father, the Queene, and his Vncle <hi>Richard</hi> to suppresse them. But all was vented already, the Kings treasure was gone ouer the Alpes, Earle <hi>Richard</hi> had lent more then hee could get in, and the Earle of Sauoy in his warres had spent that of the Queenes.</p>
               <p>The King is still at his shifts to supply his euerlasting necessities. Now he comes himselfe into his Exschequer, and, with his owne voyce pronounced <hi>That euery Shriefe, which appeared not yearely in the Octaues of Saint</hi> Michel, <hi>with his money, as well of his Farmes as amercements and other dues: for the first day should be amerced fiue Markes for the second, ten, for the third fifteene, for the fourth, to bee redeemed at the Kings pleasure. In like sort, that all Cities and Freedoms which answere by their Bayliffes, vpon the same default should bee amerced, and the fourth day to loose their freedomes. Besides euery Shriefe, through out</hi> England <hi>is amerced in fiue Markes for that they did not distraine within their Counties vpon whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer held 10 pound land</hi> per annum, <hi>and came not to be made knight, or freed by the King.</hi> Then falls he to the examination of measures for Wine and Ale, for Bushels and Weights, which likewise brought in some small thing, and euery yeare commonly hath one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell or other to the Londoners, and gets some thing of them.</p>
               <p>But now there fell out 2 businesse that intertayned some time, and gaue occasion to amuze the world with conceipts of some great aduantage and honor to the Kingd. by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7690:80"/>
the Election of <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cornewall to bee King of Romans, which was (as our <note place="margin">The Earle of Cornwall Elected King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> Writers say) by the generall consent of all the Electors, and by them is he sent for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Crowne: the matter is here debated in Councell. Some, who thought his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, necessary to sway businesses in the Kingdome, were vnwilling, and diswade him by example of the miserable distruction of two lately elected to that dignity, <hi>Henry</hi> the Lantgraue of <hi>Turing,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earle of Holland: but others, and especially the King (who was willing to be rid of him, as one he had often found too great for a subiect: and being a King abroad hee might make vse of him) perswades him to take it vpon him, which he is easily (though seeming otherwise) induced to doe.</p>
               <p>But the Germaine Writers (who are best witnesses of their owne affaires) declare how after the murther of the Earle of Holland, the Electors were deuided about the choyce of a successor. Some stiffe to vphold their auncient Custome in Electing one of their owne Country, which was more naturall. Others, of a stranger, who might better support their declyning State; which was more politike. Long were the conflicts of their Councells: hereupon in the end, their voyces who stood for strangers were most, but they likewise disagreed among themselues, some would haue <hi>Richard,</hi> brother to the King of England, others <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Spain, both of them not only contending who should haue it, but who should giue most to buy it: in the end <hi>Richard</hi> being nerest at <note place="margin">

Thus they deliuer it.</p>
               <p>But before the Earle departed out of England, the Earle of Glocester, and Sir <hi>Iohn Mansel,</hi> were sent into Germany to sound their affections, and how they stood dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards him. They returne well perswaded of the businesse, and shortly after the Archbishop of Cologne comes to conduct him ouer, on whom, the Earle bestowes 500 Markes towards his charges, and a rich Miter set with precious stones. This Prince the Earle of Cornwall is reported able to dispend 100 Markes a day for tenne yeares, besides his reuenues in England.</p>
               <p>The French, and especially the King of Spaine are much displeased with this aduancement, complayning to the Pope and the King of England of the supplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earle of <hi>Cornewal. Spaine</hi> pretending to haue beene first elected, but being, it seemes a Philosopher, and studious in the Mathematikes (which he first reuiude in Europe) he was drawing Lines, when he should haue drawne out his purse, and so came preuented of his hopes.</p>
               <p>About the time of the departure of Earle <hi>Richard</hi> (in the iollity of the Kingdome <note place="margin">1257. Anno. Reg. 41.</note> vpon this new promotion, &amp; to set forward another) the King calls a Parliament, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (bringing forth his sonne <hi>Edmond,</hi> clad in an <hi>Apulian</hi> habit) he vses these words: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my good Subiects, here my sonne</hi> Edmond <hi>whom God of his grace hath called to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of regall excellencie, how fitting and worthy is he the fauour of you all, and how inhumane, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">15. Parliament</note> 
                  <hi>tyranous were he who (in so important a necessity) would deny him Councell, and ayde?</hi> And then shewes them, how by the aduice and benignity of the Pope, &amp; the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he had for attayning the Kingdom of <hi>Sicile</hi> bound himselfe, vnder Couenant of loosing his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in the sum of 140 thousand Markes. Moreouer, how he had obtayned the Tenth of the Clergy, for 3 yeares to come, of all their benefices to be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated according to the new rate, without deduction of expences vnlesse very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: besides their first fruits likewise for 3 yeares. Which declaration, how pleasing it <note place="margin">52 thousand Markes, vpon conditions promised by the Clergie.</note> was to the Clergie, may be iudged by their former grudgings. Notwithstanding, after they had made their pittifull excuses, in regard of their pouerty, they promised vpon the vsuall condition of <hi>Magna Charta &amp;c.</hi> so often sworne, bought and redeemed, to giue him 52 thousand Markes, but this satisfied him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:7690:81"/>The next yeare after is another Parliament at London wherin, vpon the Kings pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <note place="margin">1258. Anno. Reg. 42.</note> them again, for means to pay his debts to the Pope, the Lords tell him plainly: <hi>they will not yeeld to pay him any thing. And if vnaduisedly he without their consents, and councell bought the Kingdome of</hi> Sicile, <hi>and had been deceiued, he should impute it to his owne imbecillity, &amp; been instructed by the example of his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t brother, who, when the same Kingdom was offred vnto him by Albert the Popes Agent, absolutely refused it in regard it lay so farre off; So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations betweene: the cauills of the Popes: the infidelitie of the people: and the powre of the pretender &amp;c.</hi> Then repeate they their owne greeuances, <hi>the breach of his promises contemning both the keyes of the Church, and the Charter he had solemnly sworne to obserue: the insolence of his brethren, and other Strangers, against whom, by his order, no Writ was to passe out of the Chancerie, for any cause what soeuer: How their pride was intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able especially that of</hi> William de Valence, <hi>who, most reproachfully had giuen the lie to the Earle of</hi> Leicester, <hi>for which he could not be righted vpon his complaint: How they abounded all in riches, and himselfe was so poore, as hee could not represse the small forces of the</hi> Welsh <hi>that wasted his Country, but going the last yeare against them, and effecting nothing, returned with dishonour.</hi> The King hearing this (as he was apt vpon rebukes soundly vrged to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and his owne necessities constrayning him thereunto) humbles himselfe, and tells them: <hi>how he had often by ill councell beene seduced, and promises by his oath, which he takes on the tombe of Saint</hi> Edward, <hi>to reforme all these errors.</hi> But the Lords not knowing how to hold their euer-changing Proteus (saith <hi>Paris</hi>) in regard the businesse was difficult, get the Parliament to be adiourned till Saint <hi>Barnabas</hi> day, and then to assemble at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. In the meane time the Earles <hi>Glocester, Leicester, Hereford,</hi> the Earle Mareschall <hi>Bigod, Spencer</hi> and other great men confederate, and prouide by strength to effect their desires. Whilst the King put to his shifts to obtaine money, gets the Abbot of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, vpon promise of high preferment to put his Seale and that of his Couent to a deed obligatorie, as a surety sor three hundred Markes, that by his example hee might draw on others to doe the like. Sending his trustie Counsaylors, and Clerke <hi>Simon Passeleue</hi> abroade with his Letters, and this Deede vnto other Monasteries. But <hi>Passeleue,</hi> notwithstanding all the dilligence and skill hee could vse, by threates or otherwise: telling them, <hi>how all they had came from the benignitie of Kings, and how their Soueraigne was Lord of all they had,</hi> they flatly refuse to yeelde to any such Deede. <hi>Saying, they acknowledged the King to bee Lord of all they had, but so, as to defend, not to distroy the same.</hi> And thus he comes likewise disappoynted in this proiect.</p>
               <p>The Prince, who likewise must participate in the wants of his father, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uien <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and other townes to <hi>William de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

               <p>But now comes assembled the Parliament at Oxford, and in a hot season (the worst time for consultation) and here burst out that great impostume of discontent so long in gathering. The trayne which the Lords brought with them, was pretended to bee for some exploit against the Welsh, vpon the end of the Parliament: and their securing the ports, to preuent forrainers, but the taking order for keeping of the Gates of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and their Oathes and Hands giuen to each other, shewed that they were prepared to make the day theirs. Here they beginne with the expostulation of the former Liberties, and require the obseruation thereof according vnto the Oathes, <note place="margin">The Barons expostulate for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberties.</note> and Orders formerly made. The Chiefe Iusticiar, Chancellor, and Treasorer to be ordayned by publike choice: The 24 Conseruators, of the Kingdome to bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, 12 by the Election of the Lords, and 12 by the King, with whatsoeuer else made for their owne imagined security. The King seeing their strength, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they required these things, sweares againe solemnly to the confirmation of them, and causes the Prince to take the same Oath.</p>
               <p>But the Lords left not here, the Kings brethren, the <hi>Poictouines</hi> and other Strangers
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7690:81"/>
must be presently removed, and the Kingdome cleered of them, and this they would haue all the Peeres of the Land sworne to see done. Heere they found some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in the Prince, the Earle <hi>Warrein</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> eldest sonne to <hi>Richard</hi> now King of Romanes, the last refusing to take his Oath without leaue of his father; they plainely <note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Poictouines</hi> retyring to <hi>Bolongne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> send to King <hi>Louys</hi> to craue safe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage <note place="margin">Mat.

And as they whom Enuie tumbles downe from high places, shall be sure euer to haue all the thrusts possible to set them headlong into disgrace with the world, so now the death and sicknesse of diuerse great men and others, happening in <hi>England</hi> soone after this fatall Parlement, is imputed to poysons supposed to haue been prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by those Gentlemen. The Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> in a sicknesse sodainely lost his haire, his teeth, his nailes: And his brother hardly escaped death, which made many to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their nearest seruants and their Cookes. <hi>Walter Scotny</hi> the Earles Steward being one, is strictly examined, committed to prison, and after without confession executed (vpon presumptions) at <hi>Winchester. Elias</hi> a conuerted Iew, is said to haue confessed, that in his house the poyson was confected, but it was when he was a Diuell, not a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Any thing in the prosecution of malice serues the turne. Euery man that had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any wrong by those great men, now put vp their complaints, and are heard to the agrauation of their insolence and iniustice. <hi>Guido de Rochfort a Poictouin;</hi> to whom the King had giuen the Castle of <hi>Rochester,</hi> is banished, and all his goods confiscat. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Bussey</hi> Steward to <hi>William de Valence</hi> is committed to the Towre of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; most reprochfully vsed, as an especiall minister of his Maisters insolencies. <hi>Richard Gray</hi> whom the Lords had made Captain of the Castle of <hi>Douer,</hi> is set to intercept whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Poictouines</hi> conuayed that way out of <hi>England,</hi> and much treasure of theirs, and the elect of <hi>Winchester</hi> is by him there taken: besides great sums committed to the new Temple are found out, and seised into the kings hands. And as vsually in such heates much wrong is committed in these prosecutions of wrongs. But now (as an amuza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to make the ill gouerned people thinke they are not forgotten) the new chiefe Iusticiar <hi>Hugh Bigod</hi> brother to the Earle Mareschall (chosen this last Parlement by publique voyce) procures that foure Knights in euery shire should enquire of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the poore done by great men, &amp; vnder their hands, and seales certifie the same, by a certaine day to the Baronage, that redresse might be made. Moreouer, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was taken that <hi>from thence forth, no man should giue any thing (besides prouisions) for iustice, or to hinder the same, and both the corrupter and corrupted to bee grieuously punished.</hi> Notwithstanding this pretended care of the publike it is noted by the writers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that time, <hi>how the Lords inforced the seruices of the Kings tenants which dwelt neare them, and were</hi> totidem tyranni: <hi>how they furnished the especiall fortresses of the kingdom with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Regist. in Scace. William Rish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angar.</note> 
                  <hi>Guardians of their owne, sworne to the Common state, and tooke the like assurance of all Shirifs, Baylifes, Coroners, &amp; other publike ministers, searching the behauiour of many by strict commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vpon oath.</hi> And to make their cause the more popular, it was rumored that the <hi>Kings necessitie must be repayred out of the Estates of his people, and how he must not want whilst they had it,</hi> whereupon the King sends forth proclamation: <hi>How certain malicious persons had falsly and seditionsly reported, that he ment vnlawfully to charge his Subiects, and subuert the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdom, and by these subtile suggestions altogether false, auerted</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:7690:82"/>
the hearts of his people from him; and therefore desires them not to giue credit to such pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for that hee was ready to defend all Rights an Customes due vnto them, and that they might rest of this secured, he caused of his freewill his letters to be made Patents.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Monfort, Glocester</hi> and <hi>Spencer,</hi> who had by the late institution of the 24 Conservators, drawne the intire managing of the Kingdome into their hands, inforce <note place="margin">1258. Anno. Reg. 42.</note> the King to call the Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> where the Authority of the 24 is delivered vnto themselues, and order taken that three at the least, should attend in the Court, to dispose of the custodie of Castles, and other businesses of the Kingdome, of the <note place="margin">18. <hi>Parlement at</hi> London. Ordinat. inter Record. Civil. Lond.</note> Chancellor, Chiefe Iusticiar, and Treasorer, and of all Officers great and small. And heere they binde the King to loose to them their Legall obedience whensoever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed his Charter.</p>
               <p>In this State stood the Kingdome, when intelligence was given to the Lords that <note place="margin">Liceat omnibus de Regno nostro contra nos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgere, &amp; ad gravamen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum open &amp; operam dare, ac si nobis in nullo tenerentur Chart. Orig. sub Sigillo.</note> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>Romans</hi> had a purpose to come ouer into <hi>England,</hi> which made them greatly to suspect (being ignorant of the occasion) least he were sent for by the King to come with power to subvert them, by the example of King <hi>Iohn.</hi> Whereupon they send to know the cause of his comming, and to require of him an Oath before hee should land, not to preiudice the now established orders of the Kingdome: which he sternely refuses to do, saying: <hi>Hee had no Peere in</hi> England, <hi>being the sonne and brother of a King, and was aboue their power: and if they would haue reformed the Kingdom, they ought first to haue sent for him, and not so presumptuously attempted a businesse of so high a Nature.</hi> The Lords vpon returne of this answere sends presently to guard the Ports, and come strongly to the Coast, prepared to incounter him if occasion were offered. But finding <note place="margin">The Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an oath of him.</note> his traine small, accompanyed onely with his Queene, two <hi>German</hi> Earles, and eight Knights, they vpon his promise to take their propounded oath receiue him to land: but would neither permit the King (who came thither likewise to meete him) nor himselfe to enter into <hi>Dover</hi> Castle. At <hi>Canterbury</hi> they bring him into the Chapter house, where the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> standing forth in the middest, calls out the Earle, not by the name of King, but <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> who in reverent manner comming forth, takes his Oath ministred in this manner.</p>
               <p>Heare all men, that I <hi>Kichard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> do heere sweare vpon the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists <note place="margin">The Oath of the King of Romanes.</note> that I shall bee faithfull, and dilligent to reforme with you the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> hitherto by the Councell of wicked persons overmuch disorded, bee an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall coadiutor to expell the rebels and disturbers of the same, and this Oath will inviolably obserue vnder paine of loosing all the Land I haue in <hi>England:</hi> so helpe mee God.</p>
               <p>In this manner deale the Lords to binde this great Earle vnto them, supposing his power to haue beene more then it was, which at length they found to be nothing but an Ayrie Title: for having consumed all that mighty substance abroad, in two yeares (which with great frugality, had beene many in gathering) he returnes in this manner home, poore and forsaken by the <hi>Germans,</hi> without any other meanes to trust vnto, but onely what he had in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding vpon his returne the King takes heart, and seekes all meanes to vindicate his power, dispatching first messengers secretly to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be absolued from <note place="margin">1259. Anno. Reg. 44.</note> his inforced Oath, then sends into <hi>Scotland</hi> to the King, and the Queene his daughter for aydes to be ready vpon his occasions. And to haue the more assurance of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and be freed from forraine businesse, he makes an absolute resignation of whatsoever right he had to the Duchy of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and the Earledomes of <hi>Aniou,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes his right to <hi>Normandy,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Poictou, Tourene,</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> in regard whereof the King of <hi>France</hi> giues him three hundred thousand pounds (some say crownes) of <hi>Aniouine</hi> money, and grants him to enioy all <hi>Guien</hi> beyond the river <hi>Garoune,</hi> all the Country of <hi>Xantonge</hi> to the river of <note place="margin">1261.

                  <hi>Charentè,</hi> the Countries of <hi>Limosin,</hi> and <hi>Quercy</hi> for him and his successors, doing their Homage, and Fealty to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> as a Duke of <hi>Aquitayne,</hi> and a Peere of that kingdome,</p>
               <p>The Lords likewise on the other side seeke to strengthen their association, and hold in each other to their Oathes, and observation of their orders, which was hard to do:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7690:82"/>
for consisting of manifold dispositions there was daily wauering, sometimes Pikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, in so much as the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> (the chiefe man that kept the fire of that saction in) told the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> finding him staggering, <hi>that hee cared not to liue with such men, whom he found so mutable and vncertaine, for said he, my Lord of</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, <note place="margin">The Lords combine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the K.</note> 
                  <hi>as you are more eminent, so are you more bound to what you haue vndertaken for the good of the kingdome.</hi> And as he incensed others, so had he those that animated him, as <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Kobert,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> who inioyned him vpon remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">W.

               </p>
               <p>But now many being the temptations, many are drawne away from their side, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after the sentence giuen against them by the King of <hi>France</hi> (made Arbitor of the quarrell) who yet though hee condemned the prouisions of Oxford, allowed the <note place="margin">1262. An. Reg. 46.</note> confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of King <hi>Iohns</hi> Charter, by which distinction he left the matter as he found it, for those prouisions (as the Lords pretended) were grounded vpon that Charter. Howsoeuer, his sentence much aduantaged the King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; made many to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with their Oath, and leaue their party. Amongst whom was <hi>Henry</hi> Sonne to the Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> (on whom the Prince had bestowed the Honour of Tyckhill) who comming to the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> told him, hee would not be against his Father, the King, nor his allyes: but said he, my Lord, I will neuer beare Armes against you, and <note place="margin">1263. Anno. Reg. 47.</note> therefore I craue leaue to depart. The Earle cheerfully replies: my Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> I am not <hi>sorry for your departure, but for your inconstancie, go, returne with your armes, I feare them not at all.</hi> About the same time <hi>Roger de Clifford, Roger de Leiborn, Hamo I Strange,</hi> and many other (wonne with gifts) depart from the Barons.</p>
               <p>Shortly after <hi>Roger de Mortimer</hi> of the Kings part breakes into open act of hostility, makes spoyle of the lands of the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who had now combined himselfe with <hi>Llewellin</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and had sent forces to inuade the lands of <hi>Mortimer</hi> in <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the warres.</note> those parts. And here the sword is first drawne in this quarrell, about three yeares after the Parlement at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Prince takes part with <hi>Mortimer,</hi> surprises the Castle of <hi>Brecknock</hi> with other places of strength which hee deliuers to his custodie. The Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> recouers the towne and Castle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> constraines the Citizens to pay a thousand pounds for their redemption, goes with an Army to <hi>Worcester</hi> possesses him of the Castle, thence to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and so comes about to the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> subdues the same, and growes very powerfull.</p>
               <p>The King, doubting his approch to London (being not yet ready for him) workes so as a mediation of peace is made and agreed vpon these conditions. <hi>That all the Castles</hi>

                  <hi>of the King should be deliuered the keeping of the Barons, the Prouisions of Oxford should bee inuiolably obserued. All strangers by a certaine time should auoide the Kingdome, except such as by a generall consent should be held faithfull, and profitable for the same.</hi> Here was a little pause, which seemes was but a breathing for a greater rage. The Prince had fortified <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, victualled, and therein placed strangers to defend it, and himselfe marches to the towne of <hi>Bristow,</hi> where, in a contention between the Cittizens, and his people being put to the worse, hee seends for the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> (an especiall partaker of the Barons) to protect, &amp; conduct him back. When he comes neare <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> he gets into the Castle which the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> was going to besiege, &amp; being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Kingston,</hi> the Prince meets him to treat of peace, which the Earle refuses and laies siege to the Castle which was rendred vnto him, the strangers turned out &amp; sent home into <hi>France,</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:7690:83"/>The Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> in the meane time, drawes towards <hi>London</hi> to recouer and make good that part, as of chiefest importance, and seekes to secure <hi>Kent</hi> with the Ports. Which hastes the King to stop his proceeding, &amp; succour the Castle of <hi>Rochester</hi> besieged.</p>
               <p>Successe, and authority now growes strong on this side, in so much as the Earles of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and <hi>Glocester</hi> in behalfe of themselues, and their party write to the King, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly protesting their loyalty, <hi>and how they opposed onely against such as were enemies to him and the Kingdome, and had belyed them.</hi> The King returnes answere, <hi>how themselues were the perturbers of him and his siate: enemies to his person, and sought his and the Kingdomes destruction, and therefore defies them.</hi> The Prince, and the Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> send like wise <note place="margin">The Barons mediate a peace.</note> their letters of defiance vnto them. The Barons notwithstanding doubtfull of their strength, or vnwilling to put it to the hazard of a Battaile, mediate a peace, &amp; send the Bishops of London, and Worcester with an offer of 30 thousand Markes to the King, for damages done in these warres, <hi>So that the statutes of</hi> Oxford <hi>might bee obserued:</hi> which yeeldingnes, the other side supposing to argue their debility, made them the more neglectiue, and securer of their power, which commonly brings the weaker side (more watchfull of aduantages) to haue the better.</p>
               <p>The Earle, seeing no other meanes but to put it to a day (being a man skilfull in his worke) takes his time to be earlier ready then was expected, and supplies his want of hands with his wit, placing on the side of a hill nere <hi>Lewys,</hi> where this battaile was <note place="margin">The battaile of <hi>Lewys.</hi>
                  </note> fought, certaine ensignes without men in such sort, as they might seeme a farre of to be squadrons of succors, to second those he brought to the incounter, whom he caused all to weare white-crosses, both for their owne notice, and the signification of his cause, which he would haue to be for Iustice. Here the fortune of the day was his, the King, the Prince, the Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> and his sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arundell, Hereford,</hi> and all the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords are his prisoners.

               <p>All this yeare, and halfe of the other, is <hi>Simon Monfort</hi> in possession of his prisoners: the King he carries about with him to countenance his actions, till he had gotten in all <note place="margin">1265.

And now (as it vsually falls out in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where all must be pleased or else the knot will dissolue) debate arises betweene the Earles of <hi>Leicester,</hi> &amp; <hi>Glocester</hi> about their diuidend, according to their agreement. <hi>Leicester</hi> (as fortune makes men to forget themselues) is taxed <hi>to doe more for his owne particular, then the common good: to take to himselfe the benifit and disposition of the Kings</hi>

               <p>The reuolt of this Earle brought many hands to the Prince, whereby many peeces of strength are regained both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> The Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> to stop the proceeding of this mighty growing Prince (being now with his Army about <hi>Worcester</hi>) imbattailes in a plaine neere <hi>Euesham</hi> to encounter him: and noting the manner of the approch of his Army, said to those about him: <hi>these men come brauely on, they learnt it not of themselues, but of me. And seeing himselfe likely to be beset, and ouer-laid with numbers, aduised his friends</hi> Hugh Spencer, Ralph Basser, <hi>and others to shift for themselues,</hi> which when he saw they refused to doe: then said he, <hi>let vs commit our soules to God, for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

                  <hi>are theirs,</hi> and so vndertaking the mayne waight of the Battaile, perished vnder it. And with him are slaine his Sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> eleuen other Barons with many thousands of common souldiers. At the instant of his death, there hapned so terrible a thunder, lightning, and darknesse, as it gaue them as much horror as their hideous work.</p>
               <p>And so ends <hi>Monfort</hi> this great Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> too great for a subiect, which had
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7690:83"/>
hee not beene, he might haue beene numbred amongst the worthiest of his time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, the people which honored, and followed him in his life, would (vpon the fame of his miracles) haue worshipped him for a Saint after his death, but it would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Kings.</p>
               <p>And here this Battaile deliuers the Captiue King, (but yet with the losse of some of his owne as well as his subiects bloud, by a wound casually receiued therein) and rid him of his Iaylor <hi>Monfort,</hi> whom he hated &amp; had long feared more then any man liuing, as himselfe confessed vpon this accident: passing one day (shortly after the Parliament at Oxford) vpon Thames, there hapned a sodaine clap of thunder, wherewith the King was much affrighted and willed presently to be set on shore at the next landing, <note place="margin">1266. Anno. Reg. 50.</note> which was at <hi>Duresme</hi> house, where <hi>Monfort</hi> then lay, who seeing the King ariuing hastes downe to meete him, and perceiuing him to be troubled at the storme, said, <hi>that hee needed not now to feare, the daunger was past. No, Monfort, said the King, I feare thee, more then I doe all the Thunder and tempest of the World.</hi> And now the King with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Prince, the redeemer of him, and the Kingdome, repaires to Winchester, <note place="margin">18 Parliament held at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</note> where a Parliament is conuoked, and all who adhered to <hi>Simon Monfort,</hi> are disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their estates conferred on others, at the Kings pleasure. The Londoners haue their liberties taken from them, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Guy de Monfort,</hi> Sonnes of the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> with the disinherited Barons and others who escaped the Battaile of <hi>Euesham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All who tooke part with <hi>Monfort</hi> disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited.</note> take, and defend the Isle of Ely. The Castle of Killing worth defended by the seruants of the late Earle, although it were in the heart of the Kingdome, endured the Seige of halfe a yeare against the King and his Army: in the end their victualls fayling they yeeld <hi>vpon condition to depart, their liues, members, and goods saued.</hi> And it is worthy the note <hi>that we find no exccution of bloud, except in open Battaile, in all these combustions, or any noble man to dye on a Skaffold, either in this Kings raigne, or any other since</hi> William <hi>the first, which is now almost 300 yeares.</hi> Onely in <hi>Anno</hi> 26. of this King, <hi>William Marisc,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Geffrey Marsc</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being condcmned of Piracie, and treason was hanged, beheaded, and quartered: and is the first example of that kind of punishment we finde in our Histories.</p>
               <p>After the Parliament at Winchester the King goes with an army against the disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited Barons, and their partakers, which were many resolute, and desperate persons strongly fastned together. And being at Northampton, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Guy de Monfort,</hi> by mediation of friends, and promises of fauor came in and submitted themselues to the King, who, at the earnest suite of the Earle of Cornwall their Vnkle and the Lord <hi>Phillip Basset,</hi> had restored them to their Estates, but for <hi>Glocester,</hi> and others who (doubting their spirits) wrought to hold them downe where their fortune had layd them. In so much as they were faine in the end to flye the Kingdome, and worke their fortunes other where, which they did, the younger in Italy, the Elder in France: <hi>where they were propagators of two great Famelies.</hi> Their mother was banished shortly after the battaile of <hi>Euesham. A Lady of eminent note, the daughter and sister to a King, nocent onely by her fortune, who from the Coronet of miserable glory, betooke her to the vaile of quiet piety, and dyed a Nun at Montarges in France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three yeares after this, the disinherited Barons held out in those fastnesses of the Kingdom where they could best defend themselues, made many excursions, and spoyles <note place="margin">Motions of peace made to the disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lords.</note> to the great charge and vexation of the King, at length motions, and conditions of render are proposed, wherein the Councell are deuided. <hi>Mortimer</hi> now an eminent man in grace, with others stated in the possessions of the disinhereted, are auers to any restoration, alledging it <hi>a great act of iniustice, for them to be forced to forgoe what the King</hi>

                  <hi>had for their paines, and fidelity bestowed on them, and the others iustly forfeited, and therefore would hold what they had.

This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed new pikes of displeasure, in so much as <hi>Glocester,</hi> who, conceiuing his turning, not so to serue his turne, as he expected, taking his time, againe changed foote: retires from the Court, refuses to come to the Kings Fcast on Saint <hi>Edwards</hi> day: sends messengers <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Glocest.</hi> revolt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Iohn de Warreine <hi>Earle of Surrey, and</hi> William de Valentia, <hi>are sent to perswade the Earle of</hi> Glocester (<hi>who had now leuied an army vpon the borders of Wales) to come, in faire manner to this Parliament, which he refuses to do, but yet thus much the Earles had of him vnder his hand, and seale:</hi> neuer to beare armes against the King, or his Sonne Edward, but to defend himselfe, and pursue Roger Mortimer, and other his enemies, <hi>for which he pretended to haue taken armes. The first demand in the Parliament was made by the King and the Legat;</hi> for a graunt of a Tenth of the Clergie for three yeares to come, and for the yeare past, so much as they gaue to the Barons for defending the Coasts against the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of strangers. <hi>Whereto they answere,</hi> that the warre was begun by vniust desires, which yet continues, and necessary it were to let passe so euill demands, and to treat of the peace of the Kingdome; to conuert the Parliament to the benefit thereof, and not to extort mony, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the land had beene so much distroyed by this warre, as it could hardly be euer recouered. <hi>2. Then was it required,</hi> that the Clergie might be taxed by lay men, according to the iust valew of what appertayned vnto them. <hi>They answere:</hi> it was no reason, but against all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that Lay men should inter meddle in collecting Tenths, which they would neuer consent vnto, but would haue the ancient taxation to stand. <hi>3. Then was it required,</hi> they should giue the Tenth of their Baronies and Lay Fee, according to the vtmost valew. <hi>They answere:</hi> themselues were impourished by attending the King in his expeditions, and their lands lay vntilld by reason of the warres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. Then it was required,</hi> that the Clergie should in lieu of a Tenth, giue amongst them 30. thousand Markes to discharge the Kings debts contracted for Sicilia, Calabria, and Apulia, <hi>They answere;</hi> they would giue nothing in regard all those taxations, and extorsions formerly made by the King were neuer conuerted to his owne, or the benefit of the Kingdome. <hi>5. All this being denied, demand is made,</hi> that all Clergie men that held Baronies, or other Lay Fee should personally serue in the Kings warres. <hi>They answere,</hi> they were not to fight with the materiall, but the spirituall sword, &amp;c. that their Baronies were giuen of meere almes, &amp;c. <hi>6. Then was it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> the whole Clergie should discharge the 9000. pounds, which the Bishops of Rochester, Bath, and the Abbot of westminster stood bound to the Popes Merchants for the Kings seruice at their being at the Court of Rome. <hi>They answere:</hi> they neuer consented to any such lone, and therefore were not bound to discharge it. <hi>7. Then the Legat, from the part of the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> that without delay predication should be made throughout the kingdome to incite men to take the Crosse for the Holy warre, <hi>wherevnto answere was made,</hi> that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the people of the Land were already consumed, by the sword, and that if they should vndertake this action, few or none would be leaft to defend the Kingdome, and that the Legat hereby shewed a desire to extirpat the natiues thereof and introduce strangers. <hi>8. Lastly it was vrged,</hi> that the Prelates were bound to yeeld to all the Kings demands by their oath at Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; where they swore to ayd him by all meanes possible they could. <hi>They answere,</hi> that when they tooke that oath, they vnderstood no other ayd, then spirituall, and holesome councell, <hi>So nothing was obtained but denyalls in this Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Legat, likewise imploies sollicitors to perswade the disherited</hi> LL. <hi>which held the Isle of</hi> Ely, to returne to the faith, and vnity of the Church, the peace of the King, according to the forme prouided at Couentry, for redeeming their inheritances from such as held them by guift from the King for 7. yeares profits, and to leaue of their robberies. <hi>The disherited returne answer to the Legat.</hi> First, that they held the faith, they receiued from their Catholicke Fathers, and their obedience to the Roman Church, as the head of all Christianity; but not to the auarice and willfull exaction of those who ought to gouerne the same. And how (their Predicessors whose heyres they were, hauing conquered this land by the sword) they held themselues vniustly dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. that it was against the Popes Mandat, they should be so delt withall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:7690:84"/>That they had formerly taken their Oath to defend the Kingdome and Holy Church, all the Prelats thundring the sentence of excommunication against such as withstood the same and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Oath they were prepared to spend their liues. And seeing they warred for the benefit of the Kingdome, and Holy Church, they were to sustaine their liues by the goods of their Enemies, who detained their Lands, which the Legat ought to cause to bee restored vnto them, that they might not be driuen to make depradation in that manner, which yet was not so great as was reported: for that many of the Kings and Princes followers made rodes, and committed great robberies which, to make them odious, were imputed, and giuen out to bee done by them, wherefore they wish the Legat to giue no credit to such reports: for if they should finde any such amongst them, they would themselues doe Iustice vpon them without delay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides they declare to the Legat,</hi> that hee had irreuerently eiected out of the Kingdome the Bishops, of <hi>Winchester, London</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> men circumspect and of deepe iudgement, whereby the Councell of the Kingdom was in great part weakned to the daunger therof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed him to looke to the reformation of the same: and that they might bee restored to their Lands without redemption. That the proutsions of <hi>Oxford</hi> might bee obserued. That they might haue Ostages deliuered them into the Island to hold the same peaceably for fiue yeares to come, untill they might perceiue how the King would performe his promises.</p>
               <p>Thus they treat, not like men whom their fortunes had layde on the ground, but as they had beene still standing: so much wrought either the opinion of their cause, or the hope of their party. But this stubbornesse so exasperates the King as the next yeare following, hee prepares a mighty Army, besets the Isle so that he shuts them vp, and Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> with bridges made on Boates enters the same in diuers places, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines them to yeeld. In the meane time the Earle of Glocester, with his army col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected on the borders of Wales to ayde them, marched to London where, by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens he was receiued: but the Legat who kept his residence in the Towre so preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">The Earle of Glocester re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</note> with him, as he againe renders himselfe to the King to whom hee was afterward reconciled, by the mediation of the King of Romans, and the Lord <hi>Philip Basset</hi> vpon forfeiture of twelue thousand Markes, if euer after he should raise any commotion.</p>
               <p>This effected, the King goes with an Army into Wales, against <hi>Lewellin,</hi> for ayding <hi>Simon Monfort</hi> and the Earle of Glocester, in their late attempts against him, but his wrath being by the guift of 32 thousand pounds sterling, appeased, peace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt them, and foure Cantreds, which had by right of war, been taken from him, restored.</p>
               <p>And here was an end of the first Barons Warres of <hi>England,</hi> wherein wee see what effects it wrought, how no side got but misery and vexation, whilst the one struggled to doe more then it should, and the other to doe lesse then it ought, they both had the worst, according to the usuall euents of such imbroylements.</p>
               <p>The next yeare after this appeasement, the Legat <hi>Ottobon</hi> signes with the <note place="margin">1269. Anno. Reg. 53.</note> Croissado both the Kings sonnes <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Edmond,</hi> the Earle of Glocester, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Noblemen induced to vndertake the Holy Warre by the sollicitation of him: and the King of France, who notwithstanding his former calamities indured in that action, would againe aduenture therein. So much either the desire of reuenge, with the <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Edw.</hi> his brother and others vndertake the Holy Warre.</note> recouery of his fame and honour, or the hope of enioying another World prouoked him to forgo this, and haste to his finall distruction. And for that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meanes for his present furnishment, this King of France lent him 30 thousand Markes, for which hee morgaged vnto him Gascoigny. An act, which subtler times would interpret to be rather of Policie then Piety, in this King to ingage in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and vpon so especiall a caution, a young stirring Prince, likely in his absence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle his Estate at home, and to draw him along in the same aduenture with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, without any desire otherwise, either of his company or ayde; considering the inconueniences that stung these seuerall Nations heretofore by their incompetabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in the same action: but here it were sinne to thinke they disguised their ends, or had other couerings for their designes then those through which they were seene; their spirits seeme to haue beene warmed with a Nobler flame.</p>
               <p>And now whilst this preparation is in hand, King <hi>Henry</hi> labours to establish the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7690:85"/>
Peace of the Kingdome, and reforme those excesses the warre had bred, causing by <note place="margin">21 Parliament at Marlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> proclamation <hi>stealth of Cattle to bee made a cryme Capitall,</hi> and the first that suffred for the same was one of Dunstable who had stolne twelue Oxen from the inhabitants of <hi>Colne,</hi> and being persued to <hi>Redburne</hi> was by the Bayliffe of Saint <hi>Albones</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings Proclamation condemned and beheaded. And the same yeare the King assembles his last Parliament at <hi>Marleborugh</hi> where the Statutes of that Title were inacted.</p>
               <p>Nere two yeares it seemes to haue beene after the vndertaking the Crosse before <note place="margin">1271. Anno. Reg. 55.</note> Prince <hi>Edward</hi> set forth, a time long ynough (if those resolutions would haue beene shaken) to haue bred an alteration of desire, but so strong was the current of this humour as no worldly respects could giue any the least stoppage thereunto. Otherwise a Prince so well acquainted with action, so well vnderstanding the world, so forward in yeares (being then 32) so neere the possession of a Kingdome, would not haue leaft it, and an aged father broken with daies and trauaile to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himselfe (with his deare and tender consort <hi>Elionor</hi> and as it seemes then young with childe) to a voyage that could promise nothing but daunger, toyle, miserie, and affliction. So powrefull are the operations of the minde, as they make men neglect the ease of their bodies, especially in times not dissolued with those soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Luxurie and Idlenesse which vnmannes them. And we cannot but admire the vndauntable constancie of this Prince, whom all the sad examples of others calamities (crossing euen the beginning of this action) could not deterre from proceeding therein. For, first the King of <hi>France</hi> who with two of his sonnes, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and a mighty Army, being set out before, and by the way besieging the Citie of <hi>Tunis</hi> in <hi>Affrica</hi> (possest then by the <hi>Sarazines</hi> that infested Christendome) perished mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably by the Pestilence that raged in his Army, and with him one of his sonnes and many of his Nobles, whereby all their enterprise was dasht and vtterly ouerthrowne. Besides, <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicile,</hi> brother to this King of <hi>France,</hi> who likewise came to ayde him, returning home, lost the greatest part of his Nauie by tempest. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer many of this Princes owne people were desirous to leaue him and returne home. Whereupon he is sayde <hi>to haue stricken his brest, and sworne: that if all his followers</hi>

After three yeares trauell, from the time of his setting forth, and many conflicts without any great effect, disappointed of his aides, and his ends, he leaues <hi>Acon</hi> (which he went to relieue) well fortified, and manned: returnes homeward, lands in <hi>Sicile,</hi> is royally feasted by <hi>Charles</hi> the King thereof: passes through <hi>Italy,</hi> with all the honour could be shewed him, both by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Princes there.

               <p>The spirit and abilities of this Prince shewed in the beginning of his Actions vnder his Father, after the great Defeit hee gaue the Barons at <hi>Euesham:</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the disherited Mutiners of the Kingdome: The exposition of his Person to all hazards, and trauaile: His single Combat with <hi>Adam Gordun</hi> the Outlaw neere <hi>Farnham:</hi> His great aduenture and Attempts in the East: And finally his long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the affaires of the World, with his Maturitie of yeeres (being about 35. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to the Crowne) might well presage what an able Master hee would proue in the mannage thereof. And how (by these aduantages of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi>) he was likely (as he did) to make a higher Improuement of the Royaltie; hauingwonne, or worne out, the greatest of those who heretofore opposed the same. In so much as hee seemes the first Conqueror, after the Conqueror that got the Domination of this State in that emminent manner, as by his gouernment appeares,</p>

And at the first propounding thereof, one Sir <hi>Iohn Hauering</hi> Knight stands vp amongst them, as they were assembled in the Refecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Monkes at Westminster (and said) <hi>Reuerend Fathers, if any heere will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>

                  <hi>Wales,</hi> that lay neerest the daunger of a superiour Prince, and had euer strugled for <note place="margin">An occasion taken for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of Wales.</note> libertie, and the rule of a Natiue Gouernor; had alwaies beene the Receptacle, and ayde of the Rebellious of <hi>England:</hi> had euer combined with <hi>Scotland</hi> to disturbe the peace, and gouernment thereof: hauing neuer her borders without bloud, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; was an apt subiect to bee wrought vpon in this time. And occasions are easily taken, where there is a purpose to quarrell, especiallie with an Inferiour. <hi>Leoline,</hi> now Prince of that Prouince, who had so long held in the fire of the late ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warres of <hi>England</hi> (and deerely paide for it) hauing refused vpon summons to come to the Kings Coronation, and after to his first Parliament (alledging hee well remembred, how his father <hi>Griffin</hi> burst his necke out of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> for which he brooked not that place) and therefore returned answere, <hi>That in any other, vpon Hostages giuen him, or Comissioners sent to take his Fealtie, hee would (as it should please the King) bee ready to render it.</hi> This gaue occasion that King <hi>Edward</hi> the next yeare after, goes with a powerfull Armie: enters his Country with Fire and Sword <note place="margin">Reg. 4. An. 1276.</note> in so fierce manner, as <hi>Leoline</hi> (vnable to resist) sues for Peace, and obtaines it, but vpon those conditions, as made his Principallitie little different from the tenure of a subiect. And besides hee was fined in fifty thousand pounds sterling, and to pay 1000 pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for what hee held, which was but for his owne life. But yet the King to gratifie him in some thing that might be a tye to this Peace, restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him <hi>Elionor</hi> (daughter to <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> late Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi>) who, with her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Almericke</hi> had beene lately taken prisoners by certaine shippes of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> as shee was passing out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> to bee made the miserable wife of this vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince. Whose restraint, and affliction might perhaps bee a motiue, the rather to incline him to this lownesse of submission, and accord: which, as it was made by force (an vnsure contractor of Couenants) so was it by disdaine, as ill an obseruer, soone broken. And either the ill administration of Iustice vpon the Marches (the perpetuall Fire-matches of bordring Princes) or the euer-working passion of desire of Libertie in the <hi>Welsh,</hi> threw open againe (within three yeares) this ill infensed closure. And out is <hi>Leoline</hi> in armes; surprises the Castles of <hi>Flint,</hi> and <hi>Ruthland,</hi> with the person of the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> sent Iusticiar into those parts: and commits all <note place="margin">Reg. 6.

With him ioynes his brother <hi>Dauid,</hi> on whom King <hi>Edward</hi> (to make him his, finding him of a more stirring spirit) had bestowed, after the last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the honour of Knight-hood: matched him to the daughter of the Earle of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,</hi> a ritch Widdow: and giuen him, in steed of his other lands, the Castle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> with 1000 pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> All which graces could not yet hold him backe from those powrefull inclynations os Nature. <hi>The ayding his Country, the partaking with his Brother, and the attempting of Libertie.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> aduertised of this Reuolt (being at the <hi>Vize</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) prepares an Armie to represse it. But before his setting foorth, hee priuately goes to visit his Mother Queene <hi>Elionor</hi> liuing in the <hi>Nunnery</hi> at <hi>Amsbury;</hi> with whom whilst he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7690:86"/>
there was brought into the Chamber one who faigned himselfe (being blinde) to haue receiued his sight at the Tombe of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. As soone as the King saw the man, he formerly knew him to be a most notorious lying Villaine. <hi>And wished his Mother in no case to beleeue him.</hi> His Mother, who much reioyced to heare of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (for the glory of her husband) grew sodainely into rage, <hi>and willed the King to auoyd her Chamber.</hi> The King obayes, and going foorth meets with a Clergie man, to whom he tells the storie of this Imposter, and merrily said, <hi>He knew the Iustice of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be such, that he would rather pull out the eies (being whole) of such a wicked wretch, then restore them to their sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (to whom the <hi>Welsh</hi> had before sent a Roll of their grieuances, and the causes that draue them to reuolt) of himselfe goes, and labours <note place="margin">Reg. 11. Anno. 1283.</note> to bring in <hi>Leoline,</hi> and his brother to a resubmission and stay the ruine which hee fore-saw would light vpon the Nation. But nothing could hee effect, certaine pettie defeites <hi>Leoline</hi> had giuen to the <hi>English:</hi> the instigation of his people: the conceit of a Prophecie of <hi>Merlin</hi> (that <hi>Ginne of Error) how hee should bee shortly crowned with the</hi> Diademe <hi>of</hi> Brute; so ouerweighed this poore Prince, as hee had no eare for Peace, <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Leoline</hi> the last of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Princes.</note> and shortly after no head; the same being cut off (after hee was slaine in battaile by a common souldier) and sent to King <hi>Edward.</hi> Who (as if his death were not sufficient without his reproach) caused the same to bee crowned with Iuie, and set vpon the Towre of <hi>London.</hi> This was the end of <hi>Leoline</hi> the last of the Welsh Princes, betrayed (as they write) by the men of <hi>Buelth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after, to finish this worke of bloud, is <hi>Dauid</hi> his brother taken in <hi>Wales,</hi> and iudged in <hi>England</hi> to an ignominious death. First drawne at a horse taile about <note place="margin">The execution of <hi>Dauid</hi> his brother at Shrewsburie the first in that kinde.</note> the City of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> then beheaded, the Trunck of his Bodie deuided, his Heart, and Bowells burnt, his Head sent to accompany that of his brother on the Towre of <hi>London,</hi> his foure quarters to foure Cities, <hi>Bristoll, Northampton, Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester:</hi> a manifold execution, and the first shewed in that kinde to this Kingdome, in the person of the sonne of a Prince, or any other Nobleman, that we read of in our Historie.</p>
               <p>But this example made of one, of another, grew after to bee vsuall to this Nation. And euen this King (vnder whom it began) had the bloud of his owne, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers race, miserably shed on many a scaffold. And iust at the sealing of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his eldest sonne of the age of 12. yeares (a Prince of great hope) <note place="margin">The death of the Prince <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus.</hi>
                  </note> is taken away by death. And <hi>Edward,</hi> lately borne at <hi>Carnaruan</hi> (an Infant, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine how to prouo) is heire to the Kingdome; and the first of the English intituled (<hi>Prince of Wales</hi>) whose vnnaturall distruction, wee shall likewise heare of in his time.</p>
               <p>But thus came <hi>Wales</hi> (all that small portion leaft vnto the <hi>Brittaines</hi> the auncient <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wales</hi> vnited to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> possessors of this Isle) to bee vnited to the crowne of England, <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 11. And strange it is how it could so long subsist of it selfe, as it did; hauing little or no ayde of others; little or no shipping (the hereditarie defect of their Auncestors) no Alliance, no confederation, no intelligence with any forraine Princes of powre out of this Isle: and being by so potent a Kingdome as this, so often inuaded, so often reduced to extremitie, so eagerly pursued, almost by euery King, and said, to haue beene (by many of them) subdued, when it was not; must needs shew the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Nation, and their noble courage to preserue their libertie. And how it was now at last gotten, and vpon what ground wee see; But the effect proues better then the cause, and hath made it good. For in such Acquisitions as these, the <hi>Sword</hi> is not to giue an Account to <hi>Iustice;</hi> the publique benefit makes amends. Those miserable Mischiefes that afflicted both Nations come hereby extinguished. The Deuision and Pluralitie of States in this Isle, hauing euer made it the Stage of bloud, and confusion: as if Nature that had ordained it but one Peece, would haue it to bee gouerned but by one Prince, and one Law, as the most absolute glory and strength thereof, which otherwise it could neuer enioy. And now this prudent King (no lesse prouident to preserue then subdue this Prouince) established the gouernment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7690:87"/>
according to the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> as may bee seene by the Statute of <hi>Ruthland Anno Reg.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>This worke effected, and settled. King <hi>Edward</hi> passes ouer into <hi>France</hi> (vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the death of <hi>Philiple Hardy</hi>) to renue and confirme such conditions, as his State <note place="margin">Reg. 13. Anno. 1286.</note> required in those parts with the new King, <hi>Philip</hi> 4 (intituled <hi>le Bel</hi>) to whom he doth Homage for <hi>Acquitaine,</hi> hauing before quitted his claime to <hi>Normandie</hi> for euer. And afterwards accommodates the differences betweene the Kings of <hi>Sicile,</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> (to both of whom hee was allied) and redeemes <hi>Charles</hi> entituled Prince of <hi>Achaia</hi> (the sonne of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicile</hi>) prisoner in <hi>Aragon,</hi> paying for his ransome thirtie thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>After three yeares and a halfe being abroade, hee returnes into <hi>England,</hi> which must now supply his Coffers emptied in this Voyage. And occasion is given (by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <note place="margin">Reg. 16. An. 1289.</note> complaints made vnto him of the ill administration of Iustice in his absence) to inflict penalties vpon the chiefe Ministers thereof; whose manifest corruptions, the hatred to the people of men of that profession (apt to abuse their Science, and Autoritie) the Necessitie of reforming so grieuous a mischiefe in the Kingdome, gaue easie way thereunto by the Parliament then assembled; wherein, vpon due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations, and proofe of their extortions, they are fined to pay to the King these summes following.</p>
               <p>First Sir <hi>Ralph Hengham</hi> Chiefe Iustice of the higher Bench, seuen thousand Marks. <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ralf Heng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hans</hi> a chiefe Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the gouernment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the Kings absence.</note> Sir <hi>Iohn Loueton</hi> Iustice of the lower Bench, three thousand Markes.

                  </gap>enerants. Sir <hi>William Saham</hi> 3000 Markes. <hi>Robert Lithbury</hi> Master of the Rolls, 1000 Markes. <hi>Roger Leicester,</hi> 1000 Markes. <hi>Henry Bray Escheater,</hi> and Iudge for the Iewes, 1000 Markes. But Sir <hi>Adam Stratton</hi> Chiefe Baron of the Exchequer was fined in 34000 Markes. And <note place="margin">Officers fined for briberie &amp; extortion.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas Wayland</hi> (found the greatest delinquent, and of the greatest substance) hath all his goods, and whole estate confiscated to the King. Which were it but equall to that of Sir <hi>Adam Stratton,</hi> these fines being to the Kings Coffers aboue one hundred thousand Markes; which, at the rate (as money goes now) amounts to aboue 300 thousand Markes. A mighty treasure to bee gotten out of the hands of so few men. Which, how they could amasse in those daies, when Litigation, and Law had not spred it selfe into those infinite wreathings of contention (as since it hath) may seeme strange, euen to our greater getting times. But peraduenture now the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lawyers, being growne bigger then the Law (as all trades of profit come ouerpestred with multitude of Traders) is the cause (that like a huge Riuer disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into many little Rilles) their substances are of a smaller proportion, then those of former times, and Offices now of Iudicature peraduenture more piously executed.</p>
               <p>Of no lesse grieuance, this King the next yeare after eased his people, by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Iewes; for which the Kingdome willingly granted him a Fifteenth. Hauing before (in <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 9.) offred a fift part of their goods to haue them expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">The banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iewes.</note> but then the <hi>Iewes</hi> gaue more, and so stayed till this time, which brought him a greater benefit by confiscating all their Immouables with their Talleis, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which amounted to an infinite valew. But now hath he made his last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of this miserable people, which hauing beene neuer vnder other couer then the will of the Prince, had continually serued the turne in all the necessarie occasions of his Predecessors, but especially of his father and himselfe. And in these reformations that are easefull, and pleasing to the State in generall; the Iustice of the Prince is more noted, then any other motiue, which may bee for his profit. And howsoeuer some particular men suffer (as some must euer suffer) yet they are the fayrest, and safest waies of getting: in regard the hatred of the abuses, not only discharges the Prince of all imputation of rigor, but renders him more beloued &amp; respected of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this King, hauing much to doe for money (comming to an emptie Crowne) was driuen to all shifts possible to get it, and great supplies wee finde, hee had alreadie
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7690:87"/>
drawne from his Subiects. As in the first yeere of his Raigne, <hi>Pope Gregorie</hi> procured him a Tenth of the <hi>Clergie</hi> for 2. yeeres, besides a <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of them, and the <hi>Temporalty.</hi> In the third likewise another <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of both. In the Fift, a <hi>Twentieth</hi> of their goods <note place="margin">His many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, &amp; means for Money.</note> towards the <hi>Welsh Warres.</hi> In the seauenth the Old Money was called in, and New coyned in regard it had beene much defaced by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for which 297. were at one time executed at London, and this brought him in a great benefit.

               <p>King <hi>Edward,</hi> the better to sway this businesse by his presence, takes his Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Northward, and whilst hee sought to compasse greater felicitie, hee lost the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of what hee had in this world, his deere consort <hi>Elionor</hi> (who had euer atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Queene <hi>Elio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> dies.

               <p>Her Funeralls performed, back hee returnes to his <hi>Scottish</hi> businesse: And now Six yeeres it was since the Death of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> and much time hauing beene <note place="margin">Scottish Hist.</note> spent, and nothing concluded in this controuersie: King <hi>Edward</hi> that would be sure (whosoeuer preuailed) to haue the hand that should make him, deales priuately with <hi>Bruce</hi> (who had the weaker Title but the more friends) and promises him, if he would yeeld <hi>Fealtie</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> he would inuest him in that of <hi>Scotland.

Which Act, as hee thought done to secure him, ouer-threw <note place="margin">Reg. 21. Anno. 1294.</note> him. For, being little beloued before, hereby hee became lesse: such as stood for <hi>Bruce,</hi> and others of the Nobility (more tender of the preseruation of their Countries libertie) grew into Stomack against him; as hauing not onely discontented them in this Act, but shortly after in his Iustice, in the case of the Earle of <hi>Fife,</hi> one of the sixe Gouernours in the time of the <hi>Anarchie,</hi> who had beene slaine by the Famelie of <hi>Aberneth.</hi> And the brother of this Earle now prosecuted in Law, before King <hi>Balioll</hi> in his high Court of Parliament (where hauing no right done him, King <hi>Baliol</hi> giuing Iudgement on the side of the <hi>Aberneths</hi>) the wronged Gentleman appeales to the Court of the King of <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Baliol</hi> is thither summoned: appeares, sits with King <hi>Edward</hi> in his Parliament till his cause was to be tried, and then is hee cited by an Officer to arise and stand at the place appointed for pleading: He craues to answere by a Procurator: it is denied: then himselfe arises, and discends to the ordinary place, and defends his cause.</p>
               <p>With which Indignity (as hee tooke it) hee returnes home, with a brest full <note place="margin">

An. 1296.</note> King of <hi>England,</hi> to imbrace the same: Which done, <hi>Baliol</hi> defies King <hi>Edward:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces his Allegiance as vnlawfully done, being not in his powre (without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the State) to doe any such act. Hereupon brake out that mortall dissention betweene the two Nations (which during the raigne of the three last Scottish Kings had held faire correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dence together) that consumed more Christian bloud; wrought more spoyle, and distruction, and continued longer then euer quarrell wee read of did betweene any two people of the World. For hee that began it could not end it. That Rancor which the Sword had bred, and the perpetually-working desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of wrongs (that euer beget wrongs) lasted almost three hundred yeares. And all the Successors of this King (euen to the last, before this blessed Vnion) haue had <note place="margin">The occasion of the warres betweene England and Scotland.</note> their shares more or lesse in this miserable affliction, both to their great exspence of treasure, &amp; extreame hindrance in all other their designes. Although the intention of this Great and Marshall King for reducing this whole Isle vnder one gouernment, was Noble, and according to the Nature of powre, and greatnesse, that euer seekes to extend it selfe as farre as it can: yet as all such Actions hath much of iniquity, so had this, and we see it was not force or the Sword could effect it. God had fore-decreed to make it his owne worke by a cleaner way, and ordained it for an vnstained hand to set it together in peace, that it might take the more sure, and lasting hold, which otherwise it could neuer haue done. Violence may ioyne Territories, but neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections together; which onely must grow voluntarily, and bee the worke of it selfe. And yet no doubt it was in the designe of this King to haue obtained it in the fairest manner he could. As first shewes his seeking to match his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> grand-child, and heire to the last King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who (dying an Infant soone after her grandfather) disapointed his hopes that way: and draue him to haue recourse to his Soueraignty, which being opposed, he was forced to take the way of Violence, both to maintaine his owne honor, and to effect what hee had begunne. Whereof the miserable euents were such, as now we may well spare their memorie, and be content those bloudy Relations should bee razed out of all Record: but that they serue to shew vs the wofull calamities of our seperation, and the comfortable blessings wee inioy by this our happy Vnion. Neither doth it now concerne vs to stand vpon any points of Honor, whether of the Nations did the brauest Exploites in those times, seeing who had the better was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7690:88"/>
beaten, neither did the ouercommer conquere, when hee had done what he could: That little which was gained, cost so much more then it was worth, as it had beene better not to haue beene had at all. And if any side had the Honor, it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded Nation, which beeing the Weaker, and Smaller, seemes neuer to haue beene subdued, though often ouercome: Continuing (notwithstanding all their miseries) resolute to preserue their Liberties; which neuer People of the World more Noblie defended, against so Potent, &amp; ritch a Kingdome as this, by the which, without an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable hardinesse, and Constancie, it had beene impossible, but they must haue beene brought to an vtter consternation.</p>
               <p>For all what the Powre of this Kingdome could doe (which then put all the strength to doe what it could) was shewed in this Kings time: Who now (vpon this defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of King <hi>Baliol,</hi> and his League made with <hi>France</hi>) Counter-leagues with all the <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> combines with other Princes.</note> Princes he could draw in, eyther by gifts, or Allyance to strengthen his partie abroad. As first with <hi>Guy</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with whose Daughter hee seekes to match his Sonne <hi>Edward.</hi> Then with <hi>Adolph de Nassaw</hi> the Emperor, to whome he sends Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand pounds Sterling to recouer certaine Lands of the Empire which <hi>Adolph</hi> claymed in <hi>France:</hi> He had likewise married one of his daughters to the Duke of <hi>Barr,</hi> who pretends Title to <hi>Champaign,</hi> another to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant:</hi> All which, with many other confining Princes, hee sets vpon the King of <hi>France;</hi> who had (for Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spoiles committed on the Coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> and no redresse obtayned) summoned King <hi>Edward,</hi> as owing Homage to that Crowne, to appeare and answere it in his Court, which hee refusing to doe, is by an Arrest condemned to forfeyt all his Territories in <hi>France:</hi> And an Armie is presently sent forth to seize vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <note place="margin">An Army sent into France</note> the same, led by <hi>Charles de Valois,</hi> and <hi>Arnold de Neele</hi> Constable of <hi>France.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berwick</hi> is first wonne with the Death of Fifteene Thousand <hi>Scotts,</hi> (our writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port more: but nothing is more vncertaine then the number of the slaine in Battaile) and after that the Castles of <hi>Dunbarre, Roxborough, Edenborough, Sterling,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Towne were wonne or yeelded vnto him, King <hi>Baliol</hi> sues for peace: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <note place="margin">King <hi>Edwards</hi> victories in Scotland.</note> himselfe; takes againe his Oath of <hi>Fealtie</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi> as his Soueraigne Lord. Which done, a Parliament for <hi>Scotland</hi> was held at <hi>Berwick,</hi> wherein the Nobilitie did likewise Homage vnto him, confirming the same by their Charter vnder their hands, and Seales. Onely <hi>William Dowglasse</hi> refuses, content rather to endure the misery of a Prison, then yeelde to the subiection of <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Baliol</hi> (Notwithstanding his submission) is sent Prisoner into <hi>England,</hi> after his Foure yeeres dignitie, I cannot say Raigne: For it seemes hee had but little Powre, and King <hi>Edward</hi> returnes from this expedition, leauing <hi>Iohn Warrein</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> Warden of all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hugh.

               <p>And heere this Conquest might seeme to haue beene effected, which yet was not. <note place="margin">Reg. 25. Anno. 1298.</note> It must cost infinite more Blood, Trauaile, and Treasure, and all to as little effect. And now the <hi>French</hi> businesses (that require speedy helpe) are wholly intended. For which King <hi>Edward</hi> calls a Parliament at Saint <hi>Edmonds Bury,</hi> wherein the Citizens, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7690:89"/>
Burgesses of good Townes graunted the eighth part of their goods, and other of the people a twelfth part. But the Clergie (vpon a prohibition from Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> that no Tallage or Imposition, layde by any lay Prince, vpon whatsoeuer appertained to the Church should bee paide) absolutely refuse to giue any thing. Which Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition may seeme to haue beene procured by themselues, in regard of the many Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies lately made vpon the estate Ecclesiasticall. As in <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 22. they paied the moietie of their goods; of which the Abbay of <hi>Canterbury</hi> yeelded 596 pounds 7 shillings and 10 pence: and besides furnished sixe horses for the Sea-coasts. This Leauie as <hi>Stow</hi> notes in his collection amounted to sixe hundreth thousand pounds. And in <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 23. the King seized into his hands all the Priories Aliens, and their goods. Besides hee had a Loane of the Clergie, which amounted to 100 thousand pounds, whereof the Abbat of <hi>Bury</hi> paide 655 pounds.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding now, vpon this their refusall, the King puts the Clergie out of <note place="margin">The King puts the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie out of his protection.</note> his protection, whereby they were to haue no Iustice in any of his Courts (a straine of State beyond any of his Predecessors) which so amazed them being exposed to all offences and iniuries whatsoeuer, and no meanes to redresse themselues, as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with the Bishops of <hi>Duresme, Ely, Salisbury, Lincolne,</hi> yeelded to lay downe in their Churches the fifth part of all their goods, towards the maintenance of the Kings warres: whereby they appeazed his wrath, and were receiued into grace. But the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by whose animation the rest stood out, had all his goods seized on, and all the Monasteries within his Diocesse and part of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> taken into the Kings hands, and Wardens appointed to minister onely necessaries to the Monkes, conuerting the rest to the Kings vse. At length by much suite, the Abbots, and Priests giuing the fourth part of their goods, redeeme themselues, and the Kings fauour. Thus will Martiall Princes haue their turnes serued by their Subiects, in the times of their Necessities howsoeuer they oppose it.</p>
               <p>During this contrast with the Clergie, the King calls a Parliament of his Nobles at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> without admission of any Church-men; wherein, <hi>hee requires certaine of the great Lords to goe vnto the warres of Gascoine,</hi> which required a present supply, vpon the death of his brother <hi>Edmond</hi> (who hauing spent much treasure, and time in the siege of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> without any successe, retyres to <hi>Bayon,</hi> then in possession of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and there ends his life. <hi>But they all making their excuses, euery man for himselfe; the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Lords refuse to goe into Gascoig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny except the King went in person.</note> 
                  <hi>King in great anger threatned they should either goe, or hee would giue their lands to others that should. Whereupon</hi> Humfrey Bohun <hi>Earle of</hi> Hereford <hi>high Constable, and</hi> Roger Bigod <hi>Earle of</hi> Norfolke <hi>Mareschall of</hi> England, <hi>make their declaration, that if the King went in person they would attend him, otherwise not.</hi> Which Answere more offends, and being vrged againe; <hi>the Earle Mareschall protested hee would willingly goe thither with the King, and march before him in the Vantgard, as by right of inheritance hee ought to doe. But the King told him plainely hee should goe with any other, although himselfe went not in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. West.</note> 
                  <hi>Person. I am not so bound said the Earle, neither will I take that iourney without you. The King swore by God, Sir Earle you shall goe or hang. And I sweare by the same oath, I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe, nor hang,</hi> said the Earle: and so without taking his leaue departs.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the two Earles assembled many Noblemen, and others their friends to the number of thirty Bannerets, so that they were fifteene hundred men at Armes well appointed, and stood vpon their owne guard. The King like a prudent Prince who knew his times, prosecutes them not as then, but lets the matter passe: In regard that both his businesse in <hi>France,</hi> and the pressing necessity of ayding his Confederats (whereon his honour, and whole estate abroad depended) called him ouer into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> which the King of <hi>France</hi> had now inuaded; pretending the same title of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty to that Prouince, as King <hi>Edward</hi> did to <hi>Scotland.</hi> And hauing had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence <note place="margin">The French King inuites the Earle of Flanders to Paris, and there impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons him.</note> of the intended Alliance, and other designes of the Earle <hi>Guy,</hi> sends for him (as if knowing nothing therof) to come with his wife, and daughter to make merry with him at <hi>Paris:</hi> where in steed of feasting, he makes him his prisoner, and takes from him his Daughter, in regard he sought being his vassall to match her to the Son of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall enemy. The Earle excuses it the best he could, and by much mediation is released,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7690:89"/>
and suffered to depart, but without his Daughter: of whose surprize, and detention (contrary to the Law of Nations) he complaines to the Pope, and other Princes, who earnestly vrge the release of the young Lady, but all in vaine; and thereupon this Earle (presuming on the ayde of his confederates) takes armes, and defies the King of <note place="margin">The French King inuades Flanders.</note> 
                  <hi>France.</hi> Who now comes with an Army of sixty thousand against him; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King of <hi>England</hi> to make what speed he could, to releeue this distressed Earle, and to leaue all his other businesses at home in that broken estate which hee did; the <hi>Scots</hi> in reuolt, and his owne people in discontent. For which yet hee tooke the best order he could: leauing the administration of the Kingdome during his absence to the Prince, and certaine especiall Councellors, as the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> the Lords <hi>Reginald Gray,</hi> and <hi>Clifford,</hi> and besides, to recouer the Clegry receiued the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbnry</hi> into fauour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And being ready now to take ship, the Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons, and the Commons send him a Roll of the generall grieuances of his Subiects:</hi> Concerning his <note place="margin">This roll of grieuances is recorded by <hi>Tho. Wal. viz.</hi> Append.</note> Taxes, Subsidies, &amp; other Impositions; with his seeking to force their seruices, by vnlawsull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: his late impost layd of fortie shillings vpon euery sack of Wooll, being before but half a marke, estimating the Wooll of <hi>England,</hi> to a fift part of all the substance thereof. <hi>The King sends answere,</hi> that he could not alter any thing without the aduice of his councell, which were not <note place="margin">Reg. 26. Anno. 1299.</note> now about him: and thereforè required them, seeing they would not attend him in this iourney (which they absolutely refused to doe though hee went in person, vnlesse hee had gone into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi>) that they would yet doe nothing in his absence preiudiciall to the peace of the Kingdome. And that vpon his Returne, hee would set all things in good order as should bee fit.</p>
               <p>And so with 500 saile, eighteene thousand men at Armes, he puts out for this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wherein Fortune shewed him, how she would not be alwaies his: For contrary to <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> passes ouer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Flanders to the ayd of the Earle <hi>Guy.</hi>
                  </note> his expectation he found the Country of <hi>Flanders</hi> distracted into popular factions; a ritch &amp; proud people, who though they were willing to ayde their Prince, and defend their liberties (which they respected more then their obedience) yet would they not bee commanded otherwise then themselues pleased. And now the King of <hi>France,</hi> dayly getting vpon them (hauing wonne <hi>Lisle, Doway, Courtray, Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Dam;</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Adolph</hi> fayling of his ayde and personall assistance, as vn-interessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates often doe, especially hauing receiued their gage before hand, as had this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to the summe of 100 thousand Markes) draue the King of <hi>England</hi> into great perplexitie, and held him with long delayes, to his extreame trauaile and expences: which forced him to send ouer for more supply of Treasure, and giue order for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be held at <hi>Yorke</hi> by the Prince, and such as had the manage of the State in his absence. Wherein, for that he would not bee disapointed, he condiscends to all such Articles as were demaunded concerning the great Charter: promising from thenceforth neuer to charge his subiects otherwise then by their consents in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and to pardon such as had denied to attend him in this iourney. For which the <note place="margin">A Parliament held at Yorke in the absence of the King.</note> Commons of the Realme granted him the ninth penny of their goods: the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the Clergie of his Prouince, the Tenth penny: <hi>Yorke,</hi> and his Prouince, the Fifth: so the Kings instant wants are relieued, and the Kingdome satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for a present shift. But it is not well with a State, where the Prince, and people seeke but to obtaine their seuerall ends, and worke vpon the aduantages of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers necessities: for as it is vn-sincere, so it is often vn-successull, and the good so done hurts more, then it pleasures.</p>
               <p>The King thus supplied, staies all this Winter in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> where his people commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">The Gantois take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</note> many outrages, so exasperats the <hi>Gantois;</hi> as they tooke armes, made head against them, slue many, and put the Kings person in great daunger: so that, doe what the Earle <hi>Guy,</hi> and himselfe could to appease them, in satisfying such, as had receiued wrong, and giuing the rest faire words, he hardly could escape safe out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> in danger.</note> which rather desired to haue the <hi>English</hi> commodities, then their companies.

So much could the spirit of one braue man worke, to sett vp a whole Nation vpon their feet, that lay vtterly cast downe. And as well might hee at that time haue gotten the Dominion for himselfe, as the place he had: but that he held it more glory to preserue his Countrie, than to get a Crowne.

               <p>And now King <hi>Edward</hi> to bring his worke neere together, remoues his <hi>Eschequer</hi>

So that he bereaued them not onely of their strength: but of their mindes: supposing thereby to est ablish a perpetuali Domination ouer that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This iourney ended, a Parliament is called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein the promised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation <note place="margin">A Parliament at <hi>Weatminster.</hi>

               <p>In this little pause of Peace at home, a Concord is, by the mediation of <hi>Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reg. 28.

And thereupon restitution made of what had been vsurped by the <hi>French</hi> King in <hi>Gasconie, Burdeaux</hi> returnes to the obedience of the King of <hi>England</hi> (to the Merchants of which Citie he paid 150 Thousand po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uds for his brother <hi>Edmonds</hi> expences in the late wars, &amp; all is well on that side. Besides the same <hi>Pope</hi> obtained permission, for <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> the captiue King of <hi>Scots</hi> to depart and liue in <hi>France</hi> vpon certaine lands he had there, and vndertooke for his obseruation of the Peace, and his confinement, who shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dies, hauing had little ioy of a Crowne or scarce leasure to know hee was a King. The Decrying, and calling in of certaine base Coine named <hi>Crocard,</hi> and <hi>Pollard,</hi> with the new stamping them againe, yeelded something to the Kings Coffets: which must be emptied in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whither againe (hauing beene scarce Eighteene moneths at home) he makes his Third expedit. but did little, besides the regaining of Sterling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle which held out Three moneths siege against all his power, and Ingines reared with insinite charge, and labour. And in the end not wonne but yelded vp by the Defendant <hi>William Oliuer,</hi> vpon promise which was not kept with him. The rest of the <hi>Scots</hi> made no head, but kept in the Mountaines, and Fastnesses of their Country: whereby the Kings Armie hauing more to doe with barrennesse then men, suffered much affliction and many Horses were starued.</p>
               <p>Now vpon this Peace with <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> being excluded and hauing none to relieue them, send their lamentable complaints to <hi>Pope Boniface, shewing him the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted state of their Countrie: the vsurpation of the King of</hi> England <hi>vpon them, and his most tyrannicall proceeding with them, contrarie to all right and equity. Protesting they neuer knew of any Soueraigntie he had ouer them, but that they were a free kingdome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and so at first hee dealt with them, vpon the death of their last King</hi> Alexander, <hi>both in the treaty of the mariage for his sonne</hi> Edward, <hi>with</hi> Margaret <hi>the beire of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: <hi>and also after her death for the decision of the Title, wherein he sought by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to be made Arbitror, as hee was. Howsoeuer afterward they were constrained to giue way to his will; yet, what they euer yeelded vnto was by reason they were otherwise vnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist &amp;c.</hi> Vpon this remonstrance of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> writes his powerfull letters

to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to forbeare any further proceeding against them; Claiming withall, the Soueraintgie of that Kingdome, as belonging to the Church.</p>
               <p>The King answeres the <hi>Popes</hi> Letters at large. <hi>Alledging from all Antiquity, how the direct and superiour Dominion of</hi> Scotland, <hi>had euer appertained to this Crowne, euen from</hi> Brute <hi>to his owne time:</hi> And withall the whole Nobilitie write to the <hi>Pope,</hi> auowing <hi>the same right. And absolutely conclude that the King their Lord should in no sort vndergoe his</hi> Holinesse <hi>iudgement therein. Neither send his Procurators (as was required) about that businesse, whereby it might seeme that doubt were made of their Kings Title, to the preiudice of the Crowne, the Royall Dignity, the Liberties, Customes and Lawes of</hi> England; <hi>which by their oath and dutie they were bound to obserue, and would defend with their liues. Neither would they permit, nor could, any such vn-usuall, vn-lawfull, and detrimentall proceeding. Nor suffer their King, if hee would, to doe, or any way to attempt the same. And therefore besought his</hi> Holinesse <hi>to intermeddle no more in this matter.</hi> These Letters subscribed with all their <note place="margin">Vid. Apend.</note> names were dated at <hi>Lincolne;</hi> where, then was held the Parliament <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> 1301.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> vpon this answere, or rather hauing his hands full of other businesse, stirs no more in this. The King of <hi>France</hi> whom hee had excomunicated, and giuen away his Kingdome to the Emperour <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Austrich,</hi> shortly after so wrought, as his <hi>Spiritualty</hi> was surprized at <hi>Anagne</hi> a City of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> whither he was retyred from the troubles of <hi>Rome;</hi> and so violently treated by <hi>Sciarra Colonesse,</hi> a <hi>Banditto</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Nog<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the King of <hi>England</hi> (hauing been supplied, with a Fifteenth vpon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation <note place="margin">Reg. 32. Anno. 1305.</note> of the <hi>Charters</hi> againe, at the Parliament at <hi>Lincolne</hi>) hee makes his Fourth expedition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as it were the Fourth Conquest thereof, hauing had Foure times Homage and Fealtie sworne vnto him. Which might seeme sufficient to confirme his Soueraingtie, whereof now he rests secure, and home returnes in trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant manner: Remoues his <hi>Eschequer</hi> from <hi>Yorke:</hi> Feasts his Nobilitty at <hi>Lincolne</hi> with all Magnificense: From thence he comes to <hi>London,</hi> and renders solemne thanks to <hi>God</hi> and Saint <hi>Edward</hi> for victory. Which to make it seeme the more intire, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, <hi>William Wallice</hi> (that renowned <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> betrayed by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion) is sent vp prisoner to <hi>London:</hi> adiudged according to the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be drawne, hangd, and quarterd, for his treasons committed against the King (whom at his Araignement hee would not yet acknowledge to bee his King) prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting neuer to haue sworne <hi>Fealty</hi> vnto him.</p>
               <p>Thus suffered that worthy man for the defence of his owne in a strange Countrie, and remains amongst the best examples of Fortitude &amp; Pietie in that kinde. And now King <hi>Edward,</hi> being (as hee supposed) at an end of all his businesse: an vniuersall Lord at home: strong in Alliance, and Peace abroad; beginnes to looke more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely to the gouernement of this Kingdome, and to draw profit out of those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which the <hi>Licence</hi> of Warre, and Trouble had bred therein. And first, amongst <note place="margin">The case of Sir <hi>Nicholas Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue.</hi>
                  </note> other examples of his power (which it seemes hee would haue equall to his will) is the case of Sir <hi>Nicholas Segraue,</hi> one of the greatest Knights then of the Kingdome, who being accused of treason by Sir <hi>Iohn Crombwell,</hi> offers to iustifie himselfe by <hi>Duell,</hi> which the King refuses to grant, in regard of the present Warre then in hand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Segraue</hi> without licence and contrary to the Kings prohibition, leaues the Kings Campe, and goes ouer Sea to fight with his enemy, for which the King (as against one that had not only contemned him, but as much as in him lay exposed him to death, and left him to his enemies) would haue Iustice to proceed against him. Three daies the Iudges consulted of the matter and in the end adiudged <hi>Segraue</hi> guilty of death, and all his moueables and immouables forfeited to the King. Notwithstanding in regard of the greatnesse of his blood, they added. Hee went not out of England in contempt of the King, but only to bee reuenged of his accuser, and therefore it was in the Kings power to shew mercy vnto him in this case. The King hereto in great wrath replyed, haue you been all this while consulting for this? I know it is in my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7690:91"/>
                  <hi>power to conferre grace, and on whom I will to haue mercy, but not the more for your sakes then for a dogge. Who hath euer submitted himselfe to my grace and had repulse, but let this your iudgement bee recorded and for euer held as a Law.</hi> And so the Knight for example and terrour to others, was committed to prison, though <note place="margin">Mat. West.</note> shortly after by the labour of many Noble men of the Kingdome, Thirty of his Peers guirt with their swords standing out to be bound body for body, and goods for goods to bring him forth whensoeuer hee should be called; the King restored him to his estate.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the King likewise sends out a new writ of inquisition, called <hi>Trail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baston,</hi> For Intruders on other mens lands, who to oppresse the right owner would <note place="margin">The inquisiti on of <hi>Trailba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>
                  </note> make ouer their lands to great men: For <hi>Batterers</hi> hired to beate men: For <hi>Breakers</hi> of the Peace: For <hi>Rauishers, Incendiaries, Murthercrs, Fighters, False Assisors,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Malefactors. Which Inquisition was so strictly executed, and such Fynes taken, as it brought in exceeding much treasure to the King. So did likewise another Commission the same time sent forth to examine the behauiour of Officers, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Iustice, wherein many were found Delinquents, and paide dearely for it. Informers here, as fruitfull agents for the <hi>Fiske</hi> (and neuer more imployed then in shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting times) were in great request. Besides these meanes for treasnre aboue ground, this King made some profit of certaine Siluer mynes in <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> as is to be seene in <hi>Hollingshead,</hi> but it seemes the charge amounting to more then the benifit, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came discontinued.</p>
               <p>The King likewise now beginnes to shew his resentiment, of the stubborne beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of his Nobles towards him in times past; and so terrefies <hi>Roger Bigod</hi> Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Marshall, <note place="margin">Reg. 33. An. 1306.</note> as to recouer his fauour, the E. made him the heire of his lands (though hee had a brother liuing) reseruing to himselfe a Thousand pounds pension <hi>per annum</hi> during his life. Of others likewise, hee got great summes for the same offence. The Earle of <hi>Hereford</hi> escapes by death. But the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom hee accused to haue disturbed his Peace in his absence) he sends ouer to <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the Fift (who succeded <hi>Boniface</hi>) that he might be crusht with a double power. This <hi>Pope</hi> was Natiue of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and so the more regardefull of the Kings desire, and the King more confident of his fauour; which to intertaine and encrease hee sends him a whole Furnish of all Vessels for his Chamber of cleane golde: which great gift so wrought with the <hi>Pope,</hi> as hee let loose this <hi>Lion,</hi> vntied the King from the couenants made with his Subiects concerning their Charters confirmed vnto them by his three last Acts of Parlement, and absolued him from his oath: an Act of little Pietie in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of as little conscience in the King, who (as if hee should now haue no more need of his Subiects) discouered with what sincerity hee granted what hee did.</p>
               <p>But sodainely hereupon there fell out an occasion that brought him backe to his right Orbe againe, made him see his error &amp; reforme it, finding the loue of his people, lawfully ordered to be that which gaue him al his power, &amp; meanes he had, &amp; to know how their subsistances were intermutuall. The newes of a new King made, &amp; crowned in <hi>Scotland</hi> was that which wrought the effect hereof. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> Earle of <hi>Carrick,</hi> sonne to that <hi>Robert</hi> who was Competitor with <hi>Baliol,</hi> escaping out of <hi>England.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes head to the confused body of that people, which, hauing beene so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any to guide them, any intire Councell, scattered in power, disunited in minde, neuer at one together, were cast into that miserable estate as they were. For had they had a King as well as their enemies to haue led them, held them together, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their affaires accordingly, that which they did in this distraction, shewes how much more they would haue done otherwise. And therefore no sooner did <hi>Bruce</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his designe, but he effected it: had the Crowne, and hands ready to help him at an instant; and that before Rumour could get out to report any thing of it. Although <hi>Iohn Comyn</hi> his Cosen german being a Titeler himselfe, a man of great loue &amp; Alliance in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wrote to haue bewrayed <hi>Brucos</hi> intention to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in whose Court they both had liued, and were his Pensioners. But <hi>Bruce</hi> (as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7690:92"/>
great vndertakers are euer a wake, and ready at all houres) preuents him by speede: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bruce</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Iohn Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn</hi> in the Church.</note> and either to be auenged on him for his falshood, or rid of him as a Competitor, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him at <hi>Dunfraies,</hi> sets vpon and murthers him in the Church.</p>
               <p>Which Foundation laid on blood (the Place, the Person, and the manner making it more odious) much stained his beginning, and effected not that security for which he did it, but raised a mighty partie in <hi>Scotland</hi> against him. King <hi>Edward</hi> (though so late acquainted herewith, as hee could not bee before hand with him, yet would hee not bee long behind to ouertake him) sends <hi>Amyer de Valence</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> the Lords <hi>Clifford</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> with a strong power to releeue his Wardens of <note place="margin">King <hi>Ed.</hi> sends and prepates for <hi>Scotland.</hi>

Wherein to be the more free, and Nobly attended, Proclamation is made, that whosoever ought by their paternall succession, or otherwise had meanes of their owne for service, should repaire to <hi>Westminster</hi> at the <hi>Feast of Penticost,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the order of Knighthood, and a Military ornament out of the Kings Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe.</p>
               <p>Three hundred yong Gentlemen, all the sonnes of Earles, Barons, and Knights, assemble at the appointed day, &amp; receiue Purples, Silks, Sindons, Scarffs wrought with gold or Silver, according to every mans estate: For which traine (the Kings house being too little, by reason a great part thereof was burnt vpon his comming out of <hi>Flanders</hi>) roome is made, and the Apple Trees cut downe at the New Temple for their Tents, where they attire themselues and keep their Vigil. The Prince (whom the King then likewise Knighted, and guirt with a Militarie Belt, as an ornament of that honour; and withall gaue him the Duchy of <hi>Acquitaine</hi>) kept his <hi>Vigile</hi> with his traine at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the next day guirds these Three Hundred Knights with the Militarie <note place="margin">The Prince giues the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Knighthood to 300 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> Belt, in that manner as himselfe received it. At which ceremonie the presse was so great, as the Prince was faine to stand vpon the high Altar (a place for a more divine honour) to performe this: Which being solemnized, with all the State and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence could be devised, the King before them all makes his vow, that aliue, or dead, he would revenge the death of <hi>Iohn Cumyn</hi> vpon <hi>Bruce,</hi> and the periured <hi>Scots:</hi> Adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his sonne, and all the Nobles about him vpon their <hi>Fealty,</hi> that if he dyed in this Iourney, they should carry his corps with them about <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not suffer it to be interred, till they had vanquished the <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and absolutely subdued the Country. A desire more Martiall then Christian, shewing a minde so bent to the world, as he would not make an end when he had done with it, but designes his travaile beyond his life.</p>
               <p>The Prince, and all his Nobles promise vpon their faith to imploy their vtmost <note place="margin">Reg. 34.

The Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> with that power sent before, and the aide of the <hi>Scottish</hi> partie (which was now greater by the partakers of the Family of <hi>Cumyn,</hi> being many, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; egar to revenge his death) had, before the King arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> defeited in a battell neere S. <hi>Iohns</hi> towne, the whole Army of the new King, and narrowly missed the taking of his person: Who escaping in disguise recovered an obscure shelter, and was reserved for more, and greater battailes: His brother <hi>Nigell Bruce,</hi> and shortly after <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Alexander a Priest,</hi> were taken and executed after the manner of Traytors at <hi>Berwicke;</hi> so that K. <hi>Edward</hi> at his comming, had not so much to do as he expected. But yet he passed ouer the Country, to shew them his power, and to terrifie his enemies, causing strict in quisition to be made for all who had been aiding to the murther of <hi>Cumyn,</hi> and the advancement of <hi>Bruce.</hi> Many, and great Personages are <note place="margin">A great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution made of the Scots.</note> found out (being impossible amongst a broken people for any to remaine vndiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and were all executed in cruell manner to the terrour of the rest. The Age of the King of England, his Cholar, Wrath, &amp; desire of revenge made him now inexorable, &amp; to spare none of what degree soever they were. The Earle of <hi>Athol</hi> (though of the Royall bloud, and allyed vnto him) was sent to <hi>London,</hi> and preferd to a higher Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

               <p>Which rigorous proceeding rather exasperates the Enemy, and addes to the party of <hi>Bruce,</hi> then any way quailed it: <hi>desperation</hi> beeing of a sharper edge, then <hi>hope.</hi> And though <hi>Bruce</hi> now appeared not, but shifted priuily from place to place, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed manner (attended onely with two noble Gentlemen, who neuer forsooke him in his fortunes, the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Hay</hi>) yet still expectation, loue, and the well-wishing of his friends went with him, and so long as hee was aliue they held him not lost; this affliction did but harden him for future labours: which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies (who now neglected to looke after him, as either holding him dead, or so downe as neuer to rise againe) found afterwards to their cost. For this man, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus laide on the ground, within few yeares after, gets vp to giue the greatest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe to the greatest Armie, that euer the <hi>English</hi> brought into the Field, and to repay the measure of blood in as full manner as it was giuen.</p>
               <p>All this Sommer the King spends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and winters in <hi>Carleil,</hi> to bee ready <note place="margin">A Parlement. at <hi>Carliel.</hi>

               <p>Neuer was Prince receiued with greater loue, and opinion of all, or euer any that sooner lost it. For his very first actions discouered a head-strong wilfulnesse that was <note place="margin">K. <hi>Ed.</hi> the first, imprisoned his sonne, and exiled <hi>Pierce Gaueston.</hi>

                  </note> kinde euer noted in our History, and was aboue a King in his life, deserues to haue his <hi>Character</hi> among Princes being dead. Natiue hee was of <hi>Gascoine,</hi> and for the great seruice his father had done to this Crowne, intertained and bred vp by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in company with his sonne this Prince, which was the meanes that inuested him into that high fauour of his. Hee was of a goodly personage, of an haughty and vndauntable spirit, braue and hardy at armes, as hee shewed himselfe in that Turneament which hee held at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> wherein hee chalenged the best of the Nobility, and is saide to haue foiled them all; which inflamed the more their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice towards him. In <hi>Ireland</hi> where hee was Liuetennant during the short time of his banishment, hee made a Iourney into the mountaines of <hi>Dublin,</hi> brak and subdued the Rebels there, built <hi>Newcastle</hi> in the <hi>Kerns</hi> country, repaired Castle <hi>Keuin,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter passed vp into <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Thomond,</hi> performing euery where great seruice with much valour and worthinesse. Hee seemes to haue been a Courtier which could not fawne nor stoope to those hee loued not, or put on any disguise vpon his Nature to temporize with his enemies; But presuming vpon his fortune (the misfortune of such men) grew in the end to that arrogancie as was intolerable, which the priuacie of a King fauour vsually begets in their Minions, whose vnderstanding and iudgement <note place="margin">The misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ostate of Minions.</note> being dazed therewith, as is their sight who stand and looke downe from off high places neuer discerne the ground from whence they ascended. And this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fauour shewed to one though hee were the best of men, when it arises to an excesse, is like the predomination of one humour alone in the body, which indangers the health of the whole, and especially if it light vpon vn worthinesse, or where is no desert, and commonly Princes raise men rather for appetite then merit, for that in the one they shew the freedome of their power, in the other they may seeme but to pay their debt.</p>
               <p>But this violent part of the Lords shewed the nature of a rough time, and was the beginning of the Second Ciuill Warre of <hi>England.</hi> For now hauing had their desire in <note place="margin">The peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie proceeding of the Lords.</note> this, and finding theire owne power and the weakenesse of the King, they peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require the confirmation and execution of all those Articles formerly granted; threatning the King that vnlesse hee presently performed the same, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine him thereunto by strong hand. Thus will Liberty neuer cease till it growe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, and such is the misery of a State, where a King hath once lost his reputation with his people, and where his Nature agrees not with his Office, or answers the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereunto belonging.

               <p>This defeit put <hi>Scotland</hi> both into <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> so that they held their owne the better for a long time after, and discouraged so much this kingdome for many yeares as it wrought not (though it often attempted) any great reuenge.

               <p>This disaster (as mischiefe neuer comes alone) was attended with inundations, which brought forth Dearth, Dearth Famine, Famine Pestilence, all which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any that euer before had been knowne.

               <p>After these rates imposed, all kinde of victualls grew more scarce then before, and such a Murrein followed of all kinde of Cattell, with a generall failing of all fruits of <note place="margin">A Dearth which lasted 3. yeares.</note> the earth, by the excessiue raines and vnseasonable weather, as prouision could not be had for the Kings house, nor meanes for other great men to maintaine their Tables (such a iust punishment had Excesse and Ryot inflicted thereon in those daies) in so <note place="margin">Reg. 10.

               <p>Notwithstanding could all this extinguish the rancour betweene the King and his Nobles, but daily one mischiefe or other brake out, to holde in and increase the same.

               <p>Thus while the North parts were not only infested with the <hi>Scots,</hi> but likewise by such of the <hi>English</hi> as vnder colour of vsing ayde for resistance, robbed and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">The miserable affiction of the Borderers.</note> all where they came, to the miserable vndoing of the people.

A Knight is taken passing by <hi>Pomfret</hi> with letters sealed with the Kings Seale, directed to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> about murthering the Earle, which Messenger is executed, his head set vpon the top of the Castle, and the letters reserued to witnesse the intended plot. Which whether it were fained or not, the report thereof cast an aspersion vpon the King, <note place="margin">Reg. 11. Anno. 1318.</note> and wonne many to take part with the Earle.

               <p>Those of <hi>Yorke</hi> and the Countrie adiacent hauing receiued inestimable damages by the <hi>Scots,</hi> collect an Armie of 10000 men, &amp; incounter them at <hi>Milton</hi> on <hi>Swayle;</hi> but beeing not well ledde, nor experienced they receiued the defeite, with the losse of 3000 men. Whereof the King being certified and seeing all things to succeed ill with him, concludes a truce with the <hi>Scots</hi> for two yeares, and againe returnes with dishonour from those parts. In the time of this peace, a great flame arises from a <note place="margin">Reg. 14. Anno. 1321.</note> small sparke, and tooke beginning vpon this occasion. A Baron named <hi>William Brewes,</hi> hauing in his licentious age, wasted his estate, offers to sell vnto diuerse men a part of his inheritance called <hi>Powes.

And besides swore he would never violate the oath made at his Coronation, by granting letters of Pardon to such notorious offenders who contemned his person, disturbed the Kingdom, and violated the Royall Maiestie.</hi> Which answer so exasperated the Lords as presently they approach to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged in the Suburbes till they obtained <note place="margin">The Lords come armed to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Shortly after, there fell out an vnexpected accident that suddainely wrought their confusion.

                  </note> she is driven to take such lodging other where as could be provided.

The Earles of <hi>Laucaster</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> seeing this sodaine change with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themselues and their companies from about <hi>Glocester</hi> towards the North-parts. <note place="margin">The Lords withdraw into the North parts, and are ouerthrowne.</note> The King followes them with his Army wherein were the Earles of <hi>Aihol</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> and at <hi>Burton</hi> vpon <hi>Trent,</hi> where they had made head, discomfited their forces and put them all to flight.

               <p>And presently vpon this Maister-worke, the King both to busie the mindes of his people, and to Keepe their hands doing whilst the terrour thereof lasted, marches from <hi>Yorke</hi> with a mighty hoast (but small prouisions) into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Where, the <hi>Scots</hi> conuaying themselues and all succours out of his way, put that want vppon him, as confounded his great Armie without blowes, forcing him to returne with much dishonour.

               <p>And now being at leasure, in a calmer homour it seemes, hee began to haue a sense of the Execution of the Earle of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which hee discouers vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Some about him making earnest sute to grant a pardon to one of the Earles followers (a man of meane estate) and pressing him hard thereunto, hee falles into a great passion, exclayming against them as vniust and wicked Councellors, which would vrge him so to saue the life of a most notorious varlet, and would not speak one word for his neare kinsman the Earle of <hi>Lancaster:</hi> who saide hee, had hee liued might haue been vsefull to mee and the whole kingdome; but this fellowe the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hee liues the more mischiefe hee will commit, and therefore by the soule of God, hee shall die the death hee hath deserued.

               <p>Besides in this Parlement, the King required a Subsedie both of the Cleargie and Laitie, for the redemption of <hi>Iohn Brittaine</hi> Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> lately taken prisoner <note place="margin">The King is denied a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidie.</note> by the <hi>Scots.

               <p>This act lost him the Clergie, and added power to the discontented partie, which <note place="margin">The B. being absent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>ex officio.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Queene advertised of his course marched after him (growing daily greater as she marched) and comes to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> Preached before her and the whole assembly, and delivers the cause of her proceeding taking for his <note place="margin">The Queene followes.</note> Text, <hi>My Head aketh, my Head aketh:</hi> and concludes most undevinely, that an aking, <note place="margin">2.

Thus is a bad cause defended with shew of Iustice, and an vunaturall presumption made to seeme right by power and authority: An impotent woman led with passion, and abused by wicked counsell is brought to make head against her owne head, to conduct an innocent sonne against

the father; to vndertake an action she knew not how to manage, and to put her selfe into their hands, who having other ends then hers, would work beyond, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her authority, what pleased themselues.

And the King growing to yeares of more Ability to governe of himselfe, wrought a greater respect of his service in those who were of power about him, seeing him to be of a spirit likely to go through with his work, and therefore they vse their best advice to put him into courses that might be most honourable for him and the Kingdome.

               </p>
               <p>This act of submission performed in the person of a King, young, actiue, hauty, and powerfull, who held himselfe wronged in doing it to whom hee did, bred that rancour in his heart, as it had beene better for all Christendome that Ceremony had beene spared at this time, and not so punctually beene exacted by King <hi>Phillip;</hi> whom their owne Historians blame for standing so much vpon his Regality, with one as mighty as himselfe, and more able and likely to shake his new gotten Throne then any other whatsoeuer: to whose passion considering the fiery heat of his youth, hee should rather haue ministered <hi>Oyle</hi> then <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and more hospitably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him in his Court, comming with that State and Magnificence, as hee did, attended with the best of all the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> to shew what he was, and to beget a respect of his high estate. But these are the errours of improuident Princes, who carried with the sway of their owne will, imbroyle themselues and their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that euer suffer the worst and are sure to pay dearely for others faults.</p>

The late peace concluded with them is held so dishonourable, as it must not holde, and to breake the same, followed an occasion begunne vppon their owne quarells. The tender age of their King (the affliction of kingdomes) with the emulation and factions in great men, put <hi>Edward Balliol</hi> sonne to <hi>Iohn Balliol</hi> (sometime King of <hi>Scotland</hi>) thirtie two yeares after his fathers deposition, to attempt <note place="margin">

And with this effusion of blood is <hi>Baliol</hi> returned to his miserable kingdome.</p>
               <p>In this oppugnation of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> though my haste bee great, I must not so much <note place="margin">A memorable act in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation of <hi>Berwicke.</hi>

this time might otherwise shortly perish by some worse occasion: And what a staine he should lay on the name of <hi>Seton,</hi> and their posteritie for ever, by a base act of yeelding and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place committed vnto him: whereby also hee was not certaine whether he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his children or no: for how could hee hope that this King, who had violated his first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise with him, would performe the last. And therefore besought him that hee would not prefer an vncertaine and momentany benefite, before a certaine and perpetuall ignominy. <hi>And so recovering her Lords resolution for holding out, withdrew him from the walles, into some other parts aside, that he might not be Spectator of the execution of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children.</hi>

                  </note> yet could not secure his estate, but rather imbroyled it the more, by reason of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content which most part of the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> conceived vpon this act of Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and subiection of their Country. Insomuch as it gaue both Kings, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall occasion of trouble for a long time after, with the expence of infinite treasure. <note place="margin">A Parlement holden at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </note> There was granted to the King of <hi>England</hi> for these warres a <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of the <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,</hi> a Twelfe of Cities and Boroughes, and a Tenth of the Clergie, in a Parlement holden at <hi>London.</hi> And. 3 years together the King goes in person with armies into those parts, and never returned without destruction and bloud-shed of that afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: inso much as it may moue vs to admire, how it could be possible that little corner of this Isle, being no more fertile, and withal so often wasted could breed so many (had <note place="margin">A remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> it bred nothing but men) as had beene slaine in battaile within these fifty yeares past, and yet still to be able to supply and furnish their fields with such numbers as they did, both to maintaine their own quarrels, defend their liberties, and that poore ground they dwelt vpon, which was not worth so much bloud as it cost them, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to haue had a better peece of earth, and a more perspicuous place in the world to haue shewed those acts of magnanimity and courage, as they did.</p>
               <p>The reason that moved King <hi>Edward</hi> with such violence to prosecute the businesse of <hi>Scotland</hi> was out of a desire, so to settle the same, as hee might be wholy for the <note place="margin">1336. Anno.

               <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> a Prince of the bloud of <hi>France</hi> descended from <hi>Robert</hi> sonne to <hi>Louys</hi> the eighth, brother to S. <hi>Louys,</hi> had long contention with <hi>Maud</hi> his Aunt Countesse <note place="margin">

and the smoake thereof much longer. First hee discovers to King <hi>Edward</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Councels in <hi>France,</hi> and what meanes had beene vsed for the advarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> whose tytle he now disapproues, and prefers that of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as more iust: and a declaration is published and sent to the Pope and all the <note place="margin">Vid.

               <p>Now had King <hi>Edward</hi> ever since his returne from <hi>Amiens</hi> prepared to make good his party to oppose the <hi>French King,</hi> and by the assistance of his Father in law <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Haynault,</hi> combined with the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Geldres,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Cologne, Valeran</hi> his brother, <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Haynault,</hi> and other Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> And besides, had of late obtained by great gifts of <hi>Louys de Bavier,</hi> the present Emperour, to be Vicar Generall of the Empire, whereby he was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Ed.</hi> made Vicar generall of the Empire.</note> to haue all those Princes confiners vpon <hi>France,</hi> who held of the same, to doe him seruice. And this grace the Emperour did him, the rather for that hee had stood for him against his competitor <hi>Fredericke</hi> of <hi>Austrich,</hi> with whom the <hi>French</hi> king tooke part; and besides he had married King <hi>Edwards</hi> wiues sister, which might be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to procure him this honour. Then seeks hee to gaine and draw in the <hi>Flemmings</hi> whose Earle though adhering to the <hi>French</hi> King as his Vassall; yet the Cities which ever entertained a kinke of liberty among themselues, were easily wonne to take part with King <hi>Edward,</hi> in regard their wealth chiefly grew by the wools of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which by a Parlement holden at <hi>London, Anno Reg.</hi> 9. were prohibited to bee <note place="margin">The making of cloath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in this kingdom.</note> transported vnwrought, <hi>That Clothes should be made here, and habitation with all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Liberties allowed to such Artifieers as would come from other parts to inhabite.</hi> Besides it was enacted, <hi>That none should weare other then English Cloath, except the King, Queene and their Children, that no man should weare any facing of silkes or furres, but such</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The first sumptuary Law we finde in our History.</note> 
                  <hi>as could dispend 100 pounds, per annum.</hi> But those ordinances (more beneficiall to this Kingdome then these warres will bee) were vpon this new entertained correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the people of <hi>Flanders,</hi> soone after neglected; but yet the making of cloth <note place="margin">K.

               </p>
               <p>Now there was among the <hi>Flemmings</hi> one <hi>Iaques de Artevile,</hi> Citizen of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a Brewer as some say (but of more then Beere) a man of greatest estimation amongst the people, and was as their Tribune or Chiefetaine in their tumults, him King <hi>Edward</hi> gets by great rewards to take his part, and thereby had them all ready to assaile the <hi>French</hi> King vpon any occasion.</p>
               <p>Having thus prepared his party abroad, all meanes are devised to raise monyes at <note place="margin">Meanes vsed for mony.</note> home to supply this busines. <hi>The Tenth peny of Townes and Boroughes, a Fifteenth of others, and a Tenth of the Clergie is granted in a Parlement at Northampton.

               <p>But this losse much abated the power of the <hi>French</hi> King, who notwithstanding in these <hi>Martiall times</hi> was soone supplyed, both out of his owne Dominions, and those of his Confederates, and makes a mighty head against this victorious, powerfull and freshly furnished King of <hi>England;</hi> who suddainely sets downe before <hi>Tourney,</hi> with <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> and sends hic Challenge to the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> all his owne and his adherents forces.

Notwithstanding seeing the businesse was between them two, hee offers for the avoiding of Christian bloud, ànd devastation of the Country, to try the same by combat in close Campe, body to body, or each of them accompaned with 100 choyce persons: which if the said</hi> Phillip <hi>refused, then to strike battell within ten daies after, before the Cittie of Tourney.</hi>

               <p>Phillip de Valois <hi>returnes answer the last of</hi> Iuly <hi>in this manner,</hi> Phillip by the grace of God King of France, to Edward King of England: Wee haue perused your letters sent to the <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Kings answer to the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</note> Court of <hi>Phillip de Valois,</hi> containing certaine requests to the said <hi>Phillip:</hi> and for that it appeareth: hose letters and requests were not written or made vnto vs, wee will in no sort answer you. But seeing by those letters, and otherwise wee understand how you, led by Wilfulnesse, without all reason, haue entred our Kingdome of France with armed power, and committed no small dammage in the same, and on our people, contrary to the duety of a Liegeman: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lalely sworne homage vnto us, acknowledging us, as by right King of France, and haue promised that obedience which is due from the Vassall to his Liege-Lord, as is manifest by your letters Patents under your great Seale, which we haue with us, and you likewise ought to haue the same with you. And therefore our intention is as becomes our Honour, to chace you out of our Kingdome, as we firmely hope in Christ (from whom we haue our power) to do. For that by this your warre, most wickedly begunne, our Iourney undertaken for the East is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, no small number of Christians there murthered, the holy service neglected, and the Church dishonoured. And whereas you alledge you possesse the aide of the Flemmings, wee are

assuredly perswaded, that they with the Communalty of their Countrie, will so beare themselues towardes our Cosen their Earie and vs their superiour Lords, as they will not omit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their honour and fidelity, whatsoeuer hath beene by some, through ill counsell perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their owne priuate, contrary to the common good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The French write how King</hi> Phillip <hi>with this Letter sent worde to King</hi> Edward, how by his Cartell hee aduentured nothing of his owne, but onely exposed the dominion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was without all reason. If hee would hazard the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> (though it were lesse) against the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> the said King <hi>Phillip</hi> would enter combate in close campe with him, on condition the Victor should enioy both kingdomes. <hi>But that, they say, King</hi> Edward <hi>would not doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three moneths the siege of <hi>Turney</hi> had continued (and nothing effected but the waste of the Countrie about) all the eyes of Christendome bent vpon this action, both kingdomes, deeply ingaged, expecting with anxiety the doubtfull euent thereof, when <hi>Iane de Valois</hi> sister to <hi>Phillip,</hi> widdow of <hi>William</hi> late Duke of <hi>Haynault,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A mediation for peace.</note> to <hi>Phillippa</hi> wife to King <hi>Edward,</hi> a Princesse of excellent vertue, came from <hi>Fountenelles</hi> where shee had rendered herselfe a Nun vowed to God, to mediate a peace betweene these two intaged Kings, her brother and her sonne in lawe: and labours to stay the sword of destruction lift vp for blood, trualying from one to the other (stubbornly bent to their intentions) and neuer left them (though often denyed) till shee had with great patience, and wise counsell quallified their boyling passions, in such sort as she obtained day and place for both Kings to parle together. A memorable worke to bee effected by a woman, especially in such an age of Iron as that was. This parle brought forth a truce for one yeare, and both these great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <note place="margin">A Truce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> are dissolued.

                  <hi>But King</hi> Edwards <hi>condiscending to this sudden truce, had indeed no other motiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the want of his supplies of treasure, which came short to his expectation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those mighty impositions which were laid on his subiects. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee had vpon his last returne into</hi> England, <hi>in great displeasure, remoued his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and imprisoned his Treasorer, with other Officers (most of them Cleargy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) and still held them in durance,</hi> Iohn Stratford <hi>Archbishoppe of</hi> Canterbury, (on <note place="margin">Iohn Strarford <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>his Letters to King</hi> Edward.</note> 
                  <hi>whom the King laid the blame of his wants) writes him a most bolde and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letter to this effect: first shewing him</hi> how it was for the safety of kings and their Kingdomes, to vse graue and wise Counsailors, alledging many examples out of holy Writ of the flourishing happinesse of such as tooke that course, and their infelicity who followed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Then wills him to remember how his father led by euill counsell vexed the kingdome, putting to death, contrary to the lawe of the Land, diuerse of the Nobility, and wished him to consider what happened thereby vnto him. Also to call to minde, how himselfe at first, through euill counsell about him, had almost lost the hearts of his people. <hi>But afterwards,</hi> by the great circumspection and care of his Prelates and Nobles, his affaires were reduced into so good order as hee recouered them, and now possessed them in such sort, as they all, both Cleargy and Lay, haue yeelded their helping hands, more to him then to any of his Progenitors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee had gloriously triumphed ouer his enemies, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and is reputed the noblest Prince of Christendome. But now at this present, through the wicked counsell of such as affect their owne profit more then his honour, or the welfare of his people, hee had caused Cleargie men and others to bee arrested, and held in prison by undue proceeding, contrary to the lawes of <hi>England</hi> (which hee was bound by his oath at his Coronation to obserue) <hi>and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>which whosoeuer shall presume to infringe, are to bee by the Prelates (according</hi> to the Bull of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth) Excommunicate. So that hereby hee incurred no small danger to his soule, and detriment to his State and honour. <hi>Then hee telleth him,</hi> how hee doubted that if the King proceeded in this manner, he should lose both the hearts of his people and their helpe, in such sort as hee should not be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his warre in hand, and thereby giue his enemies heart and occasion to rise against him,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7690:104"/>
to the hazard of his honour and the kingdome. And therefore aduises him to assemble the Nobles and prudent men of the Land, and to consult with them (without whose ayde and counsell hee could not gouerne his kingdome, or performe his enterprises) concerning what was a misse. And whereas, <hi>said hee,</hi> certaine neere about you by their adulation and soothing, falsly betray and deceiue you, wee here denounce them Excommunicate, and beseech you as your spirituall Father, that you holde them so. <hi>Besides, hee vrges him, that</hi> whereas through the negligence of some Ministers of his, the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Turney</hi> was not gotten, the matter might bee examined in Parlement, and inquiry made, to whose hands, from the beginning of the warre, the Wooles and Monies were committed to bee bestowed, and by whose default the Citie of <hi>Turney</hi> was not subdued, but left in such manner as it was: and that as an equall and wise <hi>Lord</hi> hee would chastise such as were culpable, and not condemne or misdeeme his subiects without sufficient tryall, &amp;c. <hi>This Letter bare date the 1. of Ianuary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then writes hee also to <hi>Robert Bouser</hi> Chancelor of <hi>England,</hi> shewing him what contributions the Cleargie had yeelded to the King by their free consents, &amp; that none other were to be exacted of them. Requiring him to doe nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta; and that if any Writ, Commission, or Precept had gone out of the</hi> Chancerie <hi>contrary thereunto, or the priuiledges and liberties of the Church or Kingdome, hee should within ten dayes after the receipt of these his Letters (as hee said the Chancelor was bound to doe) reuoke and anull the same.</hi> This bare date the 28. of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Letter hee likewise sends to the King and his whole Councell, declaring that</hi> whereas contrarie to the priuiledges and liberties of the Church and Kingdome contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Magna Chatta, Iohn de Saint Paul, Michael de</hi> Wath, <hi>Robert Chickwill, Iohn Thorpe,</hi> and <hi>Henry Stratford,</hi> were arrested, committed to prison, and there detayned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being indited, or conuicted of any notorious crime, and that whosoeuer were ayding or councelling to this proseeding had incurred the sentence of the Canon, which he had caused to be published both in his owne Dioces, and in all other of his suffragans. And therefore besought the King and his whole Councell, without delay to deliuer the saide prisoners, otherwise (hee <note place="margin">Quatenus de iure poterunt excusari.</note> plainely writes) that according to his Pastrall charge, hee must proceed to the execution of the sentence. Concluding how notwithstanding it was not his intention to include therin the King, Queene, or their children, so farre as they might by law be excused.</p>
               <p>To this purpose hee likewise sends to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> and other his Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Bishops, whom after hauing complained of the great exactions and wrongs done to the Church by lay men) hee charged him not onely to denounce and publish in their Church, but fixe vp in all eminent places the sentence of Excommunication, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all offenders in those articles of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> which are at large added to his <note place="margin">Vid. Append.</note> Letter, to the end (as he sayd) that euery man might know the danger, and none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ignorant thereof.</p>
               <p>The King wakened with this clamour of the Archbishop, is faine to apologize for himselfe, by his Letters written to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> wherein, after hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> accuses the Archbishop of false dealing.</note> how much hee had euer honoured and trusted the Archbishop, he accuses him of manifest wrong, for that <hi>relying vpon his counsayle, he was put at first vpon this action against the French King, and by him assured hee should not want treasure and meanes for the performance thereof, and that hee needed not to care but onely to prouide men to execute the worke. And how notwithstanding, through the negligence or malice of the saide Archbishop and his Officialls, those prouisions granted him by his subiects in Parlement, were in so slender proportion leuied, and with such delayes sent ouer, as hee was prest of necessity (to his great griefe and shame) to condiscend to the late Truce, and through extreame wants (charged with mighty debts) forced to throwe himselfe into the gulph of the usurers; in such sort, as hauing iust cause, hee began to lookeinto the dealings of his Officers: some of whom upon apparant notice of their ill administration of Iustice, their corruptions and oppression of his subiects, he remoued from their places, and some of inferiour degree culpable of the same offences, hee committed to prison, and there detained them, to the ende hee might finde out by their examinations, the truth of their proceedings, whereof none could so well informe him as the Archbishop, to whom of long time, hee had committed the whole administration of the kingdome. And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7690:104"/>
to conferre with him at <hi>London,</hi> hee had of late sent an especiall messenger, his trusty seruant <hi>Nicholas de Cantelupe,</hi> that hee should repaire thither: which the Archbishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to doe, alledging how hee stood in feare of some about the King, and therefore would not endanger himselfe, nor depart from his Church. Then the King sent <hi>Ralph Scafford,</hi> the Steward of his house, with safe conduct vnder his great Seale for the Archbishops security. Notwithstanding he refused to come, returning worde how hee would haue no conference with the King but in open Parlement: which at that time (said the King) was not for especiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons conuenient to be called. Then aggrauates hee the vndutifull contempt of the Archbishop and his hypocriticall dealing with him: avowing that although by hereditary right, and the diuine grace hee was aduanced to that sublimitie of regall power, hee held it alwaies to haue beene a detestable thing to abuse the greatnesse thereof, and how he affected nothing more in the world, then to gouerne his subiects with mildnesse, clemency, and moderation of Iustice; that hee might with peace enioy their loue. And how notwithstanding the Archbishoppe had most iniuriously (by his Letters published in diuerse parts) torne his innocency, and slandered the faithfull seruice of his Counsailors and Officers, who executed his regall Iustice, exclayming how the people were opprest, the Cleargy confounded, the kingdome agrieued with taxations and all kinde of exactions. Which the King argues was to no other end, but to raise sedition amongst his people, and to withdrawe their loue and obedience from him. Lastly, to giue notice of the Archbishoppes corruption, he declares how, himselfe beeing vnder age, had through his counsell made so many prodigall donations, prohibited alienations, and excessiue gifts, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s treasurie was vtterly exhausted, and his reuenewes diminished, and how the Archbishop corrupted with bribes, remitted without reasonable cause, great summes which were due vnto him, applying to his proper vse, or to persons ill-deseruing many commodities, and reuenewes which should haue beene preserued for his necessary prouisions. <hi>And therefore concluded,</hi> vnlesse hee desisted from this his rebellious obstinacie, hee intended in due time and place more openly to proceede against him: inioying them to publish all and singular these his malignities, and to cause others to doe the like, for the manifestation of his owne pious and Princely intention, in relieuing his owne and his subiects wrongs. <hi>This Letter was sayd to haue been penned by</hi> Adam <hi>Bishoppe of</hi> Winchester, <hi>and bare date the 12. of February,</hi> An. Reg. 15.</p>
               <p>Thus the King and his Officers, whose proceedings must not receiue a check, are cleared, and the imputation rests vpon the Archbishop, who is charged with great accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; pressed by such as lent the King mony, to render the same. But shortly after the King found much to doe in the Parlement held at <hi>London,</hi> being earnestly petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the whole Assembly of the three Estates, that the great <hi>Charter</hi> of Liberties, and the <hi>Charter</hi> of Forrests might be duly obserued, and that whosoeuer of the Kings Officers infringed the same should lose their place: that the high Officers of the kingdome, should as in former times, be elected by Parlement. The King stood stiffe vpon his owne election and prerogatiue, but yet yeelded, (in regard to haue his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">Vid. Stat. 15. Edward. 3.</note> turne serued, as himselfe after confessed) these Officers should receiue an oath in Parlement, to doe iustice vnto all men in their offices, and thereupon a Statute was made &amp; confirmed with the Kings Seale; both for that, and many other grants of his to the subiects, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding were for the most part presently after reuoked.</p>
               <p>The truce agreed on before <hi>Turney</hi> for one yeare, was by the Commissioners of both <note place="margin">The Articles <hi>Vid. Appen.</hi>
                  </note> Kings, and two Cardinalls from the Pope, concluded at <hi>Arras,</hi> which yeelded some cessation of Armes, but not of plotting more mischiefe. <hi>Louys</hi> of <hi>Bauier</hi> (intituled Emperour) is wonne to the party of the French King, becomes his sworne confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <note place="margin">The Emperor reuokes the Vicariate, the reason why. <hi>Vid.

               <p>But in steed of this remote and vnconstant confederate (whose power lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the limits of <hi>France</hi>) Fortune brought in another more neere, and of readier <note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie for the Duchy of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>

                  <hi>Robert de Artois</hi> receiued his last wound, at the siege of <hi>Vannes,</hi> but yet was brought to die in <hi>England,</hi> it being not in his Fate, that his countrie (which by his meanes had suffered so much affliction) should haue his bones, though it had his blood, which he lost with little honour, though with much valour, leauing behinde him but the fame of a Rebell, after hee had serued the English about six yeares.</p>

This pause againe giues them more time to worke for greater woundes, and nothing is left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practised that might aduance the same.

               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> returning, makes an expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into <hi>Scotland</hi> against K. <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom he chased into the Ilands: And here the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> is conquered by <hi>William Montacut</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whom king <hi>Edward</hi> caused to be stiled King thereof, and returning backe, solemne Turneaments are held at <hi>Dunstable,</hi> where hee is attended with 230.

of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> taken vp by the King in dancing with her, was saide to haue beene the occasion. But it were some derogation to that noble institution, to impute the originall thereof to an act of Leuitie, seeing with what a graue and religious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it is performed. Although, we see oftentimes, accidents of little consequence giue beginnings to things of great estimation, which time makes venerable.</p>
               <p>But besides these exercises of Armes, this great and prouident King, during this truce, takes especiall care for the Gouernment of the Kingdome, and reformation of the abuses thereof, which daily grow as diseases in full bodies, and must of necessity haue sometimes their cure, otherwise there will be no health in a State. A Parliament is called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein vpon the grieuons complaint exhibited by the Earles, <note place="margin">The Nobility write to the Pope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> Barons, Knights and Burgesses against the collation of Benifices on strangers, a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was sent to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 6. in humble manner beseeching him to consider <hi>how inconuenient, and derogatory it was to the state of the Kingdome of</hi> England, <hi>that such reseruations, prouisions, and collations, of Benifices as had beene formerly vsed, should in such sort be continued. For that the Churches of</hi> England <hi>had in times past bene indowed, by noble and worthy persons: to the end the people might be instructed by such as were of their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and how by the vsurpation of some of his Predicessors, strangers, and sometimes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Realme, were preferred to many of them, whereby the money and profits were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, the Cures vnfurnished, almes and Hospitality vnused, the edifices ruinated, the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deuotion of the people deminished, and many other grieuous inormities, contrary to the will of the Founders, occasioned: which they could not suffer any longer, and therefore besought his Holinesse wholly to reuoke such reseruations, prouisions and collations, that meete and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue persons might exercise those Cures, and without delay to signifie his intention therein, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they meant to imploy their dilligence, that remedy and redresse might be had according to reason.</hi> The date of these Letters was in full Parliament at <hi>Westminister</hi> the 28. of May 1343, with which were like wise sent the Kings letters to the same effect, by Sir <hi>Iohn Shordich,</hi> a graue person and of great vnderstanding in the Law; whose message made <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dich</hi> sent with these Letters.</note> him so vnwelcome to that Court, as hee departed without leaue, or answer, which though the Pope afterward sent: yet the King proceeded to the prohibition of all such prouisions &amp; collations within his Realme, on paine of imprisonment, or death to whom soeuer should in time to come present or admit any such person or persons, who by the Pope were so preferred to the preiudice of the Kings royall prerogatiue. And to this effect were Writs directed to all Arch-bishops, Bishops, &amp; others to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, inhibiting them in no wise to attempt any thing preiudial to this ordinance.</p>
               <p>Here is the Arch-bishop <hi>Stratford</hi> with much adoe vpon his submission reconciled <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> to the Kings fauour. And much debating there is in this Parliament concerning Wools and the asseasement of certaine prices vpon the same, more or lesse, according to the seuerall parts of the Realme: and concerning customes to be imposed on them, as at three Markes and a halfe vpon the transportation of euery sacke; but it seemes nothing was done in this businesse.</p>
               <p>Ptince <hi>Edward</hi> about the age of 13 is created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Commissioners <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> created Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>

               <p>The next yeare after, another Parliament, or the same proroged, is held at <hi>London,</hi>

aboue. The King himselfe goes in person to confirme and make the <hi>Flemings</hi> fast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and at <hi>Sluce, Iaques van Arteuile</hi> with other Commissioners from their chiefe Townes, repaire vnto him, where a motion is made, that either <hi>Louys</hi> their Earle should do homage to the King of <hi>England,</hi> or else be disinherited, and <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> receiued for their Lord: for which King <hi>Edward</hi> promises to erect their County to a Dukedome. <hi>Arteuile</hi> was forward to entertaine this motion: but the rest of the Commissioners require leaue to acquaint therewith the Townes that sent them, which though they were all desirous to haue the Protection of the King of <hi>England,</hi> yet disliked the disinheriting of their naturall Lord. <hi>Arteuile</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing vndertakes to induce them vnto it, and returnes to <hi>Gant,</hi> garded with fiue hundreth <hi>Welsh,</hi> which he desired to haue, for that one <hi>Gerrard Denyse</hi> Prouost of the <hi>Weauers</hi> opposed him, and sought his distruction. The people whom he had so often led to muteny against others, now vpon his returne rose against himselfe, and a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with an Axe strake out his braines. And so King <hi>Edward</hi> lost his great Agent, which much displeased him, and disappointed his businesse in those parts. Yet the Townes sent to excuse themselues of this accident, laying the fault on the turbulent <hi>Gantoys,</hi> and in all things vowing their faithfull seruice vnto him: onely to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting of their Earle they could not consent. But they hoped to perswade him to become his homager, and to procure a match betweene the sonne of their Earle, and his daughter. And thus pacifying his present displeasure, the league is renued betwixt them, and King <hi>Edward</hi> returnes to prosecute his other designes.</p>
               <p>But now the warres in <hi>Guien</hi> grew hot, the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> Generall of the Army, assaults and takes in <hi>Ville-Franche, Agenois, Angolesme, Rions,</hi> Saint <hi>Basile,</hi> with many other Cities and Castles. The French King sends his eldest sonne <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> to incounter him; who recouers the Cities of <hi>Angolesme,</hi> and <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> &amp; thus is the sword out before the Truce is expired, the breach wherof, the French King layes on the King of <hi>England,</hi> and hee the same on him, for entertayning King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and setting the <hi>Scots</hi> vpon attempts of inuasion of his Realme. So that it seemes both were prepared to breake, not able to holde their hands any longer from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall worke of destruction.</p>
               <p>It was now the twentith yeare of this mighty and actiue Kings raigne, wherein <note place="margin">Reg. 20.

                  </note> to indure, to attaine glory in this world. His Army consisted of foure thousand men at Armes, and ten thousand Archers, besides <hi>Welch</hi> &amp; <hi>Irish,</hi> which followed on foot; hee had of Earles, <hi>Hereford, Northampton, Arundell, Huntingdon, Warwicke, Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Oxford:</hi> of Barones, <hi>Mortimer,</hi> (who was after Earle of <hi>Marche</hi>) <hi>Iohn, Louys,</hi> and <hi>Roger Beauchamp, Cobham, Lucy, Basset, Barkeley,</hi> and <hi>Willoughbie,</hi> with diuerse other, both Knights and gallant Captaines. Hee had of late entertayned <hi>Godfrey de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> who had beene as a minion to the French King, and became another <hi>Robert de Artois,</hi> vpon some discontent, or doubt of some discoueries of fauouring the English party in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> for which cause the French King had a little before executed <hi>Oliuer de Clisson, Bacon, Percy, Geffrey de Malestroit,</hi> men of especiall marke, whom hee had there imployed. And now insteed of this <hi>Harecourt</hi> had wonne from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Lord <hi>Iohn de Beaumont,</hi> who had long serued him, was his wiues Vncle, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> when King <hi>Edward</hi> had made him Earle of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> takes the French Kings part.</note> with all his courses. Such is the trust of mercinaries, who sell their faith for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainement. Neither did this <hi>Harecourt</hi> long hold out, but changed colours, and made his peace with the French King his naturall Lord: but in the meane time did him and his countrie much mischiefe. For vpon King <hi>Edwards</hi> landing with his mighty Army, in the Isle of <hi>Costantine</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> by his conduction, hee made him one of his Marshals, and the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> the other. The Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> is appointed Constable. He diuides his people into three battailes, one to march on his left hand, along the Sea coast; the other on the right, conducted by the two

Marshals, and himselfe in the midst with his mayne Army.

The three Armies by land lodged euery night in one field. And first he sackes the City of <hi>Caranton,</hi> slew all hee found armed or disarmed therein, burnes, razes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solates the Citie, saying hee sacrificed those oblations to <hi>Bacon, Percy,</hi> and others (whose heads hee found set vpon the principall gate) vniustly massacred by <hi>Phillip.</hi> Thence hee marches forward, and tooke Saint <hi>Lo,</hi> a rich Towne of marchandise, and pillaged the same. Then after some bickring, became Maister of <hi>Caen,</hi> and put all that countrey into so great terror, as <hi>Falaise, Lyseaux, Honfleur,</hi> strong walled townes, rendered themselues vnto him. This done hee spread his power in the Isle of <hi>France,</hi> to draw out <hi>Phillip</hi> to the combate, giuing out that hee would wrastle with him in the eye of all <hi>France,</hi> on the great Theater before his capitall Citie of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillip</hi> this while held not his armes in his bosome, but had ramassed one of the <note place="margin">The French K. prepares to oppose K. <hi>Ed.</hi>
                  </note> fairest Armies, saith the French History, that euer was seene in <hi>France,</hi> composed of <hi>French, Lorraynes, Alemaines, Genouoys,</hi> which hee led towardes <hi>Meulan,</hi> where King <hi>Edward</hi> was said to haue made a stand and attended him; but vpon report of his comming on, retyres: it was supposed hee fled for feare, but the euent shewed that the great God of Armies had destined his victory for another place. King <hi>Phillip</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and ouertakes him at a Village called <hi>Arenes,</hi> a name remarkeable (signifying the <hi>Sand</hi>) to show on what vnstable earth all the trust of humaine forces, and the designes of the great are founded. This mighty Army of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> hauing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to be at home where all was theirs, made him account the victory certaine. King <hi>Edward</hi> retires to gaine the Riuer of <hi>Some</hi> at <hi>Blanquetaque,</hi> but the passage was to be disputed by the sword. For <hi>Phillip</hi> had before sent thither <hi>Gundemar de Fay,</hi> with a thousand horse, and fixe thousand foot.

So that the <hi>English</hi> incountring the <hi>French</hi> all in disorder, fell vpon them and put them to flight. But the retraite was neere to <hi>Abbe-ville</hi> and Saint <hi>Requier.</hi> The losse was not so great as the shame, but serued as a presage for a greater mischiefe to <hi>France.</hi> These disrouted men all affrighted flocke into <hi>Abbe-ville.</hi> Where King <hi>Phillip</hi>

               <p>The French Kings Army was greater both in lustre and aduantage, composed of aboue sixty thousand combatants well armed, whereof the chiefe were, <hi>Charles</hi> Earle of <hi>Alanson</hi> the Kings brother, <hi>Iohn de Luxembourg</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia, Charles de Bloys</hi> the Kings Nephew, <hi>Ralph</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Flanders, Neuers, Sancerre,</hi> the Dolphin <hi>de Viennois:</hi> of Barons, Knights, and Gentlemen, aboue three thousand: and on the Eue of the battayle <hi>Amè</hi> Earle of <hi>Sauoy</hi> arriued with a thousand men at armes more, which made the French king swell with assurance of the maisterie, so that hee longed to be at the incounter. The Vauntgard hee commits to his brother <note place="margin">The ordering of the French Kings Army at the battaile of <hi>Cressy.</hi>
                  </note> Conte <hi>d' Alanson,</hi> the Reere to the Earle of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the mayne battaile he leads himselfe: his heate would scarce permit time for a little counsell what was fit to be done. The olde King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> aduised that the Army should first take some repast, and that the Infanterie consisting of <hi>Genouese</hi> (which were about fifteene thousand crosse-bowes, and sure men) should make the first front, and the Cauallarie to follow, which was agreed on. After their repast the Vauntgard set on, the Conte <hi>d' Alanson,</hi> contrarie to this order, tooke it ill that the <hi>Genouese</hi> were in the first ranke, &amp; in fury caused them to change place, which changed the Seat of the Armie, and wrought that discontent as it irritated them more against the leader then the enemy: besides there fell at the instant a piercing shower of raine, which dissolued their strings &amp; made their bowes vnusesull, and at the breaking vp of the shower, the Sunne shone full in the face of the <hi>French</hi> (dazling their sight) and on the backes of the <hi>English,</hi> as if all made for them.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> who had gotten to a winde-mill hill, beholding as from a Sentinell, with a setled spirit, the countenance of the enemy, and discouering both this accident, <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> discouers the disorders of the <hi>Frdnch.</hi>
                  </note> and the hurlement made by the change of place, slacks not to take aduantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and instantly sends to charge that part, without giuing them time to reaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themselues; insomuch as the discouraged <hi>Genouese</hi> recoyle, which the Conte <hi>d' Alanson</hi> perceiuing, and comming on with the horse, in great rage cries out, <hi>On, on, let vs make way vpon the bellies of these Geuouese, who doe but hinder vs:</hi> and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prickes on with a full carrier through the midst of them, attended with the Earles of <hi>Lorrayne, Sauoy,</hi> and the Dolphin <hi>de Viennois,</hi> and neuer takes breath till he came vp to the <hi>English</hi> battayle, where the Prince was, which they found better setled: their horses flanked with troupes of Archers, whose strings hauing not felt the raine, rained such a shower of steele vpon them, as cooled their heate and all disordered them. The French king seeing his brother thus indangered, makes vp to disingage him, whereupon the fight grew hot and doubtfull, insomuch as the Commanders about the Prince, send to King <hi>Edward</hi> to come vp with his power to ayd them: the King demands the messenger, whether his sonne were slaine or hurt: the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger answered no, but hee was like to bee ouer layd. Well then saide the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and tell them who sent you, <hi>that so long as my sonne is aliue, they send no more to me what euer happen, for I will that the honour of this day be his.</hi> And so being left to try for themselues, they wrought it out with the sword, and recouered the aduantage, by reason the French king (hauing his horse slaine vnder him and in danger to be troden to death, had hee not beene recouered by the Lord <hi>Iohn Beaumont,</hi> his new Pensioner) was to the great discouragement of his people withdrawn out of the field. Whereof notice being once taken by the <hi>English,</hi> the day was soone after theirs, and <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> obtaines the victory in this great battaile of <hi>Cressy.</hi>

Some few troupes that held together, saued themselues by retyring to places neer adioyning. The French king himselfe with a small company got to <hi>Bray</hi> in the night, and in approaching the walles, the Guard, asked <hi>Who goes there,</hi> he answered, <hi>The fortune of France.</hi> His voyce being knowne the gates are opened, and in is hee receiued with the teares and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note place="margin">The French King flyes.</note> of his people, when yet seekes to comfort all he could. The number of the

This memorable victorie hapned vpon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday after <hi>Bartholomew day,</hi> being the 26. of <hi>August</hi> 1346.</p>
               <p>All the Markes of an intire ouerthrowe rested with King <hi>Edward:</hi> the field of the Battaile, the bodies of the slaine, and their spoiles. The occasion of this great defeit (according to humaine coniecture) the <hi>French</hi> attribute to the choller, rashnes and precipitation of their King and his brother, and sure temeritie and presumption haue euer been the ruyne of great Actions, especially in warre.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> managed this victorie with as great moderation as he wanne it: and first, hauing imbraced his Sonne, commending his valour shewed that day, he renders thankes to God after, as he had inuoked his ayde before at the beginning of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and earely in the morning, being Sunday, he sent out 300. Lances, and 2000. Archers to discouer what was become of the enemie, who found great Troupes of such as were comming from <hi>Abbe-uille,</hi> St. <hi>Requier, Roan,</hi> and <hi>Beauvoys,</hi> (ignorant of what had hapned) led by the Arch-byshop of <hi>Roan</hi> and the Prior of <hi>France,</hi> whom they like wise defeited, and slew 7000. Our Writers report, that of Straglers which were fled from the Battaile, or comming on, (hauing lost their way by reason of a thicke mist which hapned that morning) were slaine many more then in the field the day before, which sheweth vs the wonderfull losse this afflicted Countrie susteined at one fatall blow.</p>
               <p>But this was not all the victories that fell to King <hi>Edward</hi> that yeere, there was an other of more importance gotten in <hi>England,</hi> by the Queene and his people at home against the K. <hi>of Scots;</hi> who being set on by the <hi>French</hi> to diuert the warre there, entred <note place="margin">King <hi>Dauid</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note> vpon this Kingdome with 60. thousand men, as our Writers report, assuring himselfe of successe, in regard (as he supposed) the maine strength thereof was now gone into <hi>France.</hi> But he found the contrary: the Lords of the North, as <hi>Gilbert de Humfrivile,</hi> Earle of <hi>Angos, Henry Percie, Ralph Nivile, William Dayncourt</hi> with the Arch-byshop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and others of the Clergie, gathered so great force, and so well ordered them by the animation of the Queene (who was there in person) as they vtterly defeited this great Armie; tooke <hi>Dauid</hi> their King prisoner, with the Earles of <hi>Fife, Menteth, Murry, Sutherland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Douglas,</hi> the Arch-byshop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and others, and put to the sword 15. thousand <hi>Scots.</hi> This Victorie sell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vpon a Saterday, and sixe weekes after that of <hi>Cressie.</hi> And as if all concurred to make this yeere tryumphant.

               <p>Now King <hi>Edward,</hi> without medling with the great Cities, <hi>Amiens,</hi> and <hi>Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> which were both neere, marches on directly and sets downe before <hi>Calais,</hi> a Towne of more importance for <hi>England,</hi> and the gate to all the rest: wherein <hi>Iohn de Vienne</hi> Marshal of <hi>France,</hi> and the Lord <hi>d' Andreghen,</hi> a great man in his time, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. All that Winter King <hi>Edward</hi> hauing sheltred his people as in another Towne, furnished with all prouisions, lay without any molestation of the <hi>French</hi> King, who <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> besiegeth <hi>Calais.</hi>
                  </note> this while was likewise besieged with the affliction of his owne state. Misfortune is euer held a great fault, both in mightie men and meane, and opens the mouthes of those whose hearts are peruerse. The people of <hi>France</hi> were in extreame pouertie, yet notwithstanding the necesitie of the Kings affayres must constraine fresh supplyes. The ill managing the publique treasure, the falshood of the <hi>Financiers,</hi> the decrying
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7690:108"/>
of Moneys, the deminishing of trafficke, augmentation of impostes, Subsidies, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, &amp;c. were the causes of this publicke murmur, and put the people in dispaire, seeing no end of the troubles wherein their King was dayly more and more ingaged. And now was no way to helpe him, but by an assembly of the States. Wherein the Financiers, Receiuers and managers of monies are called to render an account, and the treasure committed to the disposing of the Cleargy and the Nobles, to take away suspition in the people of ill dealing. Foure Bishops, two Abbots, and foure Knights are chosen for that businesse. <hi>Pierre des Essars,</hi> Treasurer of <hi>France,</hi> is committed to <note place="margin">The State of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> prison, condemned in a great Fine to the King. Other Officers and accountants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store at once, what they were long in gathering. The <hi>Banquiers, Lombards,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vsurers, are put to the presse for their vnlawfull exactions: the Intrests are proued to exceed the Principall, which is confiscate to the King, and the Intrest giuen to the Debtors. Courses, wherewith indigent Kings in expensiue times vse to serue their turnes, and please their oppressed people. Which I haue the rather noted, though it lye without our circle, to shew that other Kings likewise layd hand vpon what they could fasten, as well as ours haue done, and made benefite of mens offences: onely this of the Vsurer is new to vs, but yet like to that practised heretofore vpon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and might serue a turne with as much content to the people, and as faire a shew of a iust correction as theirs did, the nature of the Extortors being alike.</p>
               <p>Ayded with this meanes, and the ready seruice of his Nobles and ablest subiects, the French king, in the Spring, hath an Army in the field, approaches <hi>Callais,</hi> but findes no way open to come to relieue it. The King of <hi>England</hi> was both Maister of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and possest all other wayes whatsoeuer were passable, and had the <hi>Flemings</hi> his friends, who with a huge Army had besieged <hi>Ayre,</hi> and did much mischiefe on the confines of <hi>France.</hi> To oppose them, is <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Prince, sent for out of <hi>Guien,</hi> who being no sooner remoued from thence, but <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> became master of the field (hauing an Army consisting of twelue hundred men at armes, two thousand Archers, and three thousand other foot, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>Gascoines</hi>) takes in most of the Townes of <hi>Yaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> in the end besieged and sacked <hi>Poytiers,</hi> and so returnes to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> with more pillage then his people could well beare. Thus the <hi>French</hi> suffer euery where. Their King, not being able to approach to grapple with the king of <hi>England,</hi> sends to solicite him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some place of battaile, and hee would incounter him. King <hi>Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes answere; <hi>If hee would make his owne way to come thither vnto him, there hee should finde him: for, from thence hee would not part, hauing there layne so long, to his great labour and charge, and being now so neere the point of gaining the place.</hi> The two Cardinals sent from the Pope, labour to mediate a peace, and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners on either side meete to treate: but nothing could bee effected. So that the French King was forced to breake vp his Armie and retire to <hi>Paris,</hi> leauing <hi>Callais,</hi> and the defendants vnrelieued, to the mercy of the Besieger, which when they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, they sent to desire Parle, had it granted, and therein receiued this finall sentence: that sixe of the chiefe Burgesses should be sent to the King bare-headed, bare-footed, in their shirts, with halters about their necks, the keyes of the Towne and Castle in their hands, and submit themselues to the Kings will: for the residue hee was content to take to mercy. This sentence intimated to the miserable towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">Conditions for the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>Callis</hi>
                  </note> they all in lamentable manner looking each on other, who should bee chosen for this sacrifice, one amongst the rest stands vp, and boldly spake to this effect. <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, for mine owne part I that haue so often exposed my life, in this long fiege for my Countrie (and haue beene euery day to die) am now most willing to sacrifice the same for my last oblation thereunto, and will cherefully carry my head to the victory of the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>not desiring to suruiue the perdition of my miserable Countrie.</hi> Which free and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute speech so wrought with this amazed people, as now they striue who should bee one of the six; and cryed, <hi>Let vs goe, let vs goe vnto death, it is the last daty wee ought to render to our natiue soyle.</hi> Six are presently chosen, and sent according to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, presenting themselues on their knees to the King, and beseeching him to shew
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7690:108"/>
mercy vnto them. The King commands them instantly to be carryed to their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would not (although great supplication was made for them by his Counsel) be diuerted; in regard as he said of his oath: till the Queene, great with Childe, fell <note place="margin">The Queene obtaines par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Burgesses of <hi>Calais.</hi>
                  </note> on her knees before him, and with teares obtained their pardon, and had them giuen vnto her: which done she caused them to be clothed, gaue them their dinner, and sixe nobles a man, appointing them to be safely conuayed out of the Armie, and set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. An Act worthy of so great a Queene, and the greater by this her deed of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The King though in this he were sterne, yet was he more sparing of blood than his Grand-father <hi>Edward</hi> 1. and had more of Compassion; as shewed an Act in this Seige. When victuals within the Towne began to faile, and all vnusefull persons, as <note place="margin">King <hi>Edwards</hi> Clemencie.</note> olde, men, women, and children put out of the gates, hee forced them not backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine which hee might haue done, the sonner to consume their store, but suffered them to passe thorow his Armie, gaue them to eate, and two pence a peece to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one,</p>
               <p>And thus was that strong Towne of <hi>Callais</hi> the thirde of <hi>August</hi> 1347. gotten, <note place="margin">The Conquest of the Towne of <hi>Calais.</hi>
                  </note> after almost an yeeres siege with infinite cost and labour: all the inhabitants are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, and sent away to seeke newe dwellings; a Colonie of the <hi>English</hi> planted therein, and so it remained in the possession of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> 210. yeeres after. And now this tryumphant King hauing made truce for some few moneths, and taken order for the safe-keeping of his hard gotten prize, returnes with his Queene, the Prince, and his people into <hi>England,</hi> to make Holy-day, and inioy the benefite <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> returnes into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> of their booties brought home out of <hi>France,</hi> which are said to be so great as euery house had some part, and the wiues of <hi>England,</hi> now flourish with the stuffe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of those of <hi>France,</hi> who in the meane time lament their losses: and heere is nothing but Feasts, and Tryumphes throughout the Kingdome. And to adde to this glorie, the Princes <hi>Electors</hi> send to signifie, that they had chosen King <hi>Edward,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> refuseth the Election of King of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </note> King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> which great dignitie, notwithstanding he refused, being it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of his way, or cumbersome to deale withall.</p>
               <p>But before that yeare ended, this great iollitie, heere in <hi>England</hi> turned to the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest mourning that could be possible. The invisible Sword of Heauen makes such a <note place="margin">The first great Pestilence.</note> rauage vpon Mankinde, as had not been knowne before. A contagious Pestilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth in the East and South parts of the Worlde, that dispreads it selfe ouer all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom. And in <hi>England</hi> they write that it tooke away more then the halfe of men: as if the Diuine prouidence seeing them thus violently bent to destroy and massacre one another, would lessen their numbers for their fieldes, and take to it selfe the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of blood-shed in his terrible maner. Churchyards could not heere suffice to burie the dead, new grounds are purchased for that purpose. It is noted there dyed in <hi>London,</hi> betweene the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and the first of <hi>Iuly</hi> 57374. persons. Other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes suffered the like, according to their portions. All which calamitie notwithstanding, could not deterre those egar Princes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prosecuting their quarel, nor yet so vnfurnish their fieldes but that they found still fresh hands for blood-shed, as shewed their many conflicts shortly after. But yet it gaue some pawse, till the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the contagion asswaged, which was also attended with a miserable famine, murraine of Cattle, and sterrilitie of the earth, caused through the indisposition of the Heauens, and want of culture.</p>
               <p>The first Action after this, was the Kings going ouer to <hi>Caluis,</hi> vpon an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 23.</note> of a practise to surprise the Towne, contriued by the <hi>French,</hi> which was thus. <hi>Monsieur de Charmy,</hi> Gouernour of Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> had dealt with <hi>Americo de Pauia,</hi> whom King <hi>Edward</hi> had left Captaine of the Castle of <hi>Callais,</hi> offring him 20. thousand <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> goes ouer to <hi>Calais.</hi>
                  </note> Crownes to be receiued into the Castle: <hi>Americo</hi> accepts the offer, and appoints a night for the businesse. In which night (by aduertisement from <hi>Americo</hi>) King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> arriues with 300. men at Armes, and 600. Archers. <hi>Monsieur Charmy</hi> sets out <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> circumuented in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</note> likewise the same night from Saint <hi>Omers</hi> with his Forces, and sent 100. armed men before with the Crowns to <hi>Americo,</hi> and to possesse the Castle. The men are let in at a Posterne Gate, the Crownes receiued, and themselues layd in hold. Which done
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7690:109"/>
the gates of the Towne are opened, and out marches the King before day, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter <hi>Monsieur de Charny,</hi> comming on with his forces, who perceiuing himselfe betrayed, put his people to the best defence hee could, and the king of <hi>England</hi> to a hard bickring; who, for that hee would not bee knowne there in person, put himselfe and the Prince, vnder the colours of the Lord <hi>Walter Manny,</hi> and was twice beaten downe on his knees, by <hi>Monsieur de Riboumont,</hi> a hardy Knight (with whom hee fought hand to hand) and yet recouered, and in the end tooke <hi>Ribou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> prisoner. <hi>Charny</hi> was likewise taken, and all his forces defeited. King <hi>Edward</hi> the night after (which was the first of the new yeare) feasted with the prisoners, and gaue <hi>Riboumont</hi> in honour of his valour (wherein he honoured his owne) a rich chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Pearle, which himselfe wore on his head (for a New-yeares-gift) forgaue him his ransome, and set him at liberty. The rest pay dearely for what they got not, and were well warned how to trafficke in that kinde. Yet the <hi>English</hi> not long after in the like practise had better successe, and got the Castle of <hi>Guisnes</hi> (a peace of great importance neere <hi>Calais</hi>) for a summe of mony giuen to one <hi>Beauconroy</hi> a <hi>French man.</hi> Of which Castle, when the French King demanded restitution, in regard of the Truce; King <hi>Edward</hi> returnes answer: <hi>That for things bought and sold betweene their people, therein was no exception,</hi> and so held it.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the French king not borne to liue to see any better fortune, dyes, leauing that distressed kingdome to his sonne <hi>Iohn;</hi> who found farre worse. For <note place="margin">An. 1305. Reg. 24.</note> these fore noted wounds, were but as scratches to that State, compared with those horrible maimes it indured in his, and after in the Raignes of <hi>Charles</hi> 6. and 7. till the sword of <hi>England</hi> was turned home vpon it selfe, to let out the blood of reuenge <note place="margin">The French King dies.</note> with as tragicall mischiefes, on the fuccessours of these great actors, who now thus wrought others ruines aboade.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward,</hi> the next yeare after, is againe in person with a Fleet on the Sea, to incounter certaine <hi>Spanish</hi> shippes, passing from <hi>Flanders</hi> loaden with cloth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> in action at sea against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </note> commodities, whom, after a great fight, and much blood shed on either side, hee tooke with all their substance: for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the yeare before, entered the Riuer <hi>Garonne,</hi> and tooke away certaine <hi>English</hi> ships, loaden with wines and slew all the <hi>English.</hi> His forces in <hi>Guien</hi> were not idle this while, but many conflicts passed betweene the <hi>French</hi> and them; notwithstanding the Truce which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. The warres in <hi>Brittaine</hi> likewise continue, and are hotly maintained bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene the two Ladies, the widdow of <hi>Monfort,</hi> and the wife of <hi>Charles de Bloys</hi> (whose husband remaynes prisoner in <hi>England</hi>) eager defenders of eithers preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded right.</p>
               <p>Diuerse ouertures of peace had beene made by Legates, sent from the Pope, and Commissioners often met, to the great expence of both Kings, but nothing could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, (the winner &amp; the loser seldom agreeing vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, in regard the one wil haue more then the other is willing to yeeld vnto) &amp; so temporary Truces (which <note place="margin">Alterations of moneys.</note> were but slenderly obserued) are onely taken to winne time. These actions not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consumed our men, but the treasure of the kingdome. The warre, though inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, could not maintayne it selfe. The monyes here are altred, and abated in weight, and yet made to passe according to the former value. Before this time there were none other peeces but Nobles and halfe Nobles, with the small peeces of siluer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sterlings: but now grotes of foure-pence, and halfe grotes of two pence, equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the sterling money, are coined, which inhansed the prices of things, that rise or fall according to the plenty or scarcity of Coine. Which made seruants &amp; labourers to <note place="margin">A Parlement.</note> raise their wages accordingly. Whereupon a Satute was made in the Parliament, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 27.</note> now held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to reduce the same to the accustomed rate which was giuen before the late great Mortality. This caused much murmuring amongst them, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cause thereof to <hi>William Edington</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Kings Treasurer, whom they held to be the Author of the abatement of the Coyne.</p>
               <p>The King conceiuing displeasure against the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> for being disappointed of the Match betweene a Daughter of his, and their yong Earle <hi>Louys</hi> (who was esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7690:109"/>
into <hi>France,</hi> and bestowed on a daughter of the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi>) with-drawes the Mart or Staple of Woolls from their Townes, greatly inriched thereby, and can <note place="margin">The Staple e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in <hi>England.</hi>

And here are prouident Ordinances enacted, for the gouerning and ordering this Staple.</p>
               <p>An Act is also made in this Parliament, that all Weares, Milles, and other stoppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <note place="margin">Walsinham.</note> of Riuers, hindring the passages of Boates, Lighters, and other Vessels should be remooued. An Act most commodious to the Kingdom, but it tooke little effect, saith my Authour, by reason of bribing and corrupting Lords, and great men, who regarded more their owne, then the publike benefite: A mischiefe fatall to all good Ordinances; and yet is it an honor to that time, that so behoufull an Act was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For, this eafie conuaying and passing of Commodities from place to place, to impart the same more generally, would (no doubt) be an infinite benefit to this State: And seeing God hath made vs Riuers proper for the same, it is our negligence, or sloth if we marre them, or make them not vsefull in that kinde, as other Nations doe with farre lesser Streames.</p>
               <p>There is mentioned also an Act to bee made, at the instance of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that <note place="margin">Stow.</note> no common Whore should weare any Hood; except rayed, or striped with diuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor Furres, but garments reuersed, the wrong side outward: wherein they did well to set a deformed marke vpon foulenesse, to make it appeare the more odious.</p>

Great mediation is made by the <hi>Pope</hi> to accord the two Kings, and Commissioners meet on both sides, to treate and conclude a Peace.

               </p>
               <p>But now the Commissioners returning without effecting any thing, the King of <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> grew so displeased, as hee would not hearken to any further prorogation of Truce, though it were instantly vrg'd by two <hi>Cardinals,</hi> sent from <hi>Auignion</hi> by <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 6. (who being a <hi>French-man</hi> borne, laboured much for the peace of his Countrey) and preparation is made for fresh wars. The Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now grown a man, is appointed by Parliament to goe into <hi>Gascoigne</hi> with 1000. men at Armes, 2000.

               <p>About <hi>Michelmas</hi> following, the King himselfe passes ouer to <hi>Calais</hi> with another <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> passes with an Armie into <hi>France.</hi>

So that his Armie consisted of three thousand men of Armes, and two thousand Archers on horse-backe; besides Archers on foot. The Citie of <hi>London</hi> sent 300. men at Armes, and 500. Archers all in one Liuerie, at their owne charge. But all this great Powre effected nothing at that <note place="margin">Returnes with out doing any thing.</note> time, the French king would not be drawne to any incounter: both in regard of the potency of his enemy, and some turbulencies happening amongst his owne people,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7690:110"/>
but he so disfurnishes the countrie (where the <hi>English</hi> were to passe) of all prouisios to sustaine them, as the King of <hi>England</hi> was forced to returne.</p>
               <p>The distemperatures of <hi>France</hi> that this time diseased it, grew from the violent humors of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who had married <hi>Iane</hi> the French kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Prince of a stirring spirit, subtile, haughty, and presuming vpon his great Estate, and high blood, being the sonne of <hi>Louys</hi> Conte <hi>d' Eureux</hi> and <hi>Iane</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to king <hi>Louys Huttin,</hi> which <hi>Iane</hi> was put by the inheritance of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Phillip le Long</hi> her Vncle, in regarde of their <hi>Salicque Law:</hi> and by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to be Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> in whose right this <hi>Charles</hi> her sonne, bare both the title and state of that kingdome, with many other great inheritances: all which <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbes the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> could not yet content him, but holding himselfe wronged that hee had not also the Counties of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Bry,</hi> which appertained to his mother by the same right as did the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> enters into violent courses. And (daring not to complaine directly of the King) hee falles vpon the Constable of <hi>France,</hi> as chiefe of his Councell, and one of whom hee was iealous, in regarde of the Kings perticular fauour vnto him, and in the end caused him to be murdered in his bed at <hi>L' Aigle</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> rushing himselfe vp into his Chamber, accompanied with his brother <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> two of the <hi>Harecourts,</hi> and diuerse other of his owne retinue. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deed done, hee retyres to his owne Citie of <hi>Eureux,</hi> and iustifies the act to be lawfull.</p>
               <p>The French King, though extreamely stung herewith, yet was faine to temporise, and promises the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> if hee would come and craue pardon, he should haue it. Whereupom hee appeares at <hi>Paris</hi> before the Councell, to render reason for his act, is condemned, as guilty of treason (notwithstanding the Kings promise) &amp; committed prisoner. Three Queenes are earnest sutors for him, his mother (the old Queene of <hi>Nauarre</hi>) his sister (the widdow of the late King <hi>Phillip de Valois</hi>) and his owne wife daughter to the French King. His release is obtayned, and away hee goes with the rancour of this wound (which had beene better not giuen, vnlesse it had beene home) offers his seruice to the King of <hi>England</hi> (who knew well how to make vse of such a powerfull member) and withall surprises certaine peeces in <hi>Normandy,</hi> practising all hee could to withdraw the peoples affections, and aydes from their King, when hee had most need of them. These insolencies, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the French king is faine to endure and dissemble, vntill hee might againe take him vpon some aduantage: to vse force, hee saw was dangerous, both in regarde of his party, and the time. An occasion at length fell out, whereon he seazes. <hi>Charles</hi> his eldest sonne being lately inuested in the Duchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> is visited by all the great men in the Countrey, amongst whom as chiefe comes the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> King commits the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note> is royally feasted at <hi>Roan.</hi> Whereof the French king hauing notice, sets out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> sodenly, takes him at dinner with his sonne, and without farther processe causes foure of the principall which massacred the Constable, to bee presently executed: of which, two were the <hi>Harecourts</hi> brethren: and withall sends away <hi>Nauarre</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sure guard to <hi>Arras,</hi> and his chiefest seruants to diuerse prisons. <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> sent into <hi>Normandy</hi> to ayde the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres</hi> brother, and others.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This sudden execution, though it gaue a present amazement, yet it wakened the partisans of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and especially <hi>Phillip</hi> his brother, who with <hi>Geoffrey Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> (Vncle to the two brethren) post ouer into <hi>England,</hi> exclayming against this violent murther, inuoking King <hi>Edward,</hi> in a case of so notorious iniustice, to ayde them: offering their harts, their goods, their townes and hauens, to let him into <hi>Normandy.</hi> The occasion is intertayned, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> is sent ouer with <note place="margin">Anno D. 1335.

And euery where dwelt affliction but in <hi>England,</hi> and here was nothing but Tryumphes, Vanquishings, and Recouerings in all parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> enters <hi>Guien,</hi> passes ouer <hi>Longuedoc</hi> to <hi>Tholouse, Narbonne, Burges,</hi> without any encounter in the field; sacks, spoyles, destroyes where hee goes, and loaden with bootie returnes to <hi>Burdeanx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King thus assaulted on all sides, gathers what power hee possibly <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 30. 1336.</note> could, and first makes against his enemies in <hi>Normandie,</hi> recouers many of his lost Townes; and was likely to haue there preuailed, but that he was drawne of force to oppose this fresh Inuador, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who was again abroad, &amp; come vp into <hi>Toureyne;</hi> against whom he brings his whole Armie, causing all the Townes and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> King hath the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</note> vpon the Riuer <hi>Loyr</hi> to be strongly garded: Whereupon the <hi>Prince,</hi> whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not to encounter those so mightie, was aduised to withdraw again thorow <hi>Toureyne,</hi> and <hi>Poyctou,</hi> towards <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King to preuent his course fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and within two Leagues of <hi>Poyctiers</hi> hath him at a great aduantage.

               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> was content to restore vnto him what hee had gayned vpon him, but without preiudice of his honour; wherein he sayd: <hi>Hee stood accomptable to his Father, and his Conntry.</hi> So the <hi>Legates</hi> perswasions (though earnestly vrged) could preuaile nothing vpon the <hi>French</hi> Kings obstinacie: who presuming of victorie (in regard his Armie was sixe to one) would instantly (as loath to loose time to loose himselfe) set vpon the <hi>Prince:</hi> who reduced to this Straight, takes what aduantage he could of the <note place="margin">The Battayle of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> fought the 19. of September. 1336.</note> ground, and prouidently got the benefit of Vines, Shrubs and Bushes, on that part he was like to be assayled, to impester and intangle the <hi>French</hi> Horse, which hee sawe were to come furiously vpon him. The successe answered his expectation, for behold the Cauallarie of his Enemies vpon their first assault, wrapt and incumbred amongst the Vines, so that his Archers without danger, gall and annoy them at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>French</hi> King to giue the honour of the day to his Cauallarie (whereof hee had caused a choyse to bee selected out of euery companie, to the discontent of the rest) imployed them onely without his <hi>Infantery:</hi> So that they being disordered and put to rout, his whole Armie came to be vtterly defeited.</p>
               <p>The errors committed in the Battaile of <hi>Cressie,</hi> could not warne this King to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd the like. For had he had the patience to haue tymed it out awhile, the <hi>Prince</hi> could not haue possibly subsisted, being thus inuironed, &amp; shut vp from all succours as he was: and now thus furiously assaulted, and hauing no safetie but what was to be <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> King taken prisoner.</note> wrought by the Sword (which desperation euer makes the sharper) Hee, and his shewed that admirable courage that day, as purchased them the most memorable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that euer any Mattiall action did, that was at chiued by the <hi>English</hi> with so fewe handes.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7690:111"/>
The <hi>French,</hi> who can giue best account of their owne losses, report there dyed in the battaile a thousand seauen hundred Gentlemen, amongst which were fifty two <hi>Bannerets:</hi> the most eminent, <hi>Peter de Borbon,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Athens</hi> Constable of <hi>France, Ian de Clermont</hi> Marshall, <hi>Geoffrey de Charny</hi> High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. <note place="margin">The slaine in the battaile.</note> There escaped from this battayle three of the French Kings sonnes (for hee brought them all thither) <hi>Charles</hi> Prince Dauphin (and the first so intitled) <hi>Lonys</hi> after Duke of <hi>Aniou, Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> all great actours in the time following.</p>
               <p>This blow might seeme to haue beene enough to haue vtterly ouerthrowne that kingdome, and absolutely subdued it to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> but that is was a body which consisted of so many strong limbs, had such store of spirits dispersed in seuerall parts, and contayned so wide an extent of state, as all this blood letting could not dissolue it, or make it faint to giue ouer. And sure these powerfull king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, howsoeuer they may be diseased, and suffer, either through the distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Heads, or distractions of their other parts, can neuer (vnlesse by a gene rall dissolution) be so low brought, but they will recouer againe in the end: their frame holdes by many nayles, which neuer fayle all together.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> in this battaile, hath a double victory, the one by the sword the other by his Curtesie: first hee visits the captiue King, with all reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of Maiesty, comforts him by examples of the fortunes of warre, and assures him of all faire entertainement according to his dignity.

Whereupon the Prince demanding, whether hee accepted not his gift, hee answered how these men had deserued the same, as well as himselfe, and had more neede thereof. The Prince pleased with this reply, gaue him fiue hundred markes more in the same kinde. An example of the worthineste of the time, wherein good deseruings went not vnrewarded.</p>
               <p>All things prouidently accommodated after the battaile, the Prince with his pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners first retyres to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and thence passes with great glory into <hi>England,</hi> now <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 31. 1336.</note> the Theatre of triumph.

               <p>Aboue foure yeares the French King remayned prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> in which time were many ouertures, and great offers made for his deliuery, but nothing effected. <hi>Charles</hi> the Dauphin, who managed that kingdome (during the captiuity of his father) a Prince of great discretion, wrought all meanes possible to bring that factious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to yeeld their contribution, for ransoming their King, but little preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

These fifty, after many meetings, send for the Dauphin to heare their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7690:111"/>
which was much otherwise then hee expected. For instead of ayd and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, they require reformation in the State. And first, the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen their Speaker, besought him to keepe secret what should be vttered vnto him by the <hi>States.</hi> Theyong <hi>Prince</hi> answers: <hi>That it were much preiudiciall to the degree hee held in the Kingdom, to take Law of his Fathers Subiects:</hi> and therefore commuanded them (by their Allegeance) openly to reueale what they had in their hearts. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop there vpon, declares the euill managing of the Publique Reuenues, demands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, and Commissioners appointed to call such as were answerable, to yeeld their Accounts: <hi>That all who had managed the Treasurie, should bee deposed from their Office; That both the Moneys, and all the affaires of the State, should from thencefoorth be directed by foure Bishops, and twelue Burgesses, whereof the Citie of</hi> Paris <hi>should bee chiefe: and that without this Councell the</hi> Dauphin <hi>should doe nothing:</hi> And in conclusion, they instantly require; <hi>That the King of</hi> Nauarre <hi>might be set at libertie.</hi> On which Conditions they would yeeld any reasonable subuention for redeeming their King.</p>
               <p>To these harsh Demands, the <hi>Daupbin</hi> requires time to answer, which he so puts off from day to day, (in hope thereby to separate and dis-vnite their Councels) as the the Deputies, at length, tyred with delay grewe cold, and the Assembly brake vp without doing any thing.</p>
               <p>But this left such a poyson as infected the people, and specially those of <hi>Paris,</hi> who shortly after presumptuously demand to haue the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> deliuered, according to the Decree of the Deputies; and without delay they so wrought with <hi>Pinquigny,</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Artoys</hi> (who had the keeping of this Fire-brand) as he <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Naurre</hi> set at libertie.</note> was deliuered after 19. moneths imprisonment, and comes to <hi>Paris</hi> so accompanied, as shewed both of what Spirit and state he was, and that he meant to take his tyme of revenge. Here is he welcome with the applause of the whole Citie, to whom in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique maner with great eloquence, he declares the wrongs hee had receiued; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides intimates, what right he had to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> thereby to imbroyle the affayres of that State, which were already too much in combustion. This put the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of redeeming the captiue King quite out of their mindes for that time: and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> is constrained (by an Acte of Abolition) to acquit the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and his Complicies, of all former offences. And seeing the peruersnesse of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians,</hi> goes to solicite other Cities, and Prouinces: trauailing from place to place for ayd and succour, leauing his brother <hi>Phillip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to keepe them in (the best he could) during his absence.</p>

Besides, to witnesse their publique sorrowe, they ordaine, that no costly Apparell, Feasting, Playes, or other iollyties, shoul be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within their Prouince, during the time of their Kings captiuitie. <hi>Champagne</hi> by their example doth the like. But nothing could moue the <hi>Parisians</hi> to yeelde any thing. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had wonne them, both from their obedience, and all humanitie, and put them into such flames of rebellion, as when the <hi>Dauphin</hi> came backe to the Citie, the Prouost of Marchants assalted his house with three thousand Artificrs in Armes, and rushed himselfe vp into his Chamber with certaine of his traine: wherewith the <hi>Dauphin</hi> being amazed, the Prouost bids him be content, it was resolued it must be so. And presently vpon Signall giuen, <hi>Ian de Couflans,</hi> and <hi>Robert de Cleremont,</hi> Marshalls of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and his chiefe Counsellors, are slaine in his presence.

of these two noble men to bee trayled along the streets to the Court of the Pallace, for all the furious multitude which ran to applaud the murther, to gase on.</p>
               <p>This done the Prouost writes in the name of the whole City, to all the great Townes, soliciting them to ioyne with theirs (the principall of the kingdome) and take their Liuery, as the Dauphin had done, for the reformation of the State. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they compose a Councell of themselues, whereof the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> the Primier President, the Prouost, with some of the Vniuersity, were chiefe, assuming a Soueraigne power to order all affaires of the State, as a Common-wealth. So that wee see in what a miserable confusion that kingdome stood, being without a head, and how apt it was then to shake off all authority, and dissolue the gouernement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts: shewing vs that it was no new proiect amongst them to Cantonize, as the great Townes and the Princes of late practised to doe, in their leagues during their ciuile combustions.</p>
               <p>The Dauphin thus disgraced, with much a doe, gets out of this tumultious City, and retyres into <hi>Champagne,</hi> and at <hi>Vertus</hi> assembles the States of the Countrie, whom hee found loyall, and ready to yeeld him all succour. The rest of the great Townes refusing (with much disdaine) to ioyne with the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> offer him likewise their ayde: So that hee was put into some heart, and likly to effect his desires in short time, had not the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who sought his destruction, still raysed new broyles in the State, and taken Armes against him.</p>
               <p>Now besides these confusions, greater mischiefes arose in that miserable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the poore Paysants that had beene eaten out by the Souldiers, and troden vnder foote by their Lords, colleague and arme themselues in the Country of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoysis,</hi>

This was not all, troupes of souldiers which had no work or meanes to liue, ioyne together in mighty Companies, ouer-runne and rauage other parts of the kingdome. The forces in <hi>Brittaine</hi> vnder the conduct of Sir <hi>Robert Knoles,</hi> breake out vpon the confining Countries, and returne loaden with inestimable booties of wealth. All which miserable calamities (enough to haue vtterly dissolued a State) prolong the imprisonment of their King in <hi>England;</hi> so that nothing could bee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for his ransome, which King <hi>Edward</hi> thinkes long till he haue in his Treasury: and vrges likewise for his part, very hard conditions; requiring, say they, besides infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite summes, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> should doe homage, and holde the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> of the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> which hee with great disdayne refuses, as being not in his power to alien what was vnalienable, vowing that no misery of his, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne him to doe any thing preiudiciall to his successors, to whom hee would leaue the State as hee receiued it. But yet at length offers other, and more large conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then the <hi>French</hi> were willing to yeeld vnto, which being long in debating, and nothing concluded (after foure yeares expectation) King <hi>Edward</hi> in great displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, resolues to make an end of this worke with the sword, and to take possession <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> goes to take possession of the kingdome of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:7690:112"/>In the meane time the Regent layes in mighty store of victualls, prouides that the Souldiers should haue enough without pressing the inhabitants, and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame dilligence so fortifies the City, as King <hi>Edward</hi> returning with all his refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed power, was vtterly disappoynted of his hopes, to doe any good there.

               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> returning with his Crownes, calles a Parliament, wherein, the forme of the Accord was read, and allowed of all the Estates, and an Oath taken by the Nobles to obserue the same for their partes.

whose Daughter and Heyre was a little before marryed to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> (by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation being neere of consanguinitie) whereby hee is made Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> And shortly after, by the like Dispensation, the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> marryes the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 36.</note> of <hi>Kent,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edmond,</hi> brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the second.

Here was also an act passed for Purueiors (as there had beene many before in his time) that nothing should bee taken vp but for ready money, vpon strict punishment.

Yet the Kings desire to inrich that Towne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne acquisition, and now a member of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> might herein be well borne withall. And sure this King, the most renowmed for <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> that euer raigned in this kingdome, not onely laboured to aduance the State by enlarging the Dominions thereof, but to make his people as well good as great, by reforming their vices (whereunto fortunate and opulent States are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more subiect) as may be noted in the next Parliament held at <hi>Westminster Anno Reg.</hi> 37. wherein for the publique Good, certaine Sumptuary lawes, the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to preuent Ryot (that dissoluing sicknesse, the feuer Hectique of a State) were ordayned both for Apparell &amp; Diet; appointing euery degree of men from the Shepheard to the Prince, the Stuffe &amp; Habits they should weare: prohibiting the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornements of gold and Siluer, Silkes, and rich Furres to all, except eminent persons. <note place="margin">Vid.

And this might be the occasion of his comming, and not his loue to the <hi>Conntesse</hi> of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> as is reported.

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> returning thus out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> charged with more debts then before, and destitute of meanes to content his people, fals vpon another misfortune <note place="margin">The il successe of that iourny.</note> (as commonly men in these declinations, seeking remedies increase maladies) impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a new taxation vpon the <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> of Feuage, or Chymney mony, so discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the people, as they exclaime against the gouernment of the <hi>English,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the King and Court of <hi>France</hi> for redresse.

The Clergie graunted him, 50. thousand poundes, to be payd the same yeere; and the Laitie as much. For the leuying whereof, euery Parish in <hi>England</hi> was rated first to pay 23 shillings foure pence (the great helping the lesse) vpon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position there had beene Parishes ynough to haue made vp that summe. But by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate vpon the Kings Writs sent out to examine what number of Parish Churches were in euery Shire, they found it came short: and then rated euery Parish at fiue pound sixteene shillings (the greater to helpe the lesse) and so, of 8600.

               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> after the departure of the Prince, did little, but being now a widdower (his wife dying two yeares before, in the third great Pestilence, in which yeare also <hi>Phillippe</hi> wife to King <hi>Edward</hi> ended her life) hee marries <hi>Constance</hi> eldest daughter to <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> by whom hee had the empty title of King, <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Constance</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Castile.</hi>
                  </note> and was (after the death of his father-in-law) stiled King of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Leon.</hi> This <hi>Constance,</hi> though shee were the daughter of a wicked father and infamous mother, yet was so happy, that the daughter shee had by this Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> named <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> became after Queene of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> (being married to <hi>Henry</hi> 3. in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session before, and in her right King of both those Realmes) and left her posterity Kings of <hi>Spaine.

               <p>The City of <hi>Rochell,</hi> that yet held out for the <hi>English,</hi> had indured a long siege both by Sea and land, to relieue which important peece, the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> is sent with forty shippes well manned and victualled, and besides furnished with twenty <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>

               <p>Shortly after, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> passes ouer againe to <hi>Calais</hi> with another Army, which hee leads through <hi>France,</hi> by the way of <hi>Auergne,</hi> where amongst the mountaines he lost many of his people for want of victuals, and almost all his horse, so that hee came to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> with a starued and distressed company, which after some time hee relieues and made certaine attempts vpon the enemy, but effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the date of victories was out, all went ill with the <hi>English.</hi> The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes the next yeare, and all <hi>Gascoigne</hi> reuolts except <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Bayon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> hath another supply by Parliament, a Tenth of the Cleargy, and a Fifteenth of the Laytie, towardes these warres: which now are sought to be ended <note place="margin">Another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidie granted by Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> by treaty, an vnlikely way to doe any good. Two yeares are spent therein, at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and other places, with great charge of Commissioners, and much debate. The <hi>French</hi> hauing now the aduantage of the time, would make their owne conditions, they require the Towne of <hi>Calais</hi> (from whence King <hi>Edward</hi> had now remoued his Staple, in regard of the danger of Marchants goods) and restitution of great summes of money, which were not to bee yeelded: So that nothing but temporary Truces were to be gotten to serue present shifts, wherein the <hi>English,</hi> and their party, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the worse.</p>
               <p>And here at home, besides the sicknesse of the Prince (which grew desperate) the State is diseased, the Kings age is misled, his treasure exhausted, and his affaires <note place="margin">Anno Reg. 50. 1376.</note> ill managed. A Parliament to cure these euils, is called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Kings wants are opened, and supplyes required: the whole body of the Assembly, weary to beare these continuall burthens, in steed of Contributions, exhibit Complaints, charging the Kings Officers with fraude, and humbly craue that the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>

               <p>The King in this Parliament, being the Fiftieth yeere of his raigne, to gratifie his Subiects, grants another generall Pardon, as another <hi>Iubile;</hi> wherein onely <hi>William</hi>

But this <hi>Iubile</hi> was soone turned to sorrow, by the death of the Prince <note place="margin">The death of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Wales</hi> which happened in this Parliament time. A heauy losse to the State, being a Prince of whom we neuer heard any ill, neuer receiued other note then of goodnes, and the noblest performances, that Magnanimitie and Wisedome could euer shew: inso much, as what praise can bee giuen to Vertue, is due vnto him. His death changed the face of affayres. The late excluded parties returne to Court, and their former places. This Parliament, called <hi>the good Parliament,</hi> now wrought ill effects. <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with the rest, to the Court.</note> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter de la Mare,</hi> at the suite of <hi>Allce Peirce,</hi> an impudent woman (working vpon the Kings impotencies) is committed to perpetuall imprisonment at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> An acte without example of former times, and did no good in this, especially being wrought by such a Subiect.

                  </note> she had subdued, grew so insolent (the common euill of such fortunes) that she inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled with Courtes of Iustice and other Offices, where she her selfe would sit to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her desires: which, though in all who are so exalted, are euer excessiue, yet in a woman most immoderate, as hauing lesse of discretion, and more of greedinesse.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> is come now to haue the Regencie, and to manage all the <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns all.</note> affayres of the Kingdom, and might thereby presume farther. But King <hi>Edward,</hi> to preuent the mischiefes, which by disordering the succession might grow in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, prouidently setled the same in this Parliament, vpon <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doaux</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </note> creating him first Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Corne-wall,</hi> and then Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> which made much for his present safetie, least <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> should supplant him, as Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> did his Nephew <hi>Arthur,</hi> in the like case. For (sure it seemes) the Duke had his designe that way bent: but this confirmation by the Parliament (which hee had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended) and shortly after a breach with the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> put him so by, as he durst not now attempt that which his Sonne after effected. But yet he behaues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very imperiously in this state he had. And first shews his authoritie on the Earle <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>March</hi> resigns his Office of Marshall, which is giuen to Sir <hi>Henry Percie.</hi>

Which the Earle refuses, and rather yeelds vp his Rodde, with the Office of <hi>Marshall,</hi> then obey his commandement therein. The Duke takes the Rodde, and giues it with the Office, to Sir <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> a man most inward with him.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the Parliament is assembled againe at <hi>Westminster</hi> (whether a new; or the last prorogued I know not) and thither, the Duke himselfe brings Prince <hi>Richard</hi> (of the age of 11. yeeres) places him in the Kings Seat, and taught him to <note place="margin">Iohn Sow.</note> demaund a Subsidie. Which was two Tenths, to be payd in one yeere: Or twelue <note place="margin">The Prince motions a Subsidie in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds.</note> pence in the pound of all Marchandizes sold, for one yeere; and one pound of siluer for euery Knights Fee; and of euery Fire-house one penie. And this Demaund the Duke earnestly vrges, Saying, one of them ought of necessitie to be granted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Enemie proclayming Warre, purposed to inuade the Realme.</p>
               <p>The Knights of the Parliament (whom the Duke they sayd, had by practise made, <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diuided</note> and put by all of the last Assembly, except twelue which he could not alter) require respite to answere: a day is appointed. The maior part make choyce of one <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a Creature of the Dukes to deliuer their answere. The other would haue Sir <hi>Peter Dela Mare</hi> to be inlarged, and deliuer theirs; and also answere to what could be obiected against him, before the Lords in Parliament, and thereto submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Then the Duke demaunds ayd of the Bishops. They refuse to treate therein, without their Brother, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> prohibited from comming to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now there fell out an Accident, that besides gaue interruption to this businesse. A certaine Divine, named <hi>Iohn Wicliff,</hi> depriued by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbuie</hi> of a

The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> tolde him, it was against all law and reason, that hee who was there cited before his Ordinary, should sit: hereupon contumelious wordes arose betweene the Lord Marshall and the Bishop, the Duke takes the Marshals part, and sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Bishop, the Bishop returnes the like to the Duke, who in great rage, seeing hee could not preuayle, swore <hi>hee would pull downe the pride of him, and all the Bishops of England. You trust, sayd hee, in your Parents, but they can profit you nothing. I trust not in my, Parents</hi> said the Bishop, <hi>nor in any man liuing, but in God in whom I ought to trust.</hi> The Duke, as if whispering in his eare, tolde him, <hi>hee had rather pull him out of the Church by the hayre of the head, then suffer these indignities:</hi> which wordes the <hi>Londoners</hi> ouer-hearing, swore with a lowde voyce, <hi>they would rather lose their liues, then suffer their Bishop to bee thus iniuriously vsed, and threatened to bee pulled out off</hi>

                  <hi>his owne Church.</hi> Their fury was the more incensed against the Duke, for that the day before in the Parliament (whereof hee was president) it was required in the Kings name, that from thence forth there should bee no more a Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> but a Captaine appoynted for the gouernment of the City, and that the Lord Marshall of <hi>England</hi> should arrest offenders within the Liberties, as in other places.</p>
               <p>About this businesse, and this wrong offered to their Bishop, the Citizens assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <note place="margin">The Citizens in vprore.</note> the morrow after, to consult amongst themselues, it happened the Lord <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> and <hi>Guido Brian,</hi> came into the City, which the people seeing, furiously ranne vpon them, and were like to beate them downe for comming vnsent for, at that time. The Lord <hi>Fitzwater</hi> protested hee came for no other end, but to offer his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the City, being by inheritance their Standard-bearer, and was to take iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries offered to them, as to himselfe, and therefore willed them to looke to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Whereupon they presently take Armes, assayle the Marshals Inne, breake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates, brought forth a prisoner in his Gyues, and let him at liberty, but found
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7690:116"/>
not the Lord Marshall, who with the Duke that day were to dine with one <hi>Iohn de Ypres,</hi> Thence thus surious multitude ran to assayle the <hi>Sauoy,</hi> which a Knight of the Dukes seeing, hastes to the place whsre his Master dyned, and acquaintes him with this vp-roare in the Citie. The Duke leaps from the Table so hastily, that hee hurt <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancasier</hi> in danger slees to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</note> both his shinnes in the Fourme, and with Sir <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> alone takes boar, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he gets to <hi>Kennington,</hi> neere <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where the Princesse with the young Prince lay; to whom he complaines of this Ryot, and the violence offered him. In the meane time the multitude comming to the <hi>Sauoy,</hi> a priest inquisitiue to know the busines, was answered, <hi>They went to take the</hi> Duke <hi>and the</hi> Lord Mashall, <hi>and compell them, to deliuer</hi> Sir Peter de la Mare, <hi>vniustly detained in Prison.</hi> The Priest replyed; <hi>That</hi> Sir Peter <hi>was a Traitour to the</hi> King, <hi>and worthy to be hanged,</hi> At which words they all cryed out; <hi>This is</hi> Percie, <hi>this is the Traytour of</hi> England, <hi>his speach bewrayes him though his Apparell be disguised:</hi> and presently they ran vpon him, and wounded him to death.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> hearing of this Out-rage, leaues his dinner, hastes to the <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the tumult.</note> 
                  <hi>Sauoy,</hi> admonishes them <hi>to be mindefull of the Holy time, (being Lent) and for the loue of</hi> Christ <hi>to desist from such seditious acts; assuring them, all thing should be fairely ended for the good of the Citie.</hi> Whereupon they were something pacified, and forbare to assault the Dukes house, whose person (if they could haue found) they had (no doubt) made an end of him, and the Lord Marshall in this their surie, at that time; but missing him, they yet hung vp his Armes reuersed, in signe of Treason in all the principall streetes of the Citie.</p>
               <p>The Princesse from <hi>Kenington,</hi> sent <hi>Albert de Vere, Louys Clifford,</hi> and <hi>Simon Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leygh</hi> to the Citizens, perswading them to make their peace with the Duke. They returned this answere, <hi>That for her Honour they would doe whatsoeuer shee commanded:</hi> but yet inioyned the Kinghts, to will the Duke, <hi>to permit the Bishop of</hi> Winchester, <hi>and</hi> Peter de la Mare <hi>to come to their Answere, according to the custome of the Lawes of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <note place="margin">The Citizens send to the King.</note> They sent likewise of the chiefe Citiznes to the sicke <hi>King,</hi> to excuse them of this Tumult, protesting <hi>themselues not to be priuy thereunto, but sought all meanes to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the same, which they could not doe (the whole Communaltie being in Commotion) vpon an Information, that their Liberties should be taken away from them by Parliament.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> tolde them, <hi>It neuer was in his thought to infringe their Liberties, but he rather desired to enlarge them.</hi> And therefore willed them not to feare, but returne to appease the Citizens, and keepe them in peace and order: which they did, and were well pleased with this answere. But yet they could not stop the passage of Rimes and Libels (those secret stings that wound vnseene) but that they were dayly spread in the Citie to the defamation of the Duke; and to make his name odious to the people. For which, he procured the Bishops to excommunicate the Authors of all such Rimes, and Libels.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, this harsh proceeding of the Duke with the State, and in a time so vnseasonable, both for his owne Ends and the Publique businesse he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke; The Commons in Parliament, desirous to ayd their King, granted a Subsidie on this condition, that being leauied, it should be committed to certaine <hi>Earles</hi> and <note place="margin">A Subsidie granted in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Barons</hi> to see it yssued, according to the occasions of the Kingdom. But this Subsidie was of a new nature neither in any of those kindes propounded. Euery person, man &amp; woman within the Kingdome, aboue the Age of 14. yeeres, were to pay 4. pence, (those who liued by Almes onely excepted. The Clergie likewise grants 12. pence of euery Parson Beneficed; and of all other Religious persons 4. pence of the head, A mighty and vnknown Ayd, such as neuer was granted to any King of <hi>England</hi> before, and became a Precedent for the next Reigne: wherein it caused the first and grearest popular Insurrection, that euer was seene in this Kingdom: So tender a thing is it to taxe the people by the Poule.</p>
               <p>And now here-upon the Parliament ended: but not the Dukes displeasure against the Citie. The Maior and Aldermen are brought before the King to <hi>Shene,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised to submit themselues to the Duke, and craue pardon for their grieuous offences. They protest as before: they could not stay the rage of the multitude, who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those insolencies, beseeching the King not to punish such as were innocent and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7690:117"/>
ignorant of the fact, promising the Duke, they would indeauour by all meanes to bring in the malefactors, and compell them to make satisfaction, to the honor of the Duke, and more, sayde they, wee cannot doe. Whereupon they were dismissed the Court, and shortly after from their places, by the power of the Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> was elected Mayor in steed of <hi>Adam Staple,</hi> and other Aldermen appointed in their places, who were put out.</p>
               <p>The King was desirous to haue reconciled them to his Sonne, but sicknesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now vanquished him, hee is forced to giue ouer the world, as the same did him, before his breath left him. And first his Concubine packing away what shee could snatch, euen to the rings of his fingers, left him: then his other attendants, by her example, seasing on what they could fasten, shift away, and all his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and others forsooke him in his last agony when most hee needed them, leauing his Chamber quite empty: which a poore Priest in the house seeing, by chance as he passed, approaches to the Kings beds side, and finding him yet breathing, cals <note place="margin">The death of King <hi>Edward</hi> and the maner thereof.</note> vpon him to remember his Sauiour, and to aske mercy for his offences, which none before about him would doe, but euery one putting him still in hope of life, though they knew death was vpon him (a misery fatall to Princes and great persons, whom flattery will neuer suffer to know themselues, nor their owne state either in health or sicknesse) made him neglectiue of those spirituall cogitations fit for a dying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. But now stirred vp by the voyce of this Priest, hee shewes all signes of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his last breath expresses the name of <hi>Iesu.</hi> Thus dyed this mighty and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious King, at his Mannor of <hi>Sheene</hi> (now <hi>Richmond</hi>) the 21. day of Iune, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1377. in the 64. yeare of his Age, hauing raigned fifty yeares, foure moneths and odde dayes.</p>
               <p>His Character wee finde best exprest in his actions, yet thus briefly. Hee was a Prince, the soonest a man and the longest that held so, of any wee reade. He was of <note place="margin">His Character</note> Personage comely, of an euen stature, gracefull, respectiuely affable, and well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe: A Prince who loued 1. <hi>Iustice,</hi> 2. <hi>Order,</hi> 3. and his <hi>People,</hi> the Supreme vertues of a Soueraigne. 1. His loue of <hi>Iustice,</hi> was seene by the many Statutes he made <note place="margin">His Iustice.</note> for the due Execution thereof, &amp; the most Straight-binding Oath, he ordayned to be ministred vnto his Iudges &amp; Iusticiars: the punishment inflicted on them for corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Offices, causing some to be thrust out, and others grieuously fined, as Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Skipwith Anno Reg.</hi> 39. He bettered also that forme of publique Iustice which his Grand-father first began (and which remaines to this day) making also excellent lawes for the same, 2. His regard to the obseruation of <hi>Order</hi> amongst his people, witnesse so many Lawes, as were made to restrayne them from <note place="margin">His loue to his people.</note> Excesses in all kindes. 3. His loue to his subiects, was exprest in the often easing of their grieuances, and his willingnesse to giue them all faire satisfaction, as appeares by the continuall granting of the due obseruation of their <hi>Charters</hi> in most of his Parliaments. And when (<hi>Anno Reg.</hi> 14.) they were iealous, vpon his assuming the title of the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> least <hi>England</hi> should thereby come to be vnder the Subiection of that Crowne, as being the greater, he to cleare them of that doubt, passed a Statute, in the firmest manner could be deuised, that this Kingdome should <note place="margin">His Proui dence.</note> remayne intyre as before, without any violation of the rights it had.</p>
               <p>Prouident hee was in all his actions, neuer vndertaking any thing before hee had first furnished himselfe with meanes to performe it. And therein his subiects allowed him more with lesse adoe, then euer any of his Predecessors had: and he as fairely is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued what hee receiued from them, hauing none other priuate vent of profusion, then his enterprises for aduancing the State, &amp; honour of the Kingdom. True it is that most attent and carefull hee was to get monies, but yet it was without the Sackage of any man, such as his Grand-father made vpon the Officers of <hi>Iustice,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>For his gifts wee finde them not such as either hurt his owne fame and reputation, or any way distasted the State. To be short, hee was a Prince who knew his worke, and did it: and therefore was hee better obeyed, better respected and serued then any of his Predecessors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:7690:117"/>His <hi>Workes of Pietie</hi> were great and many, as the founding of <hi>East-minster,</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay <note place="margin">His workes of Pietie.</note> (of the <hi>Cisteaux</hi> Order) neere the Towre. An Abbey for Nunnes at <hi>Detford.</hi> The <hi>Kings Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> for poore <hi>Schollers.</hi> An Hospitall for the poore at <hi>Calais.</hi> The building of Saint <hi>Stephans</hi> Chappell at <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the endowment of 300. pound, <hi>per ann.</hi> to that Church. His augmenting the Chappell at <hi>Winsor,</hi> and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions there for Church-men, and 24. poore <hi>Knights,</hi> &amp;c. These were his publique <note place="margin">His Buildings.</note> Workes, the best Monuments and most lasting to glorifie the memorie of Princes. Besides these, his priuate buildings are great and many; as the Castle of <hi>Winsor,</hi> which he re-edified and enlarged. The Castle of <hi>Quinborow,</hi> Fortifications at <hi>Calais</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
               <p>His magnificence was shewed in his Tryumphes and Feasts, which were sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <note place="margin">His Magnif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> celebrated, with all due Rites and Ceremonies, the preseruers of Reuerence and Maiestie. To conclude, hee was a Prince, whose nature agreed with his Office; as onely made for it. Those defaillances wee finde in him at last, wee must not attribute to him but his age, wherein we neuer yet saw Prince happie. When their vigor fayles them (which is commonly about 60.) their Fortune doth. Whilest this Prince held together he was indissolueble, and as he was then, we take his Figure.</p>
               <p>Fortunate he was also in his Wife, a Ladie of excellent vertue, who though shee <note place="margin">His Wife, and yssue.</note> brought him little or none Estate, she brought him much content, some benefit by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, &amp; a faire Yssue. She drew euenly with him in al the courses of <hi>Honor</hi> that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to her side, &amp; seems a peece so iust cut for him, as answer'd him rightly in euery ioynt. Gracious &amp; louing she euer shewed her-selfe to this Nation, &amp; did many works of Pietie, amongst which <hi>Queenes Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> remaines especially, a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Name, and Renowne. And it is worthy the Marke, that this <hi>King</hi> and his Grand-father <hi>Edward</hi> the first, the best of our Kings had the two best Wiues. Which shewes that <hi>worthines</hi> is such an <hi>Elixar</hi> as by contaction (if there be any disposition of goodnesse in the Metall, it will render it of the same Propertie: So that these <hi>Queenes</hi> could be no otherwise then they were hauing so execellent Husbands.</p>
               <p>She bare vnto him 7. Sonnes, whereof 5. liued to haue Yssue; <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Edmond</hi> Earle of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> after Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Wood-stock,</hi> which became Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Foure Daughters (of fiue she bare) liued to be marryed. <hi>Isabel</hi> the eldest, to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelxam</hi> Lord of <hi>Coucy,</hi> Earle of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and <hi>Bedford.

Margaret,</hi> to <hi>Iohn Hastings,</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and shee also dyed without Yssue.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we seene the end of this great <hi>King:</hi> who, how he came to the Crowne, we know, and now how he left it we see: in both are considerations of importance. His stepping ouer his Fathers head to come to his throne, though it were not his fault, yet had it a punishment, and that in a most high kinde: For, hauing so plentifull, and so able an Yssue Male, he had not yet a Sonne of his owne to sit on his Seat: but left the same (worse then he found it) to a Childe of eleuen yeeres of age, exposed to the Ambition of Vncles, which ouer weighed him: to a factious and discontented State at home: to broken and distracted inheritances abroad: himselfe hauing seene all his great gettings, purchased with so much expence, trauaile, &amp; bloud-shed, rent cleane from him, and nothing remayning, but onely the poore Towne of <hi>Calais.</hi> To shewe that our Bounds are prescribed vs, and a Pillar set by him who beares vp the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, which we are not to transpasse.</p>
